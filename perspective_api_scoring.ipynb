       "\" Bill O'Reilly here.  It is Wednesday, June 19, 2019.  You are listening to the O'Reilly update, and here's what's happening today in America.  President Trump delivers his first 2020 re-election address in Orlando.  Joe Biden pledged to raise taxes should he win the White House.  Congress holds his first hearings on slavery reparations in decades.  The U.S. airline industry making big bucks off your luggage.  New details emerge on the botched assassination plot to kill Boston Red Sox legend David  Ortiz.  Also coming up by message of the day on Mr. Trump's speech, which is our lead story.  The president has booked a thousand of supporters in Orlando, Florida last night officially  kicking off his 2020 re-election campaign.  Some fans even camped out to secure entry to the 20,000-seat Amway Center.  Mr. Trump promising to crowd continued prosperity and attacking his enemy.  No surprise.  More in my message of the day coming up.  Joe Biden promising to raise taxes on the campaign trail this week.  Former Vice President was speaking at the poor People's Forum in Washington when he pledged  to repeal the Trump tax cuts on day one of his new administration.  Critics point out that would mean a $2,000 tax hike on a family of four earnings  $70,000 a year.  Democrats in the House meeting to discuss financial reparations for the descendants of former  slaves.  The hearings take place on June 19, the same day in 1865 when Union troops arrived in Texas  to declare the end of the Civil War.  The American airline industry making big bucks off your luggage.  Department of Transportation says US airline companies have already made more than a billion  dollars in baggage fees so far this year.  Four major airlines have raised fees since December.  American Delta JetBlue and United.  Companies first charged for checked bags in 2008 during the Great Recession.  Two details emerged surrounding the attempt to kill David Ortiz in the Dominican Republic.  A convicted drug trafficker allegedly paid $8,000 for others to carry out the hit against  big happy.  Police believe the motive may be the baseball stars campaign to crack down on crime in  his home country.  That's my message of the day the pros and cons of President Trump's speech last night.  But first, I know you have heard of the AARP.  You might even be a member.  What you might not realize is that AARP has shifted left and has now become a liberal lobbying  group that spends your money lobbying against what you may believe in.  Thankfully, there is a conservative alternative, an organization that believes in the sanctity  of our Constitution and stands up for the values that make America great.  It's called AMac.  For less than $20 a year, an AMac membership gives you members only pricing on car insurance,  roadside assistance, discounts on hotels, travel, cell phone plans, discount dental plans,  and much more.  Your AMac membership dollars support the ideals that you believe in, like protecting our  borders with immigration reform and fixing social security.  AMac gets its voice from you, the individual member.  So please join more than one million fellow Americans right now at amac.us.  Amac.us.  And yes, I'm a proud member.  So please visit amac.us.  Time now for the O'Reilly Update Message of the Day.  President Trump kicked off his reelection bid by entertaining 20,000 folks in Orlando, Florida.  Last night, he touted America's prosperity economically, but he also developed a new theme.  On now, he's your Democrats more extreme and more depraved than when it comes to border security.  The Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible.  It's the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and frankly, American life.  Our country has, as a whole, nobody sees anything like it.  Now, as I have been saying for weeks, the Democratic Party is being held hostage by radical  left elements.  And Mr. Trump has really not zeroed in on that.  He continues to hammer the Democrats about the border and things like that that he campaigned  on in 2016, but he has not broken into what is happening today.  Listen, if you have a political party that is touting reparations for slavery and no limits  on abortion whatsoever and even socialism replacing capitalism, those are radical agendas.  So President Trump is starting to formulate a new theme.  The theme is that his opposition, whoever it may be, is embracing policies never before  accepted in the United States of America.  He's also getting personal.  If you watch this speech last night, he spent some time on Justice Kavanaugh and what  happened to him in the hearings in the Senate where he was attacked, President Trump saying  without any evidence of wrongdoing.  And his family was torn to pieces.  Now leading that situation were two of President Trump's opponents, Senators, Cory Booker  and Kamala Harris.  Those are campaign issues that can help Donald Trump, as I believe most Americans are not  embracing the radical left.  It is largely a media-driven phenomenon with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren heading  the pack.  Now on the downside, the president continues to obsess about the Mueller report.  It's over, Mr. President.  You want there wasn't any evidence of collusion and the Justice Department said there's  not any evidence that rises to a prosecution of obstruction.  You want to re-litigate it on the campaign trail.  I don't know where that gets you.  The one interesting part about it is that Mr. Trump threatened last night if you listen  closely that there would be some prosecutions by the Justice Department under Attorney General  Barr in what happened while investigators looked into Russian collusion.  Of course, the president also mentioned Hillary Clinton.  And you're not running against her, Mr. President.  You've got 24 Democrats.  You might want to concentrate on.  All in all, President Trump entertained his believers and the campaign will be not boring.  I can promise you that.  For more news and analysis, head on over to BillOReilly.com.  And you can watch The Nosedman News every night and see me beginning at seven Eastern  time.  Back after this.  Millions of Americans have been diagnosed with cancer or a serious illness.  If you are one of them and money is a problem, you're not alone.  It's simple.  If you own a life insurance policy of $100,000 or more, then life guide partners can evaluate  your coverage for free to see if you qualify for cash now when you need it the most.  Be ready to take down this number.  If you own a life insurance policy of $100,000 or more and you are living with a serious  illness, then life guide partners can evaluate your coverage free to see if you qualify  for cash now.  So write this number down.  One eight eight eight guide fifty.  Totally free to call.  Get rid of those insurance premiums.  Stop paying them.  Consider turning that life policy into cash.  The number again one eight eight eight guide fifty.  One eight eight eight four eight four three three five zero.  One eight eight eight guide fifty.  Call now.  Now the O'Reilly update brings you something you might not know.  Earlier this week, controversial Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez directly compared  immigration detention center is along the US Mexican border with Nazi concentration camps,  accusing President Trump of running a series of brutal prisons with quote dehumanizing  conditions.  To fair mind, clear thinking Americans, the Congresswoman's comments are kind of ridiculous.  Administration officials say that the Department of Homeland Security operates more than  650 immigration detention centers across the USA.  Each detainee is formally charged processed given free medical care, food, water, new clothing  and a bet.  Seventy eight percent of those held in detention centers are adult men traveling from central  America illegally to the United States and are under the age of 30.  There are currently 40,000 foreign nationals in ice custody, quitting NBC News, 22 people  have died at immigration detention centers in the past two years, most from pre-existing  medical conditions.  The USA does have a massive problem at the southern border.  Everybody can see that, but there are no concentration camps.  During the 1930s and 40s, Nazi Germany operated 42,000 detention centers and historians  estimate 15 to 20 million people were either murdered or brutalized at these camps.  Prisoners included Hitler's political enemies, communists, Jews, prisoners of war, homosexuals,  other minorities and the mentally disabled.  People were brought to the camps by freight cars, use to transport cattle and other livestock.  They were given little food or water.  The only medical exam was to determine who could be used for labor and who would immediately  be executed.  In some camps like Auschwitz and Poland, the average life expectancy for all prisoners was  a month.  Well, it may be politically expedient for mists of Cacio Cortez to compare immigration  detention centers along our southern border with concentration camps.  It dishonors the memory of those who died in real death camps and those who gave their  lives to liberate millions.  Maybe a mists of Cacio Cortez might do a little reading, killing the SS would give her  the truth.  That is if she cares back in a moment.  It's an uncertain world out there.  You know that.  Disaster can strike at any time.  So you need to be prepared to protect yourself and your family.  One way to do that is with freeze, dried food.  It tastes good.  It's healthy.  It can be stored for 25 years.  That's why I'm happy to tell you about a company I recommend.  WISE foods.  I have experience with them myself.
