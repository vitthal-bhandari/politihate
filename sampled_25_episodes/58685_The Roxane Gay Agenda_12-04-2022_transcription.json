I recently had the opportunity to go to the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum. They gather together some of the most interesting artists, and they take up two or three floors of the Whitney with really interesting art. It's very good this year. In this mix, there are some less than interesting things, but most of the installations are really provocative. There's this really stunning room of kind of words, and they're carved out of metal. I'm not explaining it well. Anyway, I've never seen anything like it. It's absolutely breathtaking, and there are several truly breathtaking pieces. So, if you're in New York, the Whitney Biennial, make sure you get out there to see it. From Luminary, this is the Roxanne Gay Agenda. The Bad Feminist Podcast of your Dreams. I'm Roxanne Gay, your favorite Bad Feminist. On the Roxanne Gay Agenda, I talk about something that's on my mind, and then I talk with someone interesting to find out what's on their mind. On this week's agenda, celebrity nonsense. Uh-uh. As... No! No! As many people know, during this year's Oscars, not much happened. But one of the interesting things that did happen is that Will Smith slapped Chris Rock for making fun of his wife's hair. In the moment, I was shocked. I think I cringed so much that my body folded in on itself. In the aftermath, though, I knew there were going to be days and days of discussion, but I cannot believe that it has been almost an entire week of people talking and talking and talking about something that was, in effect, an isolated incident. This sort of thing doesn't really happen that much. And I don't think that it is a particular harbinger of anything but what it was. And so I've been thinking a lot lately about the kinds of discourse that we turn to when the world is falling apart. And I think that's why we still care about Chris Rock and Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith. It's because we're in the middle of a pandemic that we thought was going to end, but is surging once more. There's a war in Ukraine. There are all kinds of problems here in the United States from homelessness to the lack of universal health care to children going hungry, to falling apart schools, to infrastructure crumbling around us, while the government continues to fund the police and the military at exorbitant and ever-increasing rates. And so yes, once in a while, it's kind of great to just talk about celebrities who ultimately are going to be just fine no matter what happens. There's just not too much at stake, and sometimes I think we all need to have conversations where there is not too much at stake. Something else I like to turn to when the world gets too much is, of course, movies and television. And I am an 80s child. I was born in 1974. Pretty much all of the movies of the 80s were very formative to me. E.T. Star Wars. The Breakfast Club. And there was something just so... They weren't wholesome, but they were interesting, and they weren't demeaning to anyone. And that's why I am really thrilled to talk to someone I've always enjoyed talking to and thinking about Allie Sheedy. She has been part of my viewing life since the 1980s. First, she was on TV shows like Hill Street Blues, and then she got ever-increasing roles like Bad Boys, opposite Sean Penn, and then there were the huge hits, like The Breakfast Club, Short Circuit, St. Elmo's Fire. She later went on to star in some wonderful independent films, like My Favorite Movie, probably Top 5, High Art from 1998. Much more recently, like pretty much everyone else in showbiz, she's working on a streaming show on the serialized comedy Single Drunk Female currently airing on Hulu. In it, she plays the mother of a young alcoholic who has come home to sober up and ends up crashing her mother's life. Allie, welcome to the Roxanne Gay Agenda. How are you today? Thank you. I am good. I am very honored to be here in Roxanne. I was born in 1962. So you're going to slow down on 74? I am going to slow down. I am going to slow down then. Well, my wife was born in 1961, and she often teases me. And I don't feel like, I don't mind getting old, really, but sometimes, especially now, a young person will be like, I was born in 2000, and I just left them. Go away. Get out of my face. Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me. Well, my son was born in 94. Oh. And I know. And he seems, but I keep forgetting he's actually 28. I keep thinking he's much younger than that, but also, I don't know if you have this experience. I feel like there's a decade of missing. Absolutely. Not that I don't remember it, but that I keep thinking I'm actually 49. Oh, yeah. Instead of 59, for some reason. Sometimes I look around and I'm like, where did my 40s go? Well, at the same time, I'm also believing and knowing in my heart that these have been the best years of my life, but like really, where did the time go? Yeah. So I had the opportunity. I was in Amherst, Massachusetts recently, and I had a huge gap of time between my first event and my next event, and they had Hulu on a TV in the room that they put me in for five hours. So I watched single drunk female the first season, which is really great. And that means something because I watch a lot of TV. And what I really loved was that the character you play, Carol Fink, is not your typical maternal role. She has a personality, she has more to her life than just motherhood. So tell us about Carol and what drew you to this role? I loved the writing. Love the characters. And this particular group, it's almost entirely women working on this show. Nice. And there are people I always wanted to work with. And that character, there was only the pilot, so it was only the first couple scenes of Carol, but I felt like, oh my God, there's something in me that I understand this character. So I was really, really happy that they wanted me to play her. And then I had the best time. I've never done a series before. I didn't know how it works. I just didn't know the process that you are filming. The script comes in for, we did the pilot, so then we get to Atlanta and here's the script for the next episode. So we had that and rehearsed a little bit. And then while we were filming it, the script comes in for the next episode while we're still filming. First one, I didn't know that was how it went. And we would do a table read via Zoom because of the pandemic. So we're never in the same room with another actor unless it was actually on set. And as the scripts were coming in, I was beginning to understand more about Carol because they were writing them off of what we were doing. So I was connecting dots that were coming from a writer and then from the writers and then also connecting dots within myself. It's just super interesting. One of the things that intrigued me about the role of Carol is Carol doesn't actually take an active role in Samantha's sobriety. It's kind of Samantha's deal and Carol has her own stuff going on and among those things a new relationship and piecing back her life together after the death of Samantha's father. And so I just loved that part. And I was wondering how you thought about bringing that in that Carol was clearly a loving mother, but she wasn't going to micromanage her daughter's sobriety. So my daughter had her life happening in New York. My daughter played by Sophia Sam and blew her life up. I have been handed a disaster. I just went through this very long illness with my husband who died about two years before the show starts. Sam was absent for all of that. We don't have a lot of backstory in there, but this is stuff that I worked out with the creative people and with Sophia. She was not there. She was drinking in New York. She abandoned me and now all of a sudden I have my house figuring out my life. I'm trying to make friends, which I'm speaking as Carol, which is very difficult. This particular character is quite spiky and very judgmental and people cross lines too quickly with me, but I'm trying to get my setup happening. And then she moves in. I'm suddenly being asked to make this kid, kid. She's almost 30, the center of my life again when she just had vanished. There's a conflict going on the whole time because I don't want her to take up that much space. And at the same time, obviously I had this poll where I'm thinking about her all the time. It's a back and forther, almost resent how much I'm worried about her. Yeah. And that comes through that resentment and yet that love, that wanting to take care, but at the same time also wanting to take care of the Carol wanting to take care of herself, which I think is a tension that many women, many people face as we get older. I know that in a recent Vanity Fair interview, you said that when you hit your 50s, you thought you were really going to miss acting. And I've heard that before from actors, that there's this shelf, especially for women where once the world no longer sees you as fuckable, you kind of fall off a cliff into playing mothers and then grandmothers and then whatever's past that. And so how does it feel to have such a great role in your 50s? I'm so grateful, thrilled, excited, happy beyond belief. I didn't know if a role was going to come along. Everything had slowed way, way, way down. I had figured out other things that I also love to do with my life. And this just came in. And now that you have this role, do you want to keep acting and finding more roles or hopefully more roles finding you? Yes. I hope more roles find me. I hope that they pick up the season for a second season of the show. I hope so too. I hope so too. Right now, I would just love to continue with this character and this group of actors, these people. So hopefully that's what's going to happen. And if it doesn't, then yes, I'm open to something else coming in that maybe that will happen more easily now because I was able to do the show. Now I know that acting is not the entirety of what you do. In fact, you teach, you write, you edit. I'd love to talk about some of this, especially teaching because anytime I've spoken with you about teaching, just you light up, it's clearly a true passion of yours. So you're a professor in the theater department at City College of New York. Yes, but I teach film. I teach film within the theater and speech department. Yes, that I did now. Yes. I'd love to know how you think about teaching and what you love about it because every time I ask someone, it's something different. So I'd love to know what you love about teaching. First of all, I can't help it, but I fall in love with the kids every single term. I like to have an informal way of communication with them because what we're doing in this class, there's something so vulnerable about it. I had to switch it up to teach it online, which is a whole other thing, but basically it's a class that I made up close up class. They can pick any scene they want from any film or television show. I just asked to please look for some good writing. Any character that they have ever wanted to play doesn't have to be close to self or anything like that. And then they memorize it and another kid is off camera for them and we filmed their side of the scene in a close up. So they're in the scene, they have the role, they're on the set. They got it. This is not about auditioning. I got the part, what happens when I walk on a set and I own this role? How do I walk onto a set and feel that I'm grounded? I know what I'm doing. I know how to trust myself. How do we get them to move into that space? And mostly they actually end up teaching themselves because we film the close up and then they watch it back and we talk about it and then they can make whatever adjustments makes sense to them. And then we do take two, talk about it, class comes in and they can do as many takes as they want. I work with one student for an entire hour and 40 minutes each class. So they have all that time to figure out what they're doing and I wait until they're happy with what they see. How did you come up with that idea? And what do you want them to, what do you want them to take from that exercise? I want them to, and this is what I say to them, I want them to understand that this is not rocket science. They are theater majors, most of them. Some of them have other majors, but they're theater kids. They love acting. And they for the most part pretty much know what they're doing. This is a shift over from the difference between the experience of acting and what you do on the stage to what you do on film specifically when that camera is right there. And it's your close up. How do you freely navigate your way through this moment to moment to moment? I want them to, again, walk onto a set. They're all going to get their jobs and feel like they have their stuff together, you know, feel relaxed, feel that they can trust themselves, find their moments and don't feel dependent on a director who knows who the director would be or somebody else coming up and saying, Oh, good job. I want them to understand how they work so that they can do that for themselves. And I came up with the idea. I don't know. I was working with theater kids when back went to college and I had extra time. I went to LaGuardia High School. I got asked to come in and do some workshops with some kids there. And at the end of that year, the associate dean said, we'd love to have you around here. What would you like to work with the kids on? What do you feel like we don't really have in the curriculum? And it just came to me. I said, I'd like to work with them on a working their way through a close up. I love that. Because it's just that there's fun. Yeah, like there's so much intimacy there when you think about close ups and really thinking, like, what am I going to do when it's just me and the camera and a scene partner? Like what choices am I going to make? We grew up here in New York City and in a very literary family, really. Your mother Charlotte Sheedy is a really well known literary agent. In fact, she's actually my wife's agent. Books seem to be a big part of your life as well. Hij. So you published your first book when you were 12 years old. I did. Yes, I did. So you have known greatness for quite some time. And then you published a book of poems. So I was wondering, are you still writing? So the writing that I like to do, I did that essay with you, which was a specific thing. And thank you for editing it because it was just way too all over the place. So I don't want to use, I overuse the word trigger, but that particular thing at that particular time is just a lot. The writing that I love to do is, you know why I'm going to be careful with this. Yes. I can't. I do editing with writers on manuscripts that get sent to Charlotte and sometimes to other people also do some independent editing for publication. So there's submissions, the revisions, the SNAT. The reason that I get careful about it is because most of the writers don't know it's me. When I had brought it up in an interview or a couple of times I thought afterwards such a mistake because for years I've been doing this for 10 years, I don't want that to be the distraction. The point is it's their work. I never wanted any of them to know it was me because nepotism because you're an actress. What are you doing reading my work? Because of a lot of things that makes sense to me. So the anonymity was really freeing. And then with some of the writers after we had worked on several revisions, they actually did find out that it was me. Or once their book had been accepted by a publisher, then I could actually have free conversations with them. It depends on the writer. I'm not the only person doing this with Charlotte. She's got a lot of people. But this kind of deconstruction of a manuscript analyzing, looking at character arc, working on the revisions with putting the different pieces back and forth together, asking questions. You know, why does such and such person does this? I'm not following the through line here. I wouldn't say it's entirely technical. You know what I'm talking about. I do. But it's the putting it together. That's the kind of writing I love to do. Yeah, as a writer and sometimes editor, I love the just before the putting it together. I love the free form, just generation of ideas and thoughts. And I always hope this is going to come out as well as I think it should. And then when it comes to, okay, now how do I order this into something coherent? I do it. And I actually don't mind it. I enjoy it. It doesn't come as easily to me. It's not the part I love as much as the first sort of rush of inspiration. So I love that. You know, it's great to hear someone who's interested in like that part of putting it together and really thinking, how are all these pieces going to work together? Right. And I get to read the most incredible stuff. Yeah. One thing I've learned is that there's no shortage of great writing in the world. And so many writers are just waiting for that combination of hard work and luck to strike them. Yes. I know there's a rhyme or reason to which manuscripts come my way, but I'm not in charge of the rhyme or reason of it. So I get it's a brand new book, right? Get to dive in and it'll be on these incredible disparate topics. I mean, it'll just be, there's one about this and one about that and some are nonfiction and some are fiction. And I over the past 10 years, I have learned so much about people and the world and history just through reading the kind of work that that comes my way. So yes, I absolutely love it. And I'm trying to keep the focus on the writing and the writer. Absolutely. But I know I can talk to you about it because you know what I'm talking about. I do. I do. Yeah. What are the different satisfactions between the work you do with books and acting? One of the early conversations that I actually had with Charlotte was when she had first sort of experimented with sending me something and that the thing that she sent me just, it had entirely to do with them. The structure was off. There is something about having spent my entire life taking apart scripts that lends itself to taking apart and analyzing a manuscript. It's all scenes, story, consistency of character, interesting choices, dialogue that works, dialogue that's quite kind of sort of doesn't a coherent story, an incoherent story. And by the way, I've been in a lot of movies with incoherent stories. It's not that happens. Sometimes you just do what you've got in front of you. But there's this way of having to pull it apart that lends itself to books. It feels like an easy transition for me. I don't know why I love it so much, but it's something I feel like I've been doing since I was a teenager. Speaking of since you were a teenager, unlike a lot of artists, you seem to really embrace your earlier work. And that seems to be a point of connection to your students, many of whom were born in the 90s and of course now later. Yes. What is it like to have had such a long and storied career where you are an 80s icon and you're also still working in that same field today? It's interesting. I do embrace all the different parts of the career, including the ones that are just messy. It doesn't feel to me that it's been as long as it has been. 59, I think it's been what? 40 over 40 years. It feels good. It feels like I got the chance to do this and I fell in love with it early. And then I went through so many ups and downs and struggles. I really needed to develop myself. I needed to grow. Some of that happened in the public eyes. And to get to where I am now at 59, I feel very grounded. I feel very comfortable when I walk on a set. I don't feel at the mercy of someone's opinion when I'm at work. I feel like all of that, all of it, the good end of that, all of it gave me a kind of foundation that I could not possibly have had in 19. Yeah, of course. The foundations that we have at 19 are so fragile and shifting. And the older I get, the more I realize or the more I find really that I'm standing on a more solid ground. And I appreciate it very much. When you see younger actors and knowing sort of the things that you had to deal with coming up through the industry, do you ever have advice for them on how to navigate an industry that is incredibly fickle? Yeah. So this is a lot of what these are the topics that come up in class with a younger actor, for instance, in the series I just did. If they want to ask me a question or talk about it, fine, great. I'm all here for it. I asked a lot of questions when I was younger too. But the most interesting questions are what come up in class. And listen, it's not even the questions you would think, how do you get an agent? How do you do this? How do you do that? Because they've already been asking that. They've already been exploring that. More of it is things like, what do you do about all the equipment that's around that so distracting? All the people that are around. A lot of the conversations I have are about how do you keep yourself safe in the context of a set? It's very specific things. Somebody has to put a radio mic on your body. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about that. That drives me crazy. I hate that. Yeah. Let you know. Yes. When I go in, I want to know what we're filming that scene on which day. Is it going to be hot? Is it going to be cold? I need to be comfortable and where's the radio pack going to go? So those kinds of things you learn by trial and error. I learned by error. But I like to explain to them these kinds of technical things dealing with a hair and makeup department. Yes. That's the wardrobe, the sound, the lights where you're looking with a camera, how to handle direction that comes your way that might feel undermining. It doesn't make sense to you. How do you communicate with a director? What do you do if you're supposed to be in love with an actor and you hate them? I mean, these are the kinds of questions that come up. And as far as the show of business is concerned, you know, there's all this stuff written about how it's changed so much and all of this. I don't know that the people have changed so much. I just think people are more nervous. Things that were said to me in my 20s would not, well, they wouldn't be said to me now anyway, because I'm 59. But I don't think that the kind of situations that came up would come up necessarily for a 20 year old right now on a set. That's interesting because I always wonder, you know, we talk a lot about the ways that the culture is shifting and in some ways for the better. People are becoming more aware of what is and what is not acceptable. Right. I always wonder, is this really trickling over to certain industries that are notoriously problematic? Right. And so it's interesting that you see at least some change, not in the people, but that their tolerance for trouble seems to be less where before they knew they wouldn't get in trouble so they had a really high tolerance for it. Right. And there would just be things that would be said and decisions that would be made without any sort of questioning of oneself. Or why that was happening or should this be happening? There was none of that. There was no self reflection. There was nothing. It was just the way that it was. And now I think there's just more a little bit of like treading and tip towing around and questioning what used to be this automatic assumptions, I guess. Yeah, it's good and bad. I'm just not fooled that people are that different. I just think that the structure has changed enough. There's more anxiety going on than there was before. So somebody might be forced into making a better choice. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? I do. I do very much know what you mean. It's really sad that people have to basically be peer pressured into being decent. Yes. I don't know that people have ever voluntarily done the right thing. I mean, the people who are inclined to do the wrong thing, I don't know that they will ever sort of naturally find the light. I think there just have to be enough cultural and personal consequences for them to decide. Yes. I want to do this terrible thing, but I'm not going to. But I won't. Exactly. I want to say this, but you know what? Better not. Better not. I'm going to have to keep this to myself. Exactly. And a lot of it is based on money. Yes. Yes. You know. If everything you have going on between working with writing, teaching, acting, what do you want for yourself over, say, the next decade? I actually would like to keep doing exactly what I'm doing right now. Oh, I love that. Isn't that nice? It is. I would love to. I would like to keep doing. Yes. I'm doing the things that I love. I want to keep teaching, keep working with writers, and hopefully keep on with the show and have other stuff come along. I mean, you know, to have a show come along like Jean Smart has that show. Oh, yeah. You know what I mean? I do. That would be incredible. You just think, oh, wow, this can happen like that. And also my last question for you as a New Yorker, a lifelong New Yorker, in fact. Yes. What is your favorite thing to do in New York? Walk. Really. Walk in the park, walk in the neighborhood. You know, I love to sort of spy on people. Oh, my goodness. You're just like, look over here. Oh, this is a great city for that. This is a great city. It is so great. As long as you walk quickly in my neighborhood, you can really spy on people. You just don't want to slow down too much. Oh, Ali Shidi, you are, as ever, a delight. Thank you so much for joining me on the Roxanne Gay Agenda. Thank you, Roxanne.
