Proof that the DNC does not care about its supporters And in fact I contend trying to kill all of the presidential candidates in their own party. It's obscene what's happening All this and so much more on today's podcast and tonight on Stu does America We have a an outline of the new Trump policy that I absolutely love I love this really wanted to happen. He's gonna try to push this through We'll get into the details on that if you're on your podcast app click on over search for Stu does America Click subscribe and you get to get all the episodes for free now. Here's the podcast You're listening to the best of the command that program I think I might have it Stu you know Nathan who is our second unit researcher and writer is He is He's home today fever Burning up with fever Burning up with fever the trees burning up or he just has a normal fever Probably burning up. I was with him all day yesterday. I should go home What was that oh my gosh? It was a fake cough is what that was I just did it again. It seemed like halfway between a cough and a hiccup. I was gasping I was I'm gasping I caught reading a big right Sometimes yeah, right then the dyslexia thing with numbers. Oh my gosh. We support you here You should go home. You should stay home really you shouldn't come back Really you should move to another place Seriously, is that your serious recommendation because I'm looking for I'm just looking for the trigger I have just purchased some land in Mongolia and I am willing to will it to you that you just head on over there Suddenly no cases no cases no no government to measure the cases, but no cases in Mongolia How about Syria have you ever been to Syria? Okay total confirmed worldwide cases 114,600 and 38 that's up about 14,500 from yesterday total confirmed deaths up about 200 or 4,000 31 this is really really good news look at that We are still at 4,000 deaths when The what was it SARS came over here not SARS. What was the Swine flu many people here work here got the friggin swine flu I was talking to five different people who got the swine flu with this friggin place really I think they're susceptible to disease You've been hiring people who are susceptible to disease. Oh My gosh, I heard that that one I heard oh my gosh. It's happening. You need to do it a Syria It's I don't think that's what the C totally free of the coronavirus really yeah They say go if you go to a place that has no cases because they're mainly shooting all the people who might get it You won't get it. No you won't go there. I'll be dead all right. We when it came to swine flu we had 10,000 people death dead in America The whole world has 4,000 people that have died Does it seem like maybe? We're panicking a little bit. I mean I agree with the precautions because of the free fear of mutation and the fact that we don't have a Vaccine for it yet, but it's still the unknown. That's what we're fighting against right. It's just it's we this actually Bunch this all this fear is just we don't know how this ends up yet We don't know is the mortality rate really four or five percent no, but we don't know that yet right? It's not confirmed because we don't have all the cases measured yet It's most likely every expert says it's gonna be probably between a half of a percent and 1% Which is still high compared to the flu, but low compared to where we are now Everyone thinks that's where it's gonna end up But it we don't have that locked down yet and until we have it locked down people are gonna be freaked out about okay People are gonna freak out more and more because the numbers are gonna start going through the roof Don't worry about that. It's we're gonna be testing more and you're gonna see more and more people get it around you and You know unless you are I think according to the cdc 56 years plus Or you have any kind of complex, you know health issues then you know then you should probably stay at home Anyway active cases that are considered serious down from 13% to 12% 4% require ICU listen Please if you were at a big gathering Do not go to the hospital to have your child or you checked The people in Texas now what is happening to you, Texas? What is happening to me? Damn, California is here. It was happening to you people are going now into the hospitals here in Texas My kid was at the park last week and had there was a whole bunch of kids and I want them tested You can't get to your kids tested if they don't have any symptoms You can't go in and get tested for symptoms and relax on your kids This hasn't killed a single person under 18 not one outside of China. That's true I think it's under nine in China, but still it's not it does not seem to be targeting It's not I mean targeting Doesn't that seem to be affecting sure alyn did she come up with this? I guess so yeah We now have 33 confirmed cases in the US for more tracking suspected cases I think that includes Texas yesterday. We found out that there was another one that happened in Texas This one right by the studios, which I'm telling you right now Seriously, let me be serious about this. Do you have a trigger where you're like I gotta stay home. I Don't I want to self-isolate I Think fever would be a big one, you know, I've been I've told you I've been sick for you know I think allergy sick, but allergy sick for weeks. You have it. You met with the people at CP hours at CPAC I met with several people Michael Knowles from the Daily Wire. It did a extended interview. I'm an silk I did not see diamond and silk however, I know I only saw silk I don't know I didn't see diamond or silk, but I did see Michael Knowles who did a podcast with Ted Cruz Yeah, who is self-quarantined right now? Yeah, because he interacted with the guy they know has I think Sarah Cole who's our booker here on this show She met with diamond and silk last week. Mm-hmm knows where she is today not here Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's because she was terrifying everybody in the office She has the sniffles and so everyone's running away from her like she's like she is leprosy Allergies are so bad. It's leprosy That is where I that we are not the only ones in this position and this is happening all over the country Yeah, we unfortunately stoned her to death yesterday before somebody could step in and say hey, hey, hey, hey It was just you know allergies guys. Yeah, so you know hey One from time to time exactly we were just taking the Syria approach So we're just by the way if you're a booker on another show They want to work here. We have a sudden opening Rocks not included. All right. So the CDC officially recommends now that those over 60 stay at home. Is this true? Well, I'm saying it on I'm saying it on reading a story from the New York Post Which is a newspaper. Yes, Dr. Nancy and Messinger a senior CD what she said what she said quote Having us household items and groceries. So you'll be prepared to stay home for a period of time. Okay, then that does that say stay home for anyone over 60. I Don't think they're actually saying this so listen this is the give me the exact quote because everything else I have here is not a quote every Every news outlet is saying if you're a 60 or older you need to stay home and they're all reporting it that way This is what their actual warning says at the CDC website 56 you should stay home if you're 56 Oh, you should stock up on supplies that means prepare in case you need to stay home Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Take every day precautions to keep space between yourself and others social distancing When you go out in public keep away from others who are sick limit close contact and wash your hands often Avoid crowds as much as possible. Here comes avoid poorly ventilated space, which this place feels like I'm just closed in square feet and 40 foot ceiling it is Okay, avoid avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel Okay, and here's a live story roof on this thing and and that is the where the ceiling is on this I feel it's claustrophobic the walls are closing in He just turned off his mic. I don't know if you could hear that he turned off his mic. He was coughing. I'm sorry You have it. Oh, I just had some popcorn. Um, so If you're and these are all just for our people who are at higher risk Yeah, so that is the 60 I'm at a higher risk to or really 80 year older All right, and it says that it says during a COVID-19 outbreak in your community comma Stay home as much as possible for them in San Antonio You know what they actually they actually do Define outbreak which is An outbreak is when a large number of people suddenly get sick right China Hello, but that's not in your community. I am a member of the global community Seriously, I'm bound to determine stay home Every place is saying this 60 year older. This is during a COVID-19 outbreak in your community It still doesn't say stay home It says stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed Am I wrong on this? I've seen this everywhere and I have not seen a quote from a CDC person Saying if you're 60 stay home no matter what they're saying if there's an outbreak in your community stay home as much as possible That's something totally different Okay, let me give you this because I don't know if you knew this patients are Confirmed to be shedding the virus via blood mucus Spital and fecal matter now. I don't know about you guys but I Think we should stop sharing the fecal man the fecal matter Really should we stop playing with a fecal matter of other people? I don't know It doesn't specifically say that Spread my fecal matter, okay, I think that's just a worse way of saying wash your hands Is that what that is I would assume I would assume so can we stop using it because nobody's playing with poop except for monkeys now? Maybe babies Maybe a baby is really sick Maybe it is the babies Notice it hasn't killed any babies Maybe it is the babies that develop this as a bioweapon because I have opened the diaper of some of my children when they were younger and that stuff is biological warfare That is I don't you don't even recognize it. It is not what you put into that child that's coming out Could be another sequel to boss, baby Because if you know this right where suits they talk like Alec Baldwin We are planning all sorts of if somebody was gonna do this it would be Alec Baldwin It's fair. It's a fair point and I believe that's in the CDC analysis as well Also the New York Post. Yeah, it's in the New York Post story only We gotta talk to Justin because Justin's a guy who writes this and he's really good and it wasn't until you said that that I'm looking through all of the highlights and I'm like there's nothing in quotes here. Well, this isn't a Justin issue This is a media issue if I look I'd be better than me. There's another quote. I'm not seeing in these articles It's possible, but I've read a bunch of them looking for this particular detail because you know I have relatives who are over 60 and I'm trying to understand what the right Justin and tell him I want him in my office and I'm gonna cough on him today. Okay He'll never forget that he'll never forget that he would never forget that okay also Governor Cuomo Is now saying that the state of New York is making their own hand sanitizer? He said the product is 75% alcohol compared to the name-brand competitor Pirelle, which is made of 70% alcohol So it's great. He says that it's also has a very nice floral bouquet And he said stop the price gouging or we're gonna make it ourselves Because we can make it cheaper and I just want to point out yes slave labor prison labor camps Can make products cheaper Governor Cuomo how very China of you Unbelievable Mine on this freaking CDC thing I can't even listen to what you're saying. Listen to what I'm saying. You never do CNN. Yes. No CNN reports this. Mm-hmm I'm mid a coronavirus outbreak in the United States. They're covering the general situation going on the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging older people and people with severe chronic medical conditions to quote Stay at home as much as possible. How else would you take that right like? If you're if you're older you should stay at home as much as possible, right? No, it's not quarantine now What they leave out of that is during a COVID outbreak in your community comma Stay home as much as possible Well, yeah, if you have an outbreak in your community the rules are different. That's what they're saying Right, I just you say Right you're saying you're saying like if you go to the moon You should wear a spacesuit right is different than just saying you should wear a spacesuit Yeah, you know you and your journalistic rules Just sick in me More in more in just a second including a new study out That is going to boggle your mind that it is just there's no credibility with the press whatsoever You're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program Hello America, we're gonna get into some politics here in just a few minutes We have the latest on the economy and a great idea a Great idea from president Trump Which is why the market is opening up at 923 points. We go to Pat Gray now I've got some more good news for you to do you yeah, law enforcement has a great tool that none of us have ever heard about But they're using it and really capturing people like crazy. Oh, yeah It's it's it wasn't as fun as you might think for a guy named Zachary McCoy who is just riding his bike Which he does all the time and then he got he got kind of caught up He was one of the dolphins snapped up in this tune in it My goodness well, hey if we have to if a guilty guy has to go to jail once in a while You're gonna have to kill a few dolphins. Yeah to get some good tuna Right if you're gonna have to if you're gonna have to have that innocent person Yeah, the electric chair once in a while. Yes, that's what our justice system is based on I think you have to queue a few completely innocent people and they have to be the ultimate price. That's okay That's okay. It's all to be occasionally. It's always everybody else is safe. Yeah, it's okay. There is a yes Yeah, it's either that's what our system is based on or the exact opposite. I can't remember anymore, right? I'm pretty sure it's we what we want to do is trade our freedom for That way you'll have both. Yeah, right? I think that's what That's what he said you'll be dead and you won't care. Yeah, and you just won't care about freedom That's why I love it when people say I don't care if they're looking at me Looking at my information. I do nothing wrong. Yeah, well, you just don't know what you're doing wrong like Zachary Zachary just out riding his bike and as he always does and Then he got this notification from Google's legal investigation support team They they were writing to let him know that local police had demanded information related to his Google account Company said it would release the data unless he went to court and tried to block it. You got seven days. Oh, that's plenty That's a lot of time. I said a bike already. He's good. Just keep writing until it gets to Google. It's right So what's away? Wait, wait, wait, I don't think I need more than seven I need more than seven days to understand what they just said to me that was his problem He didn't understand what was going on But he knew he was in trouble somehow and a hundred percent chance that email goes to your spam folder like you're not you're not catching That was for four or five those days. That's for sure. That's for sure. So he was freaked out He's like I know I didn't do anything wrong but why is Google doing this and so he went to his parents house because he didn't know what to do and They say how old is Zachary 30? Okay, get 30 what you do whenever you have some sort of 12 year old I know I was riding his bike around So that's why I asked because you know When you're 30 and you have something go wrong with Any kind of tech any tech question you go directly to your parents directly Yeah, that's exactly what you did well They took a bunch of money out of their savings account got him a lawyer and that saved his butt because his lawyer figured out that Google had done a geofence warrant. It's a police surveillance tool the cast of virtual dragnet over crime scenes Sweeping up Google location data from all devices from all users in the area of GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi and cell connections from Everyone in the area so like a crime happens at 825 p.m. On the maple Avenue Yeah, they take every one every 15 to 840. Yes, everyone that was even in the area had having no idea What I had anything to do with a crime or not I am trying to understand but problem is So this guy's get this so he's riding around on its on his bike because he's an avid biker and his Watch is Apple watch sends the information I don't know if it's Apple, but they were sending the information to Google about where he was which I'm so he happened to drive by this house that had been burglarized and he did it three times sounds like Vicious killer to me and he yes, and that's what they thought so he was the main suspect For the local authorities and his lawyer. He had to spend thousands of dollars to extract himself Do you know and that is that's another thing? You he has to prove himself innocent that use that phrase like five times in the article His his lawyer said we had to prove his innocence to Google and to the law enforcement This is insane is completely turned American Justice upside down and here's the good thing is a good though. There's more good Yeah, the geofence warrants have increased by 1500% from 2017 to 2018 and then by another 500% from 2018 to 2019 Thank you Confession I have a confession I Went out and I bought I Went out and I bought an I-home. Oh you did yeah, just for not I'm not connecting it to anything except the internet I'm not connecting it to my security or anything and I only had one room in the house But you are connected to the Internet I was connected to the Internet on it Yeah, and I am because I've never had Siri. I don't carry a phone I don't want any of that in my life. I have an iPad is the I-home is that like a An Alexa type of device. Yeah, it's Siri. It's okay. Hey, sir watch this Hey Siri play rock monanoffs third piano concerto all over America So So Siri hey Siri disregard what they just told you I'm fascinated by this person that you just depicted Siri right now and that sounds like dude. I got you covered I knew that one you But and I was just thinking today I would like to have it because it is so They're convenient Convenient it is so easy and I was thinking yep. I know what I got Siri. It is that's how they've taken and I'm telling It'll wear freedom with it. I've got a very every We have they're all over the house with the ones with the screens on them really the one we have everywhere I have a hundred I was like I have a I'm at the point now where I can't say it the word Because three or four like once mm-hmm. Yeah, they all stay all talk to me at the same time I can't get the right what do you talk back to me? What do you say? How do you use Alexa? Matt word so you just say the Alexa the audience. I don't know why you're trying to but yes Alexa Alexa Define pornography that's fine. That's a good one. That'll be good. Everybody's like what don't know my kids are having breakfast What are you doing just saying like they really definition now? You know it when you see it right right am I right? Yes am I right? Or am I right you're right people don't so are you gonna disconnect it? Is that what you're saying? No? That's the problem. I mean if they have you that's the problem think of this Glenn is like the ultimate Yeah, you use like get off Google Catastrophists don't use Google to the stuff. It's the only search engine that works. Don't use it But I bet you use it. You know of course I do of course. Yeah, of course I do It's just good. It's good. It's better. We're not willing to we're not willing to give up our convenience Right. No, and it's and it's not good. It's not good. It's not good I'll be the guy in the prison looking at you going kids. Don't do what I did. Yeah, absolutely Listen don't do it. Yeah, cuz it's it this is frightening they have and when And this is why What's his name Zuckerberg is begging? For regulation he wants regulation What company wants regulation? Think of your own company right now this thing if I could get the federal government to give more regulation with more paperwork and more There noses in stuff We take the world by storm Why would you want that you want that because now you're a partner with the government and you use them to block all of your Competitors because they come to you and say well, what should we do for regulation? Well, I'll tell you what you need to do. Yeah, it's unbelievable how far we've come so fast I remember back in the 2000s in Houston People would call and say they're not even getting the toll tags because they don't want to be monitored or or watched or listened to or Have the government have that information on them And now we invite all that stuff right into our homes and don't even give it a second thought and it listens to everything we're doing Well, they're saying now and the thing of this people in china the reports are From I mean, can you trust them all these reporters committed suicide or you know all of a sudden disappeared But they're They're all saying that the people in china now are freaked out because the coronavirus Things that they put in all the monitoring not going away It's not going away shocking. Yeah, you mean the government took extra power and is not giving it back Oh, did they get an enabling act To make sure not a problem pretty sure there's some history to those and and I'm telling you This is what's going to happen here in america We are the one thing you have to understand about the coronavirus And this is this once you understand this the two things a we're all going to get it We've all had the pandemic flu of 1918 This is going to be with us now probably for the rest of our life And we're going to have to just take vaccines for it when we produce one Uh, so we're all going to get it and most of us are not going to die the vast vast vast vast vast vast Of us are not going to die. Yeah Um, and even if you're elderly you're not going to die It's if you have extra complications Or you are have a weak system then you're going to have a problem with it So that's the first thing the second thing you need to know is we are 50 days behind china China is just getting back to work this week So china is recovering But we're 50 days away. So We are now at where they were 50 days ago We should look up the dates to and see where they were because that was they were still in acceleration and freakout mode Okay It will come down and we're 50 days away So when you what you're going to see in the next few weeks is this rapid acceleration See nobody's taking this seriously did you China took it pretty darn seriously. They were welding people in their houses I mean, I don't know if you didn't take it anymore seriously than they did And they still had this rapid growth of it. I will say that they were Making doctors sign People who were discovering it sign confessions that they were just trying to scare the public Not 50 days away not not not 50 days in but they did not take it very seriously at the very beginning Yeah, that's why they had as many you know, that's why they had what was it in the end 75 million people quarantine or some ridiculous number like that You know, I hope we're not going to get to that Italy now just closed the second half the whole country now closed. It's incredible Israel I got this great story in Israel. I give you this Israel Just said Jeez How would you how much would you love to go to Israel right now when they're quarantining everybody who comes into the country? Yeah, you you go in teen days 14 days you have to sit there How do they do? I mean, it's basically no visitors. Yeah, that's what you're saying. No visitors Yeah, so there I love this story from Israel because it it includes it includes this line here The Israeli health minister dismissed reports in the Israeli media that portrayed the declaration as a concession to the United States Making the quarantine universal so as not to appear to single out a staunch ally of Israel So what they were saying is I think I I don't know if I completely understand this but what I read from this is that The Israeli papers were saying You gotta you got that America said you got to close Down everything so you know You look like you're taking it seriously and you're not just we're not going to pick out You know an ally like you and use you as an example blah blah blah in a negative way. Is that what they're saying? I think so. Okay. I think so Um The allegation was fake news according to the health minister One day before announcing the policy net in yahoo spoke by phone with vice president pence who is leading the trump administration's on coronavirus effort Um on monday the vice president's office did not respond to request a comment about the israeli policy So they're saying that they're going hardcore because they spoke to pence and pence force them to go hardcore The press this is the briar patch the press is in right now Wait a minute is trump taking it too seriously not seriously enough. Which one is it? Is he telling people to Listen to mike pence or listen to his stupid tweets They cannot make it up their mind on how to deal with don with donald trump on this and it's just Agonizing and despicable but the good news is hey, maybe everybody will listen to the press and maybe they'll vote for bernie sanders because hey All free health care all of it The best of the bread back program Hey, it's glen and you're listening to the glenbeck program If you like what you're hearing on this show, make sure you check out pat gray unleashed It's available wherever you download your favorite podcasts All right, we got to get to politics today um in fact we have the uh We have the joe bite because it looks like joe biden is going to be the nominee after today Um, so we'll get to joe biden here in just a second first let me just tell you that Donald trump Now he wouldn't want this to happen. I mean nobody wants this to happen But i'm telling you I love this idea so much that if donald trump were in the room and they said he's just contracted Coronavirus and he's fine, but if anyone gets within six feet of him They could die I love this so much. I might have to french kiss him because I just love I love this idea Yesterday when he was talking about the economy He said there's lots of things we can do. I want to talk to congress one of which is getting rid of the payroll tax But that on a holiday for a while Yes, please mr. President. Yes, please. This is something that ronald reagan talked about But didn't do he said if you really want to upturn the progressive income tax You get rid of the payroll tax And all of a sudden people will go wait a minute How much am I making in my pay where my paycheck now? How much are they taking and he said force them to pay it Every month they can't just take it out of the check no withholdings. You have to pay it He said there would be a revolution mr. Trump, please president trump, please I would campaign or not campaign whatever it takes You need to do this this when you get your paycheck and you have no payroll taxes in it America's view on what a fair tax is is going to completely change Everybody right now. This is the progressives. They always hide things. Everybody now is like, oh, I can't wait I am so excited. I get money back from uh from my taxes Now that means you overpaid They give you this little gift at the end to go see we're a good government We're giving you all this money back because you don't notice every two weeks how much they're raping you So he said one of the tools that we have To get the economy really going and making sure it's in the hands of little people Not just the big banks is to suspend the payroll withholding For a while Please do that. Please six months just do six months six months No one will ever allow it to go back No one will ever go back to that. That's a dry. I don't know if you're right on that That'll be interesting because I I think I don't think they're gonna allow him to do it. I mean, I think the democrats will block it But go for it, man. Go for it Because this is the to me the most evil tax it is that exists in our system And it was designed by fdr specifically so that social security could they could never go after it uh, he wanted to uh, he wanted to cement A giant program that goes to everyone a forced government savings program Theoretically, which of course we all know it's not an actual forced government savings program It's just a another welfare program. Yep, and you keep saying people say well, I point of it I put contributions in there. That's why he called them contributions He wants he didn't call it a tax He called it contributions behind the close or listen to this quote. This is what he told his advisor We put those payroll contributions there as so as to give the contributors a legal moral and political right to collect their pensions And their unemployment benefits with those taxes in there. No damn politician can ever scrap my social security program Those taxes aren't a matter of economics. They're straight politics and quote That it was exactly what he did and To me the worst part about it is and I don't know why democrats don't get on board with this. They should It's a regressive tax Someone who makes 30,000 years pays a higher percentage of their income than someone who makes a million dollars a year That is not the it's not even the it's not even a progressive The reverse of that but remember that is because it was just to cover social security and everybody gets the same payment Right. And that's why should the wealthy man pay more All because now he's got to carry everybody Yeah, and that's the thing I think that a lot of a lot of us miss at times which is The welfare program where evil rich people pay for poor people to have things Is a government a bloated government system. There's millions of problems with it Far worse than that is the universal program that everyone is involved in no matter what You're forced to contribute to your own retirement And then if your bill gates you can still get Benefits from this program and and of course Obviously it gives out to everybody more than they put in On average, it's almost it's more than double what you're putting in So of course the system doesn't make any sense anyway And then it's locked in as this massively popular program because everyone thinks that they're a big part of the system They're contributing to it. It's not what it is. It's just another welfare program Except everyone gets it even if you're rich everyone who is going everyone who is going to a Trump rally everyone who has one of them twitter machines get on it now tweet the president Please mr. President the greatest idea you've ever had 100 percent support on Suspending the payroll tax because of the corona virus you will never Get it back never and we'll have a real conversation about Progressives and their taxes. Please mr. President It's it'll it'll just It'll help the little guy it will It's much better than cutting the rates of the income tax it helps people they all have to pay it from dollar one I love it people who are making 15,000 a year 20,000 years get get them off of that tax It's completely unfair. Yeah, you know what and you know I'm a manual once said oh boy Never let a crisis go to waste. Yes, and never let her this is he's the only president that would actually do this on the Republican side That he would take a crisis like this and say oh Because it will help people it will legitimately help But it will also It will be the biggest move against progressives Since fdr, and I mean you want to go in the history books This is it and kill it for all time kill this awful tax kill it don't even don't just give it a rest Don't put it in prison kill it. Okay. Let's go to a bernie sanders update Bernie Sanders, of course This doesn't seem like very uplifting Yeah, Bernie Sanders comrades an update for you on how he's fairing in the great state of michigan You know and when he was in with michigan with hillary clinton It showed him doing really really well. He won that state now. He's not winning that state is that because You know you could afford a protest vote you didn't want hillary clinton, but you just thought she was gonna win now Now that you think well mernie centers could be the guy who he's like, no, no not him No, he was a protest. Yeah, he was about against hillary to send a message. We don't really want him What's happening in michigan and what's expected to happen today? Well michigan coming into today by the way biden leads by about 80 delegates, which isn't an insurmountable a margin however, the calendar looks really good for joe biden the big brown last stand today politically not Other way Check it off those jade sex and i'm off the pages of that calendar goes another one there The polling has been fantastic for biden since really navada it started there it went into south carolina He completely dominated super tuesday in a way that nobody For saw i mean even biden's campaign couldn't have possibly imagined they did as well as they wound up doing on super tuesday and so in michigan which was supposed to be a really strong bernie state he wanted against hillary last time He is now projected to lose pretty badly there and if that does happen i think this is over because i think this is bernie's firewall This is his south carolina. He's supposed to be able to do well in in places where labor unions have always dominated where you know socialism has always kind of been a thing Up north it's been good He's he doesn't perform well in the south up north he's supposed to perform well Yeah, this is supposed to be one of his big states correct and he's now predicted to lose it 5941 is the prediction 538 they're they're saying though what's remarkable is they say a 99 percent chance that Joe Biden wins now you might say well i went in and i remember hillary clinton had a 99 percent chance Well first of all she never did from 538. I believe they had had him had had trump at a 30 percent chance something like that 30 percent chance to win And uh he wound up obviously winning but a 99 percent chance pretty rare that something like that would happen This is the best of the glenbeck program Let me just give you an update on this uh it looks like There is more problems for joe biden and f the fbi just rated a health care business connected device presidents younger the vice president's younger brother and former business partners and they Their legal complaint saying that they um these business partners and vice president biden's brother was transferring illegally funds um the report was filed january 30th fbi raid of health care business um and uh and it's it's going to be a problem for the vice president the fbi rated a health care business linked to joe biden's brother in late january seizing boxes of documents the raid of an americor health hospital represented a deepening of the legal morass surrounding james biden's recent venture into health care investing at a time when the questions about his business dealings of joe biden's relatives and their alleged connection to the former vice president's public service continued to dog his campaign In the week since the raid two small medical firms that did business with james biden have claimed in civil court proceedings To have obtained evidence that he have he may have fraudulently transferred funds from america's outside of the ordinary course of business Oh really? And it looks like james biden had half a million dollars transferred to him from the firm as a personal loan that has not yet been repaid This vice president is such a dog This is just this is a dog of a candidate and people are so busy avoiding uh bernie sanders now They just they just don't want him to win and they will take anything or anybody at this point the blaze radio network On demand"
