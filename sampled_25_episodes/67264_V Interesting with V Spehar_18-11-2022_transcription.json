Yeah, we're talking about it all. The dough is out now wherever you get your podcast. Lemonade. Don't ever say I don't take you anywhere friends because this week I'm sitting down with the female Indiana Jones and she is taking us on a journey. Alison Teal is an adventurer, author and filmmaker whose goal is to bring out the kid and everyone by showing them what the world has to offer. I'm talking about exploring the most extreme regions and opening your eyes to a multitude of customs and traditions around the globe. Alison, thanks so much for being here. Well, hello from Home Sweet Treehouse over here in the islands. I wish you were here in person. I was thinking about that. Like we should have had an actual board meeting. I think we will. I wish I was there too. I know the folks at home listening can't see, but Alison literally lives in a treehouse in Hawaii, like the most magical person alive. Your life has been a wild quest and you've said that it all started with your parents. Can you talk a little bit about your parents? My wild parental units. Yes, they are pretty coconuts. I was literally born into a life of adventure and at about two months old they they whisked me away up the highest peak in southern Peru and I think I turned blue at the top and then passed out and then I they got me down the other side and then I came to giggling and I think that really foreshadowed my love for adventure and the unknown and since then we've just lived in intense at the base of Mount Everest and on camels going across the Rajasthan desert and dug out canoes going down the Amazon and my mom finally put her foot down and was like, I need a home of course so they built like an off the Grand Treehouse here on the beach, which has become our adventure headquarters base camp so to say. So we have kind of a home base, but they really wanted to instill in me a sense of experiential education and literally offering me the world but let me tell you it was not glamorous. I mean can you imagine living your entire life in a like six foot by six foot tent with your parents and living off of you know whatever we could pick or catch or what you know they had two coconuts in their pocket in a dream and that was just kind of what we would we would go upon and there are manifesters and creators and then I kind of took up the torch of adventure and have have really wanted to share like the mystery and the intrigue and all these cultures that I grew up in through my Allison's adventures films and books and I really think you know it's not just for kids but like the kid and explore and everyone because I that's what I want to excite is that inner like child that just wants to adventure and learn and has no judgment or or limits right like you'll just want to climb a tree when you're little and and so that's that's what I like to dive into. A lot of folks during the pandemic were like you know what why am I tethering myself to this suburban house to a school district and they were like redoing schoolies and traveling the nation and kind of like doing what you have called world school and giving their kids a more immersive adventure experience. Can you tell us a little bit about like what that was like for you growing up? Yeah of course it was bananas but you know I didn't know any different and so my parents were their professional explorers if that's a quote job but usually it was my dad's photography that would bring us to places so for companies like Patagonia or National Geographic or Tev or Eagle Creek or all the different you know adventure explore companies but we would have film you know so we'd go for six months and not know what we actually shot and if it was going to be a cover shot for a company and at the same time my dad's like this wild bohemian adventure man with a camera you know and then my mom's this like very spiritual yoga teacher and so it was always this balance between like are we going to live in an ashram in India to get to satisfy my mom's need to want to learn yoga like we literally lived with Patabi Joyce who is like one of the masters and creators of you know or our creators but you know me yoga masters of our time and then the combination of you know we got to climb up to ever space camp to get this shot of this tent in this environment and this gear so it was always a combination of accomplishing the quest that we were out to do and then my schooling kind of became the world was my classroom and the people that I met along the way became my teachers right so if you want to learn about India instead of opening a textbook I would walk out my back door and suddenly learn that there's a day where they die all the cows a crazy yellow color and this is what festival it's for and you know and this is an elephant and this is how you wash an elephant and they you know this is this is conservation and I think that was the biggest thing that I started to learn over the years is that nature provides us with our life right if we didn't fish sometimes we didn't eat if we didn't grow potatoes in the high-endies of Peru we wouldn't eat the next year and when the crops were harvested and so what I started to learn is that if we protect that which offers us life then we will survive and getting this at an early age and then watching what's been happening to our world with like plastic pollution and and culture is disappearing um that's where kind of my world schooling took a turn of I can use everything I've learned to kind of better the planet and not just have had this education but actually feel a responsibility now to to go back and do that so little secret I supposedly from the outside seem like I had this dream life right like I'm frolicking the world with my parents I get to go at all these cultures and my best friends a monkey and you know very door the exploring and um but in my heart and mine my biggest dream was to have homework and go to school and you know like have a slumber party I mean that was what I'd seen on some movies on the airplane um like some Disney movies and such and I was like oh my gosh um so I kept begging and begging I want to go to school I want to go to school so finally we were up in the Himalayas near Mount Everest and um a snowstorm hit it was about the time where they made all those Everest films where everyone was you know it was really intense like people were dying and getting stuck on the mountains and we were trying to help and offer support and you know as a little kid I'm seven I just want to go to school and have friends and I got to I got to join the Sherpa children at four in the morning get up tie ropes on our shoes pack you know hot Momo cakes pack firewood and they would climb every morning over a 17,000 foot pass to get to school and I was so excited and I did it with them and I went to school with the base amount at rest and it was the first time I'd been in a in a school room and that actually ended up becoming the story that I used for like my thesis film when I went to film school it's called Rita but um yeah that was the kind of experiences and I was like wow this is what kids do when they go to school um but yeah not not your average uh get up and go to school so anybody who's complaining about having to get up and go to school that's what I was gonna say and you recently came out with a new book for kids and families and a lot of those chapters compared with like free films they can watch um and resources for the folks who are still homeschooling what can people kind of expect from that that's different from your traditional homeschool material well one of the chapters actually is on joining Rita the the young Sherpa goal and going to school with her and and uh you know my whole thought is that education should be fun and exciting and I don't think there's any reason that school and all of this has to be from my perspective I just believe an exciting storytelling and sugarcoating that pill of education to really get kids and families and everybody really excited about it so my book is like picking up you know maybe Indiana Jones diary or door the explorer being able to have a real uh look into seriously a look I mean the pictures are unbelievable they're all like my dad's incredible photos I went I found like this musty old corner like imagine you know Indiana Jones and I'm like open this chest and it's all his slides from like years of our travels and I scanned them all and it was the coolest thing ever and I'm like man and then Ripley's Believe It Or Not came to me and I'm like this is the perfect partner because Believe It Or Not there's a lot of Believe It Or Not and so each chapter is just so fun to dive into whether you're homeschooling or not but I do offer all my films for free because I just think teachers and students and families should be able to learn about the world and dive into that um without having you know a cost involved and it's a lot of work I'm like a one-woman show just doing everything I can do and I edit and do everything by myself right by myself I do all of it I edit produce and direct and so I hope that can also inspire other girls and boys and everybody to you know pursue their dreams of whatever they want to do it doesn't have to be what I'm doing but you know they can do it how did you find TikTok you literally live in a tree house like you grew up at the base of a mountain I can't imagine you had a lot of like Mavis Beacon teachers typing classes or like stuff like that like how did you learn how to interact when did you start interacting with technology as a way to like connect with people you know and when you're in these remote areas well it was so interesting because you know what I've found is a lot of people will say when you go to another culture like don't photograph it's gonna take their soul or don't bring technology or all this well what I learned going up with my parents is my experience is cultures couldn't wait to share their stories whether it was through photos or through filming that I was able to do people actually do want to share and they they want to help preserve their cultures I mean of course you do it in a respectful way but like a homeschooled girl that had never owned a TV I got accepted on on a scholarship to USC film school which was I mean can you imagine like concrete jungle here I am in like the Los Angeles in the wildest place on earth for me I was like okay culture shock so that was pretty crazy I remember like the first time I went to class I came home and I had a big A on my paper and I call my mom I'm like I'm so sorry I just want to tell you in advance and I showed it to her and she was like yeah and I'm like I swear I was not absent I don't know why they mark A on here and she's like no Allison that means you did well I'm like really she's like yeah there's this great exist anyway I mean I'm not a total coconut but you know there were certain things that I had to figure out well sure if you never heard of it yeah 100% so then they had cameras and stuff that you know we'd get to use through school that was kind of my first experience with like technology and getting to understand that and then you know my whole family came together extended and everybody and gifted me for graduation this camera was like one of those old school like now it's probably like with the way technology you know every single year changes I mean I'm not even that old and it already looks like a dinosaur yeah so I set off around the world with my camera and saddled up my camel and just really wanted to document and make all kinds of fun adventures but then what happened along the way as I'm traveling with like my pink surfboard made out of recycled coffee cups and you know I'm all excited I'm in the Indiana Jones in Spielberg and I'm gonna conquer the world and and share amazing stories I couldn't ignore there was just plastic pollution everywhere so that kind of shifted my quest to wanting to to not just solve mysteries but also make waves of change in you know protecting our greatest treasure which is our our planet and our ocean this message is sponsored by ColaGuard

The Defenders is out now wherever you get your podcasts. So Allison after film school you created the storytelling series Allison's Adventures where you share your experiences with millions of people through YouTube and TikTok. Was it always your goal to continue traveling and learning about the world on your own? Yeah I mean I think you know it takes a village so when I say I'm on my own I don't really mean that in a sense that like you know we'll be high in the Andes and I'll be trying to make a film and of course my godfather you know Feliciano is there holding my boom pole and we're they have a ball right learning about it and and so we help each other where I think that's an incredible system. Girls growing up it's like we give you fish you give us potatoes and so I think you know a collaboration is insane like look where we are right now you have a podcast giving me a voice so maybe I have a film to make and I can document a cause or you know my friend found the oldest skeletons in the Americas you know diving in Mexico and I was able to make a film on him and share his discoveries or Dr. Marcus Erickson is uncovering dinosaurs in Wyoming and I got to go out and film that and share you know we're in the middle of another mass extinction and share the dinosaur discoveries in order to highlight what's happening you know during our current extinction and what could happen to our world and our planet just our earth is so fragile and so when I say I'm alone I'm not necessarily alone in it because I love giving initially Allison's adventures was me just filming other people that's what I wanted to share but then I realized that people like to relate with a a character like you know you could just have the news as a voiceover but you're so fun under your desk with your whole eyes like it's the best right that's how people relate with you as you yeah I got to back you up we are in a mass extinction event what are you talking about well I don't want to speak on behalf of scientists because I am not one I am the documentary and the entertainer and the creator but this is literally a 65 million year old triceratops rib bone that I'm holding here I guess nobody can see it it's it's wild right because we're we as a species are creating climate change we're inducing more climate change so things that have happened in our past due to climate change we can see that we can see that by you know looking through time and seeing what happened and now you know we're creating that again and there was mass extinction that happened when the dinosaurs were here and now you know there's there's more mass extinction going on with species at our current point and so what dr. Marcus was trying to really explain is that you know we're not we're not invincible like this is a fragile planet in a fragile ecosystem and the earth will probably be fine but us humans maybe not so much I never set off v to be like I'm not a conservationist environmentalist activist like I grew up in a tree house and if we wanted fertilizer we would compost because that's what we did if we want to turn on the light well our solar panels better be working um you know growing up here in the islands if if we fished and we protected the ocean and it wasn't full of plastic then we could have food to eat so I'm not here as a preacher to be like we're in an extinction and everybody's it's doomsday because that's not what I do I think positivity creates positive change but I can tell you for a fact that for example here in Hawaii we've lost almost 50 percent of our reefs since 2011 from things due to you know temperatures rising from pollutions like toxic sunscreen which was my last film campaign that was instrumental in helping past the law we just outlawed toxic sunscreens here in the islands and hopefully that can be example worldwide for other places to do the same other countries do the same from runoff from pesticides from overfishing and so I think that we have to understand that like for example okay so everybody if you take a breath right now and then we take another breath that second breath was from that big blue thing that's like 50 feet away from me called the ocean and you know science shows that 50 to 70 percent of our oxygen comes from the ocean from you know the teeny little plants that that live in our corals and in our reef systems the reefs are like the rainforest of the sea and so when I started learning all this going beyond just the adventures in the filming and the fun and the we here we are you know I was like oh no this we better you know add this this in because I'm not really ready to move to Mars quite yet it's kind of important that we protect our our ocean here and for me the low hanging fruit was plastic pollution so I dove into helping get you know the bag band in California and cleaning up trash island and the Maldives because I did this crazy show called naked and afraid which is I guess a whole other subject to dive into but when you hang out and talk about naked and afraid well when you hang out naked in an island for a month and you got nothing else to do but watch the currents and the tides and all this stuff is washing ashore from all over the world you start to realize it's not just an issue in one place it's a global issue and we need to do something about it okay so for folks who somehow don't know what naked and afraid is one it's one of my favorite television shows where survivalists live for 21 days or it's 21 days right typically yep completely naked and actually afraid they get to pick like two items to bring with them it's and what did you bring with you on the show well for full disclosure we were first so I don't know what the show has become I don't know you know what what has happened but from my experience it was pretty real and pretty insane and an experiment at that point like it wasn't a show yet and when they called me I said you know way are you out of your mind I want to inspire kids I don't want to be naked on national television and then the more I worked with the producers to help them develop it in a sense you know they kept asking like what would you need I said we're gonna need an item you can't you know even cavemen had a phrase like something something to knife something yeah knife something and so you know my thought was I'm gonna bring my pink surfboard because I thought you know that was clever I was gonna use the fins as a knife and the rope the leash as you know a fire starter rope thing and then when I got there and it was the Maldives during monsoon season they were like are you sure and I'm like nah I think I'll settle for a piece of flint because we're probably gonna need a need some fire but yeah we were we were first and it was very real and very scary and at that point we only got an item I don't know what they're doing now but you were first like you said and you have the highest PSR the personal survival rating of like anyone ever and you won the show you did you did your 21 days but while you were there you were noticing plastic washing ashore you were noticing problems in the ecosystem what was interesting to me is like I'd spend hours weaving baskets and fish nets and all this stuff and I'd throw it out and all I would catch is plastic and I was like oh this is such an example of the world right now of like we aren't gonna survive if we're polluting our planet and so I made a little pact there sitting starving and I think it should be called naked and starving but um starving and naked and thinking okay earth if you got my back I'm gonna help you survive so I went back and realized that we were surviving right next to what people have probably heard of called trash island and it's this just monstrosity of trash in the middle of the ocean there and current trash comes from all over the world and current so what really kind of sometimes bugs me it's when people try to lay blame on like oh it's this country's problem it's that country's problem it's this person I'm like no it's pretty much all of our issues um eight hundred million metric tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year and they swirl in currents they end up in these certain places and then it's estimated and this is crazy I can't I mean this is a legitimate study it was presented in national geographic but they say the um that a human eats an average of a credit card's worth of plastic every week why I love you so much as a friend and why I asked you to be on the show is because you do talk to children and I am very child like in the way that I learned and so I want you to start me at the very beginning with the most basic answer how is the trash getting in the ocean in the first place you would think that that is like generally illegal it's not like how is this happening well I mean if you think about it like I'll give you an example I can't tell you exactly I mean whether it's storms blowing it in or whether it's people littering and it goes in or whether it's you know nine percent of plastic worldwide is recycled so this whole recycling thing is not the answer that's not really what's happening so even landfills you know that are near the ocean for example rivers but you know so it's not just an ocean problem people who live very much inland what you know goes in a river will come down and then there's a lot of countries that don't have even the ability to recycle and so yes there is a lot of countries overseas that are a huge problem because they do throw stuff in the ocean and that's not good either but the biggest message that I can say right now is that recycling is not the answer and yes we can make small steps and like don't buy plastic but we really just need to find a substitute to it and and change change the actual because otherwise you're kind of bailing a bathtub with the tap on like let's do a beach cleanup and then a week later it's back it's not going to make a huge change so then it goes in the ocean then fish eat it we eat the fish or we you know even drink out of plastic water bottles it's pretty gnarly I mean there's lots of studies that are showing cancer you know it's causing cancer and it's pretty devastating actually if you think about it but I try to stay positive because I think we can make change and I think there's an ocean of endless possibilities to to make change and that was one of them was trash island so what what did that like sparking you what did you decide you were going to do oh yeah I mean it's crazy you control with a net off the islands here in Hawaii and catch micro plastics after 10 minutes we had just a whole handful of micro plastics I think anywhere you go in the world and yeah the Maldives is unbelievably beautiful but it just so happens that that's where one of the currents you know bring a lot of trash so I marched back with my my pink bikini and my pink surfboard and went to trash island and nobody'd ever really to my knowledge I don't think anybody had actually captured it I mean maybe a reporter here and there but kind of went where at least we're no surf girl gone before that's for sure and documented it and overnight it just went crazy viral it was kind of the beginning of how these viral trends can really make change and before I had time to like take an app and eat chocolate it was just every news station was was calling and you know how can we help what can we do and I was able to kind of link the right people up to make change and to get it to get it cleaned up and to have a system now in place where it can be you know recycled into items and again I don't think that's the answer so I feel like I haven't totally succeeded yet but at least the trash is is gone and there's a system where it's not building up and being burnt anymore because that's really toxic as well so I think if we my message would really be like I'm just one person from a tree house with a camera that wants to make change I don't have big organizations behind me I don't have millions of dollars you know I don't have I just I see something and I want to help and so I think it's really I hope I can inspire others to kind of want to do the same within whatever they want to do in life. It's me Sam B. Look I've made a lot of choices in my life joining the Daily Show creating full frontal that one summer I got bangs I didn't say there were all good choices my next choice in life is starting this podcast with Lemonade Media it's called choice words and each week I'll be interviewing people I admire about the biggest decisions they've made in their lives we'll get into how that one moment impacted their life today and whether I should get bangs again choice words is out now wherever you get your podcasts. Why hello there it's your old pal Sarah Silverman and I'm back with a brand new season of the Sarah Silverman podcast on my podcast I am talking about everything politics yeah we get into it favorite sandwich shop in LA I know a few spots and I'm gonna tell you about them I'm also going to be talking to you I will be reacting and responding to listener voicemails in real time let me tell you things can get weird and I love every second of it weird is my comfort zone the newest season of the Sarah Silverman podcast is out now wherever you get your podcasts. you you're saying as pink is the new green talk to me about pink oh my gosh that's so funny um I actually oh I get choked up I'm actually super honored because with the trash island thing um I just got to go back with the u.s. state department to the Maldives and come together with all the women and the children and get to get to teach a future generation how to make waves of change I mean and I get teared up because it was the most magical thing I mean they're on their surf boards some of them have never even swam before and they're learning to surf like this is the most liberating moment ever and this is amazing and I just you can check it out I think it's on my youtube it's just really powerful to see the visual of it and and cleaning up trash and having these future generations so badly want to be involved and be able to get represent the u.s. and that process was like just absolutely bananas and yes I was in pink and and I think for me growing up I was a tomboy is what you know the the phrase I know I don't know if that's a correct thing anymore but that I think I would identify with that for sure yeah yeah that was kind of my the way I can say it I was a my you know my dad like let's climb no whatever and I always kind of felt like I just wanted to be a princess and wear tutu and dance around because that was I felt that in my inner child you know that was that was for me something I really wanted to experience yet I was hardcore adventuring so I think as I got older I started to realize that I can still what I call it be like pink and passionate and pretty and pink and be feminine in this and still be hardcore and make change and you know paddle up to active volcanoes on a pink surfboard to watch the earth being born and promote how to you know protect it I can dive for the oldest skeletons I can you know ride horses through camels through crazy you know Petra and Jordan and be Indiana Jones but I can do it in pink and show that other little girls or people that want to be they don't want to be hardcore they want to be who they are like that's to me I was like okay this is who I am and that's kind of where that came from me does that make sense yeah I think that's really powerful actually because I think a lot of folks assume that the gender identity journey is something that only happens for trans folks or queer folks and it's not it's something that happens for everyone to the point that you know even when we're little kids even if we're learning through the societal norms that are impressed upon us and we this idea that girls are pink and boys are blue and boys are muddy and girls are princesses that is something that that is playing on children when they're trying to decide where you're going and when you fit into both of those buckets you want to be a princess who climbs a tree well what examples are there for you is that some is there somebody that that is possible for and you are giving that to people because there's going to be little boys who watch you who want to wear pink and and there's gonna be little girls who do but the thing that was the most powerful for me and oh man I'm just getting choked up all the time is um this little girl wrote to me and she was like you know I'm going through the toughest these are I'm paraphrasing but it was you know she had to have been about seven nine and she's like I my parents are going through divorce I feel like I have nothing to live for I don't want to be here anymore and I found your channel and like I feel like I have ohana and I have family and you guys are you know I mean she didn't use these eloquent awards but like you inspire me and you give me something to live for and I realize there's magic and there's so many things that can be my friend whether it's a tree or a gecko or nature around me and that I can be myself and um and even if I because I'm isolated here right on an island and and I think there's just so much adventure you could have in your own mind in your backyard um adventure really brings people and nature together and and that really kind of like that's the moment where I went oh wow I gotta keep doing this because if I can change you know one little girl's life um and she's that I remember that's what made me thought I think of it and she's like can I love your pink and it just you know I want to I want to be just like you and I was like whoa responsibility um yeah I know how I thought yeah whoo um so that's where I yeah yeah that was such a thing even with the episode of naked and afraid of being the first one I mean even if you're looking at it from a Hollywood lens they chose a former marine who at you know stereotypically everybody would have thought he was gonna be the one who was gonna carry the whole thing and like that spoiler is not how it worked out it you know there's different types of strength and you came in and you were so calm and no matter how rude he was to you you maintained this really strong sense of who you knew who you were you maintained your mental health your connection to the environments around you and of course we're very successful what was that like though like what what lessons led you to the point of being able to in the face of that maintain who you are and and be so successful well you know I think that life I'm really grateful to have your platform because I kind of feel I can be honest here not that I'm not honest in general but I play much of a character I mean I do really live in a tree house but I love to play it really are I do really I mean I am actually here sitting next to my gecko but um I definitely I mean I want kids to I think we have enough serious horrific stuff out there and that's why I love how you bring in goods you're like and we're gonna have good news today and I'm like yes um but to be honest it was not easy growing up like that I mean can you imagine you're in a tribe you look nothing like them and all and of course we'd end up becoming parts of these cultures um but it wasn't always easy even mostly even coming back to my own country like Spanish was my first language and I walked in I'd be like oh and people look at me like what the heck this little this little girl like what is she you know I have blonde pigtails and I'm running around the airport and I felt like I could never really find my tribe pun intended you know within it all and what I learned over the time is it was really hard for me I mean imagine being like I always think of like Lindsay Lohan from Mean Girls um I mean not that exact thing but you know you come from the tribes of Africa as she did and you're trying to fit in to wherever you go and however different they are and it was hard and I cried and cried and there was a lot of just like wanting to be quote normal and then having this like full realization and I think the reason is it is naked and afraid was I think like the pinnacle of my coming of age of like okay if I'm myself I can survive anything and at the end of the day you know here I am on like Oprah and Ellen and Steve Harvey and you know I was like not that that's um not that the fame is what should give you the golden ticket or the reassurance I'm just saying sometimes if you can dig down deep and just know you're not going to be accepted by everyone you're not going to get along with everyone but be you through that then you will succeed um in in what you're doing and I just remember sitting on that beach and I had the worst cramps I think I had my period for like 14 days and I was dying I was like I'm gonna die like this yeah it was really it was horrific um and I remember just sitting there being like this is probably the worst thing that could have ever happened to me and I'm gonna get back and everyone's gonna make fun of me and it's just gonna be the worst experience and I'm gonna be such a loser and such a failure and then to come back and have the outpour of just like amazing I mean I had fresh fish sitting for me what I got here from all of our you know Hawaiian long girl you killed it like you made the hats we taught you when we were yeah I was wearing my coconut hat and like you represented Hawaiian and I was just like whoa this is like that a naked show can real it make me realize when you're literally stripped of everything you figure out who you are and that was like just such a whoa moment and so I would advise you know what didn't Jesus do he had his vision quest like everybody goes in the desert that was kind of like my thing go go somewhere and that's why I encourage adventure and travel and it doesn't have to be a million dollars and you don't have to go to you know Timbok too and you can do something simple to kind of change up your thinking and just get out of your get into nature get out of your head I just think we put so much pressure on ourselves of like the over thereitis or the this person has a better life or that's why I always try to talk about like yeah okay I'm in the Maldives but I made a landfill like I ate sippin pi\u00f1a coladas on the beach you know for all looking and of course I try to mix and and experience things that are awesome within it but I also try to keep I call it like the 99 list where usually if you go if you're having a bad day or people are commenting something or whatever if you look at what's really happening in your life 99 things are actually great it's that one thing that one thing that'll completely take you down and don't that's crazy to be taken down for that one thing and it's not easy to remember that but it's also I think important to keep to keep going and gosh and just like I don't know V but we just I mean how crazy blessed are we to be on this wild little planet that's spilling through this crazy solar eco weird universe out there and like we get this chance at life and we get to make our mark on this planet and be kind to people and spread aloha and I mean I hope I'm remembered for that and I just think everybody's struggling something you don't always see and like do your best to just that's what I've realized is no matter you know what what color we are what politics we are if we don't if we're not kind to our planet and our own bodies like we won't exist there that we won't have a place to live whether it's in our own being or around us we there's it doesn't matter doesn't matter religion what race but if you know if we don't have a planet to live on and a body to call home because I think it goes hand in hand it's not just about protecting you can like I'll get so stressed sometimes protecting the ocean my mom's like um Allison like you know you have to take care of your health today yeah exactly like how about the water within your own system like that's a pretty important planet and I'm like oh yeah um so that's I just think so important is that health and we learn that through the pandemic health health health health and even through naked and afraid like holy taco you know if you don't have your health you don't have nothing and I you just have to really really really take care of that try to eat well try to that's why I do the cooking things with my mom because it's not just about me running around being door the explorer for kids it's like what do we eat what do we do I try to mix that in of like actual things actual takeaways that any age can do um to it's a full body experience 100 percent yeah hi friends I have an exciting announcement you can now show your support for our show with your very own let's

slash survey how do we start to live a life of adventure how do we live a life of adventure yeah well are you thinking of coming out from under your desk are you yes i'm going to come out from under the desk and i'm going to live a life of everyday adventure what are some things we wake up we can say to ourselves today i'm going to build adventure into my day you know what i try to explain this is like kind of my secret sauce because a lot of people will come to me and say well i don't have money or i don't have connections or i don't know how to get a plane ticket or i don't you know there's always i think a million excuses and first of all you don't have to travel overseas you could literally go to a park nearby you could sit by a window you can breathe in fresh air i mean nobody ever says to you like dang it i wish i didn't stand under that waterfall like i wish i didn't go for that walk on the beach like i don't see anybody ever saying ever saying that so there is nature there's got to be nature around you at some point somewhere i just even those little tidbits i think can totally um i can totally feel your soul but what i would also say is talk to people like i know this sounds absolutely insane but i think we are a wild in hawaiya we have the concept of like ohana right and ohana like in the system and i'm not you know speaking for hawaians but i'm just saying the facts of how they used to live here it's like they'd have their ocean property and their mountain property and they'd trade you know the different things they could grow or do and they would communicate with each other so they'd have to go up the mountain and come back to the ocean and that's kind of what i think is like if you meet somebody look i'm meeting you i could come out and visit you you could come out and visit me talk to people even in the light of the grocery store oh my gosh i love your hat wow did you is that frei is that a beret are you from france oh my start making friends because people want to share their cultures and want to share their places and before you know it you might be visiting someone in another culture and i i like to take it a step further where my biggest thing is that you find your cause and you find your adventure so lately everything i've been doing i get to go in um february back with the us state department to pop wanoo guinea because there's so much domestic violence happening there and they want to help inspire through surfing like this pink nose revolution where we're painting the tips of surfboard's pink so the girls can also get to experience surfing um and cleaning up plastics it's like that is happening because i care about inspiring these girls and these women worldwide to be able to surf and to get in the ocean i care about collecting plastic and i think if you find your cause and you get involved in a nonprofit or you get involved in something that's happening in your community before you know it you're going to go to go to get a release turtles um because and it doesn't have to be my cause you know you might be a lawyer and you want to help change environmental laws or you might be a gardener and you can start using you know healthier products on your your lawn or a mom you're a mom and you oh my gosh you have a child in front of you that you're raising to be the future generations and leader there's so much you can instill in them and i i swear you know using a reusable bottle you can save all that money from buying plastic bottles every day like there's ways to do this so i think you find your cause you find your adventure you find your ohana your global worldwide family and you find your adventure and on the flip side adventure will bring you to these people as well and if you can't make a big change in your life you can always make a tiny adjustment like just being conscious of your breath outside looking at a tree just taking that one little second we've all been there where we feel like we can't possibly do one more thing and sometimes you do just have to lay it down and just take a breath outside and see how you can get a little bit of clarity there and you can go on trips like you can go on um i should actually mention this in case anybody wants to like you can go dig up dinosaurs um and this i have no connection with this so i'm not like you're making a percentage or something but i'd love people to go i think if you go to leap leap lab dot org you can join dr marcus erics and you can go dig up dinosaurs in wyoming um if you go on my tiktok there's a link you can come in and experience hawaii um adventure but like try to get out there and adventure um i i would say that's just really important just take a trip somewhere do something anything you can around the block yeah do a little hike go kayaking i always thought those things would be too hard for me they're not they're delightful you'll have a great time allison it was such a pleasure to chat with you
