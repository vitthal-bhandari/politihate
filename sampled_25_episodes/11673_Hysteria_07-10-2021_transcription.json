    "text": " Hello and welcome to Hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico. Alyssa, what's your TikTok completely taken over by couch guy TikTok this week or is that just me? Girl, you know I don't got the TikTok. Oh my god. Okay, so there was a while where Alabama sorority TikTok just suddenly became what everybody was forced to look at. I caught up with that. I was very into Alabama sorority TikTok. Right, so you did it like the- I like lurked. You know like people posted it and I could see like 10 seconds of it. Sure. Okay, so this week there was this, the new thing that inexplicably took over my TikTok was couch guy TikTok and it was a video of a girl surprising her boyfriend at college with a visit and the vibe in the room being very off. Okay, I saw this on your your repos so I didn't see that that was fucked up. There's a lot of controversy around that. They're treating it like this is a pruder film. It is- I don't know how this happened. I need someone to tell me why this won't- I don't care about these people. I'm sorry. I just simply do not care. It's- there was a lot of deconstructing like was he with the girl next to him? Were they surprised to see her show up? Like well I agree and then I was like Alyssa? The morning show was back on focus. Okay, that's- I wish I would have done that instead. This week we are joined by Elliot Stephanopoulos, Kieran Diehl and Aaron Haines to tackle the following questions. How can Instagram make people feel less bad about themselves? What happens when too many people lose faith in institutions? What fuckery is the Supreme Court about to get up to now? And what would happen if your shit-talking group chat was subpoenaed? All this and more right now. Okay, there's a lot of real shit happening all over the world. Like it turns out there's a global network of countries and including some American states that are tax havens for mega wealthy people who are possibly you know cheating the system. There's that, you know, that the Pandora papers came out and everyone was sort of like yep okay. And then it also turns out that in France the priesthood was essentially a pedophile club for decades and the French. The French are like no that's too- look Catholic Church tone down what you're doing so you know it's bad. Those things are going on. Those things are going on in a real way and it is horrible and I wish that that's what people were talking about but instead we're talking about Kiersten Sinema using the bathroom and people being mean to her there. No look as someone with IBS I would never want anyone following me into the bathroom but like girls got bigger problems. Yeah I feel like there's look if we're just talking about we we're not going to go deep into this but if we're talking about cumulative harm that is done. The cumulative harm of going into the bathroom to bother somebody which isn't nice is much dwarfed by the cumulative harm of blocking aid for millions and millions of American families because you are being paid off by a corporation. I'm just going to say like as a utilitarian one of those evils is much much greater than the other evil and yeah and let's let's move on from there. So here's a good thing that happened this week. The Biden administration officially ended a ban on abortion referrals at federally funded clinics so that was a what was known as a gag order that withheld family planning money from places that even mentioned abortion. Alyssa can you go into a little bit more of what like this means and you know what it will mean for people who need these services. Well so one we're so glad about this it is officially referred to as Title 10 and the problem with the fact that these clinics couldn't mention abortion is that if you're a clinic you probably want to give people all their options. So these clinics provide things like wellness exams, life saving cervical and breast cancer screenings, birth control, contraception education and they test for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. So we are really glad that these clinics can now do all the things that they are supposed to do which is give people who go to them all of the health care, reproductive care and information they need to make decisions about their lives. Here's something that always bothered me about things like gag rules and mandatory speeches that doctors have to give to women who are seeking abortions or anybody with you who is seeking an abortion. Isn't that a violation of the doctors free speech to force them to give less than I don't understand this? Yes. Like it's not even just like I mean look you could it's forcing them to omit things it's forcing them to give information that isn't in the patient's best interest that seems like a First Amendment violation to me. It does and you know the other thing too is that most of the Title 10 grants typically go to clinics that are run by state and local health departments in 2017 there were some statistics 21% of patients in the Title 10 program were identified as black or African American and 33 identified 33% identified as Hispanic or Latino this affected transgendered people like I'm glad I'm kind of like why didn't they do it a little sooner but so glad that they did it. Yeah I mean look I'm not the president and I never will be the president but if I were and I were coming in on the heels of a Republican administration rolling back a Title 10 gag rule would be the first thing I did but thank you for doing it. Yes thank you delayed thank you I know you had other things to worry about Biden administration but thank you for doing it regardless. Okay we have a really exciting conversation with an actual teen which is fun so I want to get to that but before we do that I think we have two toes this week we're going to be positive before we get into the super positive so I will do the first one because I know last week you guys you know I was so excited about fat bear week and I rolled the dice I saw Holly going all the way to the end of my bracket she got knocked out in the first round but Aaron your foboy Otis made it to the end he was your bracket you are the champion and may he sleep or hibernate a wonderful winter full of salmon in his belly. I picked Otis because I think Otis is a great name for a fat bear. Oh he's a chonk. I loved his attitude. I loved his I loved his general vibe. I think Holly is great. Holly has been a real like hero and she's a super mom of a bear but Otis gaining all that weight is just really inspiring to me and I just feel I feel I feel validated and vindicated by the fact that my choice for fat bear won. We need to take our wins where we can get them. I know I should have made a bet. I should have like placed a bet and it's whatever. We were just watching the episode of what we do in the shadows yesterday where they go to Atlantic City and I was like gosh I'm glad that neither of us like to gamble but I maybe I should like to gamble. No it's there's other things to do that are better. Okay second toast everyone who listens to this show for more than a couple episodes of this show knows that we really are big fans of love our Burton here. We both have like just deep affection for everything that he's done for literacy among children. He made me love the library. Like he made me love going to the library and get really excited about buying my niece and nephews like books for Christmas every year. Can't wait to buy like cute library books for my my forthcoming child. I'm going to force them to listen to me read to them. Um love our Burton is just a great positive presence in American culture and he was just named the Grand Marshal of the 2022 Rose Bowl parade in Pasadena, California which is a great honor and he totally deserves it and I'm so excited for him. I hope that he continues to be like this sort of like a dolly parton type figure like just beloved across all ideologies in the US. Let me tell you when his vaccine comes out I will be first in line. Oh 100% the Lvar vaccine but he I'm really excited for him. So I'm so excited I'm even wearing a Rose Bowl sweatshirt today. But you didn't know and I didn't even know. You didn't you must have like sensed the vibes. Like you were like it's something with the Rose Bowl in positivity and it's it's amazing. We're so excited. I'm I can't wait to watch the parade. Uh me neither and I'm not going to be watching the game because college football at this point bores me and I encourage people to fight me on that. You've gone big time. I mean look Wisconsin's not having a great year but my husband's Penn State and so maybe one of us will do pretty well. Oh I I just noted him football makes me want to just lie face down on a dirty floor. So um I'm skipping it. I'm skipping paying attention to paying attention to other sports. Um okay let's take a quick break but when we come back we're going to talk about the bad week for Facebook and Instagram. And we're back. Alyssa you know how much I love astrology. I don't love astrology. I only like to use mercury in retrograde as an excuse for fucking stupid shit. Yes but here's the thing I live in California and you absorb astrology. It just goes into your pores. You just have to learn about it otherwise they kick you out of the state. It's like having a car that has really bad emissions. You just aren't allowed in California unless you understand astrology. Okay so it has been a bad mercury retrograde for Facebook. Um that lead you will never see in a business section but I would like to point out that economic forecasting is basically astrology for dudes. Um so we're just going to go with that. Um so no seriously it's been a really bad week for Facebook. Um there was a report from the Wall Street Journal. The revealed internal documents about Facebook sort of having all of these problems that were being either uh downplayed or unaddressed but Facebook was aware of them. Facebook contributes to human trafficking in the Middle East and there's very little being done. About that Facebook has contributed to war and genocide, political misinformation. It has contributed to a right word shift and a more extreme shift in politics globally and Facebook knew about this. So I want to say full disclosure before we get into this story that I write a newsletter that is posted on a Facebook platform. Like Facebook is ubiquitous. It is impossible to get away from um but you know just because I posted a newsletter on a Facebook platform that doesn't mean I can't talk about it when it's in the news. So we're going to talk about it. Um let's talk about it. What was the thing from the report that you found to be the most disturbing Alyssa? Oh I mean there was so much but one of the things I thought was the most repellent was that uh they have been studying. Facebook has been studying the effects of Instagram on teen girls for the last three years and they know shit like the fact that among teens who reported suicidal thoughts six percent traced their desire to kill themselves back to Instagram. Uh do you ever look at social media like Facebook and Instagram to a lesser extent Snapchat and TikTok and think holy fuck did I get lucky that that was not around when I was a kid. I mean the fact that I at least could just like go home and escape school you know or at least just use the fucking ported phone the wall mounted phone to call my friend uh I think definitely was good. This is I can't imagine I can't imagine but that's because I'm old. Yeah I have Facebook came out my junior year of college and we called it the Facebook at the time and you couldn't put like more than one picture up and we took pictures of each other with digital cameras like our phones didn't have cameras in them. We brought email email came out my freshman year of college. Oh wow yeah the poem and you got your acceptance letter via Pony Express. I did I did um so uh this week also another thing that happened for Facebook is the source of these documents to the Wall Street Journal was a former Facebook employee a whistleblower named Francis Hagen who testified before the Senate this week about the effects of Facebook's continued non-addressing of issues that it knows that it's causing. Um and it was it was kind of a blockbuster it was a blockbuster morning of her testifying to things that I think a lot of us kind of had an inkling about. Yeah you know um so you know we can talk there's a lot of things we can talk about here a lot of things to unpack but one of the things like you said Alyssa that we wanted to get into was the effective Instagram on people's minds and the effective Instagram on people's self-esteem and social lives and especially people in groups that are the most vulnerable to influence by Facebook and Instagram so we found a real-life teenager we found one in the wild we found a real-life teenager no we wanted to talk to somebody who has like a personal experience growing up with Facebook and Instagram so today we are joined by Elliot Stephanopoulos she's a freshman at Brown University Elliot welcome thank you for having me well we're glad that you're here so we'll start kind of with basics how old were you when you first signed up for Instagram and do you remember the first thing you saw on Instagram that made you feel bad um I probably first got Instagram like when I was 13 or 14 no honestly maybe younger than that but I remember I was really pissed off because when I got it I had waited so long I think it was 13 that was like the requirement at the time to have an Instagram and my little sister she was 10 at the time and because I got one she got one and I was like that is so unfair um I remember like Instagram at the beginning like my sister and I would post like cupcake recipes it was very fun um I don't really remember the first time it made me feel bad but I always liked Pinterest has always been my favorite form of social media because like my friends don't really follow me and it's about sharing photos but not necessarily your own and just curating them so I always found Pinterest to be a little better in that in that category of like the sharing images part but I definitely think as I've gotten older Instagram has like impacted me negatively more just because I've sort of had the app feel like basically when it came out and I've sort of evolved with it like I've been a teenager through the whole time that like Instagram has really been used and because you're a teenager I mean being a teenager no matter how cool you are is like awkward um do you ever scroll back through things that you posted and think like oh my god oh my god like all the time I am very lucky that my parents and still the fear of God and me about social media and we're like if you post this you're not going to get into college and I was always really scared of that so I never posted anything bad so if I ever get canceled it's not because I mean I'm not gonna get canceled I'm sure of that but famous last words Elliot I'm sorry but knock on one but like I was always very aware of Instagram I was like never post anything that could be like there's even like a beer bottle in the back it's my dad's I'm not gonna post like I was always very aware of that which I was lucky about and when I was younger like now I'm 19 which is a little bit harder for my parents could do in control but when I was younger I was like not allowed to post bikini photos not because my mom didn't want me like being confident in my body but because even if my Instagram was private there's always hackers and child predators and just sort of feeding into that so I was always very aware of that aspect of Instagram so I think I was lucky that I had parents who were like keep it fun and photos of your friends instead of making it something else so that definitely impacted my experience because I think if I hadn't had that I'd probably post a lot more things I would be embarrassed of but the stuff I'm embarrassed of are like photos that I go way back which I've already deleted but they're like me was a new Kylie Jenner lipstick when they just came out like five years ago and I was like which color do you guys like more or another one where I did like goth makeup and I was like I'm gonna scare my dad because I'm doing really dark eyeliner like it was so stupid. Do you so Elliot here's the thing so you're very careful about what you post. Yeah who are you very careful about who you follow like have you curated the people who you follow are there people who you've unfollowed because they made you feel shitty or they tried to tell you something about yourself that you really know that's not true. I wouldn't say curate because there's a big I'm not sure if you guys know about this but there's a big thing with my age group called like ratio so it's like you want to have the same amount of followers as the number of people you follow and I never cared about that because I always wanted to follow people because it's like oh because even if I didn't know them I wanted to follow them so my friends are very like Instagram is just to follow my friends and people I know and I respect that but I'm like I want to see what GG had needs posting so I'm gonna follow her but I can't think of someone I unfollowed because I felt bad but I definitely reality check with a few of these Instagram accounts that just like expose photo shopping because sometimes I'll be like oh my god I literally am doing I've been doing her YouTube workout routine for three weeks what the hell I don't look like her and then you see that like there's a lot there's photo shopping you in Photoshop videos so for my friends and I we can like have fun and appreciate it but no one to reality check it was something this summer my friend and I were feeling really insecure and we looked at that account and we kind of felt better because we were like we don't Photoshop our photos but if we did it would look the same did you when you were in when you were in high school did you ever know anyone who was bullied on Instagram or people who were targeted or harassed I mean pretty much all my friends until they were 18 had private Instagram accounts I mean there's definitely like I get a lot of creepy requests I'm private but I get like creepy DM requests that I have to go through and sometimes my dad has to deal with and I feel like that with my friends it's a lot of like weird old dudes being like five thousand dollars for photos of your butt and you're like have to block them so I wouldn't say directly targeted or like bullied on social media but I would say the main like targeted aspect is by like older men who find young girls on Instagram and your your sister was on it when she was 10 which is like you know and in technically in violation of the user agreement but I thought it would be yeah I mean but nobody but here's I think there's so many people who just like don't the fact that you were 13 when you were on it the first time kind of makes you an outlier like a lot of people are getting on Instagram when they're like under the technical lowest age like my mom has friends who have babies and they have Instagram accounts obviously I don't use it but like they have the handle and it's cute because I get to see my friends babies but it's also like oh my god they have like an existence on the internet even if it's private yeah that is weird and it's sort of like inescapable at this point you know like it doesn't really matter if you try to go totally off grid if you socialize with anybody who is connected on the internet you're going to be on there so a problem specific to Instagram is so-called social comparison which is assessing your value in relation to the attractiveness wealth success of other people do you ever experience that or does the fact that you grew up with Instagram being such a part of your life are you kind of do you have like a savviness about it that I think other people who didn't grow up with it have yeah like I think this is one thing where my mom and I experienced Instagram differently where I mean she also has a public account but she gets like very absorbed in the hate comments and we'll like look at them read them I'm like why do you do this whereas because I've grown up with Instagram and get like creepy guys DMing me and also like with my dad in politics and during Donald Trump like it was very divisive and so I was it was very easy for me to get tagged and stuff and be like delete or like get commented on saying be delete where I feel like it's a little bit harder for my parents to do that because they're not used to getting that criticism so fast so that's a generational gap I've noticed so you think that Instagram is like unhealthy for adults in addition to being like unhealthy for yeah like it sounds like it sounds like that's been your observation I think the problem I've always had with Instagram and this is just me personally more than like body comparison at least it was like the feeling of being excluded and I think that's also selling my parents experience on social media because their friends will post photo at the dinner and they're like oh man why aren't we invited and that's sort of been my whole existence is because I've had it like all my middle school high school and college life is oh someone post from a birthday party you weren't invited and that's sort of where I feel the most like sting from Instagram and I guess when I think about like my youngest memory to being hurt by Instagram it was stuff like that like girls posting at a birthday party that I wasn't invited to and being like oh my god their costumes look so cute or like a Halloween party that you weren't invited to that's where I found it the most damaging and I think maybe just because like I don't know I guess savviness like I'm able to like extract myself from comparing to celebrities where I feel like it's a lot harder with my friends like oh or even not people in front of but oh this girl was in a grade above me at my school so I follow her and I see her post an Instagram I'm like oh my god her friend group is so like I didn't really have a steady friend group in middle school I'm like oh my god she's a friend group and they're so cool I'm so jealous or oh my god they posted such a pre-photo they went to this museum now I want to go to this museum it was a lot I found that more I mean that's a very bland example but I found it a lot more like easier to compare to girls who were similar to me so girls who went to my school and I'm like yeah they're so pretty and they're so cool how do they balance school and they go to all these school concerts so that that is sort of where I'll feel bad or even my own friends I'm like how do they take such good photos yeah it almost feels like a diet like being on Instagram and like okay so you're not invited to x party y party z party by the way I didn't have a friend group in middle school either so whatever solidarity I firmly believe which my parents have said if you if people are mean to you in middle school in high school you're gonna be a stronger person and I make my sister for this because she's always been like miss popular miss social unlike we're different because of this this is like the one reason we're different I mean having a chip on your shoulder and being able to amuse yourself by making jokes about the people around you is like a superpower anyway I wanted to do it so I think like you bring up an important point so Instagram shows you ways in which you're being excluded but it also kind of in a way makes you feel like you're included because you're scrolling you're you're seeing it and so it's like this like aspartame version of actually being there where it's like not providing you any nutrition you're not getting any experience but you think you're getting the experience of being there which is super interesting I definitely feel that with stuff like my whole relationship then stream is very back and forth so I'm like oh my god I get to connect with this people who I wouldn't talk to that much and I'm probably just like in terms of college I'm probably more in contact with people than I would be from my high school because of Instagram and Snapchat and I doubt I would be if it wasn't for that so I'm grateful for that but then at the other hand there's obviously like oh but I'm excluded so everything with Instagram for me goes really back and forth because I feel really excluded but then I love like with Fashion Week when the designers live stream their shows so I can watch it so it's constant I'm caught every issue I have with Instagram there's always a flip side so Elliot I know you know that I get served ads and that my algorithm you know the more I like something the more I see something but the ads I get are creepy as fuck I mean it's like they have invaded my brain oh me too and so I was curious what kind of since we have learned that Facebook and Instagram are tracking our every thoughts and that they are targeting young people which they said they weren't years ago but they are what kind of ads do you see that you're like what the fuck well this is actually crazy so it's just an American advertising which is a class I'm taking and we talk about this all the time and like how all this body image stuff came from like three main images of body image from like the 1920s and we've talked all about like surveillance and targeting which it's crazy how my American advertising class I bring up more than any of my other class like I'm an intro to American politics and intro to 21st century film is easily the class I discussed most because it impacts everything but there's definitely creepy ads where all beyond like the Sephora app and looking at the lipstick and then the next day the lipsticks like being advertised for me and I'm like okay like I is my phone tap like okay I don't shop off Instagram which I think helps in a way because I know my friends who shop off Instagram say their ads are insane but I definitely have experiences where I'll look at a pair of jeans and then two days later there's like a model wearing the pair of jeans on the sponsors page and I'm like well they look good like yeah I see what you're trying to do here yeah it's funny because when I was like doing some research for this episode of this show I was you know kind of looking up stuff and my Instagram ads got more thinspo-y after I was like looking up stuff about body image and Instagram and like what it does to your brain and I was like I didn't want I don't need ads for Kylie Jenner's bad bikinis you know like why are they showing up on my my feet I found it to be very odd okay so just to wrap this up Elliot what would you like to see Facebook do or Instagram do to make it a safer place for people like you or people even younger than you well firstly I think Instagram for kids is not a good idea I just think it's setting up a principle that everyone should be on social media from whatever age which I don't think is true and I think their claim that it will be ad-free is incorrect because Instagram is always with ads even if they're a director indirect because it's like at least for me when I was like middle school elementary school teen vogue was always more exciting than like J14 because it was for older kids and then when I was actually a teenager teen vogue wasn't as exciting vogue was exciting because it was for it was older and mature and so I just think creating Instagram for kids it's just gonna want people to just get be like okay I'll just get an Instagram instead so I think it's just like a weird pat like a weird middle thing that doesn't need to exist for a thousand reasons what I'd like to see them change is I mean I don't know because there's a lot of things that could be changed I'm just not even sure how like if there's even a reverse that can happen with a lot of the things I guess if they could figure out a way when a photo is posted you can they could figure out if it was Photoshopped I'm sure they have that technology and put a banner that says this is Photoshopped this is edited this has a filter because I think then people wouldn't have to search the internet to find the unfiltered on Photoshop versions I think having that disclaimer like they have like this is fake news or this is not true about COVID I think if you're gonna do that about our physical health why not do it about our mental health that's a great idea and if you had it to do over again if you could go back in time and advise your 13 year old self whether or not to get on Instagram would you tell yourself to wait a couple years or no are you you would have still got on Instagram at 13 because when I was younger a lot of my friends also didn't have it so it was much more like Pinterest which I like and it was just about sharing photos and following people I thought were cool and I thought we're posting cool photos so I wouldn't because I think I started Instagram when it was more positive or maybe just felt more positive to me and so I think if I got thrown into it at an older age when it was more intense and focused on body image and beauty and social comparison then it might have been harder because it would have been more like jarring whereas like I had a slower transition into it if you were 13 now would you knowing what you know if you had a sister right now who was 12 or 13 would you think she should get on Instagram no I'd say stick to Pinterest you don't like you don't have to follow any of your friends you can literally just follow like bloggers and you can find really cool photos or outfit inspiration or beauty tutorials I mean I still get gave that advice to my sister even when it wasn't about Instagram I just said you know like it's really fun to look at photos and like plan things out and I just think Pinterest is a better way to do it I probably have like two followers and I follow like a thousand people and it's like they don't have likes it's none of that like you're just sharing photos or organizing photos that you like so my sister has a board of like fall outfits and her and I look at it together or when I was doing my dorm room we had a shared album that was like dorm room ideas so it's collaborative and it has that aspect and it's fun and I just think it's healthier yet again it's also photos of models but if you're you're getting rid of the social comparison I think well Elliot Stephanopoulos thank you so much for joining us from your dorm room I have to have you back again thank you for having me and welcome back we've reached the part of the show where Alyssa and I are joined by two wonderful brilliant women to discuss something that's been on our minds in deeper depth than a news front page so Alyssa what percentage of our texts back and forth do you think our bitchy indictments of people that are supposed to be serving the public interest 70 percent 70 percent and does this do you think that this is like this is completely in one branch of government are we only talking shit about the executive branch oh no girl we're talking governor state legislatures the supreme court everyone's letting us the fuck down right now mayors we're mad at the mayors although Karen Bass is running for mayor of LA which is an exciting development for me um yeah you know I feel like you and I are people who are inclined to really want institutions to work and believe that they should be working but you and I are both kind of falling down a a little bit of a you know a hillside of cynicism lately and I don't like being there I'm I have to be a glass half full kind of gal yeah but it's hard it's hard right now and I we're far from the only ones people are losing faith in institutions left and right and um we that's problem we need to do something about that so um I'm going to bring in our panel to talk about failed institutions failed public trust in institutions and how to fix it first bringing in somebody you know and love she is a writer she is an actor she's a director she's a comedian she just got back from one tour and if you happen to be in Boston on Wednesday October 27th you can check her out at laugh Boston it's Karen deal hi hi guys how are you? Karen how was the tour? So fun oh so fun the union hall show was sold out in DC was amazing in terms of comedy if not in terms of what it's doing politically so that was very very cool and got to meet with some very nice hysteria fans in person so you know always a treat always a treat oh that's but they're so nice they're the nicest they're the nicest people oh that's great um well I'm glad the comedy crowd in DC was good I've been to a few comedy shows in DC and I feel like people there are so starved for laughter that they flock to opportunities to actually like engage with something that makes them happy um that's just my armchair psycho analyzing of of the punditry and transient class in DC um really excited about our guest panelists today she is a journalist whose work centers politics civil rights voting rights and race she was a national writer on race for the Associated Press from 2017 to 2020 she's currently the editor at large for the indispensable news outlet the 19th she has recently written on the way the new deal excluded care workers and how build back better can rectify that and she also has according to her twitter account some important opinions on bacon erin hanes welcome I do have very important opinions on bacon thanks for having me i'm just emerging from my emotional support cabin in upstate new york so uh yeah I am rarely to go and I have many thoughts about many things bacon politics and otherwise let's do this totally totally so erin let's just get into it um the new supreme court term starting this month where do you as somebody who who works in this space where do you see public faith in the supreme court right now and how could the supreme court do further damage to itself well listen I mean um uh support for the supreme court is eroding and you know I just wrote about this for the 19th with the money anniversary of passing a brief better Ginsburg uh what what I heard from people was you know that really the moment that we find ourselves in is a moment that she predicted uh is a moment that frankly a lot of voters were very concerned about it even as there were other voters who were very much working towards this moment right and so um the supreme court that kind of helped usher in a freer and fairer America whether we're talking about voting or whether we're talking about uh you know women's rights whether we're talking about LGBTQ rights uh all of those things uh feel to be under threat by a lot of people in this country right now especially based on some of the court's recent decisions and so looking at kind of what the calendar holds in terms of issues again like voting rights and and um and reproductive rights uh people are are definitely kind of sad eyeing scotus right now and wondering what this is going to mean for their daily lives and are I think much more aware of the role of the supreme court in their daily life and and the reality that elections have consequences and frankly this is this is one of the biggest hmm yeah I saw that only 40 percent of people now approve of the supreme court yeah which is which is down I mean less than majority of the country at this point is is is you know approved of the supreme court uh which is not a good sign for them and they are going on offense you've seen you know justice amy kony Barrett uh justice brier I believe which was just out uh out in public speaking also just as a lido all kind of making public statements um kind of defending uh the court and in a way that that certainly seems unprecedented for that many of them to be kind of out at once uh but I think that that it is a moment that speaks to the climate that that we are in and and the way that the country is feeling uh about uh their role in this democracy right now hmm and so can you give our listeners a sense of like what is on the docket because there's some big stuff coming up and some of it I've seen kind of talked about a lot publicly and some of it has kind of been flying under the radar um what are some big cases that really could fuck with people's day yeah well I mean like I think the main one that a lot certainly a lot of our audience is paying attention to is uh the case that is coming up uh on abortion and this was the case that uh people were anticipating uh coming up in uh this month but uh you know the women's march uh that we just had over the past weekend was in in anticipation of uh that case coming up you know as soon as this week when the court came back in session but now that case uh has been moved to uh december 1st on the calendar and and what uh is an issue there uh is again uh trying to consider a I believe it's a 20 week ban on abortion and you know row right now these statute that has been president for half a century uh you know it's a three it's a three month limit uh you know for for abortions and so uh continuing to challenge that statute obviously we saw what happened with texas and the supreme court kind of side stepping weighing in on that uh you know did not portend well for advocates who are worried about the future of row uh the future of what this would mean for reproductive rights in this country and and whether that's going to kick back to a state level so that is probably the highest profile case uh that is on the calendar uh that that uh people are are keeping an eye on uh but there are certainly other issues uh like i said voting rights it's uh I believe on the docket uh this this calendar uh cycle too but you know the other thing that people are really watching and and the thing that is I think kind of getting increasing attention is justice brier steven brier uh in his early 80s now um especially with what we saw the pressure around greath bader ginsburg during president obama's term to retire her not uh doing that and then what that meant in terms of uh you know uh democrats getting justices on the bench versus president trump um you know mary girl and not being appointed after he was nominated and then republicans being able to nominate except uh you know a few justices in a row and so uh the question of what will happen with justice brier is something that people are also paying attention to uh as this as as the court reconvenes and and what happens at the end of this calendar with with his future so there's a lot going on uh and I feel like uh the thing that I think is really frustrating to a lot of people who are maybe just kind of waking up or just kind of going through civics kindergarten which is what a lot of people did I think after 2016 there's not like a lot of recourse you know like I mean here's the thing like bret kavana or emmy kony baret can go into a confirmation hearing and lie their face off about what they're going to do or what they believe about something like abortion or voting rights or civil rights or lgbtq rights and then do the opposite when they're actually on the bench and what are the consequences people get mad at them online and these are people who are also fairly young right we are talking about decades that they can potentially be serving uh on the bench and so that is why you have this conversation about expanding the court uh we're supposed to get uh you know you know president biden asked for you know kind of a commission to study whether or not that was feasible whether or not that was something that this administration should do uh he is fact short of weighing in on that himself at this point kind of saying that he's deferring to see what this commission is going to come up with but uh certainly there are a lot of democrats now uh you know given the makeup of of the supreme court that it is you know uh you know a conservative majority uh to i mean you know the options are few uh you know for uh you know how to how to change that and how to how to impact that and so i think that that is definitely a to your point like as people are becoming more aware of the consequences and the role of the court uh they are waking up to the reality they don't really have that many options to address things you know after the fact um karen so you are in you know comedy and that's not that's not something that like necessarily requires people to be paying attention to politics on a day-to-day basis or paying attention to the supreme court um have you noticed people in like your circles in comedy and entertainment becoming more frustrated and uh upset about a lack of responsiveness from like government institutions i would say that when i was in texas when that ban happened i was in i was in dallas and so what was what what was wild was like the kind of the contrast between being in dallas like at that particular moment seeing the day go on and liking the explosion on the internet you know because i think that the repper cut like the repercussions of the thing take a moment to take place you know in terms of like watching what's going to happen to folks that are going to be affected by this law and are you around those people at that particular moment so it's interesting to see that it's all whenever there's like a flashpoint like a cultural flashpoint with something that's um going on in politics it's fascinating to see how that resonates to me like both on the internet and how it's a very galvanizing tool for making what are probably changes that have needed to happen for a pretty long time um it for me personally i will say that like if you have two people sitting on the supreme court who um have been like really accused of harassment you know and they got there uh maybe it's broken and maybe it has been broken i the idea that like the idea that people who aren't reflective of what the nation looks like are able to you know kind of do the justice for everyone else is like a very i don't know i think it's been saying i it makes me laugh like i i um if the process in getting the person there isn't isn't one that we can trust then how how is it surprising that you know we can have a court shift in a certain type of way um yeah i mean and the fact that one of the things that i find really frustrating about watching the Texas abortion law go down for example is i don't think anybody on the supreme court is in an age group where they would maybe have to make a decision around a pregnancy yes yes that's it's that and then the other thing is that that it like i had a bunch of friends who are lawyers who went to yayo law and a lot of those people are and and one of the things that really struck me that a buddy of mine said he goes you're not taught to argue what's right you're taught to argue like how you can win like law is like a subjective idea law is a subjective idea smart people can argue anything and then you write it in a certain type of way to make it sound like a thing you know that that is quote unquote true which is why i think so many normal rational people were like what the fuck like how did this how did the Texas thing go through that doesn't make any sense but you can you can argue any point using language and using statutes and i think that's that's a wild and dangerous and interesting thing to remember and it's good that it's good that it's a conversation that we're having now because like do lifetime appointments make sense you know do they doesn't make sense for somebody to be on the court until they're deep into their 80s until they die does that i mean i sound like i sound like a radical i sound like i'm just like i just flew off the plane from a deeply social country here you're like she's like Texas is Texas is sort of a that's a radical faction like the government of Texas is a radical faction compared to the rest of the population of the u.s like greg abbot standing against things that are super popular literally everywhere else like it's it's a radical of faction um alissa i want to ask you this like as people's faith in institutions dwindles as people are like well fuck the supreme court as people are like but i think congress has like a 15 percent approval rating or something like that and they've really held steady which is impressive to have um such a group of people retain such a low approval rating for so long um and you know joe biden you know trying to accomplish his agenda kind of getting stymied uh or slowed down or the political press is making it seem like it should be moving in a way that it's kind of doesn't really always work what are the short and long-term consequences of people losing faith in all of their elected officials and all the people who are supposed to represent them shit i mean it's bad it's how you know i think that and i don't look this is this has been slowly happening for a long time right but donald trump essentially stoked this nobody's on your side nobody's gonna get shit done for you everyone should be disaffected and you know and i hear you but like he got fucking dick done right i mean he didn't do it except he did he did stack the supreme court oh he cut taxes for rich people and made it more of a pain in the ass for self-employed people nobody felt the need to offset back then no one was talking about adding shit to the deficit back then motherfuckers um but i think that right now it's it's like super interesting because i think at a national level people don't trust their politicians at all i think they think that like like i think that tikirans point come on being a politician being a senator a congressman a supreme court justice shouldn't be a retirement strategy right like it should not be like i'm gonna be here until i die i think that for us the problem is that if people don't believe in the system they're not going to participate in the system right and our problem right now is that we need more participation than ever and so you know part of what i see that i think is so hard is like especially if you're a democrat right now right you're like okay when trump and mcconnell and freaking mccarthy fuckface were out there like and they had power they fucking used it they were like we're gonna do everything we want to do and right now i think it's frustrating for democrats because they're like you have the power use it and you know people have real problems in their lives and when they listen to the news and they see their elected officials fucking no we're not going to suspend the filibuster for the debt ceiling and they're like are you kidding me i can barely fucking afford my groceries and so i think that the problem is that they're not using the tools they have to solve the problems that like people don't even care about let alone using the tools they have to solve the problems that people do care about like i think that if you are someone in this country who is struggling to make ends meet you know you don't think that the build back better is some socialist strategy the build back better is literally making america on par with every other fucking industrialized country in the world um so i think that you know right now the biggest problem we face both short term and long term is participation and the thing is that if you look at the the maga the maggas that are still out there they're fucking showing up um and i think that that is because they actually do think that the government is so corrupt that they're like they feel so compelled whereas i feel that that democrats and even some independence are kind of just like i kind of give up right now and i think that's a real problem i mean it seems sort of like i mean i've even made this analogy before but it seems sort of like democrats are standing there with like you know a bag of seeds in a watering can and they're like i need a plant a forest and it's and then there's a bunch of people with like a gas can in a book of matches being like i need to fucking burn it down right and like what's the quick what's the quicker way to make a difference if you're just talking about purely making a difference the person with the gas can and the book of matches is going to be able to make a more quick difference in the life around them than the person who's like i want to cultivate this i want to grow this so it's just it's very frustrating erin i wonder if you could bring a historical perspective here because you've recently wrote about the new deal and alissa just brought up participation and people feel like we need more participation but you know at what point in america's history did we have like the optimal amount of participation like you know how were people excluded in the past and like how do we move forward in a way that is positive and actually includes every american citizen so you know before i get to that i want to just circle back on alissa's point about participation because i think you know at this point you've got a challenge on both sides right i i mean as the former president continues to raise the specter of you know a rigged election and voter fraud and the big lie like yes that kept him from being reelected but the big last still very much on the march in these state houses with voter suppression legislation continuing to be passed but you know there is a psychological effect to voter suppression as well if people think that elections don't matter that is going to affect voter participation and that could i think we saw that even in georgia with the senate runoffs back in january that could impact republican voters as well we figure out what might not matter either why am i even participating in this process if you know the election is just going to be stolen from the if there's a feeling that the election is going to be stolen from the person that i want to win uh you know arizona audit obviously a function of that and to say nothing of the january six insurrection because we don't say much about the january six insurrection anymore but like all of that is the reflection of the erosion of of voter confidence right uh in one party and then on the other uh when you see certainly the black voters that i'm talking to right now disappointed that voting rights has not happened the police reform has not happened now very concerned with what uh of their priorities are going to get through in terms of uh build back better the story that i have uh up right now on the 19th uh is uh you know i talked to 74 year old home care worker who is a second generation domestic worker right her mom was caring for a white family in jim crow era in north carolina uh and working under you know a new deal legislation that excluded her like specifically and purposely excluded women and women of color like her from uh you know from labor protections when the new deal uh was passed right like that impacted generations of domestic workers of farm workers who we know are mostly black and brown right and so now uh you have you know the vauden heirs administration which claims that racial inequality addressing racial inequality is one of the pillars of this administration and yet that is not something that black voters are feeling uh you know in terms of policy priorities right now uh you know they proposed 400 billion dollars specifically for home care workers to try to address some of that systemic wrong that happened during rosaville and the new deal but but it's unclear frankly because you've got congress uh including some you know a couple of democrats uh as we know that are still haggling over what is what this deal is gonna look like what the final price tag is gonna be right uh for for this bill and and whether caregiving uh which we know was was uh proving essential in this pandemic whether caregiving is really gonna remain a priority um you know that is certainly something that a lot of women told me in this in this last election a lot of uh voters of color told me in this last election including uh you know a lot of the domestic workers uh yeah I mean I think those folks right now are kind of also wondering if their vote matters a lot of those people were first-time voters who were wondering what did I just vote for? Yeah it seems sort of like uh like moderates and centrists so-called centrists and moderates are like comfortable with the women and children last agenda like everybody else gets served before the people that need it the most and it and yeah it's including including P.S. uh yeah women half the half the electorate the majority of the the population and at least before the pandemic the majority of the workforce but but are still treated like a special interest group. Yeah and you know I was just seeing something this week Aaron about nurses dropping out of the workforce because they're just burned out and there's no but and like they're dropping out of the workforce care workers are dropping out of the workforce teachers are dropping out of the workforce and you know like you said during the pandemic we saw that without these people society literally falls apart. Correct. Um and so I wonder if maybe the debate is being framed incorrectly because you know we have all these people harping on numbers 2.1 trillion 3.5 trillion 1 trillion whatever how much would it cost to not do this like is there is there anybody working on that? I think that's certainly the case that advocates and activists make to me uh you know about the way that this is being framed and honestly uh you know their frustration is that there is much more focus on the number than what that number would actually pay for the things that the American people would get and and you know that is a function of messaging from the administration also what the political press is choosing to focus on right because those are choices uh you know at the 19th we definitely are interested in what the stakes of this legislation are for the people that voted you know for the folks that are weighing in on this legislation in Congress because that is that you know they don't they don't necessarily they certainly don't understand what a filibuster or reconciling that they don't that that's not their concern their concern is what is in this bill that can potentially benefit me you know we write about things like the child care child care tax credit which people literally are seeing showing up in their bank accounts like they get that they get that that is policy that affects them they don't you know whether or not that was decided by reconciliation or filibuster or whatever like that that is not their focus their focus is what are you doing especially you know in this pandemic that has crippled uh women uh people of color of marginalized folks what are you going to do to address what i'm going through to make my life fundamentally different which is what i voted for um karen i wonder if there's anybody in particular that is in i don't mean to put you on the spot but is there anybody in particular in government who you supported or who you were excited about who you feel like has been particularly disappointing or any issue that you feel like should be addressed or you voted to have it addressed and it's just simply not being addressed the thing with me i will honestly say is that like i i'm maybe the exception on this panel i'll vote i vote every election etc but it's like my expectations of what of what a congress is going to accomplish or our love you know it's like i i think i it's sad i think i am one of those people who's like you should be very galvanized but i do think there's a tremendous amount of money in politics like in politics the fact that no one is going to advocate for campaign finance reform which i think is one of the biggest things that would change who we can get elected because it changes the process by which a person with different intentions might be able to make it to um a form of representation but but this is how do you how do you make that happen right like the best and the worst thing about america is i don't feel like i really watch the needle get pushed very far in either direction because of a system of checks and balances and that is both a massive blessing and a massive curse and obviously like when you see somebody like donald trump in office and you know there were so many egregious things happening at galvanized the public because people were like okay you know it's like after thanksgiving dinner when you've been like eating through the holidays and you're like okay i gotta go i gotta do something about this now i mean this these pants really aren't fitting we got it we got to get out we got to get out there i mean unfortunately like i but i i'm curious when you have so much on your own docket and like a personal like on a personal level it's like how do you create sustained civic engagement in a system that feels very very challenging to like when it feels like you're just running your face into a wall i get it again i mean like sometimes it feels like getting us to get discouraged is part of the aim of a minority party that actually can't win elections if everybody's engaged like discouraging us and like making us feel as though nothing we do matters is like part of their game plan in a way and maybe that's just me wearing a tin foil hat but it really feels like you know like especially with like Mitch McConnell pushing through Brett Kavanaugh's nomination like just it just felt like a thing that they were just doing because they could because they wanted to show us that they could and make us feel like there was nothing we could do to stop them um and that just that just sucked at karen you have a lot of relatives in the uk i wonder if their attitude toward the process over there is as kind of pessimistic trending as most of like a lot of americans attitudes are toward their government they had a lot of i mean they're they have the NHS right like so the NHS is a really interesting one because that really affects people that's how you get your health care so it's a very like one-to-one you know when the NHS doesn't have as much money it takes longer you can feel that the lines are longer for you to get in an appointment you know or it's longer for you to get your surgery um and then the way you approach that i think there was a lot of disillusionment around um Brexit you know the the remain the leave remain and the vote of that and the the devastation of that and remembering that countries i think even in england it's like so much of it is the way you you market to people like what is the issue at hand right like do people are people really aware of the stakes my mom was there when like the first referendum was happening for Brexit and she goes here and this was so confusing the way that this was pitched the statistics it was so confusing so if you didn't have your own information it was very easy to be you know kind of like worried that oh all this money is leaving the country versus all of the good things about like you know being a part of the european union so much of it is the information that we get and it's probably also i mean i know ryan you've talked about this it's like engagement on like the local levels right it's like it's not just about voting in your federal election but it's like the places when your area can change when it's your city council when it's those things and and i guess my the counter to that is all of those things take a tremendous amount of time in a world in which people i think are are strapped and very busy and trying to just keep their heads above water mhm alissa i want to pivot to you on this um do you think that civic engagement is a cost that we're finding to i mean it sounds like karen to take what you're saying further sounds like civic engagement is like one of the things that falls by the wayside when people have to work really really hard and all the time in order to make ends meet so alissa i wonder what your thoughts are on the possibility that civic engagement could be a casualty of people being overworked and under supported well i do i definitely think that's true and i also think though that if people engage and take what precious free time they have and then don't see results that's really part of the problem and so like in a smaller community so up here where i live you know one of the greatest things you guys i legitimately got teary-eyed the entire community got together and raised money to build a library and everybody knew the point of the library it was to help bring Wi-Fi it's broadband is not super accessible up here in some places and so it was it was meant to give older people a place to go and like use computers it was meant to be a community space and the funny thing is is that when they opened it the library was built everyone helped raise money it wasn't done through through taxes or anything like that but it was everyone in the community got together there were trump bumper stickers there were bident bumper stickers there were bernie bumper stickers in the parking lot the day that that library opened and people were so proud that this hit that this is something now that was available to everyone in the area and i think that there are so many issues that actually aren't political that are being politicized just because and for us it's like that's why i do try to make the time to go to things like that because it actually makes me feel better like going to the library fundraiser and then seeing a fucking library made me feel really good you know and and i think that when politicians of all persuasion showed up at the opening it was like see this is something that everybody needed i think part of the problem is that the local stuff i do i'm such a believer in local because i do think you see more you see faster impacts of what you've been working towards right and the stuff that's happening nationally now is like look i'll tell i mean i'm a fucking brat right now i'm like i am anyone who knows me for all the years i worked in government you ask fyfer and favro i was the most annoying establishment institutionalist like these things are a way for a reason and the truth is the point of congress was to bring shit to the floor bring bills to the floor and debate on them like mitch mcconnell just stopped having debate like people you couldn't you couldn't even have debates on things anymore and it just became this this this massive people who got paid for fucking tweeting at each other and so i think that part of our problem at least for me is that we know what the republicans will do to win it's very clear you know i mean in from soup to nuts they won't stop at any cost and so i think that for me it's like i just i want i'm like we got like six more months people before this shit all goes tits up and so like what can we get done to help people and make them feel like i mean i'm talking everything i'm talking about bernie supporters who got on the biden train and work their asses off i'm talking about people who had never voted before who stood in line for eight hours so that they could help make change and if there is just if there is no change it's it's it's easy to see how the two most fringe fractions of the party will become more dominant even though they're the minority because they are so rabid they won't give up and so that's that's what i see is sort of like one of the biggest is is is a big issue for me personally to deal with them therapy all right air out to therapy seriously i mean that's another thing that everybody should have access to but very few people do um erin i would like to close with you do you see a positive path forward for um re-engagement with regular people and the institutions that are supposed to represent them like is there a way that faith in like the supreme court congress the white house how can those things be saved oh wow that's a big question that i uh that is probably above my pay grade but what i what i will say though erin ends on the easy ones she ends on the easy yeah exactly it's like air do you have any you know close us out on a Honda i don't have a Honda uh but what i will say is you know the thing about the comment that we are in now i i think alissa spoke to this a little bit just now i mean it really does feel like we are looking at elections that will be a battle between voter turnout and voter suppression right and so um you know convincing people of the stakes at this point you know with you know unless you're giving people reasons to vote for them you know the argument may be that you know these people don't want you to vote so you know you need to turn out to reject that right like voter suppression can also be a very galvanizing thing like we see that right but like we really shouldn't be in a democracy where voter turnout has to overcome voter suppression right but that is the moment that we now find ourselves and that was really what the 2020 election was largely about um and that should be unsettling for anybody who cares about how democracy is supposed to work in this country you know voter voting rights did not used to be a bipartisan thing and now you know i think we we cannot i mean especially as as a press cannot continue to kind of both sides the conversation around voting voter access election integrity right like we cannot but we cannot both sides that we have to call that out for for what it is but in terms of um you know the the thing you were saying about republicans earlier kind of uh going for broke you know the thing that they also say the thing that uh you know mitch mccollum will say is you know we're doing what our voters wanted this is what our voters wanted president trump for you know the promises that he made he's like i may get on those the things that i told you i was going to do i did that right and so i think that democrats are now um you know kind of looking at the folks that they helped to elect in the midst of a pandemic right in the midst of in the face of voter suppression and they are saying we did our job in november we are we are wanting you to do yours and i think that that um to the extent that that democrats are able to convince their voters that they did do their job but they did deliver on the agenda that they campaigned on you know i think that could contribute to voter enthusiasm but to the extent that that is absent i think that that could be an issue for them headed in the 2022 2024 and beyond well let's hope that we can actually get some deliverable here um i think i think i read that our the maternity our the family leave proposal in build back better would put us on par with sweden in the 1970s so uh hoping we can join the 70s Scandinavia that sounds cool um sweden was right in the 70s oh yeah it's throw it throw it throw it back i mean sweden continues to be abba aside soft counter argument and we didn't swedish fish the 70s love it oh my god swedish fish just in time for halloween what are you doing oh my gosh the chaos the chaos you're coming right now i'm gonna get swedish fish after we're done recording okay we're going to take a quick break when we come back a little sanity corner before we send you on your way and we're back let's get to sanity corner and then we'll send you on your merry way alissa what is keeping you sane this week you guys so you know we're like softly tip towing into holiday season and uh it's like weird it's the time of year when i miss my oma the most uh because she was just like the mistress of holiday things and no one in my family really keeps up with the weird german things that she used to bake so i have gone deep deep into the internet and have used translate apps and found some of the german recipes that she used to make and i would like you and like you guys i like turn the television off i listened to like npr classical music while i do it because that's what she would do well she listened to german radio but i can't get that so uh anyway i would like you to know that downstairs right now is a german plum schwettchke kuhin uh that i made and turned out it smelled just like she made it i've been practicing it like i don't like to practice things if it doesn't turn out right the first time i'm like this recipe's fucked but anyway this was my third one that i made and it just it's like it it's like it just makes me feel so good and so uh next up is apple strudel um most apple strudels are wrong so if you are of austrian descent and you have a recipe for apple strudel that involves some measure of sour cream please DM it to me because i can't find it and i know her recipe had sour cream so anyway thank you for listening oh my god i love that you're having like your own personal october fest you just you just try and try and get never unless you persisted that's exactly right thank you we're here for you but you know it's paying off it's paying off for you the next the next episode should be in leader hosen for sure okay wow i was forced to uh as a baby they were called strumphosies i don't know if that's the real word or just what my oma said but they they don't fit my booty right so we're gonna skip that part here and thanks picture it doesn't count when you fix the mat you can make it also i love the most controversial take of this whole thing is like you're like a lot of the apple strudel recipes out there are wrong whoa it was like apple strudel apple strudel controversy yeah strudel twitter is gonna be really mad they're gonna be they're gonna let me tell you i'm here for it i need their support and i need their guidance I that's why i did it this was my personal my call to action ah has passed passed to Austria um karen what is your sanity corner this week as someone who just got back from a series of live shows it like i would say like i both went to a bunch of live comedy and then i did live comedy and it's being in a room full of people that are fully vaxed that have masks that are being safe that are laughing um is so incredibly healing and warm and i just feel like i was reminded about like that pre pandemic spirit of like the gathering and how you know i think a lot of this episode we were talking about oh people are getting together and like not doing a good job doing something and there's something about like what alissa was saying with a library there's something about putting a group of people and having a shared experience together um in human person that felt um really warm and healing and and just did help to melt my cold stony heart and you know whether you are at the stand or you know in york or whether you're you know going to a local show wherever you live i was like this is uh there's something really um it reminded me why i loved it and i hope that that's something that other people can appreciate that's so great that's like the most positive sanity corner you've ever thank you so much thank you thank you so much thank you thank you so much touching i was that's i am touched you're like oh my god who who are you um erin what is your sanity corner this week well you know that was that was very touching uh but i'm gonna go have to go pumpkin spicy because you know yes we do we do love to be around our our our vax trends and neighbors and family but uh you know i'm actually trying to be around as g people as possible these days i'm keeping this social distancing going and as i mentioned at the top of this i uh just emerged from my emotional support cabin i'm addicted to a frame cabins people so send recommendations by way your airbnb your instagram accounts i'm there because i'm booking this shit non-stop after the foreseeable future don't know when we're gonna get out again but i like the idea of nature so i plan on doing a lot more of that getting hoogey with it um in the woods uh in my a-frame cabin living my best life on instagram not really in the woods um yeah that's that's where i'm at emotional support cabins are are my two things is in the pandemic is that why you just you put you put the idea of nature in quotes i don't think people can see you absolutely absolutely not not not really trying to encounter bears raccoons mosquitoes etc not interested in that um but but like to look out the the big windows like love that love to do that while i'm watching uh my reality tv shows uh and drinking hot cider um spiked got it so it's like a monkey among it not in it among amongst correct i'm nature adjacent yes i'm nature adjacent that's why um absolutely um erin i've got a good a-frame for you in california if you ever make it out here it's like oh i'm there i'm okay i've got a real good link send me the link and i'm booking that a real good one in idle wild california which is continuous my rcp okay amazing you are here you're amazing i was invited i'll send it to you and also because it's california it's like nature but not bugs which is like the main appeal that's like that's my favorite combination nature nobody exactly exactly can't mean like that's why i can't go to florida i mean there's a lot of reasons well i mean correct i was gonna say that's yes sure i'm right i'm right now come on guys come on guys there's all kinds of people live everywhere i am from florida originally so i know i'm talking specifically of the bugs i think there are lovely people in florida they're scary they're yeah but the bugs specifically yes they're they don't need to be that big but they are they don't they don't need to be okay so i don't need to be okay so my sanity quarter this week is something that was kind of eating up the internet on tuesday and i want to get into it uh so there was a story that ran in the new york times about two writers who are now locked in lawsuits with each other oh shit yeah so basically this is this is extreme writer drama and by writer drama i mean it's like slap fighting within writing groups it is using another person's story without really giving it credit is shit talking on the group tech chat it is people who like grab onto their own idea of of saintlyhood and goodness and just cannot let go and when anybody challenges it they re they react very disproportionately so i'm going to give you a very cliff snootsie version of this story if you haven't read it it is really really good so this is a story of a writer named don who decided to give her kidney to uh an anonymous recipient she wanted to be a living donor of a kidney and that's great i think that's a super nice thing for a person to do there are a lot of people who need kidneys but don for don giving the kidney was not enough she needed there to be uh she she made it her whole personality uh she started a facebook group about how she gave a kidney away she wrote all these posts about giving a kidney away to this guy um and she is now a person who like it's her thing um she discovered a couple years after this that uh one of the people in the group uh had written a short story about a woman who had given a kidney to somebody as a living donor and she reached out to this woman and was basically like you didn't say anything about my kidney donation what's going on with that it was very like like she needed it was like white savior type stuff like this woman needed recognition about her kidney this woman she reached out to sonya sonya said oh that's so great that's so interesting that you gave a kidney um i'm really happy for you uh come to realize sonya's short story involved elements that closely resembled things that don the kidney donor lady had posted in this facebook group about how great she was for donating a kidney uh sonya denied that anything was lifted she said that maybe don inspired her don at this point goes and erin i know that you read the story too i think this is a proper characterization don goes apeshit completely completely apeshit i believe that is the technical term yes it's the legal term she went apeshit she tried to ruin sonya's career because she had a hunch that sonya had lifted elements of her story as part of the short story that sonya wrote um over the course of the lawsuit the group chat that sonya was involved in was subpoenaed so what happened was my worst nightmare yeah dude like holy shit so that the group chat was subpoenaed and it turned out that dawn's facebook group about how great she was for donating a kidney was fodder for just a ton of shit talking in this group chat and it turns out that sonya had in fact used elements of dawn's story directly in her short story including one of the one post that was originally lifted almost verbatim and so at the end of the day we have this woman sonya who is by all accounts a gifted writer she's a woman of color also uh sonya get a gifted writer who had had stories published all over the place dawn a less celebrated writer who wanted to be celebrated for her kidney donation going after sonya and trying to ruin her career and her reputation because ultimately dawn didn't think sonya celebrated the fact that dawn gave a kidney enough is that correct erin is that a good summary okay so first of all this is insanity corner you know what you're doing be chaos that ensued on twitter behind like twitter is still lit behind team dawn versus team sonya um my friends my family people i run across like are they inspiration for journalism absolutely like you know like they are so you know on on one level like i could definitely get with sonya kind of drawing inspiration from this facebook group that she was clearly lurking in uh you know when she you know got the you know the idea to to write this short story that she wrote i think you know again like maintaining that this is the thing that that writers do like like they draw from real life for inspiration for uh their fiction like sure that's a thing i think you know the part they're probably sent dawn over the top was the gas lighting no there's had nothing to do with you you know maybe i took a nugget from here as opposed to like lifting the entire letter you know that you know that she had posted to her facebook group he asked me like never subpoena me in the group chat because um yeah that's that's gonna be that's gonna be a problem because writers be petty and um writers be shit talking oh my god i'm on team nobody erin i'm on team nobody here i think that i think that you know look is it bitchy and kind of not maybe the very best way to act to like target and shit talk and gaslight somebody who clearly has some issues it's not kind that's it was very unkind but i'm i'm i'm team mess that's what i'm to i'm here for this entire story i encourage everybody to read this thing from top to bottom it was a wild ride it was it was a journey and you know when you cover politics you need an estate every now and then and this this was this was a welcome escape oh my gosh well you know what you talked about your reality tv shows and drinking cider this was like a reality it was like reality tv drama oh it was definitely like real it was tape there was some table flipping going on oh 100 percent i mean i think that i think that the thing the ultimate my takeaway was ultimately sonya and the group of writers were being bitchy and mean but dawn was being insane like dawn is being over the top at like popping into events yeah showing up at events that i want to ruin it for you people you need to read this but but yeah there there there was a just when you thought this doesn't get me more wild it's like nope new rock bottom so yes yes it's the kid is the story that keeps on giving i'm here for oh 100 and it also also reminded me that it's really important as like a writer or anybody who does creative stuff surround yourself with people who do different stuff than you like don't don't do the thing or or surround yourself with people who will actually acknowledge you as their actual friend right goes down right as opposed to don who like that that was that was my first clue that this was not going to end well at all we actually weren't that close it's like oh sure no yeah it's like when donald trump says he just he doesn't know somebody it's like oh you did crimes with this person you definitely did crimes with this person um okay erin thank you so much for coming by today it was great having you thank you kyron
