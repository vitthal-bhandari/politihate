    "text": " The only reason I ever been mad at the transgender community is because I was at a club in LA and danced with one of these n***s for six songs straight. I had no idea. And we ended up having breakfast together. All grown up, that doesn't make me gay. So Megan Rapinoe, the professional female soccer player, she is doing something that I would not have thought possible, but she is in a tight race with Megan Markle to be my least favorite Megan. It's an accomplishment, really. And of course, you guys are probably familiar with Megan Rapinoe, not necessarily because of her soccer prowess, because let's face it, who watches women's soccer, but because she is the athlete slash activist who really made the pay gap for female athletes a major talking point nationwide. She is one of the women who said, hang on a second, who cares? If I could never beat a male soccer player, who cares? If nobody actually watches our matches, you know what? We are women and we deserve the same pay as the men. Yeah, that in a nutshell is Megan Rapinoe. And now she is back in the news this time for basically blaming Dave Chappelle, the comedian, for violence against trans people. We have this from our very own theblaze.com. I don't want to mince words about it, Rapinoe said. Dave Chappelle making jokes about trans people directly leads to violence, whether it's verbal or otherwise against trans people. When Martina or Sage or whoever are talking about this, people aren't hearing it just in the context of elite sports. They're saying the rest of my life, this is how I'm going to treat trans people. So there's a bunch of things to unpack there. First off, let's talk about the jokes angle. Megan Rapinoe is essentially saying here that Dave Chappelle makes jokes at the expense of trans people. Like by the way, he does against women, against white people, sometimes even black people, but no, when it comes to trans people, those jokes are apparently unacceptable because they encourage violence. But I mean, are Dave Chappelle's jokes about trans people really that dehumanizing? Do they really condone or perhaps minimize violence in any way, shape or form? I don't know. Let's just for science, of course, here another one, definitely not because he would upset Megan Rapinoe. I'm not saying it's not pushing, but that's like beyond possible. Tastes like pushing. It's not quite what it is, if it's not blood, that's beet juice. I mean, whether you think that joke is funny or not, whether you think that joke is in good taste, but don't. Or not. I think it's very hard to argue that Dave Chappelle, by saying this would be at all complicit in trans violence, but Megan Rapinoe doesn't actually stop there. She goes even further and even says that, hey, you care about trans people and sports and that also. Somehow it's contributing to violence against trans people. I'm going to be unpacking all of this, but first, I do want to say a big thank you to today's sponsor, Naturally It's Clean. So I have a dog, I'm a pet owner, and I have a toddler. I am a mother. And if you're anything like me, that means that you are dealing with a lot of cleanup in your household on a constant basis. However, that also means that you likely want to avoid any harsh chemicals that could potentially be dangerous or not safe for your little ones or for your furry friends. And that is exactly where naturally it's clean comes in. Their products are made with hospital grade cleaning solutions that are going to smell great every time and not only that, but they actually work. I hate how so many times natural products, they don't do anything, which is like, okay, that's nice that you're made of plants, but I actually want something efficient. Natural is clean, not only are we talking safe formulations, but they are effective formulations. Specifically, Bob Villa says that Naturally It's Clean actually has the most eco-friendly carpet stain remover on the market today. Okay, and that's Bob Villa. So you know you could take it to the bank. I personally love Naturally It's Clean and I use it at home. I use their stain remover for the carpet. I use their laundry detergent and their essentials starter kit, which features four of their most popular products. It's one of their top selling items and you can get 15% off for a limited time. When you go to naturallyit's clean.com slash Lauren, these products are manufactured right here in the USA. They support your conservative values and on top of everything, they offer free two day shipping look guys. Odds are, I hope you are buying cleaning products anyway. So why not take that money and actually buy something that not only works, but it also goes to support people who share your values. I mean, really it's win, win, win, win, win. Please check them out today and get your Lauren's essential starter kit by going to naturallyit's clean.com slash Lauren. Again, that is naturallyit's clean.com slash Lauren. So in this little statement here, not only is Megan Rapinoe attributing violence against trans people to jokes, humor, comedians, which really would have been bad enough, but she goes a step even further than that and essentially says, Hey, if you don't like trans women in sports competing against females, then you're also part of the problem. It's disappointing, but not really surprising that Megan Rapinoe has taken this stance because being the good progressive, good left winger that she is, she is actually very outspoken about the fact that she is okay with trans women competing against females. And some people have pointed out that this does come as she is retiring. And therefore not in a position where she herself will have to compete against these males. But in any case, we have this once more from the blaze. US women soccer team star Megan Rapinoe said that she would welcome a trans woman onto the team, even if it meant replacing a biological woman. Rapinoe made the comments in an interview with Time magazine during which she was asked to explain her supportive trans athletes at a time when many states are passing laws forbidding trans athletes in some sports competitions. It's particularly frustrating when women's sports as weaponized Rapinoe continues, Oh, now we care about fairness. Now we care about women's sports. That's total BS. Okay, so I mean, that is kind of a funny point. Obviously people don't really care about women's sports when it comes to actually watching them. At least going by, you know, viewership of women's soccer, for instance. But is it hypocritical for people who don't watch women's sports to say, hey, trans people shouldn't be competing in them? In my opinion, no, you don't need to be an avid fan of women's soccer. In order to say, hang on a second, the women who do play women's soccer, they should have a right to compete against their own sex and not have to go up against biological males. I don't think that's hypocrisy. You don't have to be a huge fan of women's sports to say, hey, perhaps it isn't fair for female swimmers to go up against people likely at Thomas. Maybe that's actually not fair. And I think when Rapinoe alludes to fairness here, she's probably talking about the pay gap issue, but it's like, come on, you can honestly believe that it's unfair for female athletes to get paid less than male athletes. When fewer people watch them and they just bring in less money, but think that it is fair for biological females to compete against males simply because the male believes they're a different sex. Like in what world does that make sense? Rapinoe also went on to say, show me all the trans people who are in a fairly taking advantage of being trans in sports. It's just not happening. But here's the thing, Meghan, it is actually happening. There's headline after headline week after week of a trans person winning women's swimming competitions, women's cycling competitions, women's weightlifting competitions. How big is the trans population worldwide? Not very yet. How often, how disproportionately represented in women's athletic championships are trans people. This is not just something right wingers are making up. I mean, why in the first place are men and women competing in different leagues? If not, due to the fact that males have a biological advantage over women and actually speaking of that biological advantage, it's kind of ironic how Meghan Rapinoe calls her opponents or her ideological critics, the ones who are encouraging violence against women when, in fact, there's a pretty good case to be made that it's people like Meghan Rapinoe who are responsible for actual women being beaten bloody. You see what we're about to witness is a very brave, very empowered, a trans woman, absolutely BTFOing a biological female. Good throws and reversals by both fighters. These girls are getting right into it. Fox. Oh, yeah, it's it fell in Fox. Holy cow. The game over. I mean, is it honestly the feminist perspective, the progressive stance that that is okay and that that should happen more, that it's all right, not a big deal for a biological male to come in and just absolutely bloody a woman because the biological male says he's a woman. Is that really where we are at as a society? Not only that, but other people have mentioned that it's kind of interesting that Meghan Rapinoe's keen support of trans people competing against women actually comes at a time when Meghan is retiring and will will not herself actually have to face off against a biological male in order to win any championships. I mean, ultimately, this is Meghan Rapinoe we're talking about. I was never of the belief that her and I were like, like this ideologically, but to see her not only condemn people who raise questions about trans women in women's sports, but to actually say, Hey, you are the reason why violence is happening. It's just so unbelievably bad faith. That's basically all I have to say though. If you enjoyed this video, please be sure to like share and subscribe until next time."
