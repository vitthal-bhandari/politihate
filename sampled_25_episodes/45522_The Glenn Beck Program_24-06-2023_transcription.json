    "text": " The New York Post recently published an article about single woke females. For the first time in American history, the majority of women between 18 and 35 are voluntarily opting out of the traditional pathways of marriage and parenthood. Among liberals, it has become a total obsession. Yet nobody on the left can answer the question, what is a woman? Birth rates are dropping for many reasons, some of which are downright depressing. A lot of people are asking, what's the point of starting a family? It's strange and it's awful and it's a suicide note for humanity. Because of the importance of parenthood and because it is rooted in thousands of years of love and meaning that is so enormous, it's often impossible to describe. The last time today's guest was on this podcast was three or four years ago and she wasn't apparent, she wasn't married. And this has led her into an incredible transformation. She hosts the Walkins Welcome podcast and recently started her podcast with her husband. What is it like working with a spouse? I hope we can get to that today. Today's guest can talk about anything to anyone with the ease of a gifted storyteller, a brilliant writer and humorist. She's tweeted earlier this week, I have some thoughts on the future of human civilization for anyone who can't get Elon on their podcast. Please welcome Bridget Fettice. Before we get to Bridget, let me tell you about home title lock. When was the last time you checked the legal title to your home? Why?

Take this home owner, for instance, she was getting ready for a home remodel when everything got shut down. She discovered her property wasn't in her name anymore. Not at all. Turns out she was the victim of a devastating crime called home title threat, a theft, a criminal had forged the deed to her home and taken over as the new owner. Now she's having to fight to get her home back. Your home property equity, your most valuable assets, they're all up for grabs. May I suggest you hire home title lock to protect your most valuable assets home title lock. Go there now home title lock dot com use the promo code back and save. Home title lock dot com. It is so good to see you. Welcome back. So good to be here. Thank you for having me. You were on the radio when you were pregnant. Yes. But the first time we met about four years ago. And you look great. Thank you. You look healthy. Yeah. And I know just in listening to you and and corresponding occasionally that you are much healthier and happier and all these changes in your life. Yeah. So we're going to get it get to that here in a second. But you were just telling me right before we started that you had an Uber driver from Venezuela. I just love talking to you. I always talk to them. I want another whole story. I'm like, how did you end up in Dallas? How did you? He was in Florida first and then he came to Dallas and it's a really funny story about air conditioning, sales and and his sister was here. And so then but he was talking about how prosperous Venezuela was. And he said when he was a kid, he was nine years old and he was sent to America to learn English and and just what he didn't really want to come here. But then he saw the conditions deteriorating and he started talking to me. And he said that he said, I always kind of just gauge if my my passengers can handle, you know, what level of conversation I can have. He said, because people have gotten really mad and I and then he started saying the thing everyone kind of says in private these days. And he said that the thing that they're doing where they're taking a five year old and they're saying, maybe you're not a girl. He's like, this is child abuse. And then he said, you know, the only better than Uber drivers, New York, New York, yeah, really, especially if they're old, they're driving way too long and way too fast. But you learn so much from, yeah, so funny. He was saying, you know, this is he just was saying people don't, he said communism looks really good on paper. And when you're young and idealistic, it sounds great. And then he was just talking about the the people who still control the means to everything are still humans. And they still want the same things we all want. And they want to control things. And it was just funny. It was just a funny conversation. And he was like, you know, look at Venezuela. Now it's tragic. Look at California. Yes, I know. I know. I know. Washing up on the beach of I had someone pull up to me in in my town now in Texas. And he was like, go back to where you came from. I can excuse me. So now I know. Yeah, no, it's the California driving probably. Do you I mean, why did you move to Texas? I mean, life is so strange. Last time I was here, we were I was joking that I feel like I was I'm in like a giant improv where I'm like, yes, and now I'm going going back because I wouldn't have ever thought I would end up in these situations or places being kind of, though, no, it is. I think it's good to you know, I had a friend say the other day, follow the truth wherever that leads you, even if it's not somewhere you want to go, did you ever think you would be living in Texas? And I think part of me always wanted to live in. I love driving around America. Texas has always fascinated me. I think it's like its own ethos and its own culture. And everyone immediately becomes a Texan the minute they step foot here. I know. Like you're weird, isn't it? I have we have mutual friends who have moved here from other places and they're like online, you know, we need to text it. We need to. I'm like, you can't even drive. You're from New York. You don't even have a license. It is so true. What kind of Texan doesn't have a license. Yeah, it doesn't not drive. But my son, you get that way. You know, we're going to be free. And if you are born here, yeah, it's even worse. My son was five maybe when we were talking about moving to Texas. He's adopted. He was born here in Texas. Okay, but he was, you know, soon as soon as mom, he's up to New York and Connecticut. So he, we never talked about Texas. And he's sitting at the table five years old. See the table, we're talking about moving into Texas. And he said, you all realize that I will be the only true Texan in the family. And I'm like, where does that come from? There's something in the soil in the water. I don't know what it is. It's great. It's funny. My daughter took her first steps in Texas. She wasn't born here. She was born in California. But I'm like, I feel like that makes you your Texan. I have friends who will argue absolutely not. You know, Marcus Littrell? No. Okay. So Marcus Littrell, Navy Seal, his brother is also a Navy Seal and doctor now. And he was still in the seals and he was in Virginia. His wife was about to give birth like days away from giving birth. And he calls his brother Marcus up here in Texas. They grew up in Texas. And he said, bro, I just want to make something clear. Even though my son is born in Virginia, he is a Texan, right? And Marcus seriously said, no, he'll be a Virginia. And he's like, come on, man. He's like, no, he'll be a Virginia. So he put his nine month pregnant wife into a car and drove to Texas and had the child here. Wow. I mean, that is commitment to the cars. That is commitment to the cars. It really is. It's so funny, though. There is something about it where you know, it's cool. It is cool. I just I I'm definitely, it took me a minute to kind of breathe into the different pace. I've been in Los Angeles for 16 years. And I think you for and I do really think that you get Stockholm syndrome living in these cities in California that are kind of falling apart all around you. And it was like when I used to go to Joshua tree and it would take me a couple of days to just let my nervous system come down from being in a city, but also just be walking my daughter around and not looking around constantly for I mean, I'm not exaggerating when I say every single walk I took her on. It was dodge someone who looks crazy or sketchy or looking around and living like that constantly, that fight or flight. It does something to your nervous system. So it took me it took me a couple of weeks to really really breathe into the the pace and the just be able to relax a little bit. Besides the weather, do you miss anything in California? I'm a freak. I love this weather. Oh my gosh. I'm a I'm a weirdo though. It's like 150 with 2000% humidity right now. It reminds me of Sri Lanka though or India. There's just something I always wanted to live. Nobody wants to live there. I love Sri Lanka. It's sad what's happening there too. I just I don't mind the heat. I've preferred over the cold. My husband luckily is the same way and we walk out and not eight when it's still 95. We're like, we love I know. The heat I was just on vacation a couple of weeks ago in Great Britain. No air conditioning. No. Okay. And it was like 80 degrees. And I'm like, no one in America would put up with this. I'm like, what is wrong with you people? And they were all fine with it. And I'm like, get some air conditioning. This is a 2000 year old building. And yeah, get a window unit, put some air in this place. And everybody was fine. It's different in America as the as you know, the world economic forum and all the green new deals. They're expecting us to not have air conditioning or not the way America has. I don't think I think what you're doing in schools and mutilating kids, you add air conditioning. And that's a bridge too far. That's when like even the stonchus lives are like, maybe glutton has a point. How could you live here before air conditioning? You could apparently. Well, I don't know. I mean, I can escape it. So I do get to walk in and I would worry about my daughter, my dog, you know, they need to be able to escape this. But there was no air conditioning in Sri Lanka. We always used to be like, we need an AC room. They have AC here. I'll tell you, when we were walking down London, it was so hot and hot in every place. And I'm walking into these stores. I don't know, we're conditioning in here either in New York. We open up the front of the stores when it's really hot. So the people on the street feel the air conditioning like I got to just go browse in here for a while. A complete opposite. They think we're nuts. I think we're nuts. I was in Rome one year and it was so hot. And even me who likes the heat, it was making me, I was like imagine him. There's a light back then. And then you add the smell on it. We were in London and the river still brown from centuries of people pooping in it or something. I don't know. But imagine what that was like. No, I like to imagine. We have it so good. We have it so good. We do. The amount of complaining that goes on. It just, I'm like, we have, this is an unparalleled time in human history. And we're at maybe we just need challenges. And this is, and we're self-destructing because it's not hard enough. And there's not, I don't know. We're so, we're away from all other countries that, you look at Canada and you're like, I mean, I'm glad I'm not living in Canada, but it's not that bad. Mexico's got some beaches. It's bad. But it's not like some of the rest of the world that was so far away from us. We lose context. And we have, honestly, I think of my father always saying to me, Oh, you're crying? I'll give you something to cry. I feel like, I feel like dad, you know, maybe in the role of God, it's like, Oh, really? That's bad? Yeah, I'll give you something to cry about because we're whining and crying now. My gosh, if things turn. No, don't. I mean, there's not mud there. There are more and more people, I think, who will survive it because there are more and more preppers born every day. I feel like it's, I was joking with my friend. I'm like, I'm not sure if I should be preparing my daughter for like growing her own food and hunting or like going to Mars, you know, it's like, right? I was talking to Tim Urban about this and he has a young one too. And I'm like, I don't know. Should I be stockpiling seeds or teaching her how to code? Not definitely not to code that those days are over. Well, I mean, it's it is a weird. I read something the other day that the first industrial revolution was 1760. Okay. The first second and third industrial revolution is from 1762 now. Okay. All of that change will be dwarfed by the change from 2020 to 2040. Yeah, yeah, it's all exponential. It's it is. When you look at Tim Urban actually has this illustration on it's in the intro to his book and he talks about if human history was 2000 pages or something and it's like the last, yeah, all of the last industrial revolution, what you were just talking about is all on the last page. I know. But it was a slow and rather boring and smelly story before that. I mean, I was in Scotland and you'd go one place and they'd say, and you know, this where the plague happened and this how they lived, you go to another place and, you know, 200 years later, they were living like this and you're like, that's not much different, you know, it was. I mean, Jonah Goldberg, I think in his book, he talks about this too, if aliens came and checked in on earth, you know, every 5,000 years, it would be like, oh, not much has changed for for 200,000 years. And then suddenly you're like, wait, what happened? How did we get cars and planes? And it's what's weird is, I just don't think it is a coincidence that, you know, when you're you're living in as a surf, you can't own land, you're you're on the king's land. And so anything you do to make your life better, he'll just take, he'll make more money. People just lose like, why am I going to do that? Why would I put myself out? And then we have freedom in the idea of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. And America does this and the rest of the world behind us, but still does this. And nobody connects the two. It's like all of a sudden, you know, around around 1800 things just got great. Humans started doing hot gloves. I mean, it is like our mutual friend Carol Ross, new book, you own nothing, which is is terrifying. I see these things that although I was reading something the other day, I think it was just a tweet. And someone said, oh, you think you own your land, try not paying property taxes. And I was like, Oh, right. I know, I know. I'm comfortable. I've been thinking about that because, you know, look at me. I'm not in the greatest of health. And I, I was thinking about, you know, when you get older and you have kids, and I want to talk to you about the changes in you already, but when you get older and you have kids, you start to think about leaving, you know, stuff behind. And lucky for me, I'm going to spend it all before I die. So, but, but I was thinking, I couldn't leave them my house. Because if I left it to one of them and they didn't have a very good job, even if the house is paid for in Texas, you couldn't pay the property tax. So do you really ever own anything? I think property tax is the most immoral thing you can do. It's so unfair. I see it in my hometown, where it's a small New England village, essentially, but it's the people who are elderly who own their homes. All of these rich people come in and buy property and all the values go up. And now they have to leave their forever homes because they can't pay property taxes. It's so wrong. It seems horribly wrong. Yeah. And people will, I don't know if that's capitalism doing its thing, but that's government. Okay. Yeah, that's government, isn't it? This is like taxation is theft. If all of a sudden I own a home, a home and a bunch of rich people move in and the neighborhood values go up. Sweet. I'm great. Right. Because capitalism says, now you're coming from that. Yeah. And when I want to, if I want to, I'm going to be sitting pretty. Yeah. It's government saying, you don't really own that. You have to pay our taxes. That's nasty. I'm not smart enough to understand. This weekend is the one-year anniversary of the overturning of Roe versus Wade. And I want to take a moment to recognize the over 64 million babies whose lives were taken at the hands of abortion. And we pray for the mothers who still mourn for their children. And we pray for the mothers who feel they are trapped and have nowhere to go. I think abortion is one of the saddest things. I mean, unless you're celebrating your abortion. But I don't think most women do that. They just don't know what to do. Preborn honors the precious souls who never had a chance to take their first breath and to discover who they could become. That's we've lost a generation. But also honors the mothers who chose life, the mothers who are still struggling in mourning because of what they what they chose. And doing the right thing by not dwelling in the past, but saving moms and their children right now. To honor the 64 million deaths, we'd like you to consider donating $64 to honor the precious lives lost and to keep the precious lives of those at risk safe. Can you do that? Even 64 cents will help. Pound 250. That's all you have to do. Hit pound 250. Say the keyword baby pound 250 keyword baby or you can go to preborn.com slash Glenn. It's funny. I was joking that my my whole life. The other unsettling thing about moving to Texas was becoming basic. Just just it was like my whole life has been just trying to be. I don't know different or cool or I felt like I was always chasing some elusive sense of of identity and really I just find so much joy and the American dream. I want like a nice little piece of land and I want a good school for my kid to go to where she can ride her bike around with her friends. And it's I never I never and I mean I think I joked last time that if you had told me that I was going to quit drinking and end up on this show, I would probably would have kept drinking. But now I can extend that like and be married to someone in recovery and have a baby which is amazing and end up living in Texas four years ago. That wasn't. Oh, I know. I said to you at the time you you should move to Texas and you're like. I mean, yeah, there were so many dreams of being someone. You know, I, California will flush that down the toilet every time. It's nothing but shattered people working as a waiter or waitress waiting for their dream to happen. I thought I wasn't shattered. Well, maybe a little bit. Was waiting tables. Yeah, nothing wrong with that. By the way, there's nothing wrong about that. It's if you're still you know, you've been there for 40 years and you're still going on a dish and see I haven't gotten anything. Such a temporary. Yeah. Yeah. And I did move there with big delusional dreams of grad delusions of grandeur. Yes. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they work. Yeah. And sometimes it's just not really. I don't know. I still love doing comedy. I I found that. I still I still it's tragic what's happened to California. And I know a lot of people disagree with me and they still think it's great. But I lived there for almost 20 years and the decline that I witnessed while I was there. Just around the state and it's it's such a beautiful state that it's just tragic. It is tragic. San Francisco. San Francisco is I was just talking to a guy who said he said he was in London. He said, I'm I'm coming to America. And I said, really? Where are you going? And he said, San Francisco. And I said, so you're not really going to America. He got to look at me puzzled with that. And I said, have you been keeping up with the news? It's going to be a little different than perhaps you think. It's so crazy. I mean, if you went to if you were in San Francisco 10 years ago and went now, you would be shocked at what's happened. And you'd also be shocked because you probably got your rental car broken into. I went to San Francisco maybe five years ago when the super when the super bowl was in San Francisco, I went and that was the last time and the change that I had seen from five years before to then was stark. I can't even imagine what it's like now. I mean, and they're they're all in denial. The the mayor said recently, people are saying that companies are moving out. You're like, we this is the craziest part of the time that we live in is the the blatant lying about what people can see with their own eyes. Right. You're like, no, they literally just put out a press release. They're shutting down the mall. They're shutting. They're taking their company. People are these these conservatives are like, it's not just conservatives, by the way. It's it's a lot of people are seeing this and and you can label them all conservative. Yeah. It makes you feel better, but it's still not true. It's you know what it is. Thank God. It is now the people who have always really kind of believed in the bill of rights, but you really kind of didn't need it. You know what I mean? Kind of work. Anyway, now you're seeing, oh crap, all of them are being violated and this is the result. And so the honest people are coming to the table. You don't have to believe the same things I do. That's the point of the bill of rights. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's been something I've really been saying more and more is that you don't have to be on the right to reject the left and some of some of the blue they want you to leave they've been labeling me that for four years now for five years or however many years since I started opening my mouth that I don't need to accept that people I think get afraid because they're afraid of the labels that will be put on them. But I do think now is the time for some courage and just saying you have to speak what you see because the minute you have been scared out of speaking what you're seeing happening that that's you. Yeah, it's only going to get worse. So you are kind of fascinated by the apocalypse lately. We talk about it a lot. Yeah, tell me about that. I mean, I think I've always been joking that it feels very pre-magnet and ish. And I think every I was thinking about this when I was getting ready this morning to come just how you know every there's so much nihilism and so much like dooms everybody seems like they're in a dooms they call I feel like I joke about the apocalypse but every doesn't every generation feel that way. I mean what did they did they probably thought it was the apocalypse during the black plague maybe they didn't have a word for it. Yeah, I think I think the best thing is if you lived my grandparents my grandparents living through the depression and World War II and seeing that evil of the Nazis and I don't know if they saw it as clearly as we can see it now if you care to look. But that's madness what was going on and it's the same stuff. 1925 do you know the first trans surgery happened in Weimar Republic? I don't know any I'm out of my depth here. Okay, so anything about that? But that guy died because the doctor just shoved a uterus in a man. But all of these things were happening and it happens over time and it's just a slow boil to where people just lose all reason. Yeah, and I think if you're watching that from the outside or could see it and you weren't numb I think you might have thought this might be the end of the world. But I mean now I think it might. I'm just trying to follow this little exact line of thought wait are you saying the trans something led to the Nazis? No, no, I'm saying here's what I should excellate. I'm like wait, wait, wait. So let me let me it probably should clarify. So Weimar Republic, first Germany and World War one happened and all the churches lost the credibility because they were like gods on our side we're gonna win this victorious war and it was a bloodbath. So the churches had lost their credibility because they had become political so people aren't listening to church anymore. Then the dollar or their mark starts to spiral out of control. Youth the 20 something's they become the wealthy ones because they don't have families to feed. So they could take some of their salary and invest it okay and make money but everybody else had to take every dime to buy food and housing and everything else. Okay, so and there's a shift of power to the 20 something's. Okay, so then because 20 something's are 20 something's. They're living a very decadent cocaine is pushed. All kinds of stuff really pushed and society begins to decay. Then the first sexology university is founded and it's all about LGBT. It's they're pushing trans it's the movie cabaret. Okay, except on steroids. Okay. And and then pedophilia starts to crop crop into the schools. The churches see the opportunity of a ha see this is what happens when we don't have God. They get in on the pedophilia. Wait a minute everybody's doing it. No. So the churches the churches do what churches do. Well, at least a lot of them and they don't talk about what the principles of Christ are. Instead, they're like, our faith is the right faith and we're gonna jam it down. Everybody else's throat. They get people who say our children are in jeopardy here. Okay, this madness has got to stop. They get involved. They find the Nazis who are not religious. In fact, hate Christianity. And really anybody that won't bow to the state. They see these as a guys, the stormtroopers on the streets that are I mean, you didn't get the whole population to do Zig Heil and raise your arms because everybody liked it. The stormtroopers would come in in the early the late 20s and early 30s. And they would beat people sometimes to death in the streets if you didn't do that. So everybody was like, I don't want any trouble. Hile. Okay. So that culture, they saw this and they saw them because Hitler was talking about religion and God and our decaying morals right at the very beginning. They went, maybe he'll help the first book burnings. I didn't know this until recently. The first book burnings were the sexology books. Okay. And then everybody lost control of everything. The first people in the death camps were gays and especially trans people. They were the first to go. So when somebody LGBTQ positive, you know, who's saying like, Hey, this is my movement and here's my flag. When they say you're a Nazi, they may know more about doubt a lot to, but they may know more about the actual history and say, Christian nationalists are very dangerous. Historically, you're right. Right. Okay. But that movement was not Christian nationalist, but they played that pivot role. Right. But isn't that the kind of current fear the left has of the backlash to a lot of this stuff in the country? Absolutely. Yeah. And I think it's only because you're jamming it down people's throats. You know, our biggest strength is also our Achilles heel. We're tolerant. We just want to get along. Okay. And if all of this stuff would have been introduced, and not in our schools per se, right? And you could talk about it and debate about it. I don't think you'd be sitting on the powder keg you are. You're now forcing everyone to be involved. And that doesn't sit well, whether you're a Nazi or, you know, transgender activist. Right. It doesn't matter. When you say it's my way or the highway, you're putting powder in that keg. Yeah, there seems to be a it's like these two opposing forces that are extreme. And it's I think most people are in here. Most people are. I mean, the piece that I just dropped today actually was how the public last pride because there was there were how pride lost the public because there was this Gallup poll that came out recently that everybody was like, look at the drop from conservatives on the support for gay marriage. I'm like underreported. Look at the Democrat drop. There was a drop. Look at the numbers of the gay community. I mean, we work with a lot of gay people and they're like, this is nuts. This has just gone too far. Yeah, that's and that's what's fascinating because as I was writing this piece and I was going down several rabbit holes, it was I wanted to and it's I could have made this piece 10,000 words had I wanted to because there's so it's a confluence of so many forces at the same time that are occurring. One being that I feel a very illiberal movement has and we see this kind of all across the board in America just as Douglas Murray said in this piece, parasitically attached itself to gay rights in this instance. Big time. And that's why. And that's why. And that's why. Equality ideal that they have but it was very much lit and Andrew Sullivan contributed some brilliance to this piece and he said it was live and let live and now it's it's my way or nothing. Correct. All the highway. And I think Americans are going fine. It's nothing then. Okay. Don't make me choose between this stuff, you know, like to go back to the driver. What why is let a kid be a kid? Why don't make me defend this and I don't want to have to fight this in our schools and it's so insidious. But then you go down the other rabbit hole and it's like, why is it everywhere? Why is it why is pride like a national as again Douglas Murray the holy month of pride? How did this become something corporations? I'll change their logo. I am less in Saudi Arabia. The less it's their Saudi account. Then and you go down the rabbit hole of ESG and see I and there and you're like, this is nuts. This is social credit. It's crazy. Most people can't understand it. They're just trying to raise their kids. They see this everywhere. Their their daughter has three girlfriends who are now boys. They're like, what the hell is going on? And it's easy to sit down and try and explain well, sit down. Let me tell you about the Frankfurt School and queer theory. Do you have several hours? Oh, and by the way, there's this thing called ESG. Have you heard of it? Oh, no. Well, it's just this global mechanism for basically controlling liquidity. And they've got a racket that has all these massive corporations by the balls. Do you have another several hours? No, people don't. So they they feel that I feel like it accelerates tribalism because it's too confusing, which is part of the point. Correct. It's why people say, you're either with me or against me. And that's so dangerous. That's that's where the the religious thing comes because people will say, well, I believe in God and I believe in morals and standards and everything else. But then it's so easily attaches itself to control exactly the way Murray was talking about. It just it just you have to be so careful. We are in a moment where everybody it's like, everybody should just have their mantra count to 10. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I do think too, it's easy not to get caught up in it. You know, there there was a part of me that was very happy to be the kind of cool gen X or in the back of the school, laughing at all of the world while it burns, which I still do enjoy, by the way, don't get me wrong. But then I had a daughter and suddenly I'm like, Ah, shit, I'm gonna have to fight this. I'm gonna have to fight this stuff. I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to get involved or I'm gonna have to homeschool my kid or I because I just want her I got to be a kid. You know, there was there's stuff in my childhood that was dysfunctional, but I didn't have this stuff in school. It wasn't the gender bread man, you know, the gender stuff. All this like weird stuff. I didn't know I was actually so innocent and sure. They also have the internet, which does not help. But they there's an innocence that's being taken. And it doesn't and I don't I, you know, there are guys like James Lindsay who are much more, I think I feel bad for him because he's he's he's kind of light years ahead of the game and he's he's it's gotta be frustrating. The problem and I don't mean it like this. So let me tell do I rephrase it. The frustrating thing with James Lindsay is he is so deep. Yeah, I mean, I can talk about things and make people's eyes gloss over quickly on, you know, ESG or whatever. But James, he's so deep into it. And he's so smart. And he's so smart. His his language is a little bit Marxist at times. You know what I mean? He uses the language that a lot of Americans don't understand, right? Because he's accurately describing it. You know what I mean? And names and things and you're just like, but it's also important. But it's so complex. So insidious. That's part of the problem. It's the it's this thing where you're and I say this in my piece, the spectator piece, it's like people can they can intuit it, you know, they're like, this wasn't right. And I think a lot of parents during the pandemic were like, what are they talk? What are you? Excuse me. What are they talking about? Weird zoom class. And you can intuit that. But then the minute you try and point to it, it kind of shape shifts or suddenly it's like you're a bigot. And nobody wants to be a bigot. Nobody wants to be a racist. Nobody wants to be a Nazi. Back with more from Bridget Fetticey in just a second. First, let me tell you about a great American business. It started out with a couple of guys. And one of them was really, really talented could make anything. He said, would you make me a belt? And one that works better than average belts. He came up with this design of this belt and he made it. And then friends started saying, Hey, would you make me one? And they knew they had something. So they started a business. Well, here's the thing. They wanted to do if they were going to do a business, they wanted to make sure that it was all American, that it was using American products. It was all sourced here in America, American labor doing it. And now they've expanded, they wallets really great different wallets and really great socks. This American business pays American ranchers to raise specially bred sheep for the wool. Then another American company goes through the wool and gets it ready and makes it into the thread. And then another company here in America weaves the socks, American made products done right by American labor. Grip six dot com slash Beck. That's grip six dot com slash Beck. Talk to me about the difference between you three years ago and you as a mom. Well, I've been radicalized. Oh, it's about extremism. I've been fully radical. Because your mom. Well, yeah, there's certain and because I love America and I was the person that was the 20 something imperialist America. I mean, for lack of a better phrase and I apologize for using this. I'm kind of recovering Libtard. I should write a 12 step program. You know, admitting your Libtard and your life has become miserable. And it is and that's okay. It's okay to be I was idealistic. It's okay to question some of our country's decisions. We should absolutely be horrible. We've done horrible horrible things. And I want to fix them. I want to I would just like us to have a serious conversation just a checklist. What did we do? Okay. Is it still being done? Okay, done. Let's bold this out. Let's never do that again. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Just deal with the things. We're we're still doing horrible, horrible things. And we're talking about what? Yeah, yeah. We can't heal unless we actually look at the real things rationally. Yeah, make sure they're fixed and move on to the next. I think too, living in a city where I saw it, I couldn't look around. That was the benefit of being in California. It's a it's a uni party. I couldn't look around and blame conservatives for the the, you know, city falling apart. I could only blame the people that were being elected and it was blue all the way down. So but how come more people don't see that in college? Again, I think there is I had a friend who said something that really stuck out to me that the true and only guiding ideology in America is but the right. There's this like, you know, there's this going on and this going on. And you if you're a conservative, you probably have to shy your mouth and not really express your opinions at work or around your friends because and you see that disparity and don't think, oh, maybe one side has a lot more power. But but the right. And again, I don't think guys like Trump, which will probably piss off many of your people in your audience, but I don't think it does people any favors because I do know a lot of particularly like boomers who have seen what's going on. They're like, this is this is nuts. And Trump is too much of just a narcissistic loose cannon for them to feel safe, kind of saying, okay, we need to push back against some of this crazy in our own party and and get look at the state that it's in you have Federman announcing Biden. It's just like, we're supposed to just take our sugar and eat it. That's what we're supposed to just be like, oh, this is where all the dog in the meme drinking coffee, like this is fine. And I think someone I know a lot of them have said, you know, I just kind of in hushed shameful tones like I vote for Desannis, you know, somebody who seems younger, disciplined. Somebody who this is, I think, a large part why Biden won is because there were a lot of Americans that just said, I want to return to normalcy. Okay, I know times are changing everything. Just can we turn everything down? And then there were the food shortages. It was and we've we've we've turned it up. Yeah. And I'm interested to see who is going to win the nomination because I think the Democrats are making it more likely that he's the nominee by Biden Trump. Of course, they would love that. They would love that. And they know exactly what I'm saying. Yeah, I know. Which is that there are a lot of died in the world Democrats who have had it with them. But there's a lot of Republicans who are saying the same thing. We just want sanity. Yeah. But when you push a society so far, not an 80 year old madman with a revenge mission. Yeah, that wouldn't be good. I don't know. I don't I can't say that I know what would be good. I do or bad because everything is so crazy. But I would like to you know, people are like, can we get the boomers? I'm like, these guys are even boomers. They're silent generation. Can we maybe just get a boomer? Can we can we? I have, you know, nothing against people who are old. I just think you should be enjoying your grandchildren. And I want 100. Have you seen quite a mistake corporation? Well, say that. Have you seen a fake Ramishwami? Oh, yes. What if press the fresh air? I'm like, yeah, somebody like that would be great. Yeah, would be great. I don't know if he even has a chance to even be on the debate stage. But that's the kind of guy and attitude and someone who under you really think that Biden is tweeting his own stuff. Yeah. I mean, Donald Trump is Joe Biden. I bet hasn't even used an iPhone, you know, necessarily himself. We're in a different world. It is time for people. And I say this as a guy who's almost 60. Okay. We've had a good run. And especially, I think, my age, I'm at the last year of the boomers. Okay. And I don't really relate to the boomers. And I'm the last year of the boomers. And I feel like I've dealt with these hippies long enough. And I feel like saying, dude, you screwed everything up. And we had to pay for a lot of that back in the 60s, my generation. Right. Okay. And we were the latch kids, you know, generation. And now you are the exact opposite of what you said was right. It's time for you to let go and let someone else deal with it. They talk about how the declaration and constitution just isn't, it wasn't written for this era. And you were? Yeah. I mean, you were a teenager when 1946, 1951. Come on. Yeah. It's definitely shows me to just how hard power is to let go of when you have it, no matter who you are. And what's weird, it's not even who you are. Like you look at what's her name finds. She doesn't even know who she is. It's the institution that just wants the body. You know, Federman, I feel so bad for him. I know. So bad for him. It's so, and that's the problem is that it pulls on all this. You're like, I feel bad for this person. I don't want to, and I feel like everyone has a right to demand that their leaders be competent. But those, those norms were shredded. And I'm not exactly sure. I do think though, I would prefer as much as it absolutely pains me to say this, Gavin versus Ron, just because at least it would be, I feel accurate representations of both sides and where what we're actually trying to confront. And does someone needs to push Biden when he says, I'm pro gender affirming care. People need to push these people to define what that is. Tell me what that what does that mean, sir. Mr. President, what exactly is gender affirming care? Can you describe it to me? Do you even know what it is? Do you know what you're supporting? Do you know where you are? Do you know your name? But you can't get that nobody, the press. It's so either evil and they know it or they're the dumbest people alive or they're just trapped and feel like I mean, I feel like a lot of people feel trapped. I was saying this just on Twitter yesterday, there was that that woman, I think her name was Robinson and she was talking in some hearing about how she read an article in NPR about this is why it's not a big deal. The biological men should be competing against women. And I'm like, where are the female athletes? I understand that it's a culture of just suck it up and you take your loss, but this is not fundamentally not fair. And you are going to lose, I would say, joking. I'm like, I hope they I hope these women who don't speak up lose their job to a mediocre male because you didn't say anything. And if you don't, you're going to cost another woman her spot. Do you see the activist in Congress yesterday talking about Serena Williams and saying there is no difference, no difference between a man and woman. I'm talking about it. I think her name was Robin. I can't remember her name yet. And wait, there's no difference. Serena Williams, when she was good, was beaten by the 207th ranking man at tennis. You can't tell me that a man can be imposing and can hold a woman in Raper and do and do whatever because a woman doesn't have the strength, which is all true on some men. I mean, you could beat the snot out of me, but you know what I mean? Generally speaking, we have more muscle. We are bigger. So to say that there's no difference. Well, it is interesting. It is interesting too, because it's talking out of two sides of your mouth at the same time. So how do you explain rape culture, for example, if this is true, this can't be true. It must not exist. If there's no biological difference between men and women, why does this happen? Women should just be able to fight back. It's insane. And people are afraid. I think people feel trapped. I think they're afraid. Douglas Murray said, I wish I could have just posted the transcriptions of every person that I interviewed because they were also brilliant trying to put it into one article felt impossible. But Douglas was saying that he felt that the reason because the UK is actually quite ahead on this. And he said, it's because somebody like JK Rowling, who's massively huge, spoke out very early against this and that we are behind because someone like Oprah hasn't stood up and been like, hey, women should have their spaces. You know, it's really interesting being over there. JK Rowling is, I mean, there are Harry Potter things everywhere. Yeah, she's huge. Everywhere. She is gigantic. Yeah. Going to Oxford, they have made one of the gargoyles, one of the figures in a Harry Potter's. She has an honorary doctorate Oxford. And I'm trying to piece this together. You have somebody that popular, Oprah doesn't have anything in any college, you know, reflecting on the gargoyle, anything she's ever done. You have a society that is monetarily really benefiting from her work. She's deep into the culture. And they've just destroyed her. Just destroyed her. It's insane. And all she's doing is defending women. You know, it's just like, and you're not defending women. If you're, if you're standing up and saying the truth, all of a sudden, wait, I don't, wait, how do you even make that logic work? I'm not sure. Again, I feel like it's just something that's kind of cool. And there's something young people are, they feel purpose being a part of this movement or whatever. And I, I'm not, I don't know, I talked to the women's liberation front, the women who are fighting for the, they're pushing the lawsuit against the California corrections for men in women's prisons. And this is the kind of stuff people need to be pushed to say on record. You agree with, oh, you're for gender affirming care for minors. You agree with putting them on puberty blockers. You agree with pausing their development development, which we know is not a pause. We know that now. You even though all most of the European countries are backtracking with not Canada, Canada is going full stream, seem ahead. And it is gone nuts. But you look at all of the places we were told, we should be more like France, Sweden, Sweden, Norway, all of those are going, whoa, slow down. Yep. I'm looking at the science. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. And this is the people who are always like, oh, these anti scientific idiots who are, it's, it's maddening. But I do my, my kind of white pill is Michael Malice would say is that more and more people do seem to be kind of reaching their limit. I mean, I wrote a piece probably four or five years ago being like, you can't just shame people into voting the way that you want because you say they're big it or they're, they're racist because of whatever your, your, your idea about things is, and you want them to vote away. And yesterday, cat Rosenfeld wrote this piece for the Boston Globe about how progress is our minting conservatives. And I'm like, yeah, I said this four years ago. And now it's even crazier. Now that was when you were, that was pre all of this, like even more insane stuff and post COVID, which was also insane. I a couple of years ago met the people at Jase Medical. And I started talking about the Jase case. The Jase case holds five of the most important antibiotics for emergency use. Well, at the time when I first met them, I said, you know, I'm a prepper. And they said, so are we. And I said, prescription drugs, I mean, heart medicine, high blood pressure, psychiatric medicine. What is going to happen if we have a disruption in the supply chain for those people who have to have that medicine? And they just sat back in their chairs and smiled and said, see, that's why you that's why we knew we needed to talk to you. We're working on it. Well, they have the new product out. It's called Jase Daily, a prescription supply service that allows you to get up to a 12 month backup supply of your prescription medication just in case of an emergency. So cover a whole bunch of medications like cholesterol. If you're a diabetic, heart health, blood pressure, mental health, and more, your order will be reviewed by a certified health care professional and delivered right to your door. It is something that has given me real peace of mind because that's the one piece of the puzzle I couldn't figure out how to prepare for my family. Jase medical.com go there now enter the promo code back for a discount on your order. It's promo code back at Jase medical.com. What do you think of RFK? Yeah, he's interesting. You know, I think he's he's an again, this is the state of the Democratic Party that he's like, people are just so thirsty. And I do think Stephen Miller, not the Stephen Miller, work for Trump, Stephen Miller, who's the writer, he was saying that he kind of gives permission to a lot of people on the left who were vaccine skeptics, for example, and just were very happy to let the everybody say, Oh, it's those mag are people who don't want the vaccine. I'm like, you know how many people I knew in LA who didn't get the vaccine quietly and just were fine. Having everyone think it was like, Oh, those, those Hicks over there didn't get the vaccine. Well, and he was saying the same thing. The original kind of anti-vax community was like in the Palisades, right? You know, these are the the hippie granola moms. Right. And so there was a lot of people and a lot of people in the black community rightfully did not want to get the vaccine and the press. Why is there any kind of history with that? What are you talking about? Press never had to really address that. They could ignore that and focus on. And so I think RFK is pointing out and giving permission to a faction of the left that has not been able to speak up because they didn't really have a representative. So I know conservatives who like him because he is in it's so strange. The left was right about the United States turning into one giant corporation in business with big business. The right said that'll never happen. I trust come. We were dumb as a boxer rocks. Got that one wrong. Got that one wrong. Kind of a big one. Um, uh, slippery slope. Yeah. Um, but, but the things that you were right on the left is now being the champion. Yeah. No, that's the other crazy thing. I mean, big, and less war and less war. And he said this when he was on Rogan, which you can't even post those clips on YouTube without getting your channel demonetized. We'll put that in the bucket of other terrifying things that we would need an entirely separate episode for. But it, it, that, that's what he represents. That the silencing of this conversation, the ability to even have the dialogue, the ability to ask the questions. He has a little bit of what the Democrats are doing to Trump. They're also kind of doing it to him. They're not not as severe, but they're silencing him. And people are hungry for anyone who will stand up and say, this is wrong. Yeah. He's saying, for instance, I always trusted the FBI and CIA. Oh my. Have they always been this way? How did I not see that? Okay. But now everybody on the left is like, Oh, they're great. I love them. I love the FBI. What? Yeah. As somebody who's gen X, it's very disorienting. Oh, I did. Because it was all of the things that I was when I was in my kind of recovering, you know, when I was in my full libtardation, I, that was all the stuff I was fighting against. Right. Wars in other countries. So what happened? Big pharma. What happened? It's so weird. From 2000, the year 2000, I am not the same man that I was. I still am. I hate to say the label conservative. I don't think means anything. Yeah, I'm not. I am a constitutional bill of rights American. Okay. I'm used to you agree with me on that. We don't have any arguments that are severe that we can't work through. Mm hmm. But I would make the, you know, well, this war is important and this is important and well, the FBI, it probably was just isolated. All that crap. Has been proven wrong. Right. And so many conservatives are there. And you have a chance of actually changing and doing the things that the liberals who were actual bill of rights liberals who are saying this is this is wrong what we're doing. We have a chance to change it. But it may be and maybe it goes back to the first thing you say about the right that they just will not see that I'm not talking about the GOP. I'm talking about common sense people that are like, no, there's a problem here. And shame on me for being so stupid. Good for you. You got it right. Now did we get anything right that you're starting to discover? You know, it's the same eye opening on it's just and it's almost on the same things were coming. You're coming our way on some things. I'm coming your way on some things. And those some things are the important principles. Yeah. And can we meet in the middle with health care, please anyone, anyone? I feel like can anyone address this problem? Anyone. No, we fixed it. Obamacare fixed it. I mean, that was a little bit jarring coming from California to Texas. It's definitely better in California. Because as somebody who is an independent, I can't get I don't think I can get a private PPO as an individual here. I could be mistaken or it's just way too expensive for me. I have to be employed by someone there are groups who can get involved in. And so then I had to get an HMO and I haven't had an HMO in a long time. And my gosh, how does it was very eye opening how people there are two classes while probably three classes of care in the United States for health care. And it was bad. Yeah, it's not good. No, it's got and it's gotten much much worse. Yeah, much more controlled. It's, you know, when I moved from New York, because I, you know, the company was mine and I had responsibility. I couldn't carry the same insurance across from New York to why right why I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know. Money and payoffs from politicians. Yeah, I mean, this is so much of the problem. It really is. So now that now that you are a little apocalyptic, but yet a mom, yeah, and so you're more grounded. I'm actually more optimistic, weirdly, too. Why? Because that was really the kind of epiphany I had when I was getting ready this morning. Just all men are presented with whatever humanity is dealing with in their time and they have to deal with it. And this is, this is what I'm presented with. And my job is to prepare my daughter to handle whatever, whatever is presented to her in the best way that she can and, and pray that, you know, she has the good head on her shoulders and she knows that she's loved and that, but there's a lot that I, I'm an old parent. So I'm a hyper aware of the fact that I won't be around probably as long as I'd like to be in her life and see. And so I have to trust that she will be okay. You know, I, I, that is, that's my job. Even not in these times. You'll go through that as a parent. Still better than ever. So it's still, even though I can look at the horizon and say, oh, this could really go off the rails. Is it, and this is kind of what Tim Urban and I were discussing, is it going to be, she's going to Mars? Is it going to be, she's enslaved by robots? Will it be, she, the grid has gone down and she's growing food? Or will it be just a little bit more of where we are and, and a little better, a little worse? Whatever. Yeah. I'm not sure. And I, I am optimistic seeing how resilient kids are, just how smart they are, how creative they naturally are. And they tap, she just forces me to come into the present. It's easy to get spun out and all this stuff. I've been watching the Arnold documentary, which is very interesting. And again, as a 90s kid, I, I had to watch this, but he was talking about his Nazi father who had one expression that really stuck with him, which was be useful. And I think about that a lot. You know, I wake up and I try to food prep or be useful. And I do think there might be a crisis of usefulness in our country because people are, they're not doing things. They're going online and like working themselves up into a lather over these ridiculous, like the dumb think pieces and, and not having enough really nuanced conversations. That's why all the people in the piece about pride that I, that I wrote, they're, they're gays and lesbians and trans men and women. And they, they have to live with the consequences of this backlash we're seeing, which is why I wanted to reach out to them, but they're also critical of gender ideology. So they represent, I think, where most people fall and they're the people we should be listening to, the Glenn Greenwalls and Douglas Murray about this topic in particular, Andrew Doyle. And they get the kind of least amount of airtime because we just hear from the activists on either side who are riling each other up. But they're, we, I don't, there's, I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We've made, that's one of the most, I think inspiring things that I've seen in my lifetime is that, that the, going to just the, the transition we've had for lack of a better word around gay marriage and gay rights and gay people in the world. It's miraculous. And in a very short time, and now, and this is where I kind of, we were joking on Dumpster Fire and I'm sure it'll get, you know, cut and taken out of context, but we were like, maybe you're right about the slippery slope. And I disagree, it's not necessarily true, but it is because this other thing is piggyback, like a Trojan horse into it. Although my husband would say that's what they were afraid of. That's right. I had a conversation with my daughter. She was a Fordham. She wouldn't talk to me for a while because they had her so ratcheted up that, that I was anti-gay. And I'm like, I'm a libertarian on this. I don't really care. I don't think the government has anything to do with anybody. Don't tell me how to live. I won't tell you how to live. Don't tell me what my church has to do. And I won't tell you what your church has to do. Leave it be. Let people follow themselves. And, and she just, she wouldn't even, she got so, and I said, honey, the reason why I speak out about this is because of the slit, and she cut me off. Okay. And I'm like, and I know, and I, and I said, it's not that this will lead to this and this will lead to this. You don't understand the people that are truly pushing with money behind this. Okay. The people that you get that, are they all going to quit their job because they've got what they want to? I mean, yeah, that's the, that's another thing we covered in this article is just that NGOs need a job. But then there's also just this insidious part of all of these theories that is all just destruction. Yeah. It's just, just deconstruct everything. And I'm not smart enough for them. It's, there's something sinister. You know, it feels sinister. And I hate saying that because I don't want to be an extremist. I don't, I try so hard to be nuanced and, and see where everybody's coming from. And then I see activists screaming in people's faces. And, and I don't want like conservative people having to like, check children's genitals before they play soccer. You know, I, I, that's crazy too. Right. Here's the thing. I said to James Lindsey, last time I talked to him, I think, I said, James, you know, the first time I ever met you, you were an atheist, full fledged. And I said, I don't really know where you stand now. He's had some really good experiences, some really bad experiences. I said, but I swore off the word evil about 2011 because it was, it's, it's, it's a very powerful word. It feels hyperbolic. Correct. You know. And I said, however, if I were to define evil, I would define it as a destructive force that destroys everything and makes people slaves to thoughts or physical slaves. You know what I mean? Yeah. Anything that tells you you can't do it, you won't survive without anything that does that. I think is evil. And he agreed with me. Yeah. I hear this a lot and I have that same resistance, like being raised Catholic and feeling kind of, it's, you're like, evil, is it evil? And then it gets thrown around and you see it online. And, and there's lots of hyperbole. And, and then I don't know, you know, again, I go back to the Arnold documentary, which he kind of brushes over, but it made me really think about his talking about his father, how he was, he could be very, you know, hard on them and also seem to be an alcoholic. And all of these broken men in Austria who basically got behind this ideology and believe were believers and were just demolished and demoralized and what his town was like with all these people. And, you know, there will, there seems to be, I can't help but feel that way about a lot of the stuff I see now that people are kind of co-signing. And I think Blair White has said this where she says, you know, a lot of people are going to pretend they were never on board with this. Oh, yeah. They're just going to act like that's why I say, but when people are saying this and they're public figures, you put, you need to push them to say it on record, to say what exactly this stuff means and what they're advocating for. Because, oh, so you're advocating for biological men and women's prisons and shelters and locker rooms. And that was the other thing I was looking at my daughter and I'm like, I don't want these. I don't want her to have to worry. I was so uncomfortable when I was a young girl going through puberty to the thought of having comfortable with same sex. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is supposed to, again, people are, and then there's like this whole weird, because we live in such a raging, narcissistic time. There's this whole culture of people where it's like, cool to be a parent of one of these kids. And this is where I say, because I had an internal debate, you know, like should the state be saying, you can't get this care for your child if you, if you feel that to write for your child. And then I see these moms on Instagram and like, no, shut up. By the way, you brought up on our social niggas dad who was a Nazi twice now, Nazi. But let me just say this. You said his phrase was, be useful. I think that's fantastic. I don't think you should say it came from our social niggas dad, the country that was like useless eaters. Let's kill them all. I mean, part of it is kind of like, whatever you do, be useful, because this will come back again. I know, I don't know how to, I hate like, I was like, I don't even know how to explain this. No, I know. Because I don't know. Schwarzenegger's dad, but then if I neglect to mention that he's not. Just say it's yours. I'm not going to say it's I hate. Okay, it's my mantra. It's my, you know, I just keep going, which very good, which is mine. But you know, I don't like stealing things from people and I, I, but you're right. I probably shouldn't. No, but I, I think it's a profound the way you said it. It is a profound statement because people are not being useful, useful, you know, but then the Nazi thing just kept going. I know. I know. I had this whole thing. I was writing about it. And this is a thing you like tiptoe. And this is what I hate about the, the, the modern culture is that I'm hyper aware of, like, Oh, that's going to get clipped. And here's Bridget saying like, be useful like a Nazi, which is not what I'm saying. You just have to, I know, I know, you just have to let go. And then I was thinking like, it led me down this other weird rabbit hole, like, are you still considered the greatest generation of your a Nazi? The greatest generation on the winning side. Only the winners were the greatest generation. That's what I came down to. Yeah. And I was thinking too, just about how much this must have affected his, like Arnold psyche and why he loves American might. And so, you know, doesn't want to lose. It's really fascinating. Yeah. He's an amazing guy. I mean, it's an amazing story. Amazing. And yeah, you're probably right. Good to see you. Good to see you too. And we'll talk again. Thank you for having me. Especially now that you're in Texas. Yeah. Just a reminder, I'd love you to rate and subscribe to the podcast and pass us on to a friend so it can be discovered by other people."
