Hannity they'll turn them up press always ask me don't I wish I were debating him no I wish we're in high school I could take him behind the gym that's what I was imagine for any one second any prominent conservative or any elected republican ever saying any one of those individual things what do you think the reaction would be that's just part a tiny part of their hypocrisy here you know listen to the media and Antifa literally defending Antifa and I could go long I'll give you the short version what are they really I know their name is anti-fascists today only go after fasciest or they go after anybody say in the global economic community they don't like no they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the Trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo-fascism that we see a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is on legitimate response to white supremacy neo-Nazi violence it says it right in the name Antifa anti-fascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organization is perfect there was some violence no organization is perfect Antifa yeah they're not perfect you know I've never forget I mean we've been showing it the last two nights on TV got an MS DNC reporter covering you know the mayhem and the rioting and the looting and the arson that took place over the summer literally right behind a live shot this fires everywhere mostly peaceful mostly yeah mostly peaceful or the the still shot we have of this fake news CNN reporter you know behind up just nothing but flames everywhere but mostly peaceful I mean it's insane you got the media got Democrats all they did is downplay the violence and even denied it on a level that is like huh you think our own eyes to see us they don't listen this is a question that's been done by a commissioner of the city council not a mob in the middle of the night from the department what they do this violence across the whole country he does about the history that that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's been spread only in Washington DC about the anti-fascists yes they're not going to stop before election day november and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not going to let up and they should not this is not generally speaking on rolly but fires have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country a restructure yeah well they're going to do what they're going to do Pelosi said there's the idea that this violence that's a myth come on that's not true it's a myth you know Kamala Harris you know protests are not going to stop and should not and then goes on everyone be aware and take note of that huh well the very thing that they're just they're fainting their outrage that they're saying that not all day Trump did it I'm going to show all of this tonight on Hannity because it's it's it's eye opening you know you you look at the hatred the contempt for the president or you know for his supporters you know pasket of deplorables drug addicts um well molly walmart shoppers olive garden eaters now I mean it just never ends it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their the holiday and that they're staying at and the garden mariotte and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem this is seeing it the garden mariotte oh let me correct the right it's a courtyard you know it's actually pretty funny to make courtyard mariotte and it's the Hilton garden let's not milk milk let's not mix up our hotels here um or holiday and or olive garden you know olive garden has the best salads I love their salad I love their garlic breadsticks I love their desserts you know little they kind of like don't let you put on you can dip them in like chocolate or caramel whatever you prefer pasta dishes and they got everything that is good as christian tonies but I mean it's just a great place um especially when i was on the road a lot you know just like I love waffle house I can't pass ask anybody on my team if I can pass a waffle house or an in and out burger or a cracker barrel I can't do this skinny if you eat all this food I'm not skinny that's the problem I mean and I put on you know a covid 10 at least I got mortaring so much food now because I love my friends in the restaurant business trying to support them um anyway but you know then then then yesterday you got biden and Harris both you know climbing a double standard by cops in the US it's it's I don't even know exactly what they're referring to I mean yeah you've got this video of this former you know high ranking four tours of duty arms forces patriot veteran shot as you don't arms now I granted I didn't think anybody should have gone in the capital didn't deserve to get killed over it and you know so it's selective moral outrage as anyone forgotten Kamala Harris a massive supporter of the la defund the police movement you know supporting the bell raising money bell funds in the wake of the Minneapolis riots and biden staffers also supporting this idiotic bell fund this all happened what do I always say feign selective moral outrage double standard you know it was um it's it's just painful we really have a truth deficit in this country the likes of which we've never had before and and it's it's beyond troubling journalism I declare dead in 2007 and 8 it's probably the one example where I can almost speak with a broad brush and I don't like speaking with broad brushes hence the 99% in the FBI the 99% intelligence community you know but if you look at the wage Donald Trump and his supporters you know we can pull up my favorite cut of all was how they mocked and laughed and ridiculed the idea that Donald Trump would run and then he won and they never stopped attacking this man every single hour of every single day you know one of the challenges the mob is gonna now face all right they'll have their what 120 days of Biden and oh there's you're gonna get a lot of this so refreshing it's not gonna be long before it goes super viral miss me yet hashtag trump 20 24 trust me and then all of a sudden I realize wow joe is a lot slower than we thought maybe hannity and some conservatives were not wrong in their criticism that he lost his fastball if he ever had one they looks weak and frail we don't get to see him very often another is what he does his press conference is now he pulls out his notes and he likes flips to every section starts reading from the section he probably forgot um what are you gonna do if he forgets what job he has what day the week it is look I'll do what he's unable to do I'll lead to effective strategy to mobilize true in an ass ever depressor isolated plenty's China I know how dare Hannity bring these things up just say in my humble observation um time will tell put the the stated policies are outright scary for the country and you know and and that's why for a lot of you that just want to say the hell was it you can't there's too much at stake ah I'm gonna retire you know what it doesn't matter if you care about future generations you know what a Reagan say freedom is one generation away from extinction I don't want it to be on our watch this country is too great too many people of you know for the principles that make us great and this is the most radical socialist agenda ever advanced by any major political party it just is so you know we have our challenges we have our differences and you know we're gonna get through all of it we'll get through all of it together and you know they're always they're always bumps in the road and I know you know it's funny because I've I've talked to a lot of people that were actually at the rally and they said they've actually declared to me some they said yeah my soul was happening I knew that would be trespassing I'm not going near that well that's the 99% you know when you look at the left do I think to I think the the leaders of the left the Biden's Kamala Harris's and and everybody in Washington Pelosi and Navler's they should have condemned the violence and the arson and the looting and the taking over city blocks and police stations and we shouldn't have been told this is you know the summer of love and a chopchas autonomous zone that can't happen either in America when they're pulling down American statues you want to change them all right go through the legal process try and do it that's the way things work in this country the same with those that enter the Capitol apparently some now reports that Nancy Pelosi's laptop may have been stolen another Democrat Jeff Merkley said rioters stole a laptop from his ransacked office and we don't need to see this in this country we can prevent it the biggest questions I think we need to answer this how come we were not they were not prepared for this knowing so many people were in town and knowing that they were marching from the monument straight on over to the Capitol anyone been to media pay attention that the president was condemning it at the time was telling people to leave and be peaceful yes they didn't want to pay attention to that anyway so you know let's impeach the president that's what we're gonna do it was very interesting the comments that Nikki Haley gave um rana McDaniel's been the national republican republican national committee dinner in florida and she said about the president I didn't always choose the right words and I told them so with the time when these moments came up um she didn't like the rally but she pointed out that that i'm one who believes our country made truly extraordinary gains in the last four years and up and then Haley's right Nikki Haley because conservatism works that's the thing you know nobody looks at the extraordinary success that this president has had nobody nobody looks that no president in history has ever had to go through as much as this guy's gone through the media just ignoring you know calls for violence against the president they never cared you know this ideas molly walmart marchoppers and olive guard eaters and i mean it's very revealing in terms of what they think of we the people for those we the people people are the ones that make America great people that get up every day and they go to their job and they provide goods and services for other and they obey laws pay taxes you know i'm pretty much just want to just leave us alone with the rest of our lives let it raise their kids their good examples nobody's perfect but the good examples then you have a media that defended antifa and a media that defended the violence this summer now they're all lecturing everybody about how they really feel well be consistent we're consistent on this program they've anything but consistent we don't we care about Russian interference not Hilary's dossier care about quid pro clothes yeah not Joe's quid pro quail with Ukraine we care about Russian interference we didn't care about the dossier we don't care premeditated fraud on the five-sighort spying on a president we don't care about hunter the money wire transfers from an oligarch in Russia or Kazakhstan or Chinese national shopping spree we don't care about any of it is but if it was Trump okay about all of it and you know that gets frustrating for people frustrated me i'll tell you that um but you know i'm just going to tell you what mark my words they're going to overreach and the country is not going to like it's a center-right country and then we'll have an opportunity to get back in power in the meantime you try and you know fight for the values make people aware of everything that we don't agree with peacefully something they should have called for in the last four years and they didn't right hour to Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program i mean censorship here there and everywhere it's amazing isn't it the short-term memory we don't even have to go back a full year and you got Democrats you got the media mob you know there the way that they have defended and not spoken out against you know violence in the streets of major cities and americans pretty unbelievable i we even have specific instances of them you know defending antifa or antifa if you prefer let me let me play that one first they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo fascism that we see and they've taken a principal stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists wherever they may show up it says it right in the name antifa antifascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organizations perfect there was some violence i think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response to white supremacist neo-Nazi violence the problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment the radiation is tough treatment but it is meant to remove the cancer there's a group of antifascists called the black block which do tend to get violent their idea is look non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this but they wouldn't have been there they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been for the fact that white supremacists neo-Nazis were out scaring the living day-lout out of most of the people in that town sogishness is thogishness whatever it comes from politically and we should be the first to call it out i disagree now why would they defend antifa how about if we all forgotten the last four years of we've forgotten the rhetoric against Donald Trump and violent rhetoric of the left because i might it's pretty fresh in my mind listen yes i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house i'm the last time an actor assassinated a president but dare you say that things he does of course i want to punch him in a face right you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up they go low we kick right i just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all of the country maybe they will be i'll put mr.  Burgess up against uh Sean Hannity they'll turn them up press always ask me don't i wish i were debating him no i wish you're in high school i could take him behind the gym that's what i wish wow i guess i guess they forgot to get outraged over those comments and then of course you got the media the mob well let's downplay the 2020 uh writing that went on and alluding in the burning that took place we're just kind of look downplay it a little bit but boy you wouldn't think uh from this week and they're fained selective moral outrage and double standard uh that these are even the same people from just a few months ago listen to the media democrats the mob he respect that being done by a commission or should he counsel not a mob in the middle of the night from the middle of the department? he'll do what they do this by the time it's across the whole country he disavowed the way through tifa that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's that's being spread only in what should be about the anti-f not gonna stop before election day november and they're not gonna stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this is they're not gonna let up and they should not this is the most lip protest it is not it is not generally speaking on rolli but flyers have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country all right joining us now we are joined by Joe Concha Fox News contributor opinion columnist for the Hill the great mark Simone host of the morning show our affiliate in New York W O R thank you both for being with us you know mark you do it every day I do it every day Joe does it every day you know you point out this this rampant hypocrisy I mean it's not that long ago this this all happened in the last four years a lot of it happened last year alone not even a full year ago well that's the problem in your show too consistent you gotta be like these guys it's like a ping pong that you it's over there now he's over there now he's over there I don't know what I was watching that Chris Cuomo clip from a while back when he said why does the protest have to be peaceful and he was defending the lawlessness and the craziness but he we had a 126 protest the first 125 which were far more violent are some looting smashing destroying statues monuments tens of thousands of businesses destroyed they never said a word you saw Jimmy Fallon with that the fearful speech about from mob to get out of control he was crying when it happened in his own city outside his own a window for months he never said a word so I guess only the consistent about his total inconsistency yeah the total the only thing consistent is the inconsistency which is which is forever true you know Joe Concha you you been on radio and TV with me a lot over the last four years and you know we've talked at length we we expose that they they pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory they lied to this country for three long years they have made excuses for even violent behavior and and showed no condemnation of violent rhetoric of the hard left or Hollywood or even within their own party you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either president trump mike pence or jeff sessions who would it be does one of us have to come out alive yes I'm angry yes I am outraged yes I have thought and not a lot about blowing up the white house what was the last time an actor is sesame to the president I life really did you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up Donald trump is a guy who none whatsoever and now I want to these things supposed to so supposedly we're supposed to believe this matters to them as they feign their new selective moral outrage you ever see naked gun the great Leslie Nielsen he's the detective Frank driven your aging yourself mr\"}\n",

March when Biden actually have to answer for Biden and his administration and his ideas and his proposals he promised that Democrats took back the Senate that the $2,000 checks would go out immediately and you already got Joe Manchin saying yeah I'm not signing on to that so suddenly he's gonna run into a lot of problems despite having the house in the Senate and the Oval Office and it's gonna be a civil war within the Democratic Party because progressives and guys like Manchin are gonna see eye to eye and it's gonna be quite entertaining to watch until the GOP takes back the House in 2022 yeah I'm not exactly sure how much ability he's truly gonna have to stand up to the hard left in his party because they're the ones that helped elect this guy if you want to believe that you know this guy got 80 million votes I have a hard time believing that number I don't see on that front marks a moan Joe Biden in any way is gonna do anything but what the AOCs and the squad and and the Bernie Sanders are gonna insist that he do and I think it's gonna be as bad as they as they telegraphed her in the campaign I don't know you know Democrats those crazy Democrats may be in for a shock with old swamp Joe you notice the stock market once they want everything on Monday Tuesday the stock market starts soaring now I hear that's because this administration the Biden administration has contacted everybody in banking finance Wall Street to let them know everything's gonna be okay for them that they'll be taken care of there'll be some corporate tax but corporations don't pay the tax anyway they just pass it along so there'll be a couple of little tiny symbolic crazy left-wing things just to keep you other said happy but it's gonna be swamp businesses usual Wall Street banking big tech big corporations will be taken care of again it's a great observation although Bloomberg had an article out today that said get ready because taxes are gonna be raised dramatically on quote the wealthy you know top 10% pay 70 whatever percent of the tax money in this country top you know top 10% pay like 80% so they're already paying the money all right quick break right back we'll come back more with Mark Simone and Joe Concha on the other side on this Friday Hannity tonight we're gonna remind everybody of the left wing rhetoric and things that they have said and done the last four years it's fresh in my memory it's nine eastern on Fox quick break right back more with them on the other side we as we continue I 25 to the top of the hour toll free it's 800 941 Sean you want to be a part of this extra amigantah I don't know what it is I mean I spent a lot of time in my life had like a courtyard maria or Hilton garden more time than I would prefer because you go on the road my kids are you know into athletics we used to travel quite a bit and when they were younger and you know it was a big deal of one of the first things I always checked all right is you know what are the good restaurants in town and whenever there was an olive card I'm like all right great I love the olive card unlimited salad unlimited you know amounts of garlic delicious breadsticks sometimes unlimited pasta specials you know in some cases I remember just starving myself all day because I'm going to olive garden tonight and then for dessert they have like these hot it's sort of like donut things and you give it chocolate or caramel and you put it on top I mean it is with powdered sugar it's just amazing loved it loved all of it well apparently it is not particularly up to speed when it comes to a fake new CNN anchor former fander built I guess current fander built himself Anderson Cooper is what he had to say about it it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their holiday in that they're staying at in the garden mario and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in Washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem you're going to go back to the olive garden or the holiday in or the you know he doesn't even know the names of the hotels I'm like wow not sure where does he do is fine dining no boo I mean most Americans don't dine there I've never been there I don't know any play I know like two places in New York City where I go and that's it unbelievable and I have my steady restaurants here in Long Island and by the way one is just like the olive garden except better I mean just a little bit better I like the olive card you go over to fake news msd and see and they're talking about you know trumps ride or die base is a bunch of people with Nazi t-shirts so we've gone from olive guard eating olive garden eating holiday in courtyard mario at Hilton Gardens people smelly Walmart shoppers here at demable deplorables people that cling to god our guns our Bibles and our religion that are angry and now I guess now we're a bunch of ride or die people that wear Nazi t-shirts according to msd and see he has the voters we saw who the president's rider die base is Peter it was a bunch of people wearing Nazi t-shirts homemade for pelts and horns that is not the Republican party so as far as the president's kingmaker status have we just realized it was maybe all just a marketing scheme because think about it on his watch yes he wanted to 2016 but his party lost the house they lost the White House they lost the Senate and think about his big reveal on Wednesday we saw who his rider die base are a bunch of Nazis and you just never ends anyway we continue our analysis Joe Kancha Fox News contributor he writes on the media opinion calmness for the hill marks Simone host of the morning show on w or r I will say this about marks Simone he's probably been all those fancy restaurants because he pretty much mcs every event that takes place in New York City is that connected it is it is part of his DNA is not a single person that doesn't know who marks Simone is in New York City but I'm not sure marks Simone that you'd dine at all these places on a regular basis maybe you do I'm kind of pretty sure I'm just guessing here that you you've been to all of garden and I'm betting you're probably like it actually it was terrible when the innocent Cooper said that because it got me thinking about the olive garden it's taken every out the strength let the go there because I don't want to start with those breadsticks they got the best columnari yeah shrimp dishes and I don't know who does the photographs on the menu but that guy's the greatest photographer in the world I want them to do by the way is the one in Times Square still open yeah good good curbside delivery take out and of course they're all over and the great shopping malls and there's a couple of long island and I love that place you know when Anderson Cooper said that about low-lives that would go to the mario the Hilton garden or the the olive garden he didn't realize everybody in the room all all the crew all the union guys what they love these places he was insulting them right to their face I don't know I've been on MSM BC whenever you're done after the host yells at you as you walk out everybody on the crew all the union guys all the workers whispering your ear I agree with you I don't think they realize how hated they are but their own crews over there no I think that by the way there's certain truth to that too I've by the way I've had people that hate every word I say when I work by the way but that's fine I don't know you know Joe I'll be honest and and this is an honest feeling so you know my kids would be in you know whatever city state small town we happen to be and and you know I can't help it I'm older and I take you know great delight in the little pleasure of life of eating and you know I'd get to the town get to where my courtyard mario there's or Hilton garden get settled in whatever we had to do we do whatever practice whatever was going on that day but one of the first things I would do is I would I would check out in google what restaurants are in town and I mean this with all my heart and if all of garden popped up boom we're going to the olive garden that was it or outback state cows another plan to be like yes touchdown whatever I go to all of garden the first thing I say to the waitress after I'm done with my meal which is mainly breadsticks is my compliments to the microwave I mean they do great microwave there no question but I look I see it and I don't know if you knew this it's what the acronym stands for it's the condescending news network and it's why so many people dislike the network on a personal level because it's hard to find too many folks there that don't speak down to people you know they're the smartest people in the room don't you know and they're going to tell you exactly how they feel about things as Anderson Cooper did remember he's the same guy and he's called an anchor by the way which is hilarious just own it you're an opinion host and he called the president no beast turtle just a month ago you know he's the funniest guy in the room so when he speaks like this to Marx point I guess the plan is for CNN to alienate completely already have I suppose they probably don't even care anymore half the country when you say those things and again they keep claiming to be the objective down the middle network and clearly it's almost impossible to tell the difference between MSNBC CNN and media matters as it pertains to the media team there so look that that's what they have and when the Donald Trump is gone in two weeks and Joe Biden comes in and they settle in it is going to be a ratings crash like we haven't seen since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of a number being in one place and going down to another because once you lose your central character and that's all Donald Trump has been on that network for five years they got nothing and they can't go back to being in the Bernard Shaw Gulf Wars the end of because they got people like Anderson Cooper there to alienate their audience yeah but let me tell you where it's also going to go you're right I mean they'll get their first hundred days and and I can predict the coverage marks on what it's going to be oh how great it is to have somebody with the integrity of the great Joe Biden of course like during zero experience Hunter ignoring the quid pro quo ignoring the Biden foreign family syndicate in China and Russia and Kazakhstan and Ukrainian oligarchs and Chinese national shopping sprees and the deal with the bank in China we're going to ignore all of that's going to be a relief after a hard days of all of this relief and they'll probably pledge we're not going to cover Donald Trump anymore we're going to censor him just like big media big tech and then all of a sudden their ratings chose right at some point hundred days maybe 120 days I can't give the exact date they're going to start tanking and then they're going to realize that their daily dose of feigned outrage against Donald Trump and their hatred of this man fueled you know their entire network for all this time and I'm just guessing they're really going to miss this guy yeah the big question is what will they do when there's a tremendous loss in ratings and then revenue and they got to do something that executives are going to get the fired will they turn on Biden will they start to go after hunter to save themselves I don't I don't know or will they keep up the the plan they're going to go back they're going to pledge to stay away from all covering Trump then they're going to be forced to cover up because they're going to need it's like it's like a drug to them now I mean that was going to be major withdrawal symptoms in all of them you know and at the media should be outraged about Facebook and Twitter censoring Donald Trump you know what in Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone that was the most important invention he changed well he mentioned to be said only people I agree with politically can use it if I don't agree with you I'm not giving you a phone and you can't talk kind of imagine a phone company did that why why do we allow this face the commander in chief of the military is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States he's not allowed to speak on Facebook anymore how does this allow this it's insane how could the media just sit back I don't care who and allow some like that to happen in America here's how I see that evolving Joe Consha all right so they're going to silence the president on on social media big tech companies Twitter Facebook etc which by the way makes the case to eliminate their their liability protection is provided by section 230 the silencing the president okay and the silencing prominent conservatives and any conservative for that matter free speech is out the window it's not free in in America then it's the assignment is used to say no to Josh Hawley's book on this very topic and then they're going to go back to their you know tried and true efforts which is to silence every conservative voice talk radio people like me the few conservatives that we have on the Fox News channel just silence those guys and get rid of those guys because that's all they've been trying to do now for years pretty much throughout my entire career if we're going to be blunt and that's the thing right it is slippery slope when you say all right we're going to ban this guy from speaking on our platform whether it's Twitter whether it's Facebook snapchat whatever then what do you do with say the leader of Iran who tweets out often that Israel should be wiped off the map or Chinese government officials that say that coronavirus was actually invented by the US army and now being weaponized by the right is any of them ever been censored I don't recall no that's the thing right so Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey from Twitter they can say well this doesn't meet our standards well if that's the case if we're talking about world leaders and government officials then you got to take those down just like Maxine Waters when she said inciting violence inciting riots that if you see anybody from the Trump cabinet or administration you get up in their face all right that is a call to physically go after people and we saw time and again it happened again with Lindsey Graham just today he was in an airport and he started to get harassed by god knows who so yeah when you start calling on people to get in the faces of government officials because you disagree with him because god but you forbid if we actually disagree with some civility anymore this is the result of Maxine Waters her account is just fine so unless you're consistent with this don't bother trying it at all because it may look like it might have some bias and some activism against one party of course they do that's all they contributed to was the Biden campaign if you think that section 230 is suddenly going to go away because Biden gets then forget it because the check is going to become due from all those donations and all those people from Silicon Valley that are now in the Biden administration Sean and look at look at Pelosi today marks them on you know on he left to know you don't have to but if you hear her today if you if somehow you know maybe you accidentally tuned into the show or TV tonight you might hear something but unhinged as she is and and needing her her radical base as much as she does now more than ever because of the tight margin in the house but to move to neutralize America's nuclear strike force okay Russia's watching this the Iranian moles are watching this China's watching this every hostile regime and actor on the world stage is watching this and and then they see Joe coming in and if they see Joe the way I and many other people see him is weak and frail and seemingly compromised cognitively um what are they thinking about all of this I would think that from their strategic geopolitical standpoint they're probably liking what they perceive as a weak in America hey it's just crazy and you see these cabinet members leaving early and I have heard off the record from some people uh no names but they're leaving early because they don't want to get in the middle of whatever shoomer and Pelosi are plotting with some crazy 25th amendment thing they don't want to be there for any of that they don't know what these people are going to try to pull next the nuclear codes are fine that this is the most anti war president we have ever had he's the first president that didn't send a single troop anywhere uh we've got nothing to worry about there who's been more pro war than Joe Biden from uh a rack to whatever but uh it it's uh a weak and a couple of days just calm down if you're Pelosi and Schumer he's leaving don't be sore winners just let it go yeah okay that's not that's not possible anyway um anyway I'm gonna let you guys go thank you both for being with us mark some own W.

prominent conservative or any elected republican ever saying any one of those individual things what do you think the reaction would be that's just part a tiny part of their hypocrisy here you know listen to the media and Antifa literally defending Antifa and I could go long I'll give you the short version what are they really I know their name is anti-fascists today only go after fasciest or they go after anybody say in the global economic community they don't like no they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the Trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo-fascism that we see a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is on legitimate response to white supremacy neo-Nazi violence it says it right in the name Antifa anti-fascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organization is perfect there was some violence no organization is perfect Antifa yeah they're not perfect you know I've never forget I mean we've been showing it the last two nights on TV got an MS DNC reporter covering you know the mayhem and the rioting and the looting and the arson that took place over the summer literally right behind a live shot this fires everywhere mostly peaceful mostly yeah mostly peaceful or the the still shot we have of this fake news CNN reporter you know behind up just nothing but flames everywhere but mostly peaceful I mean it's insane you got the media got Democrats all they did is downplay the violence and even denied it on a level that is like huh you think our own eyes to see us they don't listen this is a question that's been done by a commissioner of the city council not a mob in the middle of the night from the department what they do this violence across the whole country he does about the history that that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's been spread only in Washington DC about the anti-fascists yes they're not going to stop before election day november and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not going to let up and they should not this is not generally speaking on rolly but fires have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country a restructure yeah well they're going to do what they're going to do Pelosi said there's the idea that this violence that's a myth come on that's not true it's a myth you know Kamala Harris you know protests are not going to stop and should not and then goes on everyone be aware and take note of that huh well the very thing that they're just they're fainting their outrage that they're saying that not all day Trump did it I'm going to show all of this tonight on Hannity because it's it's it's eye opening you know you you look at the hatred the contempt for the president or you know for his supporters you know pasket of deplorables drug addicts um well molly walmart shoppers olive garden eaters now I mean it just never ends it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their the holiday and that they're staying at and the garden mariotte and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem this is seeing it the garden mariotte oh let me correct the right it's a courtyard you know it's actually pretty funny to make courtyard mariotte and it's the Hilton garden let's not milk milk let's not mix up our hotels here um or holiday and or olive garden you know olive garden has the best salads I love their salad I love their garlic breadsticks I love their desserts you know little they kind of like don't let you put on you can dip them in like chocolate or caramel whatever you prefer pasta dishes and they got everything that is good as christian tonies but I mean it's just a great place um especially when i was on the road a lot you know just like I love waffle house I can't pass ask anybody on my team if I can pass a waffle house or an in and out burger or a cracker barrel I can't do this skinny if you eat all this food I'm not skinny that's the problem I mean and I put on you know a covid 10 at least I got mortaring so much food now because I love my friends in the restaurant business trying to support them um anyway but you know then then then yesterday you got biden and Harris both you know climbing a double standard by cops in the US it's it's I don't even know exactly what they're referring to I mean yeah you've got this video of this former you know high ranking four tours of duty arms forces patriot veteran shot as you don't arms now I granted I didn't think anybody should have gone in the capital didn't deserve to get killed over it and you know so it's selective moral outrage as anyone forgotten Kamala Harris a massive supporter of the la defund the police movement you know supporting the bell raising money bell funds in the wake of the Minneapolis riots and biden staffers also supporting this idiotic bell fund this all happened what do I always say feign selective moral outrage double standard you know it was um it's it's just painful we really have a truth deficit in this country the likes of which we've never had before and and it's it's beyond troubling journalism I declare dead in 2007 and 8 it's probably the one example where I can almost speak with a broad brush and I don't like speaking with broad brushes hence the 99% in the FBI the 99% intelligence community you know but if you look at the wage Donald Trump and his supporters you know we can pull up my favorite cut of all was how they mocked and laughed and ridiculed the idea that Donald Trump would run and then he won and they never stopped attacking this man every single hour of every single day you know one of the challenges the mob is gonna now face all right they'll have their what 120 days of Biden and oh there's you're gonna get a lot of this so refreshing it's not gonna be long before it goes super viral miss me yet hashtag trump 20 24 trust me and then all of a sudden I realize wow joe is a lot slower than we thought maybe hannity and some conservatives were not wrong in their criticism that he lost his fastball if he ever had one they looks weak and frail we don't get to see him very often another is what he does his press conference is now he pulls out his notes and he likes flips to every section starts reading from the section he probably forgot um what are you gonna do if he forgets what job he has what day the week it is look I'll do what he's unable to do I'll lead to effective strategy to mobilize true in an ass ever depressor isolated plenty's China I know how dare Hannity bring these things up just say in my humble observation um time will tell put the the stated policies are outright scary for the country and you know and and that's why for a lot of you that just want to say the hell was it you can't there's too much at stake ah I'm gonna retire you know what it doesn't matter if you care about future generations you know what a Reagan say freedom is one generation away from extinction I don't want it to be on our watch this country is too great too many people of you know for the principles that make us great and this is the most radical socialist agenda ever advanced by any major political party it just is so you know we have our challenges we have our differences and you know we're gonna get through all of it we'll get through all of it together and you know they're always they're always bumps in the road and I know you know it's funny because I've I've talked to a lot of people that were actually at the rally and they said they've actually declared to me some they said yeah my soul was happening I knew that would be trespassing I'm not going near that well that's the 99% you know when you look at the left do I think to I think the the leaders of the left the Biden's Kamala Harris's and and everybody in Washington Pelosi and Navler's they should have condemned the violence and the arson and the looting and the taking over city blocks and police stations and we shouldn't have been told this is you know the summer of love and a chopchas autonomous zone that can't happen either in America when they're pulling down American statues you want to change them all right go through the legal process try and do it that's the way things work in this country the same with those that enter the Capitol apparently some now reports that Nancy Pelosi's laptop may have been stolen another Democrat Jeff Merkley said rioters stole a laptop from his ransacked office and we don't need to see this in this country we can prevent it the biggest questions I think we need to answer this how come we were not they were not prepared for this knowing so many people were in town and knowing that they were marching from the monument straight on over to the Capitol anyone been to media pay attention that the president was condemning it at the time was telling people to leave and be peaceful yes they didn't want to pay attention to that anyway so you know let's impeach the president that's what we're gonna do it was very interesting the comments that Nikki Haley gave um rana McDaniel's been the national republican republican national committee dinner in florida and she said about the president I didn't always choose the right words and I told them so with the time when these moments came up um she didn't like the rally but she pointed out that that i'm one who believes our country made truly extraordinary gains in the last four years and up and then Haley's right Nikki Haley because conservatism works that's the thing you know nobody looks at the extraordinary success that this president has had nobody nobody looks that no president in history has ever had to go through as much as this guy's gone through the media just ignoring you know calls for violence against the president they never cared you know this ideas molly walmart marchoppers and olive guard eaters and i mean it's very revealing in terms of what they think of we the people for those we the people people are the ones that make America great people that get up every day and they go to their job and they provide goods and services for other and they obey laws pay taxes you know i'm pretty much just want to just leave us alone with the rest of our lives let it raise their kids their good examples nobody's perfect but the good examples then you have a media that defended antifa and a media that defended the violence this summer now they're all lecturing everybody about how they really feel well be consistent we're consistent on this program they've anything but consistent we don't we care about Russian interference not Hilary's dossier care about quid pro clothes yeah not Joe's quid pro quail with Ukraine we care about Russian interference we didn't care about the dossier we don't care premeditated fraud on the five-sighort spying on a president we don't care about hunter the money wire transfers from an oligarch in Russia or Kazakhstan or Chinese national shopping spree we don't care about any of it is but if it was Trump okay about all of it and you know that gets frustrating for people frustrated me i'll tell you that um but you know i'm just going to tell you what mark my words they're going to overreach and the country is not going to like it's a center-right country and then we'll have an opportunity to get back in power in the meantime you try and you know fight for the values make people aware of everything that we don't agree with peacefully something they should have called for in the last four years and they didn't right hour to Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program i mean censorship here there and everywhere it's amazing isn't it the short-term memory we don't even have to go back a full year and you got Democrats you got the media mob you know there the way that they have defended and not spoken out against you know violence in the streets of major cities and americans pretty unbelievable i we even have specific instances of them you know defending antifa or antifa if you prefer let me let me play that one first they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo fascism that we see and they've taken a principal stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists wherever they may show up it says it right in the name antifa antifascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organizations perfect there was some violence i think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response to white supremacist neo-Nazi violence the problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment the radiation is tough treatment but it is meant to remove the cancer there's a group of antifascists called the black block which do tend to get violent their idea is look non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this but they wouldn't have been there they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been for the fact that white supremacists neo-Nazis were out scaring the living day-lout out of most of the people in that town sogishness is thogishness whatever it comes from politically and we should be the first to call it out i disagree now why would they defend antifa how about if we all forgotten the last four years of we've forgotten the rhetoric against Donald Trump and violent rhetoric of the left because i might it's pretty fresh in my mind listen yes i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house i'm the last time an actor assassinated a president but dare you say that things he does of course i want to punch him in a face right you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up they go low we kick right i just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all of the country maybe they will be i'll put mr.  Burgess up against uh Sean Hannity they'll turn them up press always ask me don't i wish i were debating him no i wish you're in high school i could take him behind the gym that's what i wish wow i guess i guess they forgot to get outraged over those comments and then of course you got the media the mob well let's downplay the 2020 uh writing that went on and alluding in the burning that took place we're just kind of look downplay it a little bit but boy you wouldn't think uh from this week and they're fained selective moral outrage and double standard uh that these are even the same people from just a few months ago listen to the media democrats the mob he respect that being done by a commission or should he counsel not a mob in the middle of the night from the middle of the department? he'll do what they do this by the time it's across the whole country he disavowed the way through tifa that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's that's being spread only in what should be about the anti-f not gonna stop before election day november and they're not gonna stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this is they're not gonna let up and they should not this is the most lip protest it is not it is not generally speaking on rolli but flyers have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country all right joining us now we are joined by Joe Concha Fox News contributor opinion columnist for the Hill the great mark Simone host of the morning show our affiliate in New York W O R thank you both for being with us you know mark you do it every day I do it every day Joe does it every day you know you point out this this rampant hypocrisy I mean it's not that long ago this this all happened in the last four years a lot of it happened last year alone not even a full year ago well that's the problem in your show too consistent you gotta be like these guys it's like a ping pong that you it's over there now he's over there now he's over there I don't know what I was watching that Chris Cuomo clip from a while back when he said why does the protest have to be peaceful and he was defending the lawlessness and the craziness but he we had a 126 protest the first 125 which were far more violent are some looting smashing destroying statues monuments tens of thousands of businesses destroyed they never said a word you saw Jimmy Fallon with that the fearful speech about from mob to get out of control he was crying when it happened in his own city outside his own a window for months he never said a word so I guess only the consistent about his total inconsistency yeah the total the only thing consistent is the inconsistency which is which is forever true you know Joe Concha you you been on radio and TV with me a lot over the last four years and you know we've talked at length we we expose that they they pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory they lied to this country for three long years they have made excuses for even violent behavior and and showed no condemnation of violent rhetoric of the hard left or Hollywood or even within their own party you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either president trump mike pence or jeff sessions who would it be does one of us have to come out alive yes I'm angry yes I am outraged yes I have thought and not a lot about blowing up the white house what was the last time an actor is sesame to the president I life really did you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up Donald trump is a guy who none whatsoever and now I want to these things supposed to so supposedly we're supposed to believe this matters to them as they feign their new selective moral outrage you ever see naked gun the great Leslie Nielsen he's the detective Frank driven your aging yourself mr\"}\n",
