    "text": " All right, it's Friday. Glad you're with us right down our toll free number at 800-94 one shawn if you ever want to be a part of this program today and we got a lot coming up in the course of this program. I got to start with I know so many of you and even many of you that went to the rally earlier in the week are living a level of frustration you probably have never felt before in your life. And you know when you're falsely accused of things it's understandable. Now we watched about 1% of people and we're beginning to be we're trying to piece together exactly you know who some of the leaders agitators were as they raced into the Capitol building, etc. and they will be held accountable for their actions. But there's always this desire to paint with a broad brush. When 99% of the people traveled to Washington for reasons I have outlined repeatedly on this program and on TV about how they feel about things is you know when you have 83% of the American people feeling one way about an election in one party and you know about 30% of independents and millions even in the opposition party, there's something to it. The whole purpose of what they were doing trying to do in the House on the 6th now it's the 8th two days ago was to try and say okay we hear you we need to look at it we want to attend a commission that's that's what that was all about. And and then when you are watching and listening and hearing you know every good American we've been consisted on this program when there was violence going on rioting going on the burning down of our city cities blocks being taken over etc. etc. we we condemn those that that did these specific acts and the same about the 1% not the 99% of people that went to peacefully protest. We're not denying what happened the way Democrats did over the summer what we saw before our very eyes our eyes were not lying to us. And in part is there's an agenda to everything that people do and say and you know what really I think it's gotten a lot of people upset it is not only the 99% and let me remind everybody it was not the most pleasant task in my career to have to really on peel every layer of the onion and it took almost three years to do it to expose corruption and abuse of power and by the way proven right now multiple times on every level as it relates to people in an organization for example the FBI one that I revere and but so I made a a determined effort if you're a regular listener if you're a regular viewer of I made a determined effort to isolate and separate the 99% versus the 1% because people in the FBI the overwhelming vast majority are good honorable people that serve their country and many of them putting their life at risk every day the same with the intelligence community. There's a reason I have an FBI pin and I wear on Hannity every night and an intelligence pin I also wear on on Hannity every night it's actually you know for the 99% because we spent a lot of time having to go after people that did abuse their power oh knowing what we'd know now we'd never have signed those Pfizer warrants we signed you know that we never verified that we that we told the Pfizer court was verified and even when they knew it was unverifiable and debunked and false they kept going ahead with their scheme to spy on a presidential candidate and then president and for the record not one Democrat that I can think of and nobody in the media mob that I can think of short of me and a couple of others some of us on talk radio just a couple on Fox that spoke out of against it you know you look at fake news CNN they just lie with abandoned to the American people for three well really longer when you include it when it's all encompassing just light every day did they ever admit that they were wrong ever correct or no how much damage does that do to the country does a lot um it's destructive it's hateful and so people that went they're law hardworking law-abiding uh honest American citizens that were peacefully protesting they get painted with a broad brush I'm not somebody that does that I didn't do in the case of the FBI I can say pretty accurately that pretty much the media mob now as they speak with one group think voice few rare exceptions in the media I can name some of you want we can go down that road if you feel like calling it and asking me I have names of a few that are actually pretty fair sure Al Atkinson would be one uh Catherine Harridge I think does a good job she used to be a colleague at Fox he's now at CBS um but I'm not gonna go down the whole list but you could just you just know that they have an agenda they they all push the phony Russia hoax conspiracy they all ignored Hillary's dirty Russian dossier breathtaking hypocrisy they never criticized those that abused power at the at the highest levels in the FBI you know the same thing with with you crane and hunter Biden and and Joe Biden and quid pro clothes you know they peach the president over one phone call with one fact witness the phone call was fine the fact witness said no there was no quid pro quo you create a lot of movement and a lot of noise and you know Americans begin to think something nefarious happened it never happened you know they'll vet Trump till the day goes home when did Joe Biden really ever get tough questions um anyway so no American like what we saw at the Capitol and we're gonna get to the bottom of it we need to get to the bottom of it although I don't know if you put John Durham in charge of it me we mean never get to the bottom of anything it'll just you know be in an investigation and perpetuity you know Americans all of us as conservatives we love this country we believe in this country there's no greater country that God has ever given man Americans you know every conservative I know respects and honors law enforcement you know you watch the violence that took place over the summer and the excuses that were made by by many in the media many Democrats it's breathtaking I'll play some of it and you know I watch and I listen and we chronicle this I think we probably do more than anybody else but I mean you literally now we're at a point where you could have you have big tech companies deciding to outright censor anybody whose opinions they don't like it's that bad and yet get liability protections that are not afforded to anyone else in the media which by the way is a huge cost reduction to them and and also you know they would then become editors like any news organization which I'm a part of and etc etc anyway um and then you know we're gonna now we're gonna silence Josh Hawley's book like really he's about this very topic and you know if you there are a lot of institutional forces I've been warning you about way before this election that don't particularly like conservatives this this statement by Anderson Cooper's revealing in that sense the year they're gonna go back to their olive garden or holiday in or court yard gardens I mean I love the olive garden I like Walmart you know I like my second amendment rights and my Bible and God and my religion too and I'm not an iridema who's deplorable and I actually take shower every day and use the odor it but I go to Walmart I like to shop at Walmart and you know now people just with a broad brush you've been well have your or have you ever supported Donald Trump I mean this is how crazy some of these people are taking it and you know there is righteous indignation for all of the reasons that I have laid out on this program many many times we can go over them again today you know this country whether we like it or not I mean it would be great if we all just got along but we have very deep a very deep divide and deep political differences and and that's what this country right now is going through it's gone through this many many times it's not unusual but if you live in a country that has freedom of speech and assembly you know people are going to express those differences now what happened over the summer was wrong does that represent all Democrats now he doesn't does the guy that shot Steve Scalise in the ball field represent Bernie Sanders no he doesn't you know we can does every the the the people the percentage of people that is minute compared to the massive crowd of the rally this week does that represent conservatives and Trump supported no it does not you know and what what really I think a lot of this is rooted in is one of the things is is that Donald Trump has fought back against the establishment he has exposed this you want to know how ugly the swamp is when you start draining it and you get to the tar at the bottom and the swamp creatures that are emerging out of that tar don't like being exposed at a little disinfect in it's called sunlight and people become aware of you know just how bad the media is quote fake news just how corrupt the Democratic Party is what breathtaking hypocrisy they have and they don't like it and they have they have basically been on a never ending campaign since this guy and his his wife came down the escalator at Trump tower five years ago and you know because in large part because he fought back and he exposed them does he is he a fighter for his views and is like yeah yes fierce and he's he's had a backbone that probably stronger than all the Republicans in the party group together and so for example was he just supposed to not fight back against Russia conspiracy lies and a hoax that he had conspired with a hostile regime to this country and a hostile actor Vladimir Putin to get elected over Hillary Clinton no I don't I think he was right to fight back three long years of his presidency wasted on the country being told nothing but lies and ironically at the end of it we find out well there was Russia collusion it was a dirty Russian misinformation dossier and Hillary Clinton paid for the thing and then worse the dirty Russian disinformation dossier you can't make this up in a spy novel was then used as the foundation and predicate to spy on candidate Trump transition team Trump and president Trump same with the Ukraine oh quid pro close okay Joe Biden yes you got six hours you're not getting the billion let's you fire the prosecutor it would be the prosecutor investigating a zero experience on goes on ABC GMA and he's experienced an oil gas energy Ukraine nope nope nope nope why do you think you got the millions I don't know it's only the tip of the iceberg you can factor in Russia wire transfers causa transfers other Ukrainian deals China deals China national shopping spree bank of China 1.5 billion nobody cared about exposing any of this and there are people that that have legitimate you know anger about what has been happening in the country and they went to Washington express it all I try to explain do they care about the 99% of peaceful protesters and so this is not gonna end unfortunately the political disagreements I'm just saying that anytime we disagree we got to be you got to do a peacefully and then if people not gonna be peaceful we're gonna be consistent in calling it out the Democrats weren't consistent this summer and I'm gonna prove it to you when we get back because I actually have a great memory like an elephant and I got a I've got audio and videotape that nobody else will remind you of all the only hundred nine four one Sean toll free tell of the numbers you know it's you know to deny that we don't have major massive political differences and and a very closely divided country just lying to ourselves doesn't mean but but no American good American would want any of of what we've seen over the summer and what we saw earlier this week nobody wants that but you know we can also you know ignore four years of lies and conspiracy theories psychotic rage either and but that's what you know these the self righteous and self righteous indignation that is fained by the left it's it's just utter hypocrisy you know and if when you when we I'll play this after the news at the bottom of the half hour you know how the left never even criticized violence over the summer and denied what our own eyes showed us or some of the unhinged rhetoric of their supporters the biggest names of their supporters against this president not a word not a peep out of them celebrities calling for violence against the president Madonna Johnny Depp Kathy Griffin Robert DeNiro you know you know when they're down we kick him said Eric Holder or you know if Maxine Waters get in their faces I didn't see any outrage by the media mob I didn't see it outraged by the Democratic Party either on any of this I have a timeline we're gonna do tonight on hand and I'm gonna play some of it next on the other side of this and the media mob saying you know wanting to impeach Trump from day one they were calling for it and you know basket of deplorables and you know anchors calling Trump supporters drug addicts and and other anchors you know they'd smack their mothers in the face of Trump Trump told them to and 50 million jerks really suck as human beings and you know we uh smelly Walmart shoppers and we eat it all of garden good grief and the double standard is breathtaking you know Biden and Harris themselves you know defending some of the most radical uh acts by radical groups over the summer and you know the double standard of what it is that they have said and done it is spectacularly breathtaking the hypocrisy and it just wreaks I don't see anybody really willing to take a hard honest look at it we will do their job as usual we'll continue all right 25 to the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of this extra amigans of you know I'm just I'm just pointing out what is just such obvious extreme breathtaking hypocrisy you know we we've got all of the celebrities that love the Democratic Party and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the newly elected off-sulf and Warnock etc etc am I the only one that remembers the call from violence against president Trump Madonna Johnny Depp Kathy Griffin holding the severed head Robert De Narrow wanting to punch in the face you know Donald Trump Joe Biden wanted to you know take him in the back of the schoolyard or wherever the hell he is you know we wanted to take him to have a as fight he's so tough and you know this is there legacy this is these are the things that they have supported over time let me just play some of the highlights yes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House one's last time an actor assassinated a president but dare you say the things he does of course I want to punch him in a face right you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gasoline station you get out and you can't go they go low we kick I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all of the country maybe there will be I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity they'll turn them up press always ask me don't I wish I were debating him no I wish we're in high school I could take him behind the gym that's what I was imagine for any one second any prominent conservative or any elected republican ever saying any one of those individual things what do you think the reaction would be that's just part a tiny part of their hypocrisy here you know listen to the media and Antifa literally defending Antifa and I could go long I'll give you the short version what are they really I know their name is anti-fascists today only go after fasciest or they go after anybody say in the global economic community they don't like no they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the Trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo-fascism that we see a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is on legitimate response to white supremacy neo-Nazi violence it says it right in the name Antifa anti-fascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organization is perfect there was some violence no organization is perfect Antifa yeah they're not perfect you know I've never forget I mean we've been showing it the last two nights on TV got an MS DNC reporter covering you know the mayhem and the rioting and the looting and the arson that took place over the summer literally right behind a live shot this fires everywhere mostly peaceful mostly yeah mostly peaceful or the the still shot we have of this fake news CNN reporter you know behind up just nothing but flames everywhere but mostly peaceful I mean it's insane you got the media got Democrats all they did is downplay the violence and even denied it on a level that is like huh you think our own eyes to see us they don't listen this is a question that's been done by a commissioner of the city council not a mob in the middle of the night from the department what they do this violence across the whole country he does about the history that that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's been spread only in Washington DC about the anti-fascists yes they're not going to stop before election day november and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not going to let up and they should not this is not generally speaking on rolly but fires have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country a restructure yeah well they're going to do what they're going to do Pelosi said there's the idea that this violence that's a myth come on that's not true it's a myth you know Kamala Harris you know protests are not going to stop and should not and then goes on everyone be aware and take note of that huh well the very thing that they're just they're fainting their outrage that they're saying that not all day Trump did it I'm going to show all of this tonight on Hannity because it's it's it's eye opening you know you you look at the hatred the contempt for the president or you know for his supporters you know pasket of deplorables drug addicts um well molly walmart shoppers olive garden eaters now I mean it just never ends it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their the holiday and that they're staying at and the garden mariotte and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem this is seeing it the garden mariotte oh let me correct the right it's a courtyard you know it's actually pretty funny to make courtyard mariotte and it's the Hilton garden let's not milk milk let's not mix up our hotels here um or holiday and or olive garden you know olive garden has the best salads I love their salad I love their garlic breadsticks I love their desserts you know little they kind of like don't let you put on you can dip them in like chocolate or caramel whatever you prefer pasta dishes and they got everything that is good as christian tonies but I mean it's just a great place um especially when i was on the road a lot you know just like I love waffle house I can't pass ask anybody on my team if I can pass a waffle house or an in and out burger or a cracker barrel I can't do this skinny if you eat all this food I'm not skinny that's the problem I mean and I put on you know a covid 10 at least I got mortaring so much food now because I love my friends in the restaurant business trying to support them um anyway but you know then then then yesterday you got biden and Harris both you know climbing a double standard by cops in the US it's it's I don't even know exactly what they're referring to I mean yeah you've got this video of this former you know high ranking four tours of duty arms forces patriot veteran shot as you don't arms now I granted I didn't think anybody should have gone in the capital didn't deserve to get killed over it and you know so it's selective moral outrage as anyone forgotten Kamala Harris a massive supporter of the la defund the police movement you know supporting the bell raising money bell funds in the wake of the Minneapolis riots and biden staffers also supporting this idiotic bell fund this all happened what do I always say feign selective moral outrage double standard you know it was um it's it's just painful we really have a truth deficit in this country the likes of which we've never had before and and it's it's beyond troubling journalism I declare dead in 2007 and 8 it's probably the one example where I can almost speak with a broad brush and I don't like speaking with broad brushes hence the 99% in the FBI the 99% intelligence community you know but if you look at the wage Donald Trump and his supporters you know we can pull up my favorite cut of all was how they mocked and laughed and ridiculed the idea that Donald Trump would run and then he won and they never stopped attacking this man every single hour of every single day you know one of the challenges the mob is gonna now face all right they'll have their what 120 days of Biden and oh there's you're gonna get a lot of this so refreshing it's not gonna be long before it goes super viral miss me yet hashtag trump 20 24 trust me and then all of a sudden I realize wow joe is a lot slower than we thought maybe hannity and some conservatives were not wrong in their criticism that he lost his fastball if he ever had one they looks weak and frail we don't get to see him very often another is what he does his press conference is now he pulls out his notes and he likes flips to every section starts reading from the section he probably forgot um what are you gonna do if he forgets what job he has what day the week it is look I'll do what he's unable to do I'll lead to effective strategy to mobilize true in an ass ever depressor isolated plenty's China I know how dare Hannity bring these things up just say in my humble observation um time will tell put the the stated policies are outright scary for the country and you know and and that's why for a lot of you that just want to say the hell was it you can't there's too much at stake ah I'm gonna retire you know what it doesn't matter if you care about future generations you know what a Reagan say freedom is one generation away from extinction I don't want it to be on our watch this country is too great too many people of you know for the principles that make us great and this is the most radical socialist agenda ever advanced by any major political party it just is so you know we have our challenges we have our differences and you know we're gonna get through all of it we'll get through all of it together and you know they're always they're always bumps in the road and I know you know it's funny because I've I've talked to a lot of people that were actually at the rally and they said they've actually declared to me some they said yeah my soul was happening I knew that would be trespassing I'm not going near that well that's the 99% you know when you look at the left do I think to I think the the leaders of the left the Biden's Kamala Harris's and and everybody in Washington Pelosi and Navler's they should have condemned the violence and the arson and the looting and the taking over city blocks and police stations and we shouldn't have been told this is you know the summer of love and a chopchas autonomous zone that can't happen either in America when they're pulling down American statues you want to change them all right go through the legal process try and do it that's the way things work in this country the same with those that enter the Capitol apparently some now reports that Nancy Pelosi's laptop may have been stolen another Democrat Jeff Merkley said rioters stole a laptop from his ransacked office and we don't need to see this in this country we can prevent it the biggest questions I think we need to answer this how come we were not they were not prepared for this knowing so many people were in town and knowing that they were marching from the monument straight on over to the Capitol anyone been to media pay attention that the president was condemning it at the time was telling people to leave and be peaceful yes they didn't want to pay attention to that anyway so you know let's impeach the president that's what we're gonna do it was very interesting the comments that Nikki Haley gave um rana McDaniel's been the national republican republican national committee dinner in florida and she said about the president I didn't always choose the right words and I told them so with the time when these moments came up um she didn't like the rally but she pointed out that that i'm one who believes our country made truly extraordinary gains in the last four years and up and then Haley's right Nikki Haley because conservatism works that's the thing you know nobody looks at the extraordinary success that this president has had nobody nobody looks that no president in history has ever had to go through as much as this guy's gone through the media just ignoring you know calls for violence against the president they never cared you know this ideas molly walmart marchoppers and olive guard eaters and i mean it's very revealing in terms of what they think of we the people for those we the people people are the ones that make America great people that get up every day and they go to their job and they provide goods and services for other and they obey laws pay taxes you know i'm pretty much just want to just leave us alone with the rest of our lives let it raise their kids their good examples nobody's perfect but the good examples then you have a media that defended antifa and a media that defended the violence this summer now they're all lecturing everybody about how they really feel well be consistent we're consistent on this program they've anything but consistent we don't we care about Russian interference not Hilary's dossier care about quid pro clothes yeah not Joe's quid pro quail with Ukraine we care about Russian interference we didn't care about the dossier we don't care premeditated fraud on the five-sighort spying on a president we don't care about hunter the money wire transfers from an oligarch in Russia or Kazakhstan or Chinese national shopping spree we don't care about any of it is but if it was Trump okay about all of it and you know that gets frustrating for people frustrated me i'll tell you that um but you know i'm just going to tell you what mark my words they're going to overreach and the country is not going to like it's a center-right country and then we'll have an opportunity to get back in power in the meantime you try and you know fight for the values make people aware of everything that we don't agree with peacefully something they should have called for in the last four years and they didn't right hour to Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program i mean censorship here there and everywhere it's amazing isn't it the short-term memory we don't even have to go back a full year and you got Democrats you got the media mob you know there the way that they have defended and not spoken out against you know violence in the streets of major cities and americans pretty unbelievable i we even have specific instances of them you know defending antifa or antifa if you prefer let me let me play that one first they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo fascism that we see and they've taken a principal stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists wherever they may show up it says it right in the name antifa antifascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's you know no organizations perfect there was some violence i think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response to white supremacist neo-Nazi violence the problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment the radiation is tough treatment but it is meant to remove the cancer there's a group of antifascists called the black block which do tend to get violent their idea is look non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this but they wouldn't have been there they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been for the fact that white supremacists neo-Nazis were out scaring the living day-lout out of most of the people in that town sogishness is thogishness whatever it comes from politically and we should be the first to call it out i disagree now why would they defend antifa how about if we all forgotten the last four years of we've forgotten the rhetoric against Donald Trump and violent rhetoric of the left because i might it's pretty fresh in my mind listen yes i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house i'm the last time an actor assassinated a president but dare you say that things he does of course i want to punch him in a face right you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up they go low we kick right i just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all of the country maybe they will be i'll put mr. Burgess up against uh Sean Hannity they'll turn them up press always ask me don't i wish i were debating him no i wish you're in high school i could take him behind the gym that's what i wish wow i guess i guess they forgot to get outraged over those comments and then of course you got the media the mob well let's downplay the 2020 uh writing that went on and alluding in the burning that took place we're just kind of look downplay it a little bit but boy you wouldn't think uh from this week and they're fained selective moral outrage and double standard uh that these are even the same people from just a few months ago listen to the media democrats the mob he respect that being done by a commission or should he counsel not a mob in the middle of the night from the middle of the department? he'll do what they do this by the time it's across the whole country he disavowed the way through tifa that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's that's being spread only in what should be about the anti-f not gonna stop before election day november and they're not gonna stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this is they're not gonna let up and they should not this is the most lip protest it is not it is not generally speaking on rolli but flyers have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country all right joining us now we are joined by Joe Concha Fox News contributor opinion columnist for the Hill the great mark Simone host of the morning show our affiliate in New York W O R thank you both for being with us you know mark you do it every day I do it every day Joe does it every day you know you point out this this rampant hypocrisy I mean it's not that long ago this this all happened in the last four years a lot of it happened last year alone not even a full year ago well that's the problem in your show too consistent you gotta be like these guys it's like a ping pong that you it's over there now he's over there now he's over there I don't know what I was watching that Chris Cuomo clip from a while back when he said why does the protest have to be peaceful and he was defending the lawlessness and the craziness but he we had a 126 protest the first 125 which were far more violent are some looting smashing destroying statues monuments tens of thousands of businesses destroyed they never said a word you saw Jimmy Fallon with that the fearful speech about from mob to get out of control he was crying when it happened in his own city outside his own a window for months he never said a word so I guess only the consistent about his total inconsistency yeah the total the only thing consistent is the inconsistency which is which is forever true you know Joe Concha you you been on radio and TV with me a lot over the last four years and you know we've talked at length we we expose that they they pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory they lied to this country for three long years they have made excuses for even violent behavior and and showed no condemnation of violent rhetoric of the hard left or Hollywood or even within their own party you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either president trump mike pence or jeff sessions who would it be does one of us have to come out alive yes I'm angry yes I am outraged yes I have thought and not a lot about blowing up the white house what was the last time an actor is sesame to the president I life really did you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up Donald trump is a guy who none whatsoever and now I want to these things supposed to so supposedly we're supposed to believe this matters to them as they feign their new selective moral outrage you ever see naked gun the great Leslie Nielsen he's the detective Frank driven your aging yourself mr. Concher you're aging yourself the week 1988 that wasn't too long ago okay Reagan was president good point so he accidentally uh... set fire to a fireworks warehouse and suddenly you just start to see all these explosions behind him in a crowd starts to form and he says nothing to see here please disperse that's the alley velshi on msnbc saying these are mostly peaceful protests and behind him it looks like it is fires burning the die hard yeah exactly it's a frickin inferno right and then even CNN has kyron's you know mostly peaceful protests continue and again you see fire and chaos behind these people show you how are people not like flabbergasted by this what's the thing i mean this was the uh... in terms of bias it was literally right in front of you on your TV screen and you're being told otherwise by the reporter so the lie is right there in front of you and all one up uh... the great marks of own on uh... chris quomo he wants compared had the audacity to compare and keep up to the allied troops storming normally day day because you know the fighting fascism now i'm pretty sure it's not the same thing that the bottom line is that we're letting the extremes control the narrative at this point and then mark pen who worked for uh... helary clinton and bill clinton he was a chief strategist he doesn't great polling and he found that seventy six percent of the country either describe themselves as moderate or conservatives were right of center country yet if you watch our media you would think we're completely liberal on everything but again it's that disconnect and it's making excuses for black lives matter and in tifa during the summer and then being rightly outraged of what we saw the capital but without that key word and mark used to be for consistency then no one trust the messenger anymore how do they mark some on just to sort of like well you know just just sort of forget conveniently everything that they've done and said and all that they've supported over the last four years and and and they they act as though they didn't even say any of these things or tell these lies or spread these conspiracy theories or support the attacks against Donald Trump most of which came from them uh... over this extended period of time there's just about a narrative of the long you know they come up with the narrative you don't have to execute it you don't have to do it just give out the narrative and act like it happened and not not only do they not condemn any of these rioters before but you remember the Harris campaign the Biden campaign people were contributing to the bail funds that were the right to manicute the domestic violence and Kamala Harris was promoting that bail fund to get it to them uh... Portland is still going on the anarchy in Portland continues and yesterday protesters found the mayor in the cafe and hit him in the face I haven't heard anybody mentioned it's totally inconsistency you know it's like Joe Biden calling for unity while uh... while they're trying to prosecute the president while they try to put him in a mental institution while they consume arrest them this is this is a call for unity it's just keep the narrative you don't have to do it let me remind everybody what Kamala Harris had to say protests are not going to stop this is during the summer she said all of this she said it on a Colbert show uh... they're not going to stop and they shouldn't stop listen to this they're not gonna stop and that's there this is a moment I'm telling you they're not going to stop and and everyone be wear because they're not gonna stop it is there not going to stop before election day in novembre and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this is not they're not to let up and they should not and we should not they're not gonna let up these should not and will not wow I mean I mean how do we characterize those comments or the fact that she was helping the raise money for those that were arrested in many apples to her in those riots right the bail fund and since she almost took no questions leading up to election day no one ever asked her about that particular bail fund or about the fact that she sowed so much doubt in the vaccine saying that oh well if this comes out in 2020 I'm not gonna take it if Donald Trump says the take it as if Donald Trump's in a lab making it somewhere you know it she's made so many reckless statements already and the fact that Joe Biden yesterday with that speech Mr. Unity right supposed to bring the country together says that well it black lives matter were involved in the capital siege well it would have been a lot different in terms of police using guns a lot more it's like what are you doing this has nothing to do with race and yet he went through this whole all these horrible things that he says Donald Trump did bad leave it last four years I can't wait until say February or March when Biden actually have to answer for Biden and his administration and his ideas and his proposals he promised that Democrats took back the Senate that the $2,000 checks would go out immediately and you already got Joe Manchin saying yeah I'm not signing on to that so suddenly he's gonna run into a lot of problems despite having the house in the Senate and the Oval Office and it's gonna be a civil war within the Democratic Party because progressives and guys like Manchin are gonna see eye to eye and it's gonna be quite entertaining to watch until the GOP takes back the House in 2022 yeah I'm not exactly sure how much ability he's truly gonna have to stand up to the hard left in his party because they're the ones that helped elect this guy if you want to believe that you know this guy got 80 million votes I have a hard time believing that number I don't see on that front marks a moan Joe Biden in any way is gonna do anything but what the AOCs and the squad and and the Bernie Sanders are gonna insist that he do and I think it's gonna be as bad as they as they telegraphed her in the campaign I don't know you know Democrats those crazy Democrats may be in for a shock with old swamp Joe you notice the stock market once they want everything on Monday Tuesday the stock market starts soaring now I hear that's because this administration the Biden administration has contacted everybody in banking finance Wall Street to let them know everything's gonna be okay for them that they'll be taken care of there'll be some corporate tax but corporations don't pay the tax anyway they just pass it along so there'll be a couple of little tiny symbolic crazy left-wing things just to keep you other said happy but it's gonna be swamp businesses usual Wall Street banking big tech big corporations will be taken care of again it's a great observation although Bloomberg had an article out today that said get ready because taxes are gonna be raised dramatically on quote the wealthy you know top 10% pay 70 whatever percent of the tax money in this country top you know top 10% pay like 80% so they're already paying the money all right quick break right back we'll come back more with Mark Simone and Joe Concha on the other side on this Friday Hannity tonight we're gonna remind everybody of the left wing rhetoric and things that they have said and done the last four years it's fresh in my memory it's nine eastern on Fox quick break right back more with them on the other side we as we continue I 25 to the top of the hour toll free it's 800 941 Sean you want to be a part of this extra amigantah I don't know what it is I mean I spent a lot of time in my life had like a courtyard maria or Hilton garden more time than I would prefer because you go on the road my kids are you know into athletics we used to travel quite a bit and when they were younger and you know it was a big deal of one of the first things I always checked all right is you know what are the good restaurants in town and whenever there was an olive card I'm like all right great I love the olive card unlimited salad unlimited you know amounts of garlic delicious breadsticks sometimes unlimited pasta specials you know in some cases I remember just starving myself all day because I'm going to olive garden tonight and then for dessert they have like these hot it's sort of like donut things and you give it chocolate or caramel and you put it on top I mean it is with powdered sugar it's just amazing loved it loved all of it well apparently it is not particularly up to speed when it comes to a fake new CNN anchor former fander built I guess current fander built himself Anderson Cooper is what he had to say about it it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their holiday in that they're staying at in the garden mario and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in Washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem you're going to go back to the olive garden or the holiday in or the you know he doesn't even know the names of the hotels I'm like wow not sure where does he do is fine dining no boo I mean most Americans don't dine there I've never been there I don't know any play I know like two places in New York City where I go and that's it unbelievable and I have my steady restaurants here in Long Island and by the way one is just like the olive garden except better I mean just a little bit better I like the olive card you go over to fake news msd and see and they're talking about you know trumps ride or die base is a bunch of people with Nazi t-shirts so we've gone from olive guard eating olive garden eating holiday in courtyard mario at Hilton Gardens people smelly Walmart shoppers here at demable deplorables people that cling to god our guns our Bibles and our religion that are angry and now I guess now we're a bunch of ride or die people that wear Nazi t-shirts according to msd and see he has the voters we saw who the president's rider die base is Peter it was a bunch of people wearing Nazi t-shirts homemade for pelts and horns that is not the Republican party so as far as the president's kingmaker status have we just realized it was maybe all just a marketing scheme because think about it on his watch yes he wanted to 2016 but his party lost the house they lost the White House they lost the Senate and think about his big reveal on Wednesday we saw who his rider die base are a bunch of Nazis and you just never ends anyway we continue our analysis Joe Kancha Fox News contributor he writes on the media opinion calmness for the hill marks Simone host of the morning show on w or r I will say this about marks Simone he's probably been all those fancy restaurants because he pretty much mcs every event that takes place in New York City is that connected it is it is part of his DNA is not a single person that doesn't know who marks Simone is in New York City but I'm not sure marks Simone that you'd dine at all these places on a regular basis maybe you do I'm kind of pretty sure I'm just guessing here that you you've been to all of garden and I'm betting you're probably like it actually it was terrible when the innocent Cooper said that because it got me thinking about the olive garden it's taken every out the strength let the go there because I don't want to start with those breadsticks they got the best columnari yeah shrimp dishes and I don't know who does the photographs on the menu but that guy's the greatest photographer in the world I want them to do by the way is the one in Times Square still open yeah good good curbside delivery take out and of course they're all over and the great shopping malls and there's a couple of long island and I love that place you know when Anderson Cooper said that about low-lives that would go to the mario the Hilton garden or the the olive garden he didn't realize everybody in the room all all the crew all the union guys what they love these places he was insulting them right to their face I don't know I've been on MSM BC whenever you're done after the host yells at you as you walk out everybody on the crew all the union guys all the workers whispering your ear I agree with you I don't think they realize how hated they are but their own crews over there no I think that by the way there's certain truth to that too I've by the way I've had people that hate every word I say when I work by the way but that's fine I don't know you know Joe I'll be honest and and this is an honest feeling so you know my kids would be in you know whatever city state small town we happen to be and and you know I can't help it I'm older and I take you know great delight in the little pleasure of life of eating and you know I'd get to the town get to where my courtyard mario there's or Hilton garden get settled in whatever we had to do we do whatever practice whatever was going on that day but one of the first things I would do is I would I would check out in google what restaurants are in town and I mean this with all my heart and if all of garden popped up boom we're going to the olive garden that was it or outback state cows another plan to be like yes touchdown whatever I go to all of garden the first thing I say to the waitress after I'm done with my meal which is mainly breadsticks is my compliments to the microwave I mean they do great microwave there no question but I look I see it and I don't know if you knew this it's what the acronym stands for it's the condescending news network and it's why so many people dislike the network on a personal level because it's hard to find too many folks there that don't speak down to people you know they're the smartest people in the room don't you know and they're going to tell you exactly how they feel about things as Anderson Cooper did remember he's the same guy and he's called an anchor by the way which is hilarious just own it you're an opinion host and he called the president no beast turtle just a month ago you know he's the funniest guy in the room so when he speaks like this to Marx point I guess the plan is for CNN to alienate completely already have I suppose they probably don't even care anymore half the country when you say those things and again they keep claiming to be the objective down the middle network and clearly it's almost impossible to tell the difference between MSNBC CNN and media matters as it pertains to the media team there so look that that's what they have and when the Donald Trump is gone in two weeks and Joe Biden comes in and they settle in it is going to be a ratings crash like we haven't seen since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of a number being in one place and going down to another because once you lose your central character and that's all Donald Trump has been on that network for five years they got nothing and they can't go back to being in the Bernard Shaw Gulf Wars the end of because they got people like Anderson Cooper there to alienate their audience yeah but let me tell you where it's also going to go you're right I mean they'll get their first hundred days and and I can predict the coverage marks on what it's going to be oh how great it is to have somebody with the integrity of the great Joe Biden of course like during zero experience Hunter ignoring the quid pro quo ignoring the Biden foreign family syndicate in China and Russia and Kazakhstan and Ukrainian oligarchs and Chinese national shopping sprees and the deal with the bank in China we're going to ignore all of that's going to be a relief after a hard days of all of this relief and they'll probably pledge we're not going to cover Donald Trump anymore we're going to censor him just like big media big tech and then all of a sudden their ratings chose right at some point hundred days maybe 120 days I can't give the exact date they're going to start tanking and then they're going to realize that their daily dose of feigned outrage against Donald Trump and their hatred of this man fueled you know their entire network for all this time and I'm just guessing they're really going to miss this guy yeah the big question is what will they do when there's a tremendous loss in ratings and then revenue and they got to do something that executives are going to get the fired will they turn on Biden will they start to go after hunter to save themselves I don't I don't know or will they keep up the the plan they're going to go back they're going to pledge to stay away from all covering Trump then they're going to be forced to cover up because they're going to need it's like it's like a drug to them now I mean that was going to be major withdrawal symptoms in all of them you know and at the media should be outraged about Facebook and Twitter censoring Donald Trump you know what in Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone that was the most important invention he changed well he mentioned to be said only people I agree with politically can use it if I don't agree with you I'm not giving you a phone and you can't talk kind of imagine a phone company did that why why do we allow this face the commander in chief of the military is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States he's not allowed to speak on Facebook anymore how does this allow this it's insane how could the media just sit back I don't care who and allow some like that to happen in America here's how I see that evolving Joe Consha all right so they're going to silence the president on on social media big tech companies Twitter Facebook etc which by the way makes the case to eliminate their their liability protection is provided by section 230 the silencing the president okay and the silencing prominent conservatives and any conservative for that matter free speech is out the window it's not free in in America then it's the assignment is used to say no to Josh Hawley's book on this very topic and then they're going to go back to their you know tried and true efforts which is to silence every conservative voice talk radio people like me the few conservatives that we have on the Fox News channel just silence those guys and get rid of those guys because that's all they've been trying to do now for years pretty much throughout my entire career if we're going to be blunt and that's the thing right it is slippery slope when you say all right we're going to ban this guy from speaking on our platform whether it's Twitter whether it's Facebook snapchat whatever then what do you do with say the leader of Iran who tweets out often that Israel should be wiped off the map or Chinese government officials that say that coronavirus was actually invented by the US army and now being weaponized by the right is any of them ever been censored I don't recall no that's the thing right so Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey from Twitter they can say well this doesn't meet our standards well if that's the case if we're talking about world leaders and government officials then you got to take those down just like Maxine Waters when she said inciting violence inciting riots that if you see anybody from the Trump cabinet or administration you get up in their face all right that is a call to physically go after people and we saw time and again it happened again with Lindsey Graham just today he was in an airport and he started to get harassed by god knows who so yeah when you start calling on people to get in the faces of government officials because you disagree with him because god but you forbid if we actually disagree with some civility anymore this is the result of Maxine Waters her account is just fine so unless you're consistent with this don't bother trying it at all because it may look like it might have some bias and some activism against one party of course they do that's all they contributed to was the Biden campaign if you think that section 230 is suddenly going to go away because Biden gets then forget it because the check is going to become due from all those donations and all those people from Silicon Valley that are now in the Biden administration Sean and look at look at Pelosi today marks them on you know on he left to know you don't have to but if you hear her today if you if somehow you know maybe you accidentally tuned into the show or TV tonight you might hear something but unhinged as she is and and needing her her radical base as much as she does now more than ever because of the tight margin in the house but to move to neutralize America's nuclear strike force okay Russia's watching this the Iranian moles are watching this China's watching this every hostile regime and actor on the world stage is watching this and and then they see Joe coming in and if they see Joe the way I and many other people see him is weak and frail and seemingly compromised cognitively um what are they thinking about all of this I would think that from their strategic geopolitical standpoint they're probably liking what they perceive as a weak in America hey it's just crazy and you see these cabinet members leaving early and I have heard off the record from some people uh no names but they're leaving early because they don't want to get in the middle of whatever shoomer and Pelosi are plotting with some crazy 25th amendment thing they don't want to be there for any of that they don't know what these people are going to try to pull next the nuclear codes are fine that this is the most anti war president we have ever had he's the first president that didn't send a single troop anywhere uh we've got nothing to worry about there who's been more pro war than Joe Biden from uh a rack to whatever but uh it it's uh a weak and a couple of days just calm down if you're Pelosi and Schumer he's leaving don't be sore winners just let it go yeah okay that's not that's not possible anyway um anyway I'm gonna let you guys go thank you both for being with us mark some own W.O.R. New York and uh Joe Concha uh we appreciate both of you being well as we're gonna do a great history lesson reminder tonight on Hannity because those so saying to Monius and self righteous the damage that they've done um is real and they just think that they're so superior and meanwhile ignoring the 99% of good people that went to Washington this week and we've got to get the other people those that those that you know rated the capital that there's gonna be justice maybe we can even get justice for the deep state actors too while you know I'm watching and watching and I'm like wow it's it almost takes your breath away not only all the things we discussed the last hour about what they would like to have happen and that is that Donald Trump never speak again and they forget the things that they have said that they have done for the last four years as if it's it never occurred I mean it's kind of breathtaking gonna be very blunt and to be very honest with you but if you think of all of these big tech companies now have decided what you can and cannot read it's it's a form of censorship and I remember the president saying get rid of section 230 which would which would then take away the immunity for liability that companies like Twitter Facebook etc have because then did not content providers any longer but they literally at that point become editors just like newspapers newspapers and TV stations and news networks they don't have the same liability protection as Twitter and Facebook and all these other groups and anyway it's it's kind of amazing to watch all of that happen then of course we're gonna cancel Josh Hawley's book just cancel it which is about this very topic it just so happens and look this is something that as a conservative on radio and TV and let me let me stop here and promise all of you I'm not changing I am who I am and I'm not changing and but I can tell you the things that we deal with behind the scenes and have for many many many many years is nothing short of an effort to silence to get fired to remove advertisers and boycotts just because they don't like a conservative point of view Julie Kelly political commentator seen you contributed to american greatness author of disloyal opposition and kreg marshal special counsel to the american center for long justice guys what do you think here that what we are shot we are part of the apocalyptic cancel culture movement and unfortunately when you've got these mega monolithic monopolistic uh... silicon ballad giant like facebook google amazon twitter apple that control information they've joined uh... partnership with the mainstream media and now capital hill is tilting only in one direction as a result of an election this is a threat to the republic no questions asked crag your answer you just exactly right here what you're what you're pointing out of something you know you as an expert in the law you deal with these platforms all the time you deal with every day let me ask you there was a lawyer is there is there any other recourse that people can take in other words you finding that people are coming to you that are being silenced and suppressed and demonetized in this case yeah in fact uh... this is comprising the majority of work that i'm doing both for the american center for long justice and american principles project both on on internet free speech issues and it's not just crag partial uh... opining about this more and more folks on capital hill on both sides of the aisle are saying this is a gigantic problem and a threat because they are monopolies by the way section two thirty pass by congress in nineteen ninety six before they understood that these companies would become monopolies and then start controlling not only information in opinions but tilting elections as a result um... uh... this has to be changed and i think it will be interestingly regardless of the election this is a bipartisan issue on capital hill because law makers of both sides are worried about it by the way this is inside information i want to share and next week a block buster bombshell bill is going to be introduced in the house uh... representatives by representative greg stuby called the case it act as in you can bring a case against them if this bill passes right now you can't they have immunity from law suits if this bill passes silicon valley will have shockwaves because they will once and for all be responsible in courts of law to those of us who are centered or suppressed for viewpoint purposes you know grab your brain about so many so many good points julie i want to bring you in here i know you wrote the book disloyal opposition how the never trump right tried and failed to take down the president when when we see a social media platform you know the names of the mall literally silencing like twitter like facebook a president of the united states is you know in the case of twitter's twitter handle as a means of communicating with the american people just like you couldn't even print the new york post story about the biden syndicate and and hunters laptop you know what can you say about that well and can we talk about this before i've written about this the last few months a bigger problem is that this is straight up election interference from these big tech democratic party so the time bally ole garks we saw this with their platform starting in sptember when they started to roll out all of these policies related to tagging or flagging or banning post the question uh male and dalak and eppson key ballot so they have really contributed how could you do it in calculator chan hundreds of billions of doctors maybe in free illegal by the way in kim kampeen donations to the democrat party to julbyton and so be just be this as a continuance i think what happened is you know the democrats are aware that so many republicans and about thirty seven percent of independent you this election it's illegitimate they think that julbyton was uh not fairly elected because of all of the and legalities related to male and an eppson key ballot so that's what they're trying to shut down now they're gaslighting and exlating the events on wednesday to do that the publicans and never chompers of course are going along and so they are creating a really dangerous uh situation that they really started several months ago well we look at how easy it's been though to silence voices that confront our contradict their the narrative if you will they just completely shut us down i mean that that's that's the big problem off my friend dambon jino yesterday was talking about how his twitter was completely shut down and now by the way he's on parlor exclusively by the way we are on parlor as well but then you add to that google you add to that apple and they're saying they aren't even gonna support that platform so now they want to take down a platform because it's completely allows them to do what they're doing and you know how how do we get around this i don't know how we get around that i mean parlor is is the good platform it's sort of new obviously all of us are over there right now but it's these bullying totalitarian tactics that they're using and look they have the biggest voices behind them we saw what Michelle Obama released yesterday begging social media platforms to uh ban a Donald Trump voice we see mark zuckerberg in his statement hilarious statement about we can't undermine the peaceful transfer of power hello that hasn't even happened in the past five years you know where with Facebook uh deep platforming people and banning content about the imaginary Russian collusion hoax i mean we could go on and on and so you have these really powerful people behind that fueling it um you know some people were reading today trouble that chon could be and i mean they could refuse to allow people to you know go to his hotel or register to stay at his hotel all with his businesses how they could try to deep platform those as well so it's it's really scary territory Craig i have a question about another server you know having another platform in other words what does that mean what are the legal implications if you will for a google or an apple if they say no we're not going to do this you know in other words is there any recourse they're private companies but at this point they're serving on a global scale with a massive reach they're allowed to what silence anybody they just don't like is there something in the law that would prohibit them from from doing this so they can they just get away with that well let's take a look first of all a keen off of what julie had talked about in terms of uh in kind contributions to the democratic party through their efforts to support only uh excuse these support only democrats and to suppress uh only conservatism republicans i've filed a complaint with the federal elections commission over this last election on behalf of american principal's project whose advertisements were stifled by facebook uh as a result of their political bent uh and we showed with data in our complaint the fact that the election in the state of michigan as an example for or against prompt or biden as well as the democratic senator but likely would have changed had these advertisements been allowed to be aired over their platform that's the election impact now problem the federal election commission and all other federal agencies are now going to be under control of the biden administration there's a problem there section two thirty as i mentioned uh gives them almost completely reliability unless uh uh law like the case at act by uh representative stubie gets passed there's gonna be a real cat fight in both houses on that uh but there is also bipartisan support something has to be done uh in terms of parlor i'm on their uh a lot of us are on there it will take probably a year or two or more for them to gain the traction they need to have the influence coming anywhere near facebook uh which has a a global scale in terms of its support now there are anti-trust lawsuits filed by the department of justice still pending but again again against facebook and twitter and and google and others but we now have a biden administration that's going to be controlling the department of justice who is investigating and prosecuting so it's all gets down to campaign uh integrity that is uh do we have an election system now that gives us a real honest uh confidence in the fact that when we go into a voting booth we put the people we want in the majority will rule we don't have that confidence so i think shows like uh Sean hand it easy and others the alternate media needs to fight for its existence because that's the only place people are going to get the truth and the real facts so we talk about section 230 now Craig you you're incredibly versed on on this you wrote a piece about it about the bill in particular as a matter of fact but people are kind of misunderstanding what it can do and what it should do can you kind of delve into that a bit the section 230 was passed as part of the communications decency act which was trying to clean up the internet because in nineteen ninety six when it was passed people in congress saw the potential for a lot of scandalous and harmful things particularly for families and children going on in the internet but they also wanted to stimulate uh instead of eyes these new startup companies in silicon valley so that we would grow the internet they want to do both things so what they did it said look we're going to give illegal immunity to these uh internet what we call platforms they're not newspapers they didn't come into the internet business in order to be content providers we you and i and julie and Sean hand ity were the editors in chief of our own content that simply on their publishing or dissemination platform it's really the twenty first and twenty a century version of the printing press uh... they simply disseminate this and they use our data of course which has value to them and in return uh... we get the opportunity to have our content distributed well it doesn't work that way when they decide from time to time to be editors in chief and they know your content we don't like and we're going to strike it down their private businesses so the first amendment technically does not apply uh... to protect our right of free speech and that's going to change again if if some of these bills get passed and they're of up really a flotilla of them right floating around capital right now one is great stuby's uh... representative from florida there are many others uh... if these get passed then suddenly these monopolies will have some responsibility in courts of law for you and me advocacy organization businesses will be able to sue them for the first time since nineteen ninety six and actually prevail now they're worth billions of trillions of dollars but you get enough of these losses particularly clair faction losses and i think we could bring them to heal right quick break welcome back more with uh... julie kelly and kreg parcell on the other side later on will get to your calls and much more and so julie kreg we have about a minute left uh... welcome back by the way uh... now so stuby's bill the republican at a florida he's taking a good look at at section two thirty immunity and he's looked at the new york post for example before the election and and some of their behavior in the shutting down a kelly mac and a need and how they censored on you crane and you know you've written a ton on this what what is the platform speech in other words uh... on which you think this needs to happen so in other words so that the section two thirty is not manipulated i would defer to kreg and so happy here is optimism about it because i'm left optimistic all i will say is uh... as we finish up here what another last opportunity this was to bring the reforms to big tax that were needed the republicans when they have the house and senate but certain when they had the senate made a lot of noise about one to two thirty was another last opportunity when they had control so i hope what that what kreg is saying i i i i sure that he's right at great studios great congressmen uh... hopefully they can find bipartisan work there uh... because something has to change i quick last thought what what do you think if all conservatives just decided to have a texas like exit texas in other words you know another words people just run over to parlor and rumbull and just say see it to the rest of these people well uh... you know a lot of us are tempted to do a lot of us have changed over uh... to parlob but continue to use of facebook and twitter and we do that uh... through gridded to get the biggest platform for our information in the opinions to get out if we don't continue to do both things if we just picked the new start-ups that better like uh... parlor and others are doing great work but a very small we are going to eventually uh... silence our self out of the marketplace of debate and i don't think that's a good thing right julie kelly thank you kreg partial thank you can thank you enough for going to uh... take our dollars in our movement to other platforms i mean i'm i'm starting it by the way when you go on twitter just always hashtag parlor that's a smooth transition and you're telling other people where you're going quick break right back top of the hour on this uh... friday you know we're gonna take a little trip down memory lane in the last four years of violent insane lies conspiracy theories calls for violence uh... that the media did not pain outrage at just so everybody could know in the democratic party or they said nothing and and this is this this has been the great hypocrisy that is all things radical left democratic party media mob in sync as one now add big tech to the equation uh... these are insane times we're living in i'll tell you that just nuts jim is in texas jim that's a little sander down there however you sir fine john great showman thanks brother uh... i was well i was called that a question about i don't want to see joe biding become president when he's a criminal they went after dot or a dot on front for almost a year for quid pro quo with your crane yet by and can go on national television a lap about the fact he would that will help a hundred million dollars from the ukraine unless they fired this attorney going after gurus money son i don't know what it was the great on this and it's not just that i mean that they ignored the hillary dirty dossie they ignored the unverifiable dossie a and premeditative fraud on five secort to spy on a presidential candidate in the president uh... the hypocrisy over russia okay that's what hillary but it also is hunter bidens the the wire transfer three and a half million dollars from a russian oligarch the first lady of musca and the same with the ukraine and the same with kazakstan and the same uh... thing happening with china in chinese now i i mean there's no shortage of madness here gym and and you know it's funny because i think with what really almost is not many of us to call this out you do know that right no i knew no that that's what bothers me is that you know they don't call that out they don't allowed them to go and check out the election test of why there was fraud and maybe five states why would they not just be willing both sides of the aisle to check that out to be sure it's legitimate number one but more importantly with with biden it's the law white how can we not have somebody say go arrest this person for quid pro quo since we have his own admission on national television it makes no sense and i'm trying to figure out a way to get that done listen your your your your your your somebody that has a sense of decency honor fairness and you don't have double standards you know like i can them for example violence of summer i can them that this week too i don't want to see this for our country this ways to prevent this this peaceful protesting out that was the ninety nine percent but for them to you know deny think and office started with i think an awful lot about blowing up the white house and it went down i want to punch him in the face i want to take a mind the school yard and and fight Donald trump everyone seems to forget and and they don't do it that's not that they don't know i don't think they want to politics trumps everything no pun intended it's the ends justifies the means and a lot of this effort now this this feigned outrage is just the latest and what has been for the half five years now of an attempt to deal legitimize and and in this case prevent anybody from ever wanting to publicly support Donald trump have you or will you ever have you ever been are you now or have you ever been a Donald trump supporter uh... that's where they're headed but meanwhile they ignore their own you know their own rhetoric their own supporters and the things that they've said into things that they've done i mean that's what i'm putting on tv tonight this you know nobody else will do it i guess i have to but i'll tell you it's uh... a tough times for this country buckle up it's gonna get it's gonna be bumpy i can promise that gym thank you for a good call uh... back to our phones let us say hi to bill is in north carolina what's up bill how are you sir shown a wonderful year great american you too sir thank you i'm one of the uh... seventy four plus million picked off patriots over what's going on in our country i so much want to believe that what our president is telling us is true here's my problem the republicans don't know how to fight and when i see john derum you know he was gonna investigate where where's he been hot we haven't seen high in her hair of the elections coming on we're getting kicked we're down seventy four plus million of us are really ticked off so where john derum better yet city power supposedly has the evidence to prove the algorithms were painted to get by all these votes they have the evidence Rudy Giuliani stood in front of hundreds of thousands of americans right before the president to the stage with an expert they've got the evidence where's the evidence how we ever gonna overcome this chaos this hypocrisy and let humor and policy get away and and Hillary Clinton get away with what they're doing to us if they have the evidence produce it every day that goes by it's too late yesterday look the president said yesterday every single remedy he fought for they've been denied the courts don't want to deal with it you got to understand though and the one court that very bravely did the supreme court in the state of Wisconsin it ended up being a three four decision but the beat down in the descent by the by the chief justice was something you don't see very much from any supreme court and you you got to understand what's a play here didn't they're not seeking truth they don't listen as long as they win they don't care what whether or not laws were violated the constitution was violated you know i don't i don't i think it's hard for reasonable good people to understand well why didn't we uh... you know listen to the state law of michigan in Wisconsin why did we have two standards for signature verification in george a y you know why was the pennsylvania constitution ignored good people you know don't comprehend it because it's so antithetical to who they are and what they believe and you know the answer is now going to be going forward i could tell you right now if we don't fix america's broken busted down election laws and by the way we've had to fix it in recent times the state of florida you know exhibit a but if you put your mind towards it you can fix it so that people have faith confidence believe in the integrity of the election confident in the results that's where we got to go and you know this idea that you know they've gone after this guy with lies and hoaxes and conspiracy theories there's been violent rhetoric and not a word from these very people that that now want to paint with a broad brush you know ninety nine percent of the people at the rally this weekend washington did not go storm the capital they went away we've had people call this program no i saw what was happening i got the hell out of there um back to our phones uh let's say hi to fill is in long island of york what's up fill how are you a sure and how are you good to speak here what's up my fellow long island of how you doing i'm doing good you know i'm making fun of myself too don't worry i don't want to those people in the world brush and i feel horrible you know when we left you know we have to the speeches and we went to the capital you know some people didn't go to the front of the capital some people went on the side where the train station is because it was more convenient and on the backside if you look at the video on the back side there's nobody attacking capital police they're standing on the senate's steps the senate's side i believe it is and nobody's attacking them they're standing there if you look on the the congressional side the congressmates there was people on the staircase there already and nobody was attacking any police and when i went up this there was floor capital police standing by a broken window and a couple of kids came by with megaphones and tried to incite the people and said there's only floor them over there used to take that window and i said to those kids what are you doing you're inciting here and and they just looked at me and walked away naked belong in that crowd and then after that some other people started spraying whatever it was to make our eyes burn and it wasn't the capital please there was people there looking to incite and no matter what nobody when after those police you look at all the footage on the back side of the capital facing the supreme court there was no capital please being attacked there was no vandalism there was no breaking an entry everybody on that side was warfarin had no idea at least i had no idea what was going on the other side and then all of a sudden the big bread store opened it opened from the inside no windows have broken somebody opened that door from the inside and then people were pretty much stampede it in it was almost like Walmart on black Friday morning years ago so for other people to their peacefully protesting and and being maligned as traders and insurgents that's that's very hard to hear because we've been standing up for this country our whole life sibrettians people in their 60s grand parents high stood there with them and there was people that infiltrated that crowd and caused all that problems and they weren't from supporters by no wait how did they come with gas masks they brought note with them how did they know to bring note with them to pouring in their eyes when they got sprayed they were in combat here they weren't from supporters those that was either antifa or somebody that's still in a pot but i witnessed if you go to warmat footage on the backside of the capital no capital please for being attacked there was no vandalism nobody breaking an entry nobody storming windows and i slipped by after those brats said that and i made sure those cops that you get attacked these hurts to be considered something we're not it's gone on over over four years now but you're next and we we we were criminals we were criminals we were protesting peacefully and people came in there and started to send people just look at the footage on the back of the friggin building and they'll see no capital cops who being attacked i would never let that happen that was a marine i was a police i would never let that happen i know that listen listen i i i get it i understand i really more than you you may know it's hard when you're lied about it really is and it and it hurts and then when you get painted with a broad brush and blame for things that other people did you know all throughout our coverage of the deep state and those that abuse power fill and and were corrupt how often uh... if you're a regular listener or viewer of hand any how often that i always go out of my way to point out not the ninety nine percent that a good people not the ninety nine percent in our intelligence community i did it on purpose i had an f-b-i-p in on my lapel and uh... and an intelligence pin on my lapel for a reason for the good people i did i did because i didn't want good people tainted with a broad brush and yeah there was some bad actors at the capital this can happen in america i'm shocked a we didn't have any security ready it's it's it's it's so derelict in that duty that's number one because people knew hundreds of thousands of people were there you pretty much assume those agitators and any a crowd and you should prepare for it they didn't they were ill-prepared no i mean they've reached in minutes and then the second thing is is for the ninety nine percent that came and i i tried to explain as best i could why people like yourself were there then you get painted with a broad brush it's not fair and it's not just and it's not right but it's been happening now for five years and i can tell you i live it every day i mean you know i've i've the new york toilet paper times falsely accusing me pretty much of murder you know when it came to you know covid when it was clear that i took it more seriously than them they would say who says it's not okay to travel to china after the president's travel ban you know i accepted i entered this public life you know uh this was my choice but people that are at a protest or at a rally you know that just out there to do it lawfully and legally you don't deserve this world by living not a good world to be in trust me anyway my heart goes out to you fill anything else you want to end yeah sure as you want to say one thing there were no barricades on that backside we just walked right up the street and right into the backside of the cap of the widow cause pulling through with the senators when they joined in in the congress congress people from congress don't understand and they told us to not to come in not coming nobody bummed our star at cage you could just walk up freely and nobody said one word that's exactly what happened everybody just walked up to the back listen i saw one moment a video that went viral on twitter where literally the the people that were at the gate they just they opened it themselves to let people in i saw with my own eyes i mean i don't and i'll tell you know of course as agitators in these groups i you know we i'm waiting for to like and get a full and comprehensive report where beginning to get a good picture an idea of of people that were there to purposely agitate uh that had agendas and and and some now they weren't magga people but listen you know the fight for liberty and freedom fill it never stops you got to you got to understand that patriotic americans need to stay in the fight we can't back down and in terms of our core beliefs trade gaudy well what are the beliefs of conservatives on trade it's easy america first secure borders uh increase manufacturing at home energy independence better trade deals strong national defense piece through strength it's not that complicated and everybody knows it and people that will we should elect that will will battle for these ideas fight for these ideas nobody advocates violence and um it's just you know all the way around and you see the hypocrisy it's never been this bad ever special edition hand of the tonight we're gonna go through and we're just gonna prove what absolute hypocrites on the deepest level the mob is the media and of course the democratic party i i mean i don't
