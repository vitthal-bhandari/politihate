This offer expires February 14th. On this episode of muts world, one of the most important struggles on the planet. It's taking place right now between the people of Hong Kong and the mainland communist Chinese dictatorship led by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It has been 22 years since the July 1st, 1997, handover of Hong Kong from Britain to communist China. The system worked moderately well and maintaining a balance of economic and personal freedom next to a totalitarian system. However, as the Hong Kong government working with Beijing proposed an extradition bill to send law breakers of Hong Kong to communist courts in China. Millions of Hong Kong citizens flooded the streets in protest. The key test now is what General Secretary Xi Jinping is going to do about this direct confrontation between Hong Kong's people and Beijing's military and police power. On this episode, I'll explain why the protest are happening and why we as Americans should care about the outcome. I really wanted to talk about what's going on in Hong Kong now because I think that it is the biggest test of the communist Chinese dictatorship since Tiananmen Square in 1989. And the reason I say that is that what you've been watching on television is an outpouring of people. Remember, the Chinese communists have been perfecting visual identification systems, so you can assume that if you're in one of these demonstrations, the odds are pretty good the police are taking your picture. And if they decide to come back and crack down, you could suddenly find yourself in real trouble. The dictatorship on the mainland can be very tough and has had people locked up. So this is not fun and games. This is a real act of courage. And what's fascinating in me is the scale that it's built to. The fact that you and I are watching millions of people who are standing up and saying they don't want to go down a slippery path where the communist government, the dictatorship on the mainland, is able to have greater and greater control. And I think this reflects on something very deep in the Chinese communist dictatorship style. Its court system in the end is very political. It's important to remember that the mainland government is in fact defined by the communist party. It's about 90 million communist party members. And that they permeate everything. They permeate the courts, the police, the corporations, the universities, the people in Hong Kong who had spent a long time being governed by the British who have a totally different approach, very parallel to ours and that the rule of law matters, individual dignity matters. The state has limits on its power. All of those things had conditioned people in Hong Kong to a belief in their own legitimate authority and their own legitimate dignity. And they see all this being threatened. And there's smart enough to understand that it's a slippery the immediate cause of the crisis was a proposed bill that would allow the Chinese communist government to extradite people from Hong Kong to the mainland. Now the excuse for it was that a local teenager was killed while she was vacationing with her boyfriend in Taiwan. The boyfriend who's a Hong Kong admits to the murder, but authorities can't extradite him back to stand trial and they have to prosecute him for a lesser charge of money laundering. So the government comes in using that particular outrageous case as an excuse and says, you know, what we need to do is have an extradition law that in an orderly way will let us get rid of bad people. Let us get rid of criminals, violent criminals, and it all sounds under surface plausible in the United States so well, if that's what they're doing, why is there this huge outrage? Why are these enormous demonstrations? And the reason is virtually nobody in Hong Kong trusts the dictatorship in Beijing. And they all assume that once you start down the slope, this year it might be only hard in criminals. Next year it might be publishers and writers and public spokesperson. The year after it might be people who belong to parties that are not communist. And so they see it as the beginning of the end of the freedom which has made Hong Kong so unique. You and I have been watching history and we've been watching a moment in time where we don't know how it's going to end. It could be anywhere from a permanent change in the power system with the people of Hong Kong having vastly more power or it could be the gradual coercion through a series of steps by Beijing or it could be that Beijing simply moves in and decides that it's going to do whatever it has to in order to be able to dominate. And the truth is we don't know which of these outcomes is going to happen next. And that's why I thought it was useful to put in context how Hong Kong got to be there, what it's like, what the fights over, and what the options are in terms of the central government and what they're looking at. And remember this, if you are the Chinese communist dictatorship and you're sitting in Beijing trying to run a country of a billion, 400 million people, you know the deal you've cut which is the people will give us the right to run a totalitarian state but in return we are going to give them prosperity. I think it's fair to say that there's generally acceptance in communist China that the deal has been I have a better life but that's a life controlled by the Communist Party but it's better than chaos it's better than a disaster it's better than poverty. However there are three places where there are populations of Chinese descent that are both prosperous and free. The one we're talking about today Hong Kong which has a unique relationship in that it is part of communist China but it is they say it's one country with two systems in the 22 years since the British turned over the city state to the communist that they've actually remained relatively more open, free, or more entrepreneurial and with greater rights. The second of course is Taiwan which was occupied by the nationalists when they lost the civil war on the mainland and has grown steadily freer, steadily more open and steadily more distant from the mainland. Taiwan has millions of people it's much bigger than Hong Kong. It has millions of people now who are of Chinese descent but are living in freedom have a free press, have free elections and are also very very prosperous and the third of course is Singapore which is one of the most remarkable city states in the world enormously successful and which had for a very long time in Li Quan Yu one of the wisest leaders in modern history who really laid the basis for a remarkably prosperous and safe country. So if you're sitting in Beijing and you're trying to make sure that the billion four million people you currently govern don't get crazy ideas you worry if they start seeing too much freedom in Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong and you worry the most about Hong Kong because it is basically right next to the mainland. People go back and forth all of the time. There's a great deal of news media publishing books and other things in Hong Kong which reach back into China and so there's a great sensitivity and they've found themselves I think caught and not certain what to do. Next, how to discuss the history of Hong Kong including its 155 year British colonization and now 22 years of being under communist Chinese rule. The struggle underway now between the people of Hong Kong and the economy of Chinese dictatorship of the mainland is fascinating in part because Hong Kong has been so amazingly successful. This is a tiny city state who has $61,000 income per capita. It has a population of 7,400,000, one of the most heavily populated places in the world and it is absolutely an extraordinary achievement of the human spirit that with virtually no resources virtually no space that in fact they have built this remarkable trading finance and manufacturing and that it evolved as communist China evolved and became more open. Hong Kong had defined new ways of earning a living, new ways of being a competitor worldwide and they've actually done it. It's an astonishing place and it's a place of great diversity. Well, about nine out of ten people in Hong Kong are Chinese. They're also Filipinos, they're Indonesians, they're Europeans. The remarkable blend of people is illustrated in their religion. 28% Buddhist or Taoist about 7% Protestant, about 5% Catholic, about 4% Muslim, about 1.5% Hindu, tiny number of Sikhs and then people with no stated religion, about half the population and they feel that they're citizens of Hong Kong. They don't think that they're in any way tied to the Chinese communist dictatorship. In fact, the University of Hong Kong did a study in 2016 and found that only 31% of Hong Kong residents are proud to be national citizens of China. They don't identify their success, their freedom and their future with the Chinese communist dictatorship. They really see themselves as part of a larger world and as people who make a living by a remarkable level of entrepreneur behavior. And in fact, there have been a number of studies on the Hong Kong very low tax system in which they have really attracted entrepreneurs, attracted investments and by allowing people to keep the money they make, they have created a center of wealth. There's an estimate that there are more high value people in terms of income in Hong Kong than in any other single city in the world. That's how productive and that's how powerful it's been. Now, this is also a historical anomaly. Hong Kong originally was just some islands and the British decided it was a great port and so part of the agreement that the British made with the Imperial Government back at the end of the Opium Wars in the 1840s, they were given rights to the island of Hong Kong. Later on, they acquired rights to an area in the mainland called Calloon and for a very long period, the British ran the place, no real regard for the Chinese government, whether it was the nationalist Chinese or the communist Chinese or before that, the empire. But they ran it as a colony. I think it's important to remember this because there's a certain amount of unfairness in saying why can't they have free elections like they did in the British? No, that was a colony. Now, as a colony they had the role of law. It was a colony that people generally felt was very fair. It was a colony that was very well policed but nonetheless was not a free country. It wasn't a place that had exercised a deep tradition of democracy. This was a 99-year lease and after a long time the lease began to run out and by that time you had a much bigger, much more powerful communist China and you had Britain which had dropped dramatically in military power and dropped dramatically in relative economic rank. And so there was no possibility, no practical realistic possibility, that Britain could hold on to Hong Kong if the Chinese Communist wanted agreement. And so they had a long negotiation, I was actually a speaker of the house in Hong Kong during the negotiating period and the British worked very hard to get a general agreement from the Chinese Communist that they would, in fact, be willing to run a rule of law system very close to what the British had been doing and that they would gradually bring in some level of representative government. The way the Chinese captured it and it was a pretty intelligent model was there would be one country but two systems. So from the standpoint of Beijing, Hong Kong is Chinese but it's Chinese in a different way than the rest of China. Now, part of the reason that Hong Kong was treated this way is that the dictatorship in Beijing was trying to send a signal to Taiwan that they could rejoin mainland China and then you would have one country and you'd have three systems and that required the Taiwan decided that they could trust Beijing to keep its word. So the British consistent bias in favor of occupying the system in a fair way with the rule of law, with a police force that had a long reputation for being incorruptible and extraordinarily honest and professional. In that setting Hong Kong just transitioned from Great Britain to China and remained entrepreneurial, had a huge work ethic, people could rise rapidly in economic wealth and as China grew richer, a great deal that wealth came through Hong Kong in the form of trade or in the form of finances or insurance companies and the result was that not only did Hong Kong rise because of itself but Hong Kong also rose because of the general gradual rise of all of China. So for a very long period, life has been exciting, it's been positive and yet there's been this continuous sense of being about what will happen and the fact is nobody knew how it would evolve. Certainly after Tiananmen Square when the Chinese Communist decided they had to shoot people and run over them with tanks, there was a sense that there was a pretty rigid system politically and it wasn't going to evolve towards any kind of real freedom in the short run but that didn't particularly carry over to Hong in fact Beijing so recognized Hong Kong's ability to be independent that they were willing to have people come to Hong Kong where they could talk about Tiananmen at the very time that in the communist Chinese world they were erasing all the memories. So if you looked at the history textbooks, if you looked at memoirs, if you looked at a variety of other things, Tiananmen Square never quite occurred in the historic patterns of communist China but there were people who were openly publicly talking about it in Hong Kong, the Beijing dictatorship wasn't particularly happy about it but they gained certain very large advantages by tolerating the way in which Hong Kong operated. First of all, Hong Kong is a generator of enormous wealth, much of which goes to China, the value of Chinese currency, the value of Chinese investments, the very fact that a lot of Chinese wealthy people put money into Hong Kong, all of these things led Beijing to be very careful, they didn't want to kill the goose that was laying the golden egg. At the same time, they also recognized that whatever the political, diplomatic, and public relations had been in dealing with Tiananmen Square, it would be enormously bigger if they did something to suppress dissent in Hong Kong itself. I don't think there was ever any serious thought about using the military in Hong Kong the way they had used the military in Beijing and there's no evidence at the moment at least that they are going to put that scale of people in there and I think they have a pretty good idea how horrible it would look on television and how rapidly the rest of the world would respond with enormous hostility if that's what they did. So you had a situation building where you have on the one front, the people of Hong Kong pretty aggressively and directly taking on the establishment and to understand that in part you have to recognize that that establishment was really rigged by the Chinese Communist. There are about 1,200 people who elect the chief executive. Those people are almost overwhelmingly biased in favor of Beijing. There's a general agreement that the amount of pressure that Beijing can bring to bear on the chief executive's overwhelming and in fact, lay them who's the current chief executive couldn't survive for a full day if Beijing wanted to people in Hong Kong know this so they know she's really Beijing's puppet running Hong Kong. She's not Hong Kong's choice running Hong Kong and that leads to a continuous frustration and a continuous sense of wanting to change it. Now starting at the end of the British period there was a growing democracy movement. They had never had four democracy under the British but they thought now that they were changing over maybe the time had come to in fact have that kind of approach. The tension between the evolution of Hong Kong as an increasingly free environment and the continual effort of the Chinese Communist to bring it under a socialist communist dictatorial system. I has been fascinated to watch. In 1997 the British leave the Chinese flag has raised and the British flag comes down on July 1st 1997. By 2003 there was an anti-subversion law prohibiting quote any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against the central people's or the theft of the state. So that is actually focused on making them tolerate mainland communist Chinese dictatorship saying that you can go to jail for doing things that the government and Beijing thinks are inappropriate but at the time they're still locked into the Hong Kong legal system while they tried to ban groups that there were unacceptable they could ban them in the mainland but they weren't doing a very good job of baning them in Hong Kong. So they kept looking for ways to change the attitude of people in Hong Kong who were very skeptical of the dictatorship and very much in favor of a more open society. By 2012 the government and desperation announced the plan to require schoolchildren to take classes in Chinese patriotism by which of of course they meant the communist dictatorship's patriotism and there are huge mass student protests and they don't require it. By 2014 there's a pro-democracy group which actually sets up an unofficial referendum setting up three different options of how they want to directly elect the head of the local government Beijing says no we're not going to have open nominations. In fact the Chinese Communist state news agency reports that candidates would be chosen by a Chinese government committee before being put on the ballot. So they're already narrowing down the range of choices so you can only pick a choice acceptable to Beijing. When Beijing does reject the proposal for open nominations there are student boycotts and all through 2014 you have the police clashing with pro-democracy protesters hitting them with pepper spray shooting tear gas and up to 80,000 people gathered to protest. In 2014 this was to consider a substantial protest 80,000 people. We've just seen two million people in the streets. Seeing see how the movement has grown over the last five years. The Chinese Communist chief negotiator who is now the chief executive officer Carrie Lam she's negotiated as long as she can and they're not going to negotiate anymore. By mid December the leaders announced that the boycotts are over they've made their big push they failed and you could have said at that point that that was up to then the high watermark of the struggle for democracy and Hong Kong. Even while the political tension was intense the economic integration continued to go on. By September 2018 there's a high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China. There are huge quantities of people going back and forth and you can actually clear Communist Chinese immigration inside the station in Hong Kong. However some of the opposition leaders starts in wait a second if you're going to let the Chinese Communist government clear immigration in the Hong Kong train station. Are you an effect setting up a piece of territory that the Chinese Communist will claim is theirs. And so the tension is very prickly sense of what is it that Beijing is going to try to do next. By September 2018 only had the open high-speed rail link but Hong Kong bans the Hong Kong national party which had advocated independence for the territory and they argued that it's a national security issue to have people advocating independence. Well again if you think about it this is a step away from the original vision that they would prove you could have two systems in one country because increasingly they're coercing people in Hong Kong to basically accept Chinese Communist definition of the two systems and that certainly sends a reminder to Taiwan that maybe you ought to be a little bit careful about how things are going on. They continue however economically to work more and more in the direction of coming together while October 2018 China opens a bridge linking Hong Kong and Macau to the mainland and General Secretary Xi Jinping presides over the ceremony. So they're gradually having if you will golden threads that economically unite Hong Kong and China while they're also slowly trying to crowd out the kind of freedoms that have been integral to living in Hong Kong. So that's what got us to the stage where you had these huge demonstrations. You had Carrie Lam proposed something which clearly had been backed by Beijing and then she backed down and we have to presume that she had permission from Beijing to back down that they looked at a million people in decided that there's just two bigger crowd and that Hong Kong is too open to television and news media therefore they couldn't continue where they're going. When they back down on the bill instead of people going home and saying great we won the next day there were twice as many people in the street, two million. Remember this is in a country in which the entire population is about 7,400,000. So you're talking about almost 30% of the country turning out and if you take that same number for the US, you think about this number you'll be in rural South Staggering this. You know of over 100 million Americans in the street. So on this very congested very small city state you had a clear demonstration of massive popularity on behalf of first repudiating the extradition bill and second having won that fight. Now they're saying okay since we got it back down let's also fire and they're demanding that Beijing allow her to step down and of course Beijing doesn't want to do them. That's why you're now in this very interesting period of a test of will between millions of people in Hong Kong and General Secretary Xi Jinping. Next why we should all care as Americans about the outcome of the Hong Kong protest. When Neville Chamberlain was contemplating what was happening in Czechoslovakia in 1938 and he's trying desperately to avoid war. He described it as a distant country about which we know a little and of course the result of that appeasement policy was World War II. He has a turned out that that distant country about which we know a little was in fact of the symbolic breaking point that led Adolf Hitler to believe that he could basically invade any place he wanted to and Britain and France would tolerate it. Well Hong Kong is in the same way a small city state seven million four hundred thousand people. You could argue what does it matter to us and what it matters to us is really about the Chinese Communist dictatorship more than about Hong Kong. Hong Kong in a sense is like the story of the canary and the coal mine and the old days they would keep canaries the coal mine because they were very sensitive to gases and if the canaries began to get sick they knew that they had a danger of a gas explosion and they would evacuate the the coal mine. Well Hong Kong is the testing point for whether or not general secretary Xi Jinping is willing to allow freedom to evolve or whether in fact faced with the risk of a billion four hundred million people becoming inspired by Hong Kong. He decides that he has to clamp down and make the dictatorship even tougher even more repressive and even more comprehensive. And I think that's why this is a very very important turning point and it will be very interesting at the G20 meeting when the president and Xi Jinping meet to see what's happened to the Chinese Communist wait and do nothing until after that meeting do they act in advance and also how do the people of Hong Kong evolve they've had a taste now that street power works pushing to get the chief executive fired she is Beijing's choice Beijing's not going to back down very easily and again if you think like the leader of a billion four million people you don't necessarily want the idea that if enough people go in the street you're going to do what they tell you. So this is a very delicate and I think very important time because it affects the largest country in the world it affects the whole question of whether China evolves in a direction that they become more capable of us working with them or whether in fact in the end they have to use whatever level of force and is needed in order to sustain the dictatorship and maintain the capacity to repress their own people. I think the next few months will be very important and I hope you get a feel about how remarkable Hong Kong is what level of courage it took for two million people almost one out of every three citizens of Hong Kong to go to the streets and the kind of historic moment when you might in fact see a real step in the direction of freedom or you might find out that once again repression is used to sustain the dictatorship. I think it will have a big impact on our lives on how we relate to communist China and how the system evolves over the next 10 or 15 years.
