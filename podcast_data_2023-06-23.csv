"16645","Mark Levin Podcast","2019-06-04","mark levin audio rewind - 6/3/19","on monday's mark levin show, in usual fashion the press can't help themselves but wrongly accuse president trump of calling duchess of sussex meghan markle nasty, which he did not. he simply said that he didn't know she'd been nasty in her comments toward him during the campaign. yet the media never pauses before comparing trump to stalin, calling him a white supremacist, and more. this pseudo-event has been covered as major news by the likes of hack reporters such as jonathan lemire, the associated press' white house correspondent. lemire positioned trump's comments as an attack on markle because she is part african american and an attack on muslims because the mayor of london is a muslim. this is why it's important to recognize these manufactured media falsehoods as pseudo-events as explained in chapter five of ""unfreedom of the press."" then, a federal judge ruled in favor of trump using funds to build the border wall saying that congressional democrats had no standing and that the administration was correct, citing the constitution and political doctrine exception that the courts shall not interfere in political battles. in the same way, the supreme court will never weigh in on impeachment because it’s a political process. the media’s headline should be - 384 members of the house of representatives oppose trump's impeachment. learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices","More Conservative","News","Apple Top 100","https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO5751486850.mp3"
"16646","Mark Levin Podcast","2019-06-01","mark levin audio rewind - 5/31/19","on friday’s mark levin show, nbc news and mediaite falsely claim that mark levin played a role in president trump’s mexico tariff plan and has caused the stock market to respond negatively. interestingly, the poorly-sourced articles fail to note that mark has always challenged trump on tariffs with the exception of china which should be heavily tariffed for their theft of u.s intellectual property and animus toward our nation, nor did they even bother to reach put to mark for a comment on the story. later, the president has done everything conceivable to secure the southern border, but the democrats want to politicize this issue and the republicans when they controlled the house did nothing to secure the border. so trump must play the hand he has and uses the executive branch, which he is in charge of, to remedy this situation by leveraging tariffs to push mexico to secure their own borders which in effect will help secure ours. then, the new york times has banned their reporters from appearing on don lemon's show on cnn and rachel maddow's show on msnbc because they are too partisan. this is simply the ny times trying to look more objective despite their social activism. also, attorney general bill barr reiterates that the department of justice applied the traditional standards of law, unlike the overreach presented by robert mueller. barr also stated that many of the facts related to the spying in question don't quite add up as he continues his investigation into the genesis of the mueller probe. finally, in breaking news, 12 people have died and six are hospitalized after a shooting in virginia beach, va. learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices","More Conservative","News","Apple Top 100","https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO6151381375.mp3"
