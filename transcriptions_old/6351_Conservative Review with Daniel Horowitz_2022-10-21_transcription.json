    "text": " Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative truth. The conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our life our liberty and our property to fight for what matters in the way it matters at the time it matters if you want all of that and more well this is your one stop shop Daniel Hurwitz back here today Friday end of the week October 21st and really what sets us aside from other shows is we don't just commentate we don't just muse and engage in punditry we actually discuss policy outcomes where we want the ship to head and that's why from now until November 8th we're gonna be discussing for the most part November 9th and onwards that is what matters November 9th and onwards what exactly are you gonna do with that election mandate I can't force people to do things they don't want to do but what I can do is give voice to the right strategies the right issues the right policies the righteous truth at any given time and that's what you expect of me so I'm not gonna really do much horse race for the next two and a half weeks I do want to get on Robert Cahaly of Trafalgar maybe one time just to do a roundup of what's going on so we could learn about what he's seeing in the polling in order to again aim that towards policy outcomes but the the revolution you're looking for is not November 8th it's November 9th and what I mean by that is this do we finally change our focus I've all these Republicans I know that are so into elections oh my gosh yeah what's gonna happen November 8th and then they die November 9th they die the next day like nothing ever comes of it that same intensity that you're constantly refreshing the RCP polls page every hour that needs to continue on the issues that matter in the states that matter the legislation that matters the executive policies that matter are you pressuring the Republicans in the right way let me give you a great example of how this can be done so we've been talking about obviously yesterday CDC votes to put the death shots on the childhood immunization schedule to quote Lara Logan who just got chucked from Newsmax another fake entity the world leaders are dining on the blood of children pretty big deal death shot after everything we know about it this is what they're doing and for the first time it wasn't just me but many other conservatives were calling on the Republican governors to at least make a statement so you know what they actually felt the pressure and you could tell by the timing and tone of their statement it was like they had a gun against their head they were forced to follow Ron DeSantis is saying hey we're not gonna do that here or we already passed legislation that precludes that fine so this is not an exhaustive list there could be more but from what I've seen so far as of midday on Friday Kevin's did a vocal homeless Spencer Cox of Utah Mike Parris in Missouri Kristina almost at the Kota Glen Yunken of Virginia Bill Lee of Tennessee Kivia of Alabama and Kim Reynolds of Iowa and actually Democrat Governor Jared Paulus of Colorado also said that they're not doing it there so that's more than any other time when we demanded statements and they never made a statement well pressure does work pressure does work remember the name of the game is to pretend to be conservative but actually help the other side so the more we force scrutiny on them the more they're forced to either openly defy us and then we can more easily defeat them or they'll maybe be forced to go along with us focus on the issues in the people and the legislation the play calls we need to be making the play calls noticeably absent by the way are Greg Abbott and Brian Kemp again by the time you're hearing this it could be they changed but it's still something that so that this has gone on this long and I've not seen a statement from them so that's glass half full so that success but still we're not demanding more from them here's the glass half empty part okay so we have death shots out here and we're not going to fully force them on children to get an education well dude we should be downright recommending against their existence not just saying we're not going to force you to get it at this point but again not one other state is recommending against even children getting the shot much less adults much less taking it off the market much less bringing up Pfizer on fraud charges which by the way states can do a Florida lawyer Jeff Childers points out that friend of mine Florida has a deceptive and unfair trade practices act a lot of states have similar laws which allow lawsuits against companies that misled consumers about safety and efficacy of products now he says right now that law in Florida has a glaring exemption for pharma but that could be legislated away next session and it should be and you might think oh well you know how did states get around the prep act the the what do you call it NCBIA yeah and that needs to be repealed at a federal level and we're gonna be talking about that and more with Marjorie Taylor Greene coming up soon but it's important to remember that it's not like it's a blank check that companies could literally mislead and lie and we caught them lying so yeah they're absolved from negligence it turns out people got damaged by their product but if they lied in their advertising and marketing that's a different story and we now have all the evidence Grant Juries could bring this up we need to this this does need to happen Grant Juries state laws attorneys general pressure make the play call but yet every other Department of Health all these governors Kim Reynolds KK IV Billy Glenn Young King Christie know their departments of health are downright recommending the shots and pressuring and promoting them even on children to this day if there's such frauds that needs to change that's my point pick the top 50 most influential conservatives if they would jump on all these people make the play calls on this and other issues we could have a very different election I want you to think about being on the other side of this election right now at least until now the polls don't really show a wave they show a traditional flipping of Congress that you would expect in the midterms where one party holds the White House especially when the opposition party is starting out just a few seats away from the House majority and already 5050 in the Senate actually would be downright historically bad if Republicans didn't flip both houses so that's nothing but you know polls are starting to show a little bit more momentum and let's just say all the in all the undecideds break a hundred percent in their Republican direction which based on a number of factors is not outlandish to think that might happen and let's just say best case scenario they not only run the table in all of the contentious races but even somehow surprise us and a few senators and governors and maybe House races in blue states maybe they flip New York governor kinetic get governor and maybe even Sid Blumenthal gets flipped the Republican there whatever good she is Levy I think her name is she supported Jeb Bush for president but okay some polls only show her back like three points against it bloomin thaw okay Connecticut Oregon maybe Patty Murray goes down Bennett in Colorado I don't think so but I'm just saying let just indulge me we wake up the other day I mean people are in cloud 9 oh my gosh so rather than spending the next week or two owning the lips owning the lips owning the ha ha ha look you lost Biden's administration is over with no it's not they're continuing to persecute us Steve Bannon was just sentenced to four months in prison for literally being an adviser to a president and not cowtowing to a legislative subpoena on an underlying question where there's no accusation of a crime because of January six somehow if you supported the president's position on the election being stolen that's a crime again it's like literally saying that any Democrat that supported BLM is responsible for all the murders and and looting and beatings and arson that they committed and two billion in damage and therefore we could just bring up any executive official on charges or subpoena them if you don't come we're gonna throw you in prison they never do that by the way criminalizing politics we can't wait another day now he is gonna be able to be out of jail pending his appeal but this is what they're doing we don't have the time we need action right now what are you gonna do exactly commensurate with the mandate these Republicans get is their responsibility to immediately act and immediately we're gonna talk a little bit with MTG and next week I'm gonna come out with a column outlining this just days after the election house Republicans their conference holds a freshman orientation for the incoming members where they pick leadership where they pick a rules package for how the house is gonna run amazingly important and then the governors and the state legislative sessions beginning in January February the amount of things that cannon must be done the vote if that doesn't fact happen the voters will be saying Republicans please we won't relief do bold things on interposing the feds crushing the federal tyranny energy food medical freedom crime the border grooming autonomy from international treaties autonomy from China so many things and I'm gonna try to come out with a list before January and that's what we're gonna do highlight the strategies the key players that need to be pressured the legislation we need state federal that's where our focus needs to be if it's there we could really have a revolution so to me this is a huge lesson that Republicans can be pressured if you're willing to do it if you're willing to stay focused I do want to get to our interview but we have a couple couple more things first our sponsor of MTG's interview today is America's only Christian conservative mobile provider look you know big business is gonna cancel people like MTG cancel Patriots we need to make the switch away from Verizon T-Mobile go to Patriot mobile which has plans that fit almost any budget they use the same carriers same phone line you don't have to change your number there's no excuse for not changing over same service except rather than supporting transhumanism they actually support the sanctity of life religious freedom and second amendments to go to Patriot mobile dot com slash CR or call 972 Patriot use offer code CR get free activation you know what if you're a veteran or first responder they actually appreciate your service to the country so let them know because they have a special discount just for you come join our movement make this which today Patriot mode calm slash CR or call 972 Patriot this other day our two-year-old daughter came home from goes to a little play group in the morning came home with a band-aid on her hand and I never saw her this is so happy there's something psychological about kids love band-aids they just love it now I was thinking that's exactly what Republican voters are elections are are such a band-aid it's such a comedic relief wow oh man this is great and when you solved nothing if you don't act there the FBI is still gonna round up our people Pfizer is still gonna push the death shots Republican health departments in Republican states are still gonna push the death that shots the border invasion will continue all this stuff will continue one of the things that Kevin McCarthy cleverly does and all Republicans do is they fight us on the issues that matter in the way they matter at the time they matter so because they don't do what we say needs to be done at the time you have irrevocable damage then finally two years later or 20 years later they'll say yeah you know we've come to your position but then at that point you need to do much deeper surgery so in a legal immigration everyone talking about all Kevin McCarthy said we're done with comprehensive immigration reform aka amnesty we're only gonna do enforcement no amnesty so okay we should celebrate that for 20 years Republicans went and fought a border invasion by saying we're gonna give amnesty they joined the Democrats now like okay we're no longer to push amnesty well that's too late we suffered executive amnesties worse than any legislative amnesty we could have ever imagined anything short of state deportations is worthless at this point so Republicans will pass standalone legislation to fund more border patrol which is meaningless it's not matter of funding it's a matter of kicking them out and stop inviting them and cutting off all the magnets will you put that in the budget bill will you prohibit funding for any release of any illegal alien with criminal penalties to any government official does that anything short of that and putting it in the budget bill or a must pass bill or the defense authorization bill national defense begins with border defense is worthless but that's what they do always a day late in the dollar short so it's like now it's okay to say yeah we shouldn't shut down the schools or don't force children to get the covid shots whoa no no do we say don't force anyone to get an abortion no we want a ban abortion no one's forced to get it and even the military is still forced and they're not even promising to fight that and again this all ties back to the fact that Kevin McCarthy is not contesting Mitch McConnell's plan to pass an omnibus bill for the remainder of the fiscal year in the lame duck undercutting our ability to act swiftly at least within the first nine months on any issue any issue so this matters this certainly matters but like I said a big thing is the following Tuesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday selection day is Tuesday November 8th following week the freshmen come in this is when they vote who's going to be a speaker majority leader majority whip committee chairman steering committee and they adopt the rules that matter and what I want to speak about with MTG coming up and this is this is really important what matters is we need to take the loincloth away from the GOP so what they like to do is perfectly evince the image of a conservative fighting for our grievances at a time while ensuring that they add the problems actually continue and they don't do it that's their that's their end goal and it always is so we need to undercut their strategies their rules the way they run the house their leverage and let me give you one example we're going to talk about and the freedom caucus has made a list of demands for a rules package adoption and so far leadership has rebuffed it and has refused to respond to them and one of them is the majority of the majority rule okay again republicans are worthless I don't think at a federal level as much you can even do to me the governor should be doing this but there's a couple of things we could be doing both messaging wise building the case for things then ultimately building the case for a budget bill in other words I am okay with hearings and standalone legislation if that's to build the case for ultimately putting it in the budget and fighting for it on a must pass bill um you need to decentralize control and you need to allow the prerogative of an individual members like MTG to make noise they don't want to be embarrassed they don't want to be pushed in front of the oncoming traffic so that's why they want to be very tightly in control of what they're doing so they could pass this fluff stuff that doesn't do anything and won't even be signed into law anyway while ensuring that the leverage to actually do something is is written away and the and the first thing they're doing is actually ensuring even before republicans get in the door the budget is out the window classic example so what we want to do is force them not to do it one of them is the majority the majority rule a lot of people forget that trump was such a pathetic loser and i'm sorry some of you might get insulted but i don't care almost every budget that he signed fun fact was supported by majority democrats minority republicans in the house okay he actually every and this was while they had the trifecta control well you're saying like daniel how do you have trifecta control but democrats run the budget very simple hope yes vote no hope yes vote no republicans really and leadership really wants it and most republicans want it they agree with it but they're scared of their base so they get around it by basically having every democrat vote for it and then like the old bull committee chairs that are like suicide bombers they thumb their noses at that the base anyway they don't care anymore somehow they can't get defeated or maybe they're on their final years and they have them vote for it and everyone else including those that really don't care or down around the other side they're able to vote no so what that does is again it allows them to get their outcomes they want without getting punished we want to take that mechanism away and there's several ways but we'll talk about this more next week we'll talk about a little bit a little bit with marjorie um but one thing is the majority of the majority rule makes it that the house leadership can only push a bill let's say a budget bill that is supported by a majority of the gop conference so what that means is here's why that's important let's say you have a budget deadline coming up and republican house passes a decent standalone budget bill to defund the things we want defunded let's say let's say they do that well the hours are going to tick down to the deadline for government funding and you'll have a so-called government shutdown if you don't fund it and the senate's like well we're not passing your house bill the house should say we're not passing your bill and again and have endless speeches and media and events throughout the country highlighting the harm of their policies and what they're doing and and and willing to fund but at some point they're going to be like well we can't have a government shutdown this is why we need you to support us two years from now in the next election then we'll have the senate and the white house then we'll be able to do it mind you they did have all three and did this anyway because they didn't have 60 votes in the senate and they never will but what else okay but then they have a problem on the one hand they want to get the democrat budget bill passed but on the other hand they're scared of the base yelling at them that you voted to fund tyranny you voted to fund fissery vote to fund the invasion you voted to fund the fbi tyranny so what do they do they get the democrats to vote for it and and just a small number of republicans and the rest are free to go by ensuring that they can only push something that has the support of a majority of the conference it will force one of two things either they can't do it or a whole number of undocumented rhinos will now be documented and that at least helps us in the long run so that's a very important rule but i just want to open your mind to a number of immediately important things while everyone's going to be dancing in the end zone oh my gosh this is amazing we just crushed the democrats mcconnell in the senate is going to be giving the left everything they want in the lame duck and the house conference is going to be electing the cartheist speaker and screwing us on every position every committee chairman every rule that sets up the agenda for the house and i'm going to be the only one focusing on it how do i know because i've lived through this three other times literally did fun fact 2010 right probably in some respects um the biggest republican victory in a century almost a century maybe 80 years and guess what they responded to that mandate in the lame duck we were slaughtered slaughtered they passed the dream act out of the senate they passed repeal of doma repeal of don't ask don't tell and many other things december 2010 i'll never forget that they just took the wind out of it wait you mean the voters just said we want you so badly and you just respond by doing yes that's what they'll do i know it's unbelievable but they that's what they'll do they'll continue doing this and you need to understand that so we need to focus on how to utilize and immediately utilize that electoral mandate so what is this formula to making the election mandate actually meaningful the truth is it's simple we know what it is there's going to be a couple of good figures inside of these respective legislative bodies and hopefully in a few cases executive bodies like governor that are willing to push the proper ideas in the case of congress it's going to be starting off with stand-alone legislation and hearings and remember you need the right people to be willing to push the right sort of stand-alone legislation hearings but then it can't just end there we need immediate relief so the next step is you build a movement you build pressure and discovery behind it in the case of hearings and then you fight for two things number one that the governors that have trifectas in these red states implement were practically possible at a state level these ideas and then at a federal level to use the must-pass legislation including the budgets to fight this it's that simple anything less than that is straight bs okay we can't wait till 2025 to not have our people arrested by the fbi for having political beliefs we can't wait until they have five more death shots out immune from liability we can't wait until we have another i don't know what six million illegals by then and the criminal cartels doing their stuff we can't wait until uh you know there's no fuel fueled cars left to drive on the road this stuff is existential this ain't your grandfather's election so with us today it's probably one of the best people to discuss this and more how to utilize this electoral mandate because it's going to be one of the few people that's going to lead this margery taylor green congressman from georgia doesn't need much of an intro uh margery thanks so much for joining us again here plays media oh daniel thanks so much for having me on today i know you've had a have a busy schedule today but you'll enjoy this discussion because i think this is really what you're about how to cut through the fake talking points here's my concern my concern to put this in a crude analogy let's see republicans win big in the election it's like showing up to your house with with an army to do combat with a villain that just walked out with a bloody sword and just murdered your family and well what do you expect i don't know you expect them to pounce on the guy and you know trials and executions but instead you hear noise that hey you're stepping on my garden you just stepped on the tomato there and like what what do you just say they just killed your family and and that's what the the impression i'm getting from republicans if you heard my intro they're not really talking about any of the aforementioned stuff if they do it's on a very superficial level it's kind of like the economy is bad inflation's high as if it's like a natural disaster not something that was done um orchestrated by some certain policies that they themselves supported how could we hold them accountable to actually fulfill the mandate without our base buying into the flowery rhetoric that they're using well isn't that the question and you know here if we look at the time on the call it's really 1159 and i think that's how every republican needs to look at it is if we don't hold our government accountable if we don't pursue investigations and and force people to face consequences for the proof that we're able to show if we don't force the right leds legislation if we don't cut things in the budget like vaccine mandates like CRT in education like like the the trans movement that is preying on children if we if we aren't willing to do that and we don't take the responsibility responsibility to do it then when will we do it and because there is we can't wait any longer and i think how republican voters and especially republican donors need to hold their republican um leaders accountable after after they're elected is they need to remind them very loudly you remind them with your checkbook and you remind them with phone calls emails and you go meet with them and in their offices and and remind everyone that this is a job that we're electing you to do and you have to do it there's no other choice and and so that comes two ways is it's encouragement and accountability and that's what republican voters need to take to republican leaders as we enter into the next congress as we enter into 2023 so describe for our listeners you know you just went through this process you were a freshman member what happens that first week after the election that's so pivotal that the constituents need to know to direct their attention because because my concern is that it's kind of like dancing in the end zone let's just say it's a great victory everyone's going to be excited oh the Biden administration is over um you know and and we all pray for steve bannan today obviously it's very tough what he's gone through and it underscores the sense of urgency um look i'm scared of the FBI arresting me for what i say but he's out there and he said look Biden administration is over in november aith and i'm like steve i wish you're from your lips to god's ears but the reality is you got to make the plays you got possession of the ball but you got to make the plays that in following week what are the pivotal choices that are made that people need to know about to call their incoming representative to direct their attention to those issues well as you know nothing changes after november aith really the same people are still in place nothing really changes until january and even in january when when our new members of congress are sworn in when hopefully new republican governors like karae lake or dug macheriano or or others hopefully get sworn in um that just means the job begins it doesn't mean that anything any problem has been solved it doesn't mean that inflation goes down it doesn't mean the gas prices go down it doesn't mean that that our government is is not fighting russia in some war in ukraine it doesn't mean the fentanyl stops killing people nothing changes honestly until we start doing the hard work to change it um and so people have to have those expectations and i totally agree with you um i am i stand with c bannon and i will i will continue standing up and speaking out for him uh just like i am the people that are still being held in jail for january six who's due process rights are being completely violated our government the reality is that that people have a hard time speaking the words the government has actually become the tyrannical government yes that our founding fathers uh warned us about um but but here here's why you don't see a lot of people um just just completely recognizing that fact the middle class in this country is not really suffering yet but but the middle class will start suffering uh not too long from now and until unless we clean up these problems and we are far from it we really are not far from it and we you would see a vast change in the attitude of most americans um as soon as they're unable to heat their homes as soon as they're unable to turn their lights on every single day as soon as they're unable to afford to go you know enjoy college football or nfl football or or whatever activity or hobby they love to do or vacations they like to take as soon as those wonderful luxuries are unaffordable you'll see you'll see a huge change in this country but we just aren't there yet people aren't suffering but it's not far from now and if republicans aren't willing and and don't have the courage to fix it then that that will soon become a reality daniel and what we've seen happen to to see bannon and others um that could even become a more more terrifying reality and we just don't want to see those days come well we have pro-life activists that are being rounded up for for singing outside of abortion clinics um obviously they're an inch away from criminalizing our beliefs and just you know showing up and rounding us up it's something I could have never envisioned I literally have my wife uh you know I have her collect certain phone numbers to immediately call to get get the word out if i'm rounded up and I never would have envisioned that I was always scared of islamic terrorists because of the work I did or maybe the cartels at the border um and now nothing scares me more than the fbi itself so this is something we can't wait with we can't wait another month with my concern is that they've already set almost an irrevocable path to passing an omnibus bill for the entire fiscal year that will undercut any real leverage to um have a funding fight over these fbi programs and prosecutions is there any way to pressure kevin mccarthy i'm not i'm just gonna ask you straight up i don't understand he's the presumptive speaker in waiting this is his whole tour de force this is his body of government that he will lead with a simple majority unlike the senate the budget is his only leverage mcconnell wrote it away assuming he follows through and does an omnibus before christmas is it just me i have not heard mccarthy say a word about this and i don't under i don't understand it well i i mean we have to admit the first failure is in the senate mitch mcconnell what you you just acknowledged that and mitch mcconnell and the republicans in the senate there's so many things they could have stopped but they fully gave a green light to joe biden nancy plusy and the democrat sajenda which has been i mean that's unforgivable for what mitch mcconnell has done in the senate his failures are just you can't say enough of what a failure he is but but no actually what i think what you're going to see is you're going to see republicans in the house working very hard to stop this this budget being passed again for another whole year the can just being kicked down the road i know i'll be a very loud voice speaking out against it but you're right we we have to we have to fight as hard as we can to to not allow that to get passed just you know rolled into another whole year because it just continues more insanity but actually i have heard kevin mccarthy and others say that we need to stop it so i'm hoping we see a big fight in the house but our problem in the house is until january when we're sworn in with whatever size majority that we have and i feel confident we will have one uh we're still the minority and they can still the democrats nancy polosi has done an amazing job as much as i hate to say it of corralling her party together and passing their disastrous agenda so and you know we'll see what she's able to do with the lame duck speaker and and i don't know what she will be able to do but yeah no the pressure has to be on to do everything we can to stop that budget from being just rolled into another year so isn't some of that pressure the week following the election is freshman orientation there's the conference meetings that adopt the rules and the leadership could you walk us through your your a member of the freedom caucus what the freedom caucus is proposing and why that will help ensure the mandate is more than just fluff well the freedom caucus has put together a rules package and the rules package uh it's it's really hard to explain and a very short answer but the rules package is designed to give legislative authority to every member of congress and to allow for more amendments to be added and to build for you know true changes basically putting congress back into a functionality that it it was previous set up to so that is the rules package that the freedom caucus is working very hard to get passed and in communications with leadership about about getting that put into place uh when we vote on on that going into the next congress there's a lot of debate happening there now i think it's important to understand the next two years though we aren't going to be able to pass sweeping legislation that joe biden or whoever's in the white house would sign into law um so that's where some of those rules really we wouldn't have as much um benefit we wouldn't benefit as much from them until we have a republican president in the white house so that is one thing important to acknowledge um and as much as everyone's going to have huge expectations of a republican controlled house we really are limited uh we can pass all the bills that we want to but if they don't go through the senate and they don't get signed into law then there's literally not change our power is going to be in the budget and that's why what you the question you asked me before this was so important if that budget just gets rolled into another year nothing changes it just stays the same old thing and the only thing we can do is investigations and provide oversight uh and expose corruption so our hands are really tired and that'll just continue to frustrate the american people but i think it's important the conference needs to function properly um what i'm actually working on is i'm wanting to see a more unified congress conference republican conference while i'm continuing to push very hard uh push my conference to the right um and to reflect the america first policies and values that so many of our voters want to see happen so i'm not interested in in taking like a um uh you know bringing war within our conference i don't want to see that happen i want to see our conference work card together and i want to do that using um using relationships and and leveraging what the american people want to see happen sure no i mean obviously historically how whatever issues we had with house leadership the senate leadership was ten times worse and it's always going to be that way but like you said you know the house can't pass anything without the senate but the senate can't pass anything without the house either so where it's new legislation the default is nothing then we have no leverage but where it's a budget bill and the default is okay then your your agency is getting no funding and you have a government shutdown that's really where the leverage is and i think that's where we we talked about earlier the majority the majority rule i want to talk about another rule i thought was important that is being pushed by the freedom caucus our listeners need to know about is that so typically even the stand-alone bills the messaging bills that you know maybe you won't put in the budget bill maybe you'll wait off with but it's important to build support build messaging raise awareness as you well know it's only certain ones that will even get that status because there are certain things that are untouchable so you have promised to um and this is very timely in the news to at least reform modify the prep act the ncvi a the blanket blanket immunity for all these vaccines and particularly the the new ones uh out now and in the pipeline that have caused so much so much damage is such injustice we not only need compensation liability we need the discovery uh through that judicial process this is really our only avenue um i i think we all know and you're trying to be diplomatic with leadership but naturally that is not a bill that will ever be brought to the floor and typically in recent years it's really only bills that have leadership support that get brought to the floor um describe what you hope to do with an amendment process to at least trigger a vote on some of these bills that are wildly wildly popular with with the republican voters but not so much with the republican leaders or donors well actually the vaccine mandates repealing the vaccine mandate is something that i hear talked about widely in our conference but liability so that oh yeah no we need to take away their liability the vaccine manufacturers deserve no protection uh because they have they've made billions of dollars um on the backs of the government forcing people to take the vaccines and now we see the cdc making it part of the vaccine schedule for children starting at six months of age which is unreal and absurd um and we'll see children and democrat states force to take these vaccines parents uh forcing their kids to get them uh based on the cdc's recommendation just so they can go to public education which the taxpayers pay for the parents pay for it so it's it's absurd but no what we have to do is we have to push these amendments into place we have to push our leadership push our conference uh to support people in this because this has been it's been medical tyranny um it is is completely unscientific they talk about science this is the most unscientific uh supported vaccine that that's ever you know in history and countries like the uk many countries in europe they're not even forcing children to take the vaccine and they're taking away their vaccine mandate so i actually do have a lot of i i am going into this with confidence in leadership in our conference of of working to repeal the mandates but i i do believe i'm one of those saying it we need to take away the liability protection of the vaccine manufacturers other other messaging bills it'll be hard to get a vote on but i'm but i'm working hard on it is a bill that i have pushed and let the movement on and that's the protect children's innocence act stopping the transgender um surgeries and and puberty blockers of kids under the age of 18 i mean this is you talk about medical tyranny this is um it's basically experimentation medical experimentation on children and general mutilation and it's completely wrong and it's taking the rights away from parents in and democrat state that forces it to be an issue where we need to make it a federal law to make it a felony to do these surgeries on kids and and prescribe puberty blockers that one is a big one i have a border bill in place that would put a four-year moratorium on immigration and that absolutely should happen four-year moratorium on immigration so these are two very important bills you're you're talking about and i want to again weave in process so our listeners understand the situation um you know i'll speak for you here those two bills are in my view dead on arrival with a leadership especially the second i mean second one i think everyone would agree is because they're all very for unlimited number you know you just slap the word legal in front of immigration and all types all numbers of all amounts coming from china and india you know selling out the american worker they're all for that at best they're against the illegal immigration um they'll never support that but isn't it true that the freedom caucus has an idea to adopt as the rules package an idea that if 10 percent of the conference which would be let's say about 24 members sign on to um an amendment it would at least trigger a vote on it because without that the stuff would never get a vote well we have to well i'm not sure on that number exactly daniel to answer your question i i have to verify that before i don't i don't want to answer wrongly um but to adopt a rules package within our conference but those are votes that have to take place in our conference so i'm i apologize i don't have that number sure sure yeah i mean i'm looking at the there's a there's a 50 page packet or so that was put out to freshen members and that's where that's where i'm getting it from yes right i haven't i'm sorry i haven't read through it yet but they did send it to me yesterday yeah no i mean i'll only nerves like me read through because i thought i thought it was pretty decent i really thought it was very mature it was uh because i lived through this a lot of us lived through this with the bainer congress and it really was trying to rectify some of the problems that we experienced where we have very popular ideas and even if you oppose them they they are important to the time they have a lot of support they do raise important questions and they need an airing and let's go back to the transgender thing you know one of my concerns again is what i've watched leadership do for the last 10 15 years is again they won't fight on the budget and then even the stand alone they'll be very careful in what they do so i'm watching this parent parental rights bill it sounds great i mean who opposes that it really requires transparency they get notification of certain things they get to look over the curriculum yeah and you know what i mean it's it's it's good but there's no hard trigger like wait a minute there's no castrating people there's no um putting men in female bathrooms none of this this is not happening no funding of the federal government can go towards castrating people i mean i just saw the state departments funding in an Ecuador Fox News had an article on that i mean throughout the government there's all this funding i mean that's a pretty simple popular thing just no funding for that i'm not seeing that as a promise you know what i mean i'm seeing these kind of fluffy things so wouldn't it help to trigger some of these amendment votes to at least get an understanding of where we are in the conference oh i think so i i fully support that and i i think it's important to be able to trigger votes like that that's why i was so dedicated to calling for recorded votes because i believe the american people need to see how every member of congress votes that's our job performance and so having the ability to trigger amendments and bringing them to the floor for a vote i i think it's exceedingly important and is also showing that yeah here we're willing to take a vote on this we're willing to work hard to try to pass it um here's who supported or here's who didn't and no i i i think that is a really really good thing um i also i'm also one of those that believes in fighting it out to the point where if we shut down the government so what you know what i mean it shouldn't matter uh the the government is ruining most people's lives every day right now and and has been for a long time and so if we're battling on the floor of our budget issues or whatever it may be and we end up shutting down the government we'll find you know too bad we we shouldn't fund it if if it's if it shouldn't be funded um you know like the department of education my goodness department of education has become so dangerous to children uh we should be fund the department of education because of you know different curriculums like CRT and bringing drag shows and the schools and grooming children and sexualizing children and and these teachers who who believe they should never be fired because they're members of some union and a union boss is saying they'll protect them forever because of their union dues but that's completely wrong and the government has lost its way and so is congress and so this is why a rules package is extremely important but at the same time we have got to have the entire conference on page because if we go into and you know we have to look at this for maturity if we go into the next uh congress and or just just warring with our within our party and and unable to accomplish anything well that's not going to give the american people much confidence in us either so it has to be done in such a way where it's you know agreed upon and and mutual and i think we can get there i'm not kidding you got to think about after this election i think it said that over 70 percent or 70 percent right now or after this election of of the republican conference has been elected since trump became it came into office so the republican conference is a lot different than the days of bainer and even paul ryan yeah yeah so it's changed a lot and people have these assumptions over a lot of republicans um in in congress right now that i wouldn't necessarily say or totally true i think there's been a shift to the right that's a very important point i i want you to reiterate that to my audience because you know i'm always on the lookout for this and we've been very disappointed for many years but you're saying this as someone who's been very marginalized you're stripped of your committee assignments obviously it was under palosse leadership you're saying you don't feel and i really want you to answer this as directly as you can you don't feel like you are marginalized that you are like an outcast like there's no one like you in that conference you feel at home with a lot of those individuals well i'm not saying i feel at home i feel at home with the people in my district because that's the best to do i feel at home with but what i'm saying is is i'm not so sure that we aren't going to see a republican conference do thing i think they are going to do more things that that people think they aren't going to do at least i'm hoping so and i'm going to be pushing very hard for that and the reason why is is there's a big change in the makeup of the conference since the days of a banner speakership where the majority of the members have been elected post post 2016 and that's a big change right that's a big change in your views and ideology and understanding the america first agenda so i'm i guess i'm what i'm saying is i'm hopeful and i want and i'm working very hard within the conference but also on the outside with pressure to to hopefully help hold our conference accountable that we do the right thing for the american people and and that's what you know when i'm talking with my freedom caucus colleague who i love very much i'm i'm saying you know let's let's get an agreement we can work it on the inside without necessarily having to use an insurgency from the outside but i think a lot is possible i really do i have i have a lot of faith and i think it's possible because they have no other choice if they don't do it then they don't deserve the votes sure you know republican votes again sure but as you noted it's very subtle politics is an art it's not a math people think it's a math always to a team here you need 60 there you need the president signature there it's also an art and there are very subtle ways that you could look like you're fighting but then say look well you need to vote for us the next two elections when there really are things especially you know none of us expect them to come in for example and and start from 1776 and everything that was done on constitution all these government programs that maybe are popular and have a lot of constituencies abolish them done done done you know entitlement this that no it's some of the new radical insane things the transgenderism the fbi rounding people up the the Pfizer fascism that should be very easy in one-off defund efforts you know catch and you know defund catch release you know i'm just saying my expectation i think oh i totally say it like i have i'm selling defund the fbi t-shirt or you know those are on my campaign site i'm all for those aggressive things um and i i wish that we would do those things i think we need to um but you know i i guess for me i can't speak on behalf of others and i and i'm not going to be one of those that will say yes absolutely this is going to happen because it that's hard that's hard for me to promise i can't only control me i can't control everybody else but i think we absolutely have to work hard to make these things happen because the department of justice and the fbi has become the scariest thing in america now it's no longer like people are more afraid of the fbi than they are of of you know a criminal coming in their house and and they shouldn't be that way like you said they're coming after pro-life um you know activist versus ignoring the people that were standing outside brat kavanagh's house you know they still have people january six rioters locked up but they don't have any antifa blm rioters um you know rotting away in jail and and being politically persecuted so i mean i think we absolutely have to hold our government accountable but you guys remember i will say this something to think about that that maybe gets missed just like our conference is made up of mostly uh trump era republicans they also got treated pretty badly this past year by the law be uh where most of these republicans that i i don't take lobbyists donations so i didn't go through it but but most of my colleagues for the first time ever got denied donations from the lobbyists and the corporate tax because of objecting on january six or different reason that's great and oh yeah oh that was like oh i wish we wouldn't take any lobbyists money and corporate money me and matt gates i think were the only two that don't take any that money but it changed perspective for a lot of republican members because for the first time they were treated pretty badly by the class in washington that usually supports everyone and they got rejected and they got treated bad and that includes kevin macarthy he was one of those also and so i think you know that has created a change in in the way a lot of members think and then then how many of these republican members that you know you might consider moderate or just quiet or or they're they're conservative but they're not big names got called insurrectionists um and accused of horrible things because of january six and they never did anything wrong at all so that kind of treatment has has put a shift in a lot of these members thinking and i'm what i'm saying is i'm i really think that could play out to create a more conservative republican conference that maybe we haven't ordinarily seen that that is a really hopeful and fascinating point at the same time that i didn't think of you know you picture health care um part of the problem we've had the entire time with this pandemic is that fizer and all these entities they really give to both sides and it's really very bipartisan and that's why you know you listen to republicans and they sound the same so you're saying that headed forward because they've almost forced them to pick sides um because of this corporate communism that's just gone so woke you can no longer straddle the fence anymore and even if they wanted to straddle it their side doesn't allow them and it's almost forcing them to be an insurgent against the system um whether they meant to be or not and so you're saying that there is what to hope for and i think people need to hear that um they need to hear that there is hope and you know i'm here to point to the strategies that we could utilize i know you're definitely gonna um do that as well i want to end off with the january sixth thing because i think again that's important it speaks to lives in danger lives in the balance um so there are going to be a lot of hearings i mean republicans always like doing that because it doesn't necessarily have to force a government shutdown or you know some sort of brinkmanship um what do you do you have confidence that we're going to get a full investigation into the origins of january six if you know what i mean both the origins meaning where in the world that came from what actually did happen on the day and then the post january six treatment do you think we're gonna get fair hearings on that is leadership interested in that i hope so i and i again i continually point to Nancy Pelosi everybody from president trump to others in the administration to sergeant in arms to to uh you know many many of the different law enforcement and intel groups requested and and all agreed with president trump requesting the national guard to be there on january six and it was Nancy Pelosi that did not pursue it and she was in she's in charge of the capital she was in charge of the sergeant in arms and they rejected the national guard to be there on january six that cannot be said enough and to me it boils down to that one critical piece of information and why she rejected them and then you know and then you can just line up think you know so many things after that about her documentary her daughter was filming that day and the son was there from europe you know oh yeah the son's there for europe and then you know you've got like all the reports of the doors just being held open um but the real negligence there whether it was purposeful or not and it's hard to say it wasn't purposeful um but we you know of course such a speculation is that why did Nancy Pelosi turn away the national guard and mayor mary ill bowser by the way turned away the national guard for dc and there and all the intelligence reports were there saying that there was going to be violence and that started in late december they had those intelligence reports uh so i certainly think that that alone needs to be addressed and i believe she she should be held accountable if she was willing to impeach president trump on january 11th of 2021 literally five days after the riot on january six um it is it is severe negligence and irresponsibility to ignore the speaker of the house refusing to have the national guard there on january six i think she should be held accountable the same way they went after trump exactly she we know she should be held accountable the question is did someone tell her to reject it and why and does that have something to do with the right type of people that seem to be around and how deep that runs but you're right that seems to flow from that original question is why did they um stop any help from coming before i really appreciate your perspective i think you give a very mature full balance perspective we've learned a lot um how could people help out with your reelection effort well just as i said i don't take any donations from lobbyists or corporate packs and that's how most members uh taken a lot of donations i only rely on small dollar donations and my democrat opponent has raised i think close to fourteen million dollars against me in my reelection so if anyone is willing to donate at mtg for america dot com mtg for america dot com i greatly greatly appreciate it so that's a wonderful way to support me in my reelection and again daniel i'm just i'm i always have hope for the future because i think it's important to have hope but we also have to follow it up with really hard work and i believe in being outspoken and i believe in accountability i think that's the right thing right thing to do so i think uh you know uh porcie bannon everyone needs to keep them in and their prayers and and also everyone else in this political persecution that shouldn't be happening in our country but we have to remain hopeful and we've got to take back the house in january and then we just have to be willing to put in day after day diligent work and know that it's going to take take years to get it right day after day that's what it's going to be and it's going to start in november we're counting on you coming back updating us during that big conference week in november we always appreciate it um and we really wish you good luck on your reelection thank you thank you so much god bless take care so folks i mean we we delved into a lot of issues i can't believe the time has already gone the week is over i had so much more to get to but it was worth it to hear another perspective you know if nothing else everyone accuses her of being some wild-eyed dummy i mean all the smarts at conservatives look you know she's very tempered she's very measured very thoughtful um she didn't take some of my bake you know she doesn't want to swing that hard at leadership and i understand from where she's coming from um i get it and and i think you know where's other members coming in if i didn't see that willingness to fight i wouldn't trust them with statements like that with her you know she will bring up a liability bill to take away liability and all you know four-year moratorium on illegal immigration uh no i mean legal immigration all immigration so it's not like she's toned down but she's like look let's let's see how we can work with them two interesting points and i'm not going to say she's wrong on them um number one the house conference is different um most these people are reared more into the generation of the fbi rounding people up rather than the iraq and afghanistan wars and the most important thing we can do is fight uh you know some tribal warfare in syria or something and number two um it's interesting that because of the wokeness whether they originally were like us or not the the corporations treat them as such so they didn't take money from them so that is an interesting point that i haven't thought a lot about so there is some optimism but at the same time like i said there's a lot of accountability measures i will talk a little bit more about some of the freedom caucus ideas that need to be adopted um you know again i mean how much they're willing to fight for it in the freedom caucus i understand i understand what they're doing and you know with her say speaking about some of the limitations it just underscores the need to focus on the states which we will in fact i'm going to focus on that more than i focus on congress uh in the coming months because there there's no excuse you got the house you got the senate you got the governorship super majorities what are you doing and we're going to have a list of demands there's no excuse but again they do have the budget these issues the that the democrats are pushing and things that they've done are extremely unpopular they should be able to win a budget prengvmanship and as far as stand-alone legislation let's push a rule that any congressman that gets 10 percent that's about 24 members support it sign on sign a petition it gets an amendment vote so in other words they want to have a vote on ending mandates awesome fine now that needs to be put in the budget otherwise it won't go anywhere but even as a stand-alone they will not allow a vote on um you know ending liability naturally they don't want to vote like that well let's force that vote let's allow the vote and see who votes against it so we can know where they stand the transgenderism they'll have some sort of parental rights thing are they going to end all transgender oriented funding within the federal government i'm not seeing them promise that much less deliver let's allow an amendment vote on that and see where they stand like she said with immigration you know they'll have a pretty good standalone illegal anti-legal immigration bill that i think we could all get behind at least in the house now the senate won't pass it a will they pass it in the budget b will they push the states to start adopting it and see even as a stand-alone we need to amendments to that that because we've had so much out of control legal and illegal immigration boxing out the american worker attenuating the american culture not a similar ball degrees of immigration we are we are at least 10 to 20 years beyond what anyone in past generations would have unanimously agreed we needed a cool-off period as we've always had historically after massive waves and here we had wave after wave after wave after wave after wave with no end in sight um i can tell you republicans do not want that vote okay they want this like neat messaging um pro-illegal pro-legal immigration anti-illegal immigration okay but that's a stupid thing it's like saying on pro-vaccine well what type and what circumstance what's the data you know what what's what's the safety and efficacy same thing here so these are important um the rules package you need to hold your member accountable are they going to support the freedom caucus um freedom caucus style rules are they going to join the freedom caucus believe me i think a lot of people in the freedom caucus are a waste of time and and a bunch of you know just messaging machines that don't want to really fight where it matters but at least but if you're not even willing to join the freedom caucus that tells me a lot about where you stand unless of course you're Thomas Massey who is to the right of the freedom caucus and doesn't want to be bound by anyone and he has proved himself but you ain't Thomas Massey whatever member you have running in your district is they're just not him and um you know they need to they need to be put up put on record but this is the type of degree of specificity and granular detail that we're gonna have to get into because very broadly they will indulge our talking points especially in the house and and again i don't disagree that in some measure this will be the most conservative house we've ever had but the problem with that is this is also the most perilous time we've ever had we don't have time on the clock um and we need to do a lot more dramatic things than we've ever done so you know where is before we needed a six and they were out of four now they might be at a six but we need a 10 and that's where it is that's that overton window that's the art of politics it's not a math we're always going to bring you interesting perspectives from me from our guests let me know what you thought again you can email me um at d harro uh daniel harroitz i'm sorry
