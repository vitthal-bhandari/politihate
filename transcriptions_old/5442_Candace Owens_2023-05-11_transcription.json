    "text": " All right, guys. Happy Thursday. I am still in London, as you can clearly see, and just reminding you guys to please bear with us on the sound. We are not in our regular studio, so you may hear a couple of things. We are close to a subway station. We're going to get through it. All right, jumping into the topic of today, I was really thinking about why it is that there are, in fact, real biological women that support the transgender movement, some very famous women that support the transgender movement. Why is that? What do those women have in common? I want to discuss that. Plus, later on in the show, JoJo Silla has spoken out in a podcast to say that she can't have sex like normal teenagers because of her fame. And what she means by a normal teenager is that apparently she thinks they're all having sex in bathroom stalls or something. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. So Dylan Mulvaney has found his voice again following the Bud Light controversy. Not that any of us doubted that he would, considering he likes attention, he likes cameras, and a lot of what he is doing is for exactly that. He's a theater, theater kid. He's always been in front of the camera, and people that want attention become more and more extreme for those views when they have been raised up in the spotlight. I've talked to you guys about my perception of what it means to be a child actor and why it's bad developmentally for people's brains. Well, Dylan Mulvaney sat down with none other than Chelsea Handler on her podcast, Dear Chelsea, to discuss some of the issues that he has endured over the spotlight over the past couple of months. And it's pretty shocking to hear what he has to say. Take a listen. Yeah, I think one of the most offensive things to hear is people who are talking about, you know, trans people saying, Oh, it's trendy. It's trendy. Are we supposed to let children change their sex before they're ready? Because what if they change their mind back? And I it's such a miseducation and an unknowing. Like I had a friend say to me, Oh, I know there are eight year old kids that are getting transgender surgery without their parents. And I'm like, that's simply not true. First of all, there is no eight year old that can go to the doctor and become drive themselves there. It's just so dumb. So it's it's insane that that notion of like trendiness, because transness has existed, like since the beginning of time. And truly, like in certain cultures, the two spirits or transness was actually like seen as almost the most holy or the most reverent or the most respected. And it's so sad to watch as you know, the years go by, it get sort of picked apart due to capitalism and and all of these things that have essentially let go of the fact that this is who we are. And then also just in a scientific aspect from a scientific perspective, there is a spectrum of male, what male like Arnold Schwarzenegger is at one end of the spectrum. Okay. And then Pamela Anderson is at the other end of the spectrum. That's a boy. That's a girl. And then there's 50 million things in between. You hear that guys Chelsea Handler is here to clear up your miss education. Dylan Mulvaney is helping her clear up your miss education by telling you that the most holy thing that you can aspire to is to cut off your penis. That's actually what they're talking about. And the only reason that you don't realize that is because of capitalism or something, horses conversation makes entirely no sense. And she believes, I guess the number has jumped. Now there are 50 million different things that you can plausibly choose from. So you guys just go ahead, just decide what you are today. But don't worry guys, they're going to continue this conversation and you're going to feel really, really bad for Dylan Mulvaney and realize that you are irresponsible in your miss education. Take a listen. And that's what I think a lot of these haters don't realize is that the the mental effects of of misgendering in the media, it breaks my heart because you know, there are people calling me a man and I don't right now, I feel like I'm not even processing any of it because I'm so scared to do that deep dive and to know what the effects are. Okay, so you get it, Dylan Mulvaney is not processing the fact that there are people that are calling him a man and Chelsea sees this as something that is cruel. And of course, we don't ever intend when we refer to Dylan Mulvaney as a man for him to be sad or for him to feel that we are being cruel. It is like when we say water is wet or that we breathe air, these are basic facts. It is not something that is meant to hurt you. In fact, people that are trying to hurt you mentally are the ones that are lying to you and telling you that you are a woman or that there are an amount of pills that you can take to become a woman or that there are an amount of cosmetic procedures that you can fulfill that will suddenly make you a woman. Those people are trying to hurt you. We are trying to encourage you to fall out of the delusion that you are existing within. But I got to thinking about Chelsea Handler more of than Dylan Mulvaney here. What is it? What is Chelsea Handler? Somebody that I actually when I grew up when I was young and I was in middle school, I used to love her. I thought she was so irreverent. She had this great sense of humor. She was constantly actually offering commentary on how crazy and ludicrous people in Hollywood are. That is actually how she made her name, like talking about how foolish and delusional people are in Hollywood. And then she became them. So how is she served by the trans narrative? Why is she putting herself in front of Dylan Mulvaney in an effort to say to other people it is not okay to tell this person the truth? What does she gain from that? Because of course, Chelsea is not doing this out of an act of altruism. She's doing this for herself for selfish reasons. And I started thinking about other women in Hollywood who similarly put themselves in front of men and say no, he can also be a woman. And I come up with this list. Emma Watson is somebody that instantly comes to mind. I've talked about her on the show because it was so hideous that a girl who referred to herself as a feminist, right? I'm talking about the girl who played her my own engrainger in a Harry Potter referred herself as a feminist all throughout her career only to turn her back on JK Rowling, the person who produced the Harry Potter's book. And it basically gave her her entire career and said, I don't stand by JK because she says that she's a woman and she doesn't understand the plight of transgender individuals. So she stood up for men when it really mattered, when it really mattered for her to prove that she was a feminist and stand up to the mob in defense of actual women, she chose to stand up for men. Why? Another person that I thought of was Charlie Stearan. We talked about her on the show yesterday. Charlie Stearan is a person who has a child that she adopted and purports that he even though she adopted a boy is now a woman. And she was one of the first people in Hollywood to speak out on this, the first person to say, I have a child that identifies this way. Why? What about Jamila Jamil? You might not be familiar with her. She is a podcaster now. She was or is an actress. She's British. She is 37 years old. And she similarly speaks out and is one of the loudest voices to protect this transgender narrative. What do all of these women have in common? Well, feminism for sure to be certain these people of proportion that they are feminists and that they care about women, even if they aren't acting that part. But when you examine their personal lives, it becomes abundantly clear why it is so necessary for them to defend and explain the transgender movement. Emma Watson, she's 33 years old. So she still has time, but she is single. She now says that she is self partnered. She has essentially pushed men out of her life for various reasons. Oh, she once told a story about a man that tried to pay for her on a date. And she said, no, no, no, no, no. I want equality. I will pay for myself. I guess men didn't actually like that. And so she's becoming stranger and stranger as the years go on. She recently did a birthday post purporting that she has witches that are around her super strange. You can look it up on Instagram. I'm not making that up. Jamila Jamil, she once said that her own abortion when she was younger at eight weeks pregnant had left her with not a minute of regret, only quote deep relief and gratitude that I'd lived in a country that made abortion accessible and safe. Similarly for Chelsea Handler, she spoke out about the three abortions that she had in high school. She wrote about those abortions. She wrote about how proud she was to have those abortions. Well, Jamila Jamil is now alone and single and childless Chelsea Handler is now alone and single and childless Charlie Stherin while she has adopted children is alone has never been married and has never had a biological child. I often talk on this show on what happens if you play with feminism for too long. I have said colloquially and only half kidding that if you don't use your eggs, they scramble. And I'm not saying that there aren't exceptional circumstances of maybe a woman who has never had children and never had a husband and truly lives a remarkably fulfilled life. Maybe that you listening to this, but do not consider yourself the exception. Consider yourself the rule. Women were made to nurture whether it is a relationship, whether it is a child, women, our natural biological disposition is toward nurturing. And when we deny that within ourselves, when we deny ourselves family, we deny ourselves marriage and or children, we become something else. And so I think has happened with these women is that because they believe that they denied themselves their own femininity because there is a deep, tremendous underlying sadness that exists within all of these women. They now want everyone in the world to feel that they want to believe that femininity can be denied writ large that you know what, everything that I ever heard about what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a feminine is just an idea. It's an ideology. Anybody can be a woman. Anybody can turn off their womanhood because I've done it and I may be happy and I may be fulfilled. And actually, no, I'm not. So instead, I'm going to jump on the side of the people that want to erase femininity, that and want to erase what it means to be a woman that want to downgrade it and degrade it, really, to just lipsticks and heels and fake cosmetic procedures, all the things that do not equate to womanhood. And so that's what I believe is happening. I believe that radical feminism must necessarily find a home and lock arms amongst transgenderism. It's a sad truth. So let all of these women be a warning to you. Do not play with feminism for too long or you will have a very lonely, sad existence and turn yourself into an activist for things that are horrific. And that's all I'm going to say about that. Living a healthy lifestyle can be challenging when you're always on the go.

Okay, now it's time for some topics to show. So I make a lot of cultural predictions on this show and usually they pan out to be correct with time. Sometimes they get yelled at by you guys and you're like, you're wrong and then like some months or year passes and you're like, come back and you're right to comment. Oh, I didn't see it coming. It's okay. I'm making another prediction. I've already made it about JoJo Siwa. She was the girl who started on Dance Moms, super cute, ecstatic, and fun. Again, another child star. And there are a lot of bad things that happened as we learn in Hollywood when children find fame too young. And so I made the prediction that she was going to become like a Demi Lovato, that she doesn't actually know who she is. And she's becoming more and more extreme in the character adaptations of JoJo Siwa. First she came out as a lesbian and she said that it was because she essentially had a bad date and that she likes the way Jenna doing dances. And so I guess that makes her a lesbian. Well, she's now gone on to a podcast. And all I can say is I do not recognize this iteration of JoJo Siwa from the JoJo Siwa that we had yesterday. So before I show you the clip of her talking about sex on this podcast, I would at first like to put you in a time machine and we're going to go back 20 years ago. And this is JoJo Siwa appearing on Ellen because the contrast is well, stark. Take a listen to JoJo Siwa one year ago. I have watched 4,550 people come out on this stage and I just got to have that moment and I'm so happy. I'm so happy to. I just want to put my feet on it. You can do whatever you want to say. I'm just really happy to be here right now. She said, however you want. I'm happy to have you here. This is a big deal. You're here. You were born the same year that we started our show. That's wild. Yeah. You probably don't remember the first episode. No, that's me as a little baby. No, I don't remember the first episode, but I do remember watching everything on Ellen. I love all the little kids. I could name them all little Brielle, little Emma, Noah, Macy, all the little kids that have been on the show. Oh, number one fan. Yeah. Like have watched every single video. Love all of them so much. All the games. Oh my gosh, ones we drop the people. The one. Oh my gosh. You bet your wife. One of my favorites. So great. Mine too. So there you have it. JoJo Siwa. She's super bubbly. She's super cute. She's still appealing to children. Yes, she's a lesbian and she's so proud to be on Ellen stage. And of course, it's necessary once you become a lesbian to always wear rainbows or else how else would we know you were gay? So she's wearing a nice rainbow coat, but she's bubbly. She's fun and she's sparkly. So this is the JoJo civil adaptation of since she's been on YouTube, right? Appealing to children. Well, now she's on a podcast. I don't think she does her YouTube show anymore. I might be wrong about that. It doesn't matter. And she is essentially, I don't know, all I'm going to say is somebody different. Take a listen. It's hard for me. It's hard for the person that I'm dating or talking to because like, I can't do things. You know what I mean? Like how most people can go on a dinner date. I can't go on a dinner date normally. You know what I mean? Like I can, but I have to call and say JoJo Siwa, can I have a private table in the private room? And it's great. You know what I mean? But then you have to know that like you're not just you can't just go. Can't just go. And like, I also can't there's freedom in that there's freedom in that. And also any time that I'm away from my house. So like census is about gay sex. I've only had sex in the privacy of my own room. Besides your dad calling in size, my dad calling in. But in my own room or my own hotel room, like I mean, I'm, I don't know really what normal teenagers do, but I'm assuming that it happens. A car, a park, a bathroom stall, like whatever, you know what I mean? But like because of who I am, like, I can't do that. So that's JoJo Siwa today. And I guess now she's a butch lesbian. I don't know when that happened. She essentially became Rosie O'Donnell, kind of stole Rosie O'Donnell's thing. She's wearing a backwards cap. If you're listening to this on just audio and you're not seeing it, she's wearing a backwards cap. She's got on baggy jeans. Her whole style, just the whole demeanor looks very butch lesbian. She's wearing a big oversized black t-shirt, but it does still have a rainbow on it because else, how else would we know she was lesbian? You got away from the rainbow everywhere. Just how down you are with the movement. This is why I say that I think that she's a fake lesbian. I don't think JoJo Siwa knows who she is. A lot going on in that clip and I'd like to unpack all of it. First and foremost, how cringe to say that you think you're so famous that you can't go to a restaurant. I don't know what has happened to JoJo Siwa or why she thinks that she has Taylor Swift level fame and Kim Kardashian level fame. She doesn't. I can assure you that if she was walking down the street right now in London, where I am right now, and not a single person would recognize who she is. Maybe some children might recognize her, but she has not achieved the global level of fame that says that she can't walk down the street. That's already cringe. But then moving on to what necessarily must happen once you come out as a lesbian because there's something that is overtly sexual now about the LGBTQIA plus at every letter community where every single time they speak to us or if they're doing their pride parades, they have to be wearing a dildo. To show your allegiance to pride, to show that you are really proud, you need to be making out on the streets of Los Angeles during the entire Pride Month. You have to show people how proud you are to be sexual. It's obviously incredibly demeaning. There's something attractive about it, as I say, that you should not feel pride in what they are putting in demonstration during Pride Month. I would be horrified if this was my children. But for whatever reason, she believes that she's not having sex like a regular person because she, very famous JoJo who can't walk into a restaurant, JoJo Siwa, without being seen, has to have sex in the privacy of her own home. What am I missing here? What did she think that we're all straight people or people that are unknown are all having sex in bathroom stalls, incredibly young, incredibly immature. But it is this particular code switch that I'm the most offended by that. JoJo Siwa just keeps adapting who she is and adapting who her character is. I won't fault her, the clothing change, I think that with time, whenever you look back on photos, the way you dress when you're 19, 20 is not going to be the way that you dress when you are in your early 30s. Those things change, but the way that you speak and the way that you communicate are not things that change. And so I am again making the prognostication that JoJo Siwa is going to end up like Demi Lovato. This is a girl that is screaming for attention and she's getting attention for all the wrong reasons. So now we are on sex, butch, lesbian, Rosie O'Donnell, JoJo Siwa version, adding it to the list and with more time, there's going to be many more iterations of who she is. All right, guys, as a final cultural topic, I have to get to this. And there's so much that I want to say about this. There's no way that I'm going to have enough time. This is, I would probably say, the number one prediction that I have been making that divides my fans because I have a legion of Swifties that also listen to my podcast. I love you all and I do not fault you for being Taylor Swift fans. I have her music on my iPhone. Let me actually slow this down. I'm going to make myself at first say three really nice things about Taylor Swift, okay? Number one, she makes really catchy music. I like her old stuff better than her new stuff, but there is no doubt that Taylor Swift is definitely musically talented. Number two, nobody rocks a bang better than Taylor Swift. I mean, that girl actually looks better with bangs every time I see the way she wears it, whether it's shaggy, whether it's straight. I think she looks phenomenal. Number three, she is incredibly hard worker. So I deeply respect how hard she works. Her current era's tour, I think each of her stops is three hours on stage. If you guys knew how much energy that takes to commit, Taylor Swift had us off to. You're an incredibly hard worker. And now that I've gotten that out of the way so that the people that are Swifties, I also love me. Don't get too enraged to me. I'm going to tell you my very longstanding prediction about her. Taylor Swift is a ticking time bomb in conservative worlds. I have been saying this for a very long time. She has amassed a legion of fans. You've seen her kind of dabble her toe and say a thing here or there about politics. And Taylor Swift, it's the same age as me. We're both born 89. So that means that Taylor Swift is just about to turn 34 years old. And we've not yet seen Taylor Swift go fully crazy because she's had boys to keep her busy. Now, aside from the fact that she switches relationships way too fast, which I think is problematic. And it is a bad example to the young women that follow her and decide from the fact that she pretty much collects friends like their beanie babies, is where all things that I fault her for. The bigger issue when it comes to Taylor Swift is that she is an actual fraud. I mean, I cannot make this clear enough. And like I said, you might just you might disagree with me now, but I am telling you that I'm going to give it about five years for everything that I say to be proven right. Her entire stick and you know that one of the things that pains me the most are women that infantilize themselves, right? So I just told you that Taylor Swift is 34 years old. When you hear Taylor Swift talk to her audiences, she sounds like she's a little scared girl. That's her act. I'm a little scared girl. And I need my legion of 12 and 11 year olds fans to all attack the person or the thing that I'm no longer happy with. I mean, essentially, she is a bit of a glorified bully. She's routinely makes music about individuals that she feels she's been burned by and the way that she gets even with them. She's basically got the Mean Girl Burn book is she creates a catchy pop tune. And then she has a legion of people singing tunes that are that is actually about a real person. But nobody thinks about it this way because you say it's art. And maybe I should learn from that. Maybe what I should start doing on the show is creating catchy songs about everybody that annoys me that I don't like. Maybe I should make a catchy pop song about transgenderism and Dylan Mulvaney. I'll try that next year, but that's not going to be my stick today. I want to point you to just an example of what I'm talking about in terms of her pretending to be a little girl when in fact she is a woman that is 34 years old. This is a clip from her Netflix special, which was called a documentary that was called Miss Americana. And she's going to sell to audiences that she's just a scary little girl that wants to find her voice to speak out about politics as she's speaking to her parents. Take a listen. It really is a big deal. She votes against against fair pay for women. She votes against the reauthorization of the violence against women act, which is just basically protecting us from the best of abuse and stalking. Stalking. She votes. She thinks that if you're a gay couple, or even if you look like a gay couple, you should be allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant. It's really basic human rights and it's right and wrong at this point. And I can't see another commercial and see her disguising these policies behind the words, Tennessee Christian values. Those are Tennessee Christian values. I live in Tennessee. I am Christian. That's not what we stand for. I need to do this. I need you to just die. I need you to forgive me for doing it because I'm doing it. If Taylor Swift was a 15 year old little girl and sitting on that couch cross-legged crying in front of her mommy and daddy about how she wanted to find her voice, I would buy that. Again, Taylor Swift is 34 years old. She does not need to ask mommy and daddy to do anything at all. She never has to have for a very long time has she had to ask her parents whether she can do anything. She owns homes all over the world. In fact, she buys homes wherever her many boyfriends live every time that she's dating them. So this is her selling an act. She's very thoughtful. She's very intelligent. It's a marketing act of her once again being the little girl, which is fine because that marketing act works for her. But when she uses it to attack individuals and to send people, get her lesion of fans to send death threats to every single person that makes her angry, it becomes extremely problematic. I will give you just one example that made me really recognize how absolutely insane Taylor Swift is. Scooter Braun is a huge executive. He owns Big Machine Records with Scott Borchetta. This is who Big Machine Records is who Taylor Swift signed with when she was young, when she was just 15 years old. Something to know about Taylor Swift is she's never been a victim. Her parents are extremely wealthy when she decided that she wanted to be a singer and pretend to be from Nashville. Her parents moved her from her hometown in Pennsylvania down to Nashville and got her the meetings with music execs. This is not a come-up story where Taylor Swift was some shy girl who had a little bit of talent and was maybe living on the streets and got discovered. It was an executive decision between her parents and their lawyers to sign with Big Machine Records. Like I said, had lawyers that were present and at the time, they never knew how famous Taylor Swift was going to get. They made a bet that she might sell some music, but obviously if they had, if hindsight 2020 and knew how big of a star she was going to be, they would have never in a million years signed the deal that they signed then. So Taylor Swift decides, learns that her masters have been sold to Scooter Braun by Scott Borchetta, which is a regular business decision. She is allowed to buy her masters. Scooter Braun decided to buy her masters. When she found this out, rather than realizing, oh well, I lost out on a business deal, she instead appealed to her legion of crazy fans to attack Scooter Braun by pretending that she was a victim because she is a woman. Here's what she actually wrote on her tumbler. For years, I asked, I pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead, I was given an opportunity to sign back up to big machine records and earn one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music that I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos that I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars and then clubs and then arenas and then stadiums. Some facts about today's news. I learned about Scooter Braun's purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world. All I could think about was the incessant manipulative bullying that I've received at his hands for years. Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated in a legally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it. Or when his client Kanye West organized a revenge porn music video, which stripped my body naked. Now Scooter Braun has stripped me of my life's work that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it. This is my worst case scenario. This is what happens when you sign a deal at 15 to someone for whom the term loyalty is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says music has value, he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it. When I left my masters in Scott's hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them. Never in my worst nightmares, I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Anytime Scott Borchetta has heard the words Scooter Braun escaped my lips. It was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing. They both did controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them in perpetuity. That means forever. So you get this, she does this routinely. When she doesn't get what she wants, she paints it as this feminist moment as a little girl on a scared little girl, these big men are bullying me. No, you made a business decision not to purchase your masters. Scooter Braun took his money and he purchased your masters. Nothing happened to you. He didn't mug you on the street. He didn't do this to spite you who did this to make money, which is the point of business. And what happened as a result of this post, Scooter Braun and his then wife were harassed. They received death threats. They had to triple up on their security because Taylor Swift's little fans who don't understand the way business works, who don't understand that acting the part of an innocent little girl when you're actually in your 30s is actually wildly manipulative and sociopathic decided to attack them because their queen, Taylor Swift, is hurting and they have to make it better by threatening to kill people that are hurt by her. Again, there have been so many people in Hollywood who have said that Taylor Swift is manipulative and sociopathic, what she did to Katy Perry, marching hot girls against her in a music video when she got upset with her. All of her exes that are in all of her music videos. What she did to Kanye West, even though she's rewriting it in this post, which was absolutely disgusting, she got caught lying in Kim Kardashian exposed that lie by a snippet of a phone call, showed that Kanye West did the right thing and called Taylor Swift and got her permission. Over and over again, you see the extremes that she goes through to hide who she is and to get people to side on her. Why I talk about to side with her, why I discuss her on this show and why I say that she is someone that conservatives need to look out for is because eventually what is going to happen with Taylor Swift is because she is psychopathic, my prediction is that she's not going to find someone to marry her because men, when they get together with her, realize that she's got a couple of screws loose. She does. That's just a truth. She's remarkably talented. She's turned those screws loose into wonderful, bop-y music, but she's crazy. And because she's not going to find a husband, she is going to become like these women that I have listed that we spoke about in today's monologue. She is going to become Chelsea Handler on wheels, Chelsea Handler with a global following. Imagine what Taylor Swift could do if she wanted to get behind someone like a Dylan Mulvaney. Imagine with someone with her reach and her power and her actual global fame, not the imagined global thing that JoJo Ziwaz wanted to make people believe in a certain political philosophy. This is something to be concerned about. This is something to actually think about. When you get behind someone who is being solely dishonest about who she is as an individual, I again credit her for talent. I credit her for her success, but I know exactly who she is. I see right through her in the Little Girl Act, and she is going to be a problem for conservatives in the future when she makes the switch and goes fully crazy and jumps into politics full time as they all do when they get around the age of 40.
