    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman to our daily town hall here at CR podcast your host Daniel Horowitz back here today for the end of the week Friday the 14th your only source of truly independent conservative talk strategy and focus and that's really the thing we will need an independence movement if we are to hope to fight for our life liberty and property humanity soul body mind which is all at stake all on the chopping block has been on the chopping block it will not happen with the current fake phony opposition not just the Republican Party in America but really we're seeing this certainly with the Tories in the UK all of the party strategically set up to serve as controlled opposition and it's it's time we realize that it's time we recognize that never has there been such a dichotomy between the type of issues the severity of issues confronting us the severity of the actions and consequences of the policies by the incumbent leftist party yet the lack of focus from the supposed right-leaning opposition it's almost as if these issues don't matter they're not even campaigning on the issues that matter they're not even calling a flag I never could have imagined a couple years ago we would live in times like this yes America was very profligate libertine the social values were in the toilet but people like their stuff they like the opulence they like their comforts I never thought we would have the government literally locking down killing millions rounding up political opponents evidently one of the 12 pro-life activists just locked up by the FBI was a 95 year old Holocaust survivor singing hymns outside of of a Planned Parenthood or something I never thought this would happen and see we would have a Republican Party doesn't even call a flag doesn't say Democrats bite in you just did what you got to be kidding me and just raising cane about it they don't say a word so I never thought it would get this bad but in my mind I was hoping would get really bad and what I thought really bad at that time was nothing like what we're facing today I couldn't have even written a script like this but at least it would finally elicit a righteous reaction we would suffer but that would force a reaction to finally reform government and bring us back to the constitution in a way that we really never wore my entire lifetime but instead it's the opposite it's worse than I could have imagined and Republicans aren't even in in word much less deed raising awareness of it see typically no one party in a stable political system with real opponents no one party could get too far a field with destructive unpopular policies without the other side immediately crying bloody murder right because they would immediately contest it would immediately challenge it and maybe they'd be able to get a couple yards down the field with it but eventually it would grind them down because it would raise such outrage they would bring the data and information and all the anecdotes and the suffering of the people yet what the GOP is doing by allowing them to arson and arson and they're like hey it's it's a nice nice sunny day out here hey Kanye West hey whatever other distraction the day well in the eyes of the people makes it look like it's consensus well I guess it's not a problem I guess everyone agrees that the vaccines are where it's at I guess everyone agrees that this is what we need to do with illegal immigration I guess everyone agrees that January 6 was an interaction or at the very least if the people don't form a consensus behind it because the party's former consensus and I don't think that's happening in this case they just put it on the back burner of their minds we know that no matter how destructive an issue is there's so many distractions people are artfully distracted with the Google Apple headlines that they won't think about something so historic for that for bad reasons right in front of their eyes this is how Biden and really Biden is just a carcass but these elite globalist masters the fourth Reich could get away with even declaring an emergency for another 90 days when it's over here we are Joe Biden slipped up and said the emergency is over with a normal party would have been the very next day Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy would have held a joint press conference major governors other people wait you just said what so you admit this is over with and you're continuing to fund Pfizer and Moderna after millions of adverse events to approve a shot for babies for a variant that doesn't affect anyone for a virus that never affected kids based on a study of eight mice I mean the talking points the press releases write themselves they love talking points right that that's what they love okay you got it in spades this is not January 2021 when it's only brave souls like us that fought it it takes nothing to fight it now you have reams of experts you have reams of data you have I mean heck you have Paul Offit who's one of the most famous vaccinologists of the generation he's on the FDA advisory board he supported the vaccines up to wazoo but then it got so bad he was like oh dude like okay no this this is a problem and he's actively almost like campaigning on all of media against the boosters and the media is actually not even that bed with it especially the local Philadelphia media he's a he's big in Philadelphia he works in Philadelphia what's it called chop children's hospital Philadelphia and they they bring him on pretty complimentary and even he said look this thing is a big problem you shouldn't ask tens of billions of people to get a vaccine based on my data have you heard Kevin McCarthy or Mitch McConnell say a word about this all the studies all the data I don't even have time to go through everything every day but every day I could bring you another two dozen new studies papers on damage to another part of the body that they cause negative efficacy and to this day Republicans not only didn't say whoa Biden we are not passing this CR unless the emergency is rescinded the prep act is reformed funding for Pfizer and Moderna suspended we have an investigation into all of this we offer compensation for those injured we offer grants to expedite studies for diagnosis and treatment of these injuries not a word no matter how much it was like yeah Democrats will be like yeah we just killed 10 million people with the COVID shots and Republicans would go on the next day talking about you know the economy should really bad um a vote Republican like what what do you what just happened there it's it's so bizarre Republicans are even behind what a lot of the the medical profession people in terms of coming to to the truth on this yet because they declined to do this not only are the Democrats not held accountable it's not all just like we we thought it would be a matter of the Democrats and the Biden administration just moving on just gliding into the next thing without saying a word okay you know we're just just moving on they're not even moving on this is huge news yesterday this is from PBS it's all over the news obviously it should be a big story Biden administration extends COVID-19 public health emergency for another 90 days and they haven't said a word they still haven't said a word they didn't respond before they didn't respond to that so in other words typically you have 50 50 America maybe you could push a policy that's 40 60 60 percent opposition but Democrats could push something that is killing people and could have five percent support right only like four percent of the people got the boosters yet they could succeed in doing it and do even worse and build upon it because Republicans will never hold them accountable they won't even throw the flag much less do anything about it and they promised to funded it's not like they're like oh my gosh we know this after the revelation of Pfizer at the EU Commission that they admit they never even studied transmission we are going to make sure all the mandates are defunded at least that the mandates got for which you defund the shots themselves but at least the mandates no they're not even promising in the omnibus they plan to write in the lame duck to undercut an incoming GOP majority that they're saying you need to vote for for an entire year giving the Democrats the full budget at least they look we're going to demand it into the mandates they're not mentioning a word that omnibus is going to fund Pfizer and Moderna up the wazoo all of their products every single one of them we're going to discuss is negative efficacy causes rebounds and causes serious known and unknown injury and death and they're funding it they're gonna continue funding it they're not promising not to fund it think about this so the emergency is extending for 90 days so that means it's gonna go into mid-January that would be two weeks or so after Kevin McCarthy is is you know 99% chance sworn in a speaker see what what Kevin McCarthy should have said is that Mitch McConnell you do not undercut my leverage as incoming speaker pass a CR that expires not in December so they could write an omnibus then for the rest of the fiscal year but have it expire at the end of January and then you would come in and that's where you had your have your leverage Biden we will not send you a budget bill unless the emergency goes bye bye but no now they would have given away their leverage they would have given it away sealed sign sealed and delivered to Biden's desk for signature the entire FY 2023 budget so now they won't even have any leverage but then again they don't need it because he's not even rhetorically saying you need to get rid of it but not willing to use the leverage that was like 2010 you know they'd say we hate Obamacare but they wouldn't really use the proper leverage to fight it now they're not even articulating it it's utterly insane that is the perfidy of the Republican Party Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy he's not even rhetorically promising us on anything no matter what comes out yeah likely half a million people died in America from this no problem they're gonna continue funding it's not like he just doesn't want to unravel the last two and a half years but we've moved on we haven't moved on the emergency is still there the prep act is still there the shots are still there and by the way the cases will go up because the shots induce viral immune escape so come Janimos they look it's hard the wintery of all these cases we need to extend the emergency another 90 days and therefore allow emergency use authorization of more death products so you got to take your own destiny in your own hands you got to go independent one of the ways of doing that is by securing your food security 60% of us poor production comes from one company owned by the freakin Chinese the rest of it is full of garbage antibiotics pro-inflammatory additives and all sorts of stuff that causes cancer and heart disease and whatever they are making it that you can't get healthy protein well thankfully members of this audience can by signing up for the monthly mink boxes at minkbox.com conservative you could not only get the best tasting healthy is the grass fed grass finished beef and lamb pestered pork and chicken and sustainable wild caught Alaskan salmon straight to your door every month but you could also get a free filet mignon for a year by paying for those monthly boxes so this is the best tasting filet mignon you'll ever have all the while securing your food security supporting American independent farmers that do it right the way it should be before the cartel took over so again get linked with mink go to m-o-i-n-k box.com slash conservative that's mink box.com slash conservative best tasting meat and chicken and fish as well as free filet mignon while you can still get it of course um so like you speak to the average conservative the own the libs type of conservative commentators and you get the impression that there there's never been a better time to be alive they're enjoying it ha ha the Biden administration is desperate their fools look at them the economy is terrible ha ha ha like why is that ha ha ha that that's bad for us oh no because then we're going to defeat them uh no you're not why do you think they don't care so first of all you have to understand that on the one hand it's not like no matter how bad and destructive they are especially because republicans refuse to actually acknowledge it and expose their weakest most perfittest policies so it's not like there's a road map to getting 60 70 80 Senate seats right where in one election you essentially wash out 80% of the democrats saying even a wave is nowhere near that in american politics it's no matter what the blue states are blue you might have a fluke here and there you'll win a district here and there in a blue state could happen probably will happen but for the most part it's not like i i mean also just based on the senate map the type of sentences that are up it's mathematically impossible anyway for them to even get 60 seats and that includes mitt romney and susan colons lee'samer koski all these you know tom tillus all these rhinos anyway i mean that are downright to the left of even mitch mcconnell but forgetting about that you don't you don't have that ability so it's not like they're gonna lose everything where theoretically if republicans ever got some principles and believed in something they could just win an election and just march right in with their policies which they wouldn't do anyway because they don't believe in anything and they believe in what the democrats believe in but it's not like they're scared of that because they do have a certain minimum that they're always going to be able to hold and they know that the governors are bought out and they're not going to do what i say they should do so at a federal level they have the presidency and then in addition they're going to have a filibuster enabling minority in the senate no matter what so and they know republicans aren't going to use the budget bill and in fact they're purposely getting rid of it for the first entire year so they're not scared of that but also it's not democrats per se that that run the show it's not like the elected democrats in the senate and house that's old thinking it should be that way if we were in a healthy republic it would be congress that mattered it doesn't it's a cabal of masters of the universe that work with the bureaucracies and the so-called private sector that's not it's an artificial monopoly created by government over the years to get what they want knowing that republicans with the levers of power they have will never do what it takes to even wage an information warfare to expose them much less used leverage points power-wise to downright halt their advance in action so that's why they're just not scared they're not bothered by that never forget that they're not bothered by it they know that their policies will continue no matter what and this is how they're able to approve a shot with no clinical trial for children after the president already said the pandemic's over it's literally in the FDA press release i'm just going to read to you for each of the bivalent covid-19 vaccines meaning one's modernos version one's Pfizer's authorized today the FDA relied on an immune response and safety data that it had previously evaluated from a clinical study in adults openly yeah well we're using old data from the old shots like what and it's totally fine because no one will hold them accountable for it that's what people need to understand they're not scared they're not bothered by it let me give you a perfect example of this there's a lot of talk in the news about um aoc aoc and a lot of the conservative thumb suckers are really excited about this because it's another own the libs moment it's an important story but they're taking the wrong lesson from it so it's like oh aoc was humiliated she couldn't be left enough for a left-wing base she shows up at a town hall and they just lambasted her you say you're anti-war but really you've thrown in with the elite warmongers you know just pumping full-hearted support into the ukraine war and and you're a fraud and they're like ha ha ha look at aoc she became a fool but they're missing the point the point is it's not so much right versus left anymore it's not about that it's not about oh the democrats want this republicans want this what's interesting is that those two individuals that spoke up they had twitter accounts and they were getting very popular because they gained a lot of notoriety i forget their names twitter suspended their accounts i mean these are these are hardcore left-wing bernie sanders type of people they actually had their accounts suspended because it's not so much oh they only suspend conservatives it's not about that those terms don't mean anything because aoc it's not that aoc was anti-war she was never anti-war aoc was always just a mindless conduit a supporter of the next current thing so now the next current thing is ukraine so you have to support a war so they support it they'll turn off and on that faucet is needed the point is aoc is a nothing the democrats are nothing they'll just follow the leaders and the leaders are not these psychopaths that are brainless you know serving in congress it's the people associated roughly with the gates of the sources wef whatever that is fizer moderna big pharma big big banking all of that that's where it is that's where the power structure is and on that front yes aoc and mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy literally agree a hundred percent on arsenic our future over russia you know biden's warning he might embargo aluminum from russia could you imagine what that's going to cause and that's done on purpose and mcconnell mccarthy would totally support that if you had a vote on an embargo of aluminum russian in congress it would gain you know all but 30 40 house republicans support from them so that's why they don't care because they they buy off both parties they agree you look at the uk just to understand a fake opposition the republicans are no different it's just they're a little bit more open there because the people are less conservative than in america but you look at liz truss she just announced an energy plan that will basically focus on conservation not production of natural oil natural energy and by the way fred are one of our long time listeners had a great idea he noted that i said we shouldn't use the word fossil fuel that's their term so he came up a great term is natural energy natural energy because there's nothing natural about solar panels it takes so many heavy metals and and chemicals to put that stuff up yeah sun is natural wind is not natural not the way they're capturing it water is natural likewise coal oil and gas are natural they are replenished and god designed it that way but anyway she's she's a raving lunatic less than a month into her tenure so today the big news is she appointed this guy jeremy hunt as as her finance minister in the uk i want you to listen to this clip from the now the chancellor of the uk jeremy hunt from during the lockdowns take a listen right here i very much agree with the central point in gables paper that we should be aiming for zero infection and elimination of the disease because that is basically the approach taken in countries which have a sars strategy as opposed to a flu strategy and those are the countries that have overwhelmed when you've been the most successful in in tackling coronavirus um and uh you know i just my sister uh lives in Beijing and she flew back to Beijing in the middle of lockdown and just to give you an idea of the contrast uh she was escorted from the airport in Beijing to her home by ministry of health officials and then uh put into her home for two weeks quarantine the door was sealed and uh she had a police car sitting outside a house uh periodically and i'm not saying we go that far in this country but i just think it's an indication of how serious they are in the countries that have had to deal with sars about stopping at the root every possible source of infection so you heard that he praised China's lockdown he had a smirk on his face you have to see it he was like yeah they put people in concentration camps it really worked maybe won't go quite as far that is the conservative government's finance minister right now so that's what's so bizarre you could have one side get into power do the most egregious unpopular immoral illogical destructive things that are not just destructive values wise but literally affect the people's quality of life you know before no one cared about values that was our big problem but now it literally does i mean you could totally get people are anxious with the supply chain stuff and the persecution everything you could totally win elections on this you could have your principles and electoral success work in tandem but they won't because they're bought out by the same system on what actually matters they're literally the same and it's even better for them when the so-called right-leaning party is doing their most transformational things because if you have the left-wing party there's there's always this concern some people in the right-wing party will start raising awareness yelling about it raising concern but when you get the right-leaning party to do it well the left certainly is not going to fight it because they support it and then the right's like well we don't want to damage our guy we have to support trump remember that i mean covid fascism started literally under trump not by then fizer fascism the fizer death shots all of it he brags about he digs credit for it to this day there's actually an old saying in this rally politics it takes the right to make peace and the left to make war and their point was because whenever you have a war it's under the right-leaning government the left will scream bloody murder but if it's under the left and the right you know always wants to be patriotic and support the troops so they're not going to fight it and that's how you get consensus and vice versa with the so-called peace deals when when isra would like you know commit suicide and give their stuff to his bolan hamas by the way speaking of that uh there's this left-wing uh prime minister that's interim while they have an election the biden administration pressure them to basically give away their offshore natural gas reserves to his bola unbelievable so not only are they arsenic our uh our reserves they want to make sure globally nobody is using it because again just like with covid they didn't like a sweeten they didn't want a control group they don't want you know one country living high in the hog with oil gas and coal and nuclear and everyone else languishing because people are gonna say hey i want what they want just like with the lockdowns they had to have every government almost every global government did it so everyone's gonna do the energy lockdown transhumanism as well so that's the story that's why the elections don't matter and it's not even like you could try to believe in it man i i just i just want to believe i i just want to know even i did this until fairly recently as much as i knew the republicans were frauds this time of year you know couple weeks before the elections i would get swept up in the fervor it's just because the left is so obnoxious the democrats are so obnoxious just just let the republican win and then we'll we'll try to pressure him to do the right thing when he gets elected but now they're not even promising so everyone is obsessed with the az versus fetterman race but if you look carefully what's the outrage over it's not over any policy it's over the fact that fetterman is a vegetable and he's not fit to serve okay i mean it's true but it's like so you have a vegetable communist versus a versus a lucid communist i frankly i'd rather have the vegetable and ironically the stroke almost for sure came i mean this guy's in his 40s the stroke almost for sure came from fetterman getting the shots for which az not only won't call it out he is more supportive of it than the democrats so there's just news today az announced that he supports biden's marijuana pardons and rejects minimum prison sentences so the one issue he's kind of running on is tough on crime because fetterman literally wants to open up the prisons but even then on the issues that matter which are mandatory minimums that's the way to lock people up um and mind you the mandatories it wasn't as draconian as people say most of them got through that what's called the safety valve all the first timers were eligible for that um it wasn't locking up low-level people and like an idiot he's like we shouldn't tie the hands of the judges the judges are animals who do you think that becomes a judge who do you think is in the legal profession those who believe that only january sixers should be locked up but anyway like an idiot like i support biden again a republican party was a wait a minute wait a minute who is serving time for a simple possession of marijuana and federal prison and why they're the cartel illegal alien traffickers we have the data to point this out this this is not hard 91.5 percent we're caught near the border to the cartel traffickers that puts a whole different spin on it but yet not only don't republicans throw that punch they actually agree agree to biden's point but yeah the lucid communists are going to do really well against the vegetable communists in this election what a great time to be alive own the libs every one of my colleagues is like that almost everyone but in reality the magnitude of what people have suffered the last few years life liberty property dreams of small business owners destroyed that was the big story of the lockdowns you know we talked a lot about civil liberties and controlling people in the transhumanism and and the compliance in order to get us into this mode of complying to the great reset and that's all true but a big part of the lockdown itself was really to consolidate the market share for the big corporate players and destroy small business which was always the bulwark against tyranny the broad swath of the middle-class middle upper-income people providing goods and services that can't be centralized and monopolized by the government-controlled entities again Walmart Amazon Black Rock I mean Vanguard these these places are essentially Freddie May or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the post office their GSEs their government sponsored entities through and through they're not private I have no problem inherently with large corporations naturally it's just almost all of them are not natural anymore the pain and nobody is addressing them nobody has a plan how to rebalance the power from small businesses I have a plan I would exempt small businesses from a number of regulations and tax taxes for a period of of 10 years only small businesses I don't like means testing on a individual level or corporate level none of us do but what do you do when the government did the ultimate mandate that that tip to playing field back you have to tip it back to reach that equilibrium you can't just start out okay now now we're equal no more lockdown well that the damage is done I could read to you all the painful emails I get from military members from people that have no treatment for COVID no treatment for the shot injuries lost loved ones the amount of death is crazy the amount of long-term injury is out of control the dreams destroyed I'll just read you one one email I got last night I just need to vent we lost our five bedroom three bath home thanks to COVID and I've been unable to find a rental we can afford the we F in their dystopian ad tells us that we will rent everything we need and be happy so at this point we were looking at renting a one bedroom apartment one fourth the size of our home at two and a half times the cost of our monthly mortgage payments oh wait we can't even do that because we have been trying for months and our application is always rejected because our house was foreclosed on because the government destroyed our small business in solar livelihood so we are we are a bad risk you know by the way it's interesting that for years they force people banks to lend to people that shouldn't get loans and whatever and get credit that that that were reckless yet here you have small business owners that had their livelihood destroyed all these laptop people they enjoyed it they they didn't lose a penny and I'll tell you yours truly I did not lose a penny of income I was able to to earn income indebted to you guys otherwise that'd be nothing I was able to I didn't have to wear a mask I didn't have to get a shot I I wasn't harmed by it in that sense so many people were like that but then there's the forgotten people it's a minority it's a small minority but it's a lot of people in a country 330 million that they you know middle upper income had small businesses in this case both the husband and wife so they're self-employed so now the government literally destroyed their business and now they're like hey you're bad risk we also have no work history after being self-employed for decades and we are now working many old jobs making less money than we need to get by and our daughter had to give up on our MBA after finding herself thrust out into the world unprepared no longer having the ability to pay for school she has had to start cosmetology school at nights while working at a restaurant during the day and renting a shared room she is so excited at the prospect of abandoning her lifelong goals and cutting hair for a living instead how could we just walk away from this yet name me the republican of consequence that is even tapping into this even telling the story much less promising to do something about it they need reparations Pfizer and Moderna need to be made made to pay for vaccine injury pay for small businesses destroyed those people that did the gain of function research when we find them some of them we know who they are but the kind of the entire net of it they need to be sued for everything they have and that needs to be redistributed to the people who got harmed and that's redistributed redistribution of wealth I can get behind because the government caused that they are in that that's reparations I just it is so sad and she said your doom and gloom give me hope somehow which is nice to hear because I think the hope is that at least there's someone it's like you and you have an itch somewhere on your back that you can't quite reach and it's very frustrating it's it's it's a satisfying when you can finally reach it finally finally finally reach it because if you're actually articulating and diagnosing the problem there's some hope with God's help of solving that problem of redressing that grievance but if you if you're distracted and you're talking about Kanye West or this or that when we have civilization literally life liberty property in its most literal sense being destroyed the human mind the human soul the human lived experience being destroyed families continuity of parents to children man and woman and these guys are just flatulating are you kidding me nothing matters how do you think republicans have all this money then are I see they have like record a record war chest heading into this home stretch of the election we know all the moneyed industries every single one of them without exception is inexorably on the other side of every issue how do they get the money I'm saying even a fake mealy mouth republican why would they donate have you ever thought that look at look at financial services look at health care okay look at those the biggest industries look at where they stand on traniism medical freedom the border crime all these issues you know republicans are at least talking about being tough on crime that is one issue they're talking about not really they're blaming the democrats for what's going on they're not saying what they're going to do about it and in fact one of the things you would do is mandatory minimums if you don't want to do it on drug crimes but certainly on on you know rape murder robbery certain number three strikes and you're out on violent crimes you should all agree to and no then maybe a single one even campaigning on that formal police but that's meaningless you the police will apprehend them but the system will let them go but all the industries oppose that they're for criminal justice to form republicans are kind of talking tough on the border we talked about this many times i'm going to do what it takes and they're still in the pockets of the open borders but why would they support them with such harmful rhetoric the answer is they're not stupid they know they're not going to do anything about it and they want to grease the skids of both sides because it's the same side and you need the same side so you can have just one side of the same side because then people will rebel against it right and people are rebelling but they have no choice but to do what vote republican that's the rebellion so they're going to make sure the other side is perfectly bought out that's the bottom line that's why nothing will change that's why the left doesn't fear a republican tsunami and yet the conservatives are happy about this while the people suffer i don't know i guess the problem with a lot of these republicans is that they're cut from the same cloth as the democrats and they just don't feel it it just doesn't bother them it's just not bad enough so they don't feel like oh my gosh we're all going to die here uh they're just living a cushy life and it just doesn't bother them they don't feel a sense of urgency you know back to this email i got i'm just going to read just you know her thoughts her rant the destruction this government has inflicted on its people from destroying small businesses to families losing their homes to law schooling from which children will never recover to permanent brain damage and depressed IQs from the masks to millions of americans being disenfranchised for daring to engage in independent thought to creating invading armies to over on our borders to people dropping dead left and right seems akin to a country ravaged by war everything is in upheaval everyone has to start over while the war profiteers are counting their stacks of cash i can't even list all the atrocities we have all lost our rights even the most basic right of all bodily autonomy autonomy to live what else can i conclude but that my country has declared war on its own citizens our government has made us war refuges in our own country and where do you go you know i got another email from someone in the frisco school board school not school board school law district frisco texas so this is not dallas proper there should be a conservative area and they're they're still into uh they're into traniism in in in the school district they're into code fascism traniism it's not like you could escape this and that's really the key folks it's not about the national election it's not about connye west or you know everyone's looking for uh elan musk or trump too everyone wants this celebrity who's just going to come and change everything it's not going to happen that way you should be able to get together if you have an area that voted majority for trump you should be able to get together in that area and force your will on the local culture the mother standing up at these school boards and running for a school board and other similar similar local offices that's what matters more it's not going to be one massive log that you dump lighter fluid on and a fire a bonfire arises rises from there i mean there's no shortcut to it you got to build that campfire properly with the kynling wood and the ability to to layer it and that's what it means to start out local at least in the most conservative areas like i said if you took there's three thousand counties in the country if you took the 20 percent most conservative ones just just 20 percent most conservative now would easily get you into super majority you know trump territory and have those areas free from federal tyranny free from medical tyranny free from energy tyranny free from the homosexual agenda and and all of its analogs just that alone i take that any day the week we're no longer saving our country because it's lost it's it's it's killed it's dead but that's a comforting thought because that's a that's a big task and we're never going to succeed in that i hate to be crude here but it's kind of like people who suffer through the uh a loved one having just end-stage life illness and it's tough you want them to survive maybe i could do this maybe you could do that the care is tough and and you you want to extend every day of their life it's terribly sad when they die but then there's also this part while you know i no longer have to wake up every day fearing the person's gonna die i mean it's over with and it's kind of taken off our plate what we're tasked with is our own self survival not so much as a country because it's gone but somewhere maybe we could reconstitute a country one day but at least for now some sort of ad hoc sanctuary where we might be under the auspices of the same flag but politically we have a deterrent against any intervention in our affairs that's what we need to do we totally have the ability to do that in many parts of the country but there's no organized political will because all that organized political will is sucked up into nonsense utter nonsense it's not getting better not getting better at all now before we get too late today i did want to touch on an important covid story so what we've noticed is that every single thing that pharma has made every single action that government has promulgated under the guise of saving lives has not only failed to do that but was negative effective and then cost lives with so many things it turns out that every single drug that they approved is deadly the shots from desivere um allumiant in the icu's they were using causes blood clots guess what else now causes blood clots this is a huge huge story i want to make sure we didn't go by this week for getting it this is from the daily mail Pfizer's flagship covid drug can have dangerous interactions with common medications for review as found paxlovid gained emergency use of authorization the u.s in december last year it's been given to millions of people paxlovid can cause serious health problems when coupled with heart disease medications such as statins and blood thinners researchers from lehi hospital medical center harvard medical school and other u.s. institutions found the covid drug can increase the risk of developing blood clots when taken with blood thinners how about it blood clots every last thing they do it can also cause in a regular heartbeat when combined with drugs for heart pain and when taken alongside statins it can be toxic to the liver oh i want you guys to understand this is not just some in the weeds science medicine story that like ho ham i don't know i'm not a doctor what do i care what do i know this is insane because we now have a situation where pharmacies without a doctor's prescription can give out like candy paxlovid that causes blood clots that interacts with essentially the medications that a majority of seniors are on and they could just hand that out unlimited no safety trials no data uh an efficacy trials outside of the manufacturers own trials that are now proven to be fraud from head to toe they could do all of that yet that same pharmacist could turn down in my case pseudofed and the safest essential drugs with a doctor's prescription it just it's not just about medicine and shows how medicine is broken and and biomedical tyranny and fascism and everything is just a conduit for pharma corruption so what gets in their way even a doctor can't do what helps grease their profits even if pharmacist could become a doctor that's all true but it's emblematic of the fourth Reich in the hierarchy that they've created how they could turn on and off that faucet as needed it's not hypocrisy it's hierarchy that's the fourth Reich that's what it's built on so we'll be like man we are so careful with things i mean we're gonna have oversight um even the safety safe its drugs we're not gonna want to prescribe off label all right wow it's kind of dumb but i guess you're just really strict but then a minute later you'll take a novel drug now mixed with an age drug no safety and efficacy outside of the own manufacturer's corruption you already know you have a metallic taste in your mouth from it you already know it's contraindicated with 30 categories of drugs now it could cause blood clotting isn't that interesting everything seems to cause blood clotting wondering what's behind that and and and it's all good and by the way by the way what's the other drug that we spent 1.2 billion dollars on taxpayers did Merck's Monopirivir you don't hear about that much this from the national post in Canada covid drug and 450 million deal with Canada failed to cut deaths hospitalization so i guess at Canada spent 450 million we spent 1.2 billion there's a study it was a lie so not only is it mutagenic carcinogenic extremely dangerous everyone agreed it was caused birth defects in the mice it's speaking of mice trials they had it and and and it caused bone uh retarded to bone growth in the offspring of the mice it seemed to be positive development the multiple fronts offering a new weapon against covid they you know they went up and bought it but results of a major independent trial of the medication have cast new doubt over those deals concluding that Monopirivir does not better than standard care in lowering the rate of death or hospitalization of covid patients its main selling point the study did find that patient symptoms were resolved faster somehow with viral load but remember we were told it had a 60 reduction in death but that was done by Merck itself and again the budget bills that republicans are signing off on have tons of money spent for that and there's nothing no desire to even investigate they're not even gonna hold hearings on this much less cut off funding much less reform for the future so that there's liability reform the prep act reform the vaccine act of 86 pay for reparations nothing none of this this stuff is biblical all of it these are not rare drugs they're being given to the entire population just like the shots and it just doesn't matter it just doesn't matter what are we gonna do republicans are bought out by pharma just as much imagine republicans being just as pro abortion and pro gun control as democrats right you wouldn't vote for them but what's a bigger issue what's an issue of greater consequence again i mean i for the first time i was able to get a carriers permit i benefited from it but whoopi do what is it going to do for me what is it going to do for me when the fbi comes knocking on my door what's it going to do for me it's no longer the the palladium of liberty look i love guns i think you should be trained i think even with the persecution of people defend themselves it's better to be tried by 12 than carried by six but in terms of being a bulwark against tyranny that's outdated biden is not wrong when he says you know you're gonna need fighter jets if you want to you know push back against the government with it he's not wrong he's not wrong at all and by the way murk is developing along with moderna a cancer vaccine for melanoma that sounds really safe and this is what they're going to do they're going to produce a bunch of heart drugs a bunch of blood clotting drugs a bunch of cancer drugs and they'll get emergency use authorization for them they'll get to benefit from the fruits of their crime because again the theme today there is no political movement or party that will shed light up on it outside of a few people the hospitals that committed genocide they always complain they don't have money seven large hospital systems in north carolina received 1.5 billion in covid relief money while collectively seeing their cash and investments grow by 7.1 billion from 2019 to 2021 now you know what why they did what they did it's working for them see this is what you have to realize for the people that are doing this the masters of the universe this system works for them because they made it work for them so they don't feel a sense of urgency remember the state hospital systems are like the dominant lobbyist in any state legislative government they're often the largest employers in the state that's why you don't hear anything from republicans again these are not tough issues we're in desivir it's repudiated a hundred times over that's what i'm saying i'm not asking them to do something that pulls bad this is no longer those first months of the pandemic and even then it was because they people weren't getting the right information because the republicans weren't fighting it where everyone supported masks and everything now this stuff outside of the real weirdos it's repudiated the shots too people are voting with their feet there's too many getting them but it is a minority republicans are nowhere i want to just end today with one data point that really encapsulates the magnitude of this genocide this from michael simmons at the uk spectator some nine million working age people are out of work and are no longer working looking for work in the uk figures released by the office for national statistics reveal that the number has grown by 630 000 since before the pandemic 630 000 additional people out of work in the uk and it clicked in my mind you know how i like i like it when you have grouping of data points that hone in on almost the exact rough number so remember we saw in the united states 3.2 million additional people identifying as disabled according to the bureau of um labor statistics survey coinciding exactly and by the way those numbers don't coincide with the pandemic it's with the beginning of 2021 which is the uptake of the shots and you know what's interesting if you extrapolate the population of the u.s you know it's roughly times five five times greater than that of the uk 630 000 times five you almost get that exact number of the excess people identifying as disabled in the u.s since the uptake of the shots this is an enormous enormous holocaust that has been committed but they but not only are they not going to be held accountable for what they did they're going to be able to continue doubling and tripling down and benefiting from it the staphon bandsl the moderno ceo recently told sky news that they have a heart muscle mRNA shot that helps for heart attacks blood vessel issues cancers genetic disorders they're they're looking for mRNA for all that and how covid allowed them to develop this transhumanist technology that they always wanted but it will now so what happened was you know under the old regime they could never get this stuff approved so covid was planned and we all know this now they literally say this that allowed them the fauci is quoted as saying this the ceo of bayer said that this stuff would have never flown with the people covid allowed it to and then boom suddenly we have 15 other viruses with mrna shots coming out and we have mRNA that's going to be used for cancer heart attack blood cuts coincidentally all the things that the shots cause and guess what that's why we can now understand how mo derna just sat there with all these patents on everything for years years and never produced a product or brought a product to market and then suddenly within three minutes a company that never brought a product to market was the leader one of the two leaders in the biggest product ever the covid shots and then now they're suddenly bringing out all the other technology it was all planned that you tell me that's not forth right you show me what rivals that in magnitude of evil and destruction and yet none of this exists in the minds and hearts of the top republican officials and the top so-called conservative voices and influencers and folks that's why we are where we are we got a break through this i welcome your thoughts common strategies concerns daniel harwitz at startmail dot com is the email at c19 truth bombs on telegram folks we had a really productive week as always again next week i'll have a pre-tape for monday be out tuesday be back
