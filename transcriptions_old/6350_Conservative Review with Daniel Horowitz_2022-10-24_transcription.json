    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our life our liberty our property and to use the policies the strategies and the initiatives that matter in the way they matter at the timely matter that's a tall order but that is our agenda we are relentlessly focused on what matters Daniel Harowitz back here today at CR podcast blaze media brand new week of broadcast Monday October 21st and a lot of people ask me they'll bump into me in a store on the streets and the neighborhood at services and I'll say hey Daniel must be really busy for you you know before the election and everything and I look at them and say actually you know it's kind of in a holding pattern it's relatively quiet now I'll really get busy after the election and they don't understand what I'm saying you guys do because after the election is when you have the leverage points on policy on strategy on leadership elections for Congress for state legislatures for things that governors should be doing that attorneys general in the states should be doing if only Republican voters were as focused on that stuff as they were on the election the elections that they work so hard on would actually be meaningful but absent that focus they're not meaningful so that's why the next two weeks we're gonna largely focus on the news of the day through the prism of how in the world do we break this GOP fake illusion of opposition and force them to either really oppose the WEF trans humanist agenda the fourth Reich let's just use the fourth Reich for short form of all of our grievances or at least expose the mountain open so they can't continue to play this double game and we talked about this a lot last week and I want to continue with some examples this week of how they're going to continue to try to events this illusion of an opposition while all the policies that matter get worse and like we said the only things that actually matter are two things the budget and debt ceiling votes in Congress and the red states willing to pass sovereignty bills push back against the federal government and protect our liberties take their own destiny in their own hands anything short of that is meaningless now the two have a lot to do with each other in other words if you had a party that let's say only had the house or the house in the Senate but a not 60 votes in the Senate not the presidency you would pass stand alone legislation you would hold hearings in addition to using the budget leverage and in fact you would do that as a messaging tool building up towards the budget fights and that would also harness the states to help you so in other words you know people always ask well Daniel what happens if you do have a government shutdown I mean who blinks first you know we say we're you know we pass a budget bill let's say out of the house defunding the FBI defunding catch and release at the border defunding Pfizer Ukraine war all this stuff transgenderism throughout federal government transgenderism throughout the military and all other bad stuff in the military we have a list of 15 20 things we want we pass a budget done Senate and by the way the Senate Republicans would oppose it but let's just indulge me here that the Senate Republicans would support it but Democrats would have enough to filibuster and either way Biden obviously would veto it okay so Republicans obviously always give in and they passed the Democrat bill but let's say they wouldn't and they would have a you know wouldn't pass theirs Democrats would balk and you passed the deadline as government shutdown so what happens at that point one of the pieces of leverage is the states it's like who breaks the log jam we want these policies you don't so we're kind of divided well the states could come in and implement a lot of the things we want so in other words let's say we have no budget on the FBI well states would come in and say we're going to prohibit FBI agents from arresting people for x and x crimes let's just one example that puts further pressure to make it seem like we're winning and by the way don't sit and look me in the eyes and tell me you can't win a government shutdown media war with a dead carcass like Joe Biden you know in theory you could say the last time we went through these debates with a Republican Congress Democrat president you had too charismatic somewhat popular Democrat presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton but the notion that somehow you can't win a fight with with Biden is absurd you can't win because they won't fight it because they don't believe in it and that's what we're going to talk about today and that's that's the point I want to make is that if this stuff happens it's not because they didn't have the power it's because the Republicans really are Democrats and supported because if they did these issues are so destructive let me let me bring your mind back to the 95 96 government shutdowns picture living during that time that was a much tougher hill to climb for conservatives because then we were actually really fighting for conservatism the economy was pretty good the roaring 1990s people generally felt very good it was a very good time to be alive it was a lusory but it was it was a you know juiced-up stock market and a lot of technological advances and the peace dividend from Reagan's ending of the Cold War and kind of before the war on terror whatever that was and wasn't commenced it was a really good time to be alive okay so conservatives didn't have any we weren't dealing with a fourth Reich now we would argue the build-up of that started then and we allowed it to fester for many years and didn't do anything about it we were just talking about the debt in itself which by the way at the time was a fraction of where it was today was like five trillion or something four trillion now it's over 30 so then we were literally talking about social security Medicare Medicaid had start these different programs so the people were fine and we're like we're gonna cut programs and again I I I'm conservative I believe these things are harmful they don't do anything they created to me they were the foundation of the government we have today and the rotting out of individual rugged individualism dependency people thinking for themselves working for themselves I haven't changed in that sense but let's just face it politically that's a lot harder contrast that today when we're not asking for them to do major things the economy is horrible the Democrats are openly saying rather than we're gonna give you freebies we're gonna sell you scarcity eating bugs and drinking sewage and having your lights off and getting shots every second and illnesses and pandemics it's so criminal what they're doing it's so easy to fight and yet they won't do it they will not do it and I want to give you a number of examples of this illusory game they're gonna make they're gonna play and our responsibility to stay focused and not allow them to sweet talk us because remember Kevin McCarthy is a master of this I will tell you this here's what I do know Kevin McCarthy is he he learned the mistakes of John Boehner he doesn't what he's not going to joust with conservatives openly and in fact he's going to go on a charm offensive and this is why I'm not gonna mention names but as you well know he has saddled up to major prominent conservative talk show host and he's gonna continue doing that it's like yeah this is terrible and he might even express some of our skepticism maybe to a certain degree on Pfizer although he hasn't done it yet and a certain degree on Ukraine he made one statement about that but in the way it actually matters at the time it matters he's going to ensure that the opposite happens and we need to stay there to be focused and that's why I was focusing you know on Friday with Marjorie Taylor Greene and trying to get her to talk about some of these Freedom Caucus ideas to lock leadership into a decentralized process in the house to allow conservatives more more leverage but absent that we're gonna be in big trouble this is all gonna get worse in other words we can no longer just sit calmly and see how do we go over the federal budget and cut spending cut spending or cut taxes in the abstract I wish we could return to those days we are fighting for litter I mean I mean you look at immigration we now have the final numbers 227,000 migrant encounters in September 2.378 million apprehensions in in the fiscal year we now have the full FY 2022 data not to mention 600,000 known godaways which is really double that 28 on the terror watch list we caught which means it's probably a thousand we didn't catch because they pay a lot of money not to be caught you you can't last another a few days with it you can't have like oh yeah well we'll have some standalone bills yeah the borders terrible every Republican including by the way the rhinos that for years promoted illegal migration they're like yeah it's terrible yeah now that it requires a tend to deal with it you'll move from a negative two to a two but that doesn't do us any good the FBI arresting people I can't even tell you the things that are happening now with private researchers that just you know I'm not talking about January 6 or even the people protesting outside abortion clinics no one's alleged to have even committed a bogus crime just that you know you're doing the work I do literally the FBI is hacking into them the entire military national security state is is working on that and the Republicans they want to fund those programs in the military more than the Democrats do and Ukraine the 101st Airborne Division they now stationed on their border this has got to stop we can't afford this this dog and pony show oh wait another 10 years until Republicans have 90 seats in the Senate in the president we'll be dead by then there is an easy way to fight the Democrats on these issues but you have to stay focused and you have to force them to focus on it so I want to show how they're they're creating this illusion and why we need to hold them accountable no this is what you can be doing this is what you should be doing and that's what I'm all about that's what separates this show as an advanced postgraduate study of politics versus these other people offer you garbage and one thing I am really proud of today you know if I can't get Republicans to do the right things cannot help elect conservatives that are actually conservative and actually work for us at least to promote products that actually work so many products are on the market now there's a product for every element under the Sun any inconvenience under the Sun the problem is most of them don't really work you know Pfizer phony shots not working is not unique on the market a lot of things don't work we're sick of those products that just don't work especially the Chinese junk there's one element that terrifies me and that's why I want to introduce you to relief band so you know everyone has their things in life they're scared of since I was a kid I had this phobia and it's still in me of nausea severe nausea there's nothing quite worse than that like I'll take fever any day of the week you know you could at least lie in bed calmly if you have fever I mean when you're like you know bratching I mean forget it I guess I had a lot of that when I was a kid I don't thankfully I don't get it that much now I wish we would have had this out on the market relief band it's something you put on your wrist you have to charge it up you put gel on kind of like just like a wristwatch and it literally works for motion sickness anxiety this is this is proven to work it's the number one FDA cleared anti nausea wristband that has been clinically proven to prevent not prevent and treat nausea and vomiting motion sickness anxiety migraines hangovers morning sickness this is very important for for people are pregnant on chemotherapy whether it's everyday nausea or again you know people that have those those severe circumstances you got to try this out at relief band calm and use promo code conservative so my youngest Zach he gets terrible motion sickness 15 minutes into our car ride even if it's not a big trip like you know Sunday trip to a park or something you know we got to get the bag and you know he says yes to throw up so we went on a recent trip last week that's why I was I was out for a day and the kids were all fighting over so my only problem is I only have one of them now I got to get more of them but they really really do work and it pre-amps it so you do we did it right away and didn't have problems so we didn't even have to have the kids take dremamine these things make you groggy and who knows what happens when you put these chemicals in your body you just put it on your wrist and boom never go on a trip again without it whether you're flying or whatever and again there's people that suffer such terrible terrible nausea and and the good news is they allow you to try it out for 30 days so if you want the band that actually works that relieving your nausea check out relief band that's R E L I E F B A N D dot com use promo code conservative and you get 20% off with that promo code plus free shipping and no questions as 30 day money back guarantee so head to relief band dot com promo code conservative so folks I want to sell you a relief band of conservatism that's what I'm trying to do what will actually work it's that focus in those days after the election that are going to matter now I want to give you an example of what we're asking we're not asking for you know trillions of dollars and cuts to the budget it would be nice but frankly I don't even care about the debt anymore I do know it's a big part of the inflation I get that but it's like we have so many easier things to accomplish that will kill us quicker you have a lot of these Republicans even conservatives that are talking about oh Medicare Social Security it's making the Trump tax cuts permanent it to me that's not where it's at it's like the the debt could be important it's like someone has chronic diabetes that's important that could kill you it's chronic and then at some point the person gets pancreatic cancer or one of these brain cancers that are that go very quick if you don't come up with something really immediate and innovative you're done so to focus on the diabetes at that point is is a ridiculous but that's what they're gonna try to do oh we're gonna solve the hundred-year conservative issues when you won't even fight the radical destructive unpopular things the left didn't even think of until five minutes ago it's not so much the amount of spending cuts it's the quality it is what are those things funding it's the catch and release it's the FBI persecutions it's the medical fascism relative to Social Security Medicare they're not a lot of money something dollar amount you're not gonna balance the budget off of those defund provisions you'll save life liberty and property and humanity off of that that needs to be the focus but I want to warn you what is going to happen if you don't push some of these freedom caucus rules of decentralizing power some of you might know that there's a position called the rules committee was a committee and the and the obviously the position the rules committee chairman that in many respects is the most powerful position in the house that's the point man for leadership you're always working you're the those the people that they have hearings throughout the night why it's the committee that holds a quick hearing on the rules structure of debate for any piece of legislation it's literally the gatekeeper of what hits the floor of the United States Senate or house right so in some respects even if you're a chairman of ways and means or you know energy and commerce these big committees appropriations obviously very very powerful but ultimately what rights the bill out to the floor and what amendments are brought up that's the rules committee and the rules committee chair that's the number one position the man who is likely to be rules committee chair I think because he's the ranking member unless he's gonna be termed out is Tom Cole from Oklahoma he's the biggest rhino leftist big government whore you could ever imagine but there you have from the state of Oklahoma he's been there forever and there's no way of getting him out he is a top he's a subcommittee chairman on the appropriations committee and he is likely gonna be rules committee chairman and he's on the steering committee which chooses all the other committee chairs so he can treat he he what when when when we are like telling people wait another two weeks the cavalry is coming reinforcements the red wave that rev red wave is all gonna be funneled through a trickle quite literally of Tom Cole he's gonna control the business on the house floor now ultimately it is at the behest of the speaker and majority leader who you know absent any ability to fight that it realistically is gonna be Kevin McCarthy and Steeze Gleeze but he's the man who is this man NBC reports that the justice justice department is begging for more money to prosecute January sixers now you might think they already arrested eight hundred seventy people like who else could be involved I mean even if even if you would count anyone who technically broke any law they they're accounted for believe me they immediately had them spotted which is very interesting how they were able to have all those cameras all those websites the snitchers set up very very interesting but say what you want they were quite efficient even if you don't believe that it was pre meditated which it certainly was but if you don't want to believe me on that but they certainly did a great job of rounding them up and they're saying they need more money and simultaneously we know we have agent friend the whistleblower who came to the Republican members of that very house that Tom Cole would be among its leaders and the guy was like dude they're they're they're now roping in people who are never in Washington people just you know just just for their own just just for political views to you they're literally asking for funding to investigate and potentially prosecute people like you and me for for opposing politically this administration the hallmark of any democracy and they're trying to as NBC notes they're trying to rush it in very quickly because they know that next year there's gonna be a Congress so they want to get it in December when the CR expires and they're likely to write an omnibus which again shows you the betrayal of Mitch McConnell for allowing an omnibus when he could oppose it and get his members to oppose it and just pass a CR for another few months so the Republican Congress could deal with it meaning not only is this important to note not only by writing an omnibus and not allowing the GOP conference to deal with it are you gonna allow the Democrats to control an entire another year of the budget and not defund these positions but actually in December it's going to provide them with one more opportunity to add that funding and add policies to the fourth Reich and which they will do especially if there is a big election win for Republicans they're gonna get it in and McConnell will go right with it and again people say well McConnell's the leftist is nothing we can do and the House Republicans are better but they don't have control yet that's true but Kevin McCarthy could you imagine being on the other side of November 8th he will be a much bigger name than Mitch McConnell he's gonna be the new Gingrich of the time that's a pretty big platform for him to hold a press conference in St Mitch McConnell absolutely you know you're gonna underwrite you're gonna undercut the entire leverage the entire purpose of this election I want to deal with fiscal year 2023 appropriations you're gonna send that to me believe me that would have its effect but I'm not exactly seeing him do that anyway to cut to the chase the political not NBC notes some Republicans are open to it meaning open to it increasing not only not defunding and demanding that we have the budget expired next year so Republican Congress could defund it but that they're open to increasing it representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma senior GOP appropriator who objected to certifying the election results after January 6th attack says he's open to authorizing more money quote those people ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law I don't have any problem giving the just apartment the resources it needs to do that I don't have any problems spending extra money to make sure that anybody that broke into the building is brought to justice mind you broke into the building these most of them simply walked in when the police let them in and they didn't do anything and then left the chanted left and yet you have people that broke two billion dollars worth of insurance claims and for BLM and Tifa riders injured thousands of cops killed people maimed burned like 800 businesses to the ground in Minneapolis and he's not calling for more resources meaning it's not a matter of that they're scared to use the budget leverage they're scared of a government shutdown they're scared of being accused of defaulting on debt if they hold up the debt ceiling you know bill they agree they agree with the left on the fourth Reich issues I mean not just that Tom Cole is a big spender he's a likes government programs likes pork yeah we know that he agrees with the persecution even after everything he knows about what they did this is not just a you know emotional reaction when you know to the media's spinning of it in the immediate aftermath this is almost two years later after everything we know about the persecution about the FBI raids and the FBI agent provocateurs the solitary confinement the pretrial holding there's a guy literally dying there of celiac disease and they won't give him you know non whatever gluten free food or whatever the Trump appointed judge McFadden denied habeas corpus petition on that after literally seeing him in you know he showed up to the court case you know emaciated down 50 pounds didn't care through Republicans agree with Pfizer fascism they agree with the tech the transhumanist technology and people like Cole for sure his whole career they agree with open borders but he has the nerve he tweeted out the same guy so you say man Cole is a big leftist no but he tweeted out during my travels around Oklahoma for this month that's his district I spent a lot of time talking to constituents about the issues that matter to them most including inflation the need for a strong national defense securing our southern border and much more yet when it comes down to it they'll do the opposite and by the way a strong national defense to them means you know what you know what that means let me translate that means giving even more funding than the Democrats want to the current woke and broke military rather than you know again using the leverage to change policies where we're not going to fund green energy in the military not gonna fund transgender is we're not gonna fund you know gender bending we're not gonna fund vaccine mandates things like that no they mean throwing more money at these spying programs by the way let me tell you this is from vice vice news came out with this couple weeks ago multiple branches of the US military have bought access to a powerful internet monitoring tool that claims to cover over 90% of the world's internet traffic and which in some cases provides access to people's email data browsing history and other information such as their sensitive internet cookies according to contracting data and other documents additionally senator Ron Wyden he's actually a Democrat from Oregon says that a whistleblower has contacted his office concerning the alleged warrantless use and purchase of this data by NCIS a civilian law enforcement agency that's part of the Navy the tool called Augury Augury bundles a massive amount of data together and makes it available to government and corporate customers as a paid service agencies that deal with the criminal investigations have also purchased the capability according to vice and the US Army US Navy Army Cyber Command and Defense Cancer Intelligence Security Agency they've spent 3.5 million to access this tool folks the military and and the national security state is a greater threat than the traditional leftist agencies HHS HUD EPA you can't think with the old mindset of of Republicans and conservatives oh military good military is the is the most potent tool of a society it's been captured and neutralized and used against us so funding it more absent putting writers and you know you know defunding these programs and again creating criminal and civil causes of action in court to any individual within DOD call using this anything short of that that's what we're gonna need by the way defunding and then you have to have a cause of action because often they won't listen they'll do it anyway it's lawless so you see what I'm saying how they could use malefluid sounding language to indulge some of our historic broad platitude nature of our principles like refer a strong national defense and they'll do the opposite but they certainly won't do what it takes to fight it again it's not it's not hard there's a budget CR that must not be turned into omnibus it must be kicked into next year and there's a debt ceiling that will come up sometime April May I whenever I don't know exactly when the debt ceiling runs out and then they have these extraordinary measure games they play that gives them a couple more months on the clock and those bills need to be used not for the old things I'm gonna change Medicare Social Security you know no it needs to be used for defunding Pfizer fascism catch and release immunity for for vaccine companies transgenderism military spying the Ukraine war just to mention a few things and obviously obviously obviously the FBI DHS ATF and all those agencies from persecuting political opposition those are things for which we cannot wait anything short of that is BS and then states where they can need to fight those as well meaning they're gonna ban transgenderism with the state whatever the feds do they're gonna ban feds from coming in and grabbing individuals and they're gonna make them register with the state to get a license it's an idea we've been pushing they're gonna deport a legal is on their own they're going to find ways to hit up Pfizer on anti fraud statutes convene grand juries and certainly certainly ban all these shots not just say see that that that's another game they're playing so over the weekend almost all these Republicans came out and said you will you know yeah we're not gonna force our kids to get a shot and it's like what this thing is a killed people what are you not gonna force it you need to get up there and say we're gonna ban it from our states yet their departments of health are still pushing it um amin Bundy you know we had him on the show he's running as an independent Idaho Brad chicken little the leftist Republican who's then come bent and you know running again so he is one of them said oh we're not gonna do this in our state and amin Bundy tweeted out he said hey hey Brad there's a fine line between a mandate and co and coercion and then he cut a video of Brad little from last year saying now is the time to get a vaccine like okay well I guess you're saying you're not mandating it on kids but you're using every tool of your rhetoric and the state funding and state organizations and state backed NGOs to promote it it's a death shot that's not good enough that that's the game they play we're we're beyond that we're beyond that point they're gonna play games all along with this stuff let me go on to another example of what the rhinos are doing where is this daily caller in a June 10th letter to Secretary of Transportation Pete butt gang National Republican Congressional Committee chairman representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota Express support for a multi-million dollar infrastructure grant application that strives to serve as a social justice measure it aims to address safety and equity equity concerns surrounding Minnesota State Highway 65 the completion of this project means improved economic opportunities for ethically underserved communities currently highway 65 is very difficult to travel or cross for people walking or riding bikes which is often a barrier to economic prosperity for many living around their emmer wrote to butt gang Emmer's letters sparked criticism from some other Republicans who told the daily call it will call it that the letter proves emmer agrees with Joe Biden and butt gang that America's highway system is racist so he supports this stuff he's saying that our highway system somehow is racist meaning again we're not asking Republicans to fight like a hundred year ago or even ten year ago level conservatism you know you know like what Reagan wanted to do which is basically reverse the new deal that would have been nice but they didn't do it lied to us at the time and here we are where we are we're not I'm not asking them to be conservative I'm asking them to fight the fourth freakin right to be what Tulsi Gabbert is today to be what Naomi wolf and RFK junior are today that's all we ask I'm not even asking for conservatism maybe one day we could rebuild a society in a couple new states where we could then push for conservative governance we're not even fighting for that now we're fighting for our lives and yet Tom emmer another example that he's part of leadership he has a vote on the steering committee he's the NRCC this is the guy who is in charge of funding and recruitment for the house races that will lead to the GOP majority he's the chairman of the Republican House campaign arm and he literally supports the most woke insanity you could imagine that's what I'm telling you you don't even have to look for but like every other Republican he'll put out a thing saying oh you know yeah the inflation's bad the world the government the Democrats this but he supports it meaning what I'm the only difference between Republicans and the European fake right wing like like the Tories is that because we have more of a robust movement in America and tradition of Liberty so they have to play a double game whereas in Europe they just openly just say screw you I mean you know this guy oh my gosh this guy Rishi the guy that just became prime minister and by the way you have all these prime ministers that are just chosen by the party no general election he was just picked you would think if you have a crisis where all these people just resigning you would trigger an election Rishi Sunak the new leader he said no we're not gonna hold general elections I don't know when you know statutorily they have to hold elections I'm not sure when the next one is but it's still a little while off this guy is literally he's not he's not like the equivalent of a rhino he's like he's literally Claude Schwab he supports the common communist Chinese party he supports social credit scores pushing digital ID he's a Goldman Sachs guy wealthy as anything he's an animal this guy and he's the Tory leader so these Republicans won't openly use these terms they'll privately use them and like in this case a private letter to the transportation secretary but then they'll they'll play this double game and the light us this is the game I don't know how you recover from it I don't know how you recover from it and folks let me go on to another rhino so we talked about Tom Cole in Oklahoma the governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt most people think he's a conservative the guy's a leftist the guy doesn't believe in incarceration except for January 6 the guy is he said we're gonna support electric cars green energy and freaking Oklahoma do you know what's interesting if you go to RCP polls you look at their map you see all these toss-up states the swing states the blue states it's supposedly a red wave year right yet in Oklahoma the governor's race is a toss-up and the all the recent polls have the Democrat ahead of Kevin Stitt they might ask how in know and what's presumed to be a wave year is the guy behind in Oklahoma well the answer is he's corrupt as hell again I know people say well the media the Democrats are just corrupt yeah I know but the Republicans are also just corrupt so the media feasts on it there so he's very unpopular and you know that the candidate did the Democrat candidates doing great job she was a Republican she has this whole line I was a Republican longer than you Kevin Stitt you know she recently changed and she's kind of playing this game so she's picking off a lot of people now I'm not telling you that for sure he'll lose he could still possibly win but the fact that he is technically a few points behind and I spoke to people that are very plugged into Oklahoma politics Oklahoma legislature they said that is it is it is real it's not like fake polling it is real doesn't mean he still won't win ultimately or can't win but this is what we have in red states we have utter corrupt frauds and it's not changing it really is not changing unless you hold them accountable unless the top names at Fox and Newsmax and all the talk radio shows do what I do and pressure and expose these people expose the leverage points expose the dates that are important for different legislation different ideas make the play calls it won't happen on its own what will happen on its own is the inertia of everything I'm showing you what they're doing privately could you imagine they have the hundred and first airborne there on Ukraine's border CBS reported it's not just about defending NATO territory the correspondent said they're fully prepared to cross over into Ukrainian territory think about this I have you ever seen the graphics comparing how much we've spent on Ukraine to every other country in Europe if this is really man I mean Putin's just gonna take over Europe he's like Hitler Ukraine is like check us a fuck your Poland and we got a defendant you would think Germany and England and France they'd be spending a boatload of money right why are we spending the money why are we the ones doing it say if it's really what they said it was of course it's not we're literally provoking nuclear war over defending one of the greatest proxies of the WEF and Hunter Biden corruption the Republican Party 90% of the Republic no a hundred percent of the Republicans that matter and 80 to 90% of elected Republicans they support the very Ukrainian administration that essentially took down Trump all that Ukrainian corruption the the Russian hoax it all came out of there ties back into Hunter Biden the fake FBI petitions for the FISA court all comes out of that Ukraine administration we have we have bled and spent tens of billions and are going to continue to now we have the 101st Airborne protecting the man that brought down Trump Zelensky I don't get it and you have a lot of like Trump supporting Republicans that are all into Ukraine I just for the life of me I don't get it meaning it's not even like they won't do the things that will help us meaning we're now at a point where even if you just have the status quo if Republicans would quite literally spend the next two years of a GOP control of Congress doing no harm which would never have been that that would be unprecedented because they've never done that we're screwed because they have the news around our neck if you don't find ways to really raise what raise public awareness through the hearings through the standalone legislation through the media interviews through the states pushing back and through the budget bills of the fascism the tyranny the spying I mean it's no longer even COVID or even illegal immigration or even transgender terrorism I know that sounds shocking but if I had to if you put a gun to my head and said the number if you if you have one request to the genie out of the bottle one favor that could be done Daniel you're here to save people what's one thing I could do typically I would have said you know get rid of COVID fascism I'd probably say now to get rid of the national security apparatus and FBI NSA the spying and apprehension of American um dissidents because while right now it's only a counted amount of people everything we know this is going to explode we will be in prison it absolutely will happen I'm convinced of that so absent a massive effort to focus on the issues message them properly get the governors to engage in interposition and then finally all that build up to the budget battles where you defund and refuse to sign any other bill absent a defund provision we're screwed yet Republicans not only won't do that they'll add to it they agree with the Ukraine stuff they agree with the January 6 persecution which again at this point it's it's not about January 6 they've gotten all those people I'm saying even if you believe demonically in locking up someone pre-trial for walking into the freaking capital when the police actually open the doors and they and a lot of them got fired for that so that that's an admission that it's their fault right you can entrap someone let's say you know law enforcement says hey it's fine come in here you can't prosecute the guy for that and even if you would you know you never serve jail time these guys pre-trial they'll get five years is this guy from Tennessee I'm forgetting his name now it's just slipping my mind you could look it up he he just got sentenced to four years he spent 22 minutes in the capital 22 minutes in the capital four years that's more than the people who burned down the police station in Minneapolis to the ground okay Republicans have no problem with that and the border is all a mirage they'll they'll pad they'll have some standalone things they're not gonna stop it they'll have more border security funding which by the way the Democrats will vote for that because you know what that funding is gonna go towards catch and release there's only two ways to leverage against what they're doing number one at a state level deporting and at a federal level we don't have control of the executive branch so at the end of the day they're not gonna deport but at least to ban any release of any illegal alien into the country in anyway and to cut off all funding for any benefit anything education health care you name it so security cards and again a civil and criminal cause of action in court for any executive branch official caught engaging in that in that activity that is the only way out of it but here we have Republicans are screwing us by the way one other thing just so you know Carl Rove is now running ads in Pennsylvania saying that Fetterman is so extreme he's not nearly as extreme as Josh Shapiro right he's the attorney general is running for governor do you know what you know what they're doing it's a two for one it's a way of electing Oz a way of electing Oz but making sure that Shapiro wins the governor's race which is what they want can you imagine that they don't want Doug mache triano we are always told oh my gosh whatever piece of crap comes out of that primary it does it he could be a world economic forum Republican you have to vote for him in the general election that's what we're told but yet when our guys win the primary they literally campaign for the Democrat you can't play by those rules anymore and of course the opposite needs to happen you need to vote for mache triano not Oz and again nobody name me one other person who does what I do maybe one other conservative writer or talker who is addressing this who is properly diagnosing this and giving a solution they have no answers to this any of this what did you get in do with these subversive Republicans look through their rhetoric and everywhere not only are they not fighting for us they're actually in other words they're not only not putting out the fire with water or they're coming with a blowtorch with with lighter fluid we can't even get Republicans to talk like a new Canadian leader I don't know the background those of you from Canada would know more I didn't see this coming I guess they had a new election so Alberta is the most conservative province in Canada but but even Alberta had a garbage leader throughout Covid they got a new one Danielle Smith the premier of the province listen to this clip of her it's beautiful apologizing for lockdowns take a listen here finally the Ottawa problem there can be no doubt that the current NDP liberal alliance is just the latest in a long line of Ottawa governments that have frustrated the legitimate aspirations of hard-working Albertans that stops now when Ottawa announces policies and laws that attack our economy or violate the rights of our people or when Ottawa seeks to take control of our sovereign areas of provincial jurisdiction our UCP government will not enforce those laws and policies in this province period and let me and let me be very clear I will never ever apologize for standing up for the people of Alberta and the province that I serve so we will pass the sovereignty act worked as already begun on crafting it we worked on it earlier this week at the caucus retreat we still further work to do but I've asked for it to be ready by the time I take my seat in the legislature we will then introduce it and we will pass it and we will use it to push Ottawa back into its own lane every single time that they step out of line and intrude on our constitutional rights Alberta will no longer ask permission from Ottawa to be prosperous and free so again that was Danielle Smith the new premier in Alberta apologize for lockdowns and she says we're gonna have a sovereignty act anything that Ottawa does that is you know tyrannical or even harmful economically it doesn't happen here now I don't know the legal structure of Canada so well but I do know there's no doubt that provinces are not nearly as powerful and autonomous historically and sovereign as American states are so here she's willing to say that in Alberta how many Republicans have taught how many Republican governors have talked like that the closest is Rhonda Santis but I mean where Texas Oklahoma the Dakotas Wyoming Idaho South Carolina Alabama Sippy Tennessee where do you see this Arkansas Missouri they just said we won't force kids to get the vaccine oh okay wow that's great great that's that's that's very brave but no the most important thing is what she said we've been talking a lot about the budget bills you know the hearings the way to leverage the feds but ultimately I still believe the most important thing are the Republican governors and state legislatures they could they could end this tomorrow remember Danielle Smith is a lot more isolated there's only one of her and Ottawa is much stronger the people are more leftist you look at the polls the people are not even souring on Trudeau that much they agree with a lot of this they're brainwashed like in Europe here at least the people are like dude vote the Democrats out we want them out they're gonna have such a freaking Mandy that's why getting back to what I started the show with November 9th the day after is so important I need help I need a movement focused on every Republican state with a trifecta what are all the legislative things we can do on the border on Transient genderism on medical freedom on interposing federal tyranny including political persecutions on energy policy other economic policies pushing back against discrimination in the so-called private sector that flies in the face of all of equality under the law that we've all adopted all of that needs to be addressed and all the ways that the governors and the attorney's generals of those states could fight for us there's a whole litany of things I'm gonna try to at some point enumerated in a column you know put put put it in writing but I mean there's no limit to it not to mention all the focus on the different leverage points the week after in Washington at a federal level the GOP freshman orientation the conference where they elect leaders and adopt the rules I have a column out today outlining some of the Freedom Caucus proposals there's a bunch of them but I highlight six of them there's a couple more I could focus on too that is the most important thing here's what you need to know what the left is doing has never been this destructive tyrannical life-altering and literally serving as a new Surrounder next on the other hand the people have never been with us more electorally we've never had a greater opportunity but so you might think oh well intuitively well if the Democrats are doing this and the people vote like this they're gonna come in and all the this is over with again God bless him Steve Bannon you know he's his life is on the line now but he's said recently November 8th the Biden administration is over with I sorry Steve that it's not gonna happen on its own we could oh believe me if they would do what I just said and fight on those leverage points the governor's it would be over with because the people would back it but they're not doing it and they're not gonna do it on it on their own if left to their own devices they're gonna perfectly sweet talk us have a couple of distractions and screw us on all the issues that matter in the way they matter at the time they matter both at a state and federal level I'm warning you I'm warning you this is this this is how it's gonna go I'm showing you on each issue what they're gonna do on the border they'll be like funding more border security huh what no it's defunding with criminal penalties any bennies for illegals any releases that's the only way to dry it up now to be fair I could envision McCarthy pushing a bill on the floor a standalone bill he knows won't go anywhere that will have some of those provisions in the legislation but if you don't put them in the budget bill it's worthless and then like I said on on Friday even that bill he won't allow any reductions in legal immigration which is why we need the Freedom Caucus rule to adopt that any member if they get 10% support could force an amendment vote and that's the type of thing you would have in an amendment transgenderism I'm not even seeing them promised to defund transgenderism in the government they're saying well parental bill of rights that parents have the right to know or the right to look at the curriculum that that's that's a bill that they're proposing but never defunding criminalizing nothing unless you defund and have teeth it is worthless and again I don't want to hear this garbage of oh Daniel we can't you have two high expectations we need the next election the presidency there's a couple things wrong with it number one if that's true so then why are you talking at it both the sides of your mouth then don't lie to me and say oh that it's over with where were we you know the the calvary is coming the rain but no it's not you're basically telling me nothing's gonna happen and we have to wait till 2025 will be dead by then that's number one and number two it's not true because Republicans had control of all three and they still didn't do it because it's like Daniel we're scared we're scared we can't fight we don't want our government shutdown well if you take that to its logical conclusion that means even if you have the house sent in a white house but the democrats have at least 41 seats which they always will at least for the foreseeable future you're that they'll just filibuster the budget and you'll have to agree to them because of a government shutdown meaning if you're not gonna fight it now with the most unpopular incoherent dementia ridden Biden right the whole the whole issue was they're like well historically it was tough with Bill Clinton the bully pulpit of the presidency that was the line that you can't as a republican congress fight a government shutdown fight against the democrat with a bully pulpit of the presidency then we had Trump with the presidency and they still didn't want to do it yet a big bully pulpit and then now you have a democrat president with a negative bully pulpit where it makes a fool out of himself and they don't want to do it so they're never gonna do it we know they're not it's a lie it's not because they're scared of a government shutdown it's because they don't agree with us on the underlying issues it's not like the taniel we wish we could do this we don't have the votes we know because they do they do have the leverage they have the people the people agree with them they agree with them on reforming social security probably not but on this much they do and they won't do it and that's how we know republicans are a bunch of utter freaking frauds other frauds that's what they're gonna do Ukraine at best the house will dial back some of the senate republican increase in spending for Ukraine but think about it the hundred and first airborne is on the Ukrainian border can i ask you a question who voted for that well daniel we voted to fund a bunch of military help well there's this this funding weapons but then this deployment of the hundred and first everyone how do you not need a declaration of war this is the problem meaning the you can't just say we're gonna win a bunch of legislative seats in a corrupt system where the legislature no longer matters and the executive branch does what it wants unless you're going to the only leverage you have is the debt ceiling in the budget once you give that away they do what they want so even if you would cut off all funding for Ukraine it doesn't matter they'll deploy when was the last time an executive republican or democrat asked permission to deploy troops world war two you know they're not gonna do it that needs to change that something republicans need to run on that we will absolutely defund any effort of a president to start a war and this is a nuclear war without a declaration of of of war how have we not moved back to that are they even calling for it Pfizer i don't even have to tell you all they're at is that we're gonna fight the mandates so again even the mandates they'll do stand alone they're not gonna have a government shutdown over it and be it's like this thing is like let's say the government pushes promotes funds partners with hemlock and not just any hemlock but endless streams of new hemlock and then that hemlock is promoted by every government funded NGO at every doctor's office so that's coercion i mean that's what they talked about during nuremberg that is a mandate essentially that's not enlightened consent but they'll never touch that we love vaccines oh and then the kovitchots too are amazing and just don't force it a with that attitude you're not really gonna fight the forcing anyway and b that's not good enough anymore there's so much that needs to be done on the pandemic related stuff the emergency powers i'm not even hearing them talking about it have you ever heard any repugnant say we're gonna end the ability of a president to declare an emergency in the way he did and and and and have such powers wield such powers not even talking about fizer and an immunity and things like that just that alone is a very popular thing that you need a congressional vote or something you know any declared emergency beyond seven days you need two-thirds of congress to continue it something like that is anyone even proposing that simple simple ideas and again the fbi there's no presumably mccarthy will shut down the democrat you know january six committee but will they have their own there's no promise of that yet and even if they do will they look into what needs to be looked into remember when the republicans had control under obama just remember what did they do nothing on any issue that mattered we never got to the bottom of extortion 17 where the obama administration likely sabotaged an entire an entire squadron of navy seals seal team six worst day of death in naval special warfare history in afghanistan a year after um bin london was caught many things like that the benghazi committee was a joke it's not going to happen on its own we need to get busy let me remind you let me remind you folks republicans that they're saying republicans might get up to 250 seats which would technically be the most they had since 19 what 29 or something but i have news for you in the last two years of obama republicans had 247 seats in that house and what did they do with it it's not going to change on its own the good news is there's a lot of great ideas that we can use is a lot of great leverage points is a lot of great messaging points what they're doing is unpopular and the more they win the more it will show that mandate but don't just project your own logical way of thinking on republicans oh so therefore oh man if you wake up the next day i'm not saying for sure it's gonna happen but let's say the polls are like underselling the republican victories it's gonna be twice as much and everyone's gonna be euphoric and i'd be happy to because it shows the people are getting it but what are you to do with it that's what you can count on me for and that's why i need you guys to send this show to every one of your friends and relatives i will try to restart our effort with the liberty strike force teams for the upcoming legislative sessions divided up by states to you know let's say we come out with 10 important priorities to push it in your respective legislatures this is what we need to stay focused on the election is nothing it is nothing if you don't actually do anything with the football that you're given historically they've never done it we know they don't plan on doing it i'm proving to you how they're that it's not just that they're too lazy or scared to do it they don't agree with the plays we want to make and unless you really relentlessly focus on it on shame them and beat them into doing it they will not do it that's the job i'm gonna do with your help we're just getting started this week folks again email me daniel herwitz at starmail.com at c19 truth bombs is the telegram handle at c19 truth bombs till tomorrow god bless y'all and thank you"
