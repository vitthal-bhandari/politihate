    "text": " Welcome to Truth for Health, the rest of the story. The media isn't telling you, this is Dr. Lee for America. And we're here to talk today about how all of the events you're seeing around you that feel like a freight train coming at you from all directions are all tied in to one central theme that began at least in the modern era, about a hundred years ago in the 1920s. And that connecting point, think of the discussion today as a wagon wheel, the old fashioned big wagon wheels that were on the covered wagons traveling across the West and the settling of this country. The hub of the wheel is what we'll be talking about today and all of the events around you that are coming at you that feel like they're coming at warp speed from all directions are actually best visualized as spokes spokes around the hub of the wheel. And around the rim is another concept that I will outline as we go forward today. The hub of the wheel that is the connecting point, the axle that's driving all of this assault against us, our bodies, our minds, our environment, our food supply, our way of life, all of it is connected to the depopulation agenda that actually began under the more polite name of eugenics in the 1920s, pioneered in this country by Margaret Sanger. And she became the darling of the left as the founder of Planned Parenthood, but that's really not where her work began. And I'd like for you to listen in the words of Margaret Sanger herself, as well as in the words of a history professor, military veteran, combat veteran, who is now a professor of history and who has put together a clip about 12 minutes, we're going to listen to his presentation on forgotten history, the story of Margaret Sanger and how it's tied in with the depopulation agenda being pushed by Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, earlier by Henry Kissinger and the Egypt, population of cords from 1994, Paul Erlich in the 1960s with his book, The Population Bomb, and then the movement called Zero Population Growth. And how all of that is connected to the COVID shots, climate change, the assault on your freedom and more. So hang on to your hat, we're going to have an interesting discussion today. And I hope you'll share this widely because some of this archival material with the interviews and the words of Margaret Sanger are actually a little harder to find and most people don't know about this connection and where Planned Parenthood really began as a movement to exterminate Negroes, which is what Margaret Sanger referred to them as in the 1920s, Negroes and colored people, Jews, military soldiers and the mentally disabled. She basically wanted to purify the population of all of these groups of people and horrifyingly her principles, her ideas, her push for a pure race became the basis for Adolf Hitler's Aryan race purification efforts in Germany in World War II. They did not originate with Adolf Hitler. They originated in this country, America, under the eugenics movement led by Margaret Sanger. Someone Hillary Clinton idealized and said, described her as such a hero. America, there's a very dark side to Margaret Sanger that you have not been told, most of you. And that's what we're gonna discuss today and how it's connected with everything around us that's happening. So listen to forgotten history for the next several minutes and then I'll be back at the end of this discussion. This is Margaret Slee, president of America's planned parental confederation maintains that European women should stop having babies for the next 10 years. But Mrs. Slee, in this country, having babies is the only thing left which is both unration and untaxed. Who think we really ought to stop? Well, I suppose a subject like that is really so personal that it's entirely up to the parents to decide. But for my view, I believe there should be no more babies. The term eugenics is basically a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population. Historically, by excluding people and groups judged to be inferior in promoting those judged to be superior. There have been various applications of eugenics, perhaps the most famous being the Germans before endearing World War II, which was condemned by the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. But the Germans did not invent eugenics. In fact, they were inspired by the founder of the taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood. The truth behind the genesis of that organization and its founder are much darker than most Americans realize. Who was the real Margaret Sanger? Why was she heralded by the Third Reich as the greatest socialist in America? Why do modern Democrats who claim to support the African-American population justify presenting her as a cultural icon? Hello, I'm Colin Heaton, a veteran of the United States Army and Marine Corps, former history professor, book author, and welcome to this episode of Forgotten History. MUSIC Margaret Sanger was born on September 14, 1879, in Corning, New York. She is an icon to left-wing groups due to her founding of Planned Parenthood in October 1916, with her sister, Ethel Byrne and Fannie Emendel, which was the first birth control clinic in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York. Nine days later, the police raided the clinic and arrested all the people involved for promoting birth control, which was illegal. Sanger refused to pay the fine and spent 30 days in jail. She then traveled the country, preaching her concepts. Sanger then founded the American Birth Control League in 1921. Sanger also endorsed the 1927 decision Buck V. Bell, in which the Supreme Court ruled that states could forcibly sterilize people deemed unfit without their consent and sometimes without their knowledge. This American law would be the major defense at Nuremberg for the Nazi defendants who were doctors, practicing Sanger's methods, and many would be found not guilty as a result of this defense. In 1939, Sanger began what was called the Negro Project, alongside black leaders like W. E. B. De Bois, Mary Macleod Bethune and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell. This was the plan to have black doctors performing on black patients, to perpetuate the sterilization of blacks who were deemed inferior as many black patients were suspicious of white doctors. Following upon Sanger's eugenics platform, disguised as giving women access to birth control, the ABCL became Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942, after birth control was no longer considered illegal, at least among married couples. During this period, Sanger had critics and supporters. The supporters even today claim that she condemned abortion, arguing that it would not be needed if every woman had access to birth control. What they leave out is that Sanger only opposed abortions if that meant not producing the best, healthiest, most intelligent from Caucasian couples, for blacks, Jews, and brown-skinned people, as well as low IQ white people, and those with birth defects. They were not to be allowed. This was what the Nazis adopted. Ironically, in 1966, Planned Parenthood began issuing its Margaret Sanger Awards annually, to honor individuals of distinction, recognition of excellence and leadership, and furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights. However, the organization very quietly, and without any fanfare, stopped this practice as Black Lives Matter rose to prominence. It would have been seen as the height of hypocrisy, to have the liberal back-to-domestic terror group that attacked white America, connected to Sanger, a Democrat darling who wanted to exterminate blacks. In fact, the last recipient of the award listed on the website, is Dr. Willie Parker in 2015. Then, he just quietly disappeared. Parker was an abortionist known for his contentious claims that his Christian faith influenced his work. He was accused of sexual assault in 2019, which he denied, but he still resigned from all of his professional positions in 2020. Other recipients of the Margaret Sanger would include House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and actresses Jane Bonda, and Catherine Heber. Margaret Sanger was one of the few women to be given an honorific title and inducted into the Ku Klux Klan, and exalted by none other than Adolf Hitler and Dr. Joseph Gerbels. She was friends with the racist Democratic President, Woodrow Wilson, Democratic fundraiser, and automobile maker Henry Ford, who was also friends with Adolf Hitler, and a rabid, anti-Semite, and hater of black Americans. Margaret Sanger's rabid racism, antisemitism, and violent suggestions on eliminating all non-whites from American society endeared her to the Eugenics crowd. She wanted an all-white, healthy, intelligent society, built upon the concept of racial eradication, years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party were even thought. In 1934, the Nazi Party adopted her radical positions, with Gerbels saying, Margaret Sanger is the best national socialist in America. In fact, the September 15, 1935 Nuremberg Laws classified races according to an insane chart drafted by Dr. Wilhelm Stukart and Dr. Friedrich Kritzinger. The official name was the Reich citizenship law and the law for the protection of German blood and German honor. These laws embodied many of the racial theories underpinning Nazi ideology which they adapted from Margaret Sanger. These laws could provide the legal framework for the systematic persecution of Jews in Germany, who, at that time, were deemed a race and not a religion, and the eugenics behind them were taken from the world of Sanger. In fact, her theories and opinions influenced men, like SS Captain Dr. Joseph Mengele, the beast of Auschwitz, and his associates, Dr. Kara Plauberg, Dr. Herda Oberhoiser, Hitler's personal physician Dr. Karl Brandt, just to name a few. When Hitler authorized the Action T-4 Ethanasia Program to murder the handicapped, mythily ill, and other undesirables from German society, the doctors and nurses were given the program directly for Margaret Sanger's own philosophy. On August 18, 1939, the Reich Ministry of the Interior circulated a decree requiring all physicians, nurses, and midwives to report newborn infants and children under the age of three, who showed signs of severe mental or physical disability. The man who started the program was Dr. Karl Brandt, and they were disguised as children's clinics and advertised that they would treat their abnormalities and infirmities. In fact, they were death centers, where the children were quietly killed and the cause of death misrepresented as by other means such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc. Dr. Brandt himself claimed the Sanger's methods were most effective and if performed correctly are ingenious. In Sanger's own words, she peddled racism, eugenics, contraception, abortion, while demonstrating a visceral hatred for children, parenthood, marriage, and the Catholic Church. The following quotes are directly from Margaret Sanger's own writings and interviews. 1. The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it. 2. A marriage license shall in itself give husband and wife only the right to a common household and not the right of parenthood. 3. All of our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class. Knowledge of birth control is essentially moral. It's general, though prudent, practice must lead to a higher individuality and ultimately to a cleaner race. 4. Blacks, soldiers, and Jews are a menace to the human race. 5. The masses of Negroes, particularly in the south, still breed carelessly and disastrously. With the result that the increase along Negroes, even more than among whites, is from that portion of the population least intelligent and fit. 6. Birth control appeals to the advanced radical because it is calculated to undermine the authority of the Christian churches. I look forward to seeing humanity free someday of the tyranny of Christianity, no less than capitalism. 7. Every single case of inherited defect, every malformed child, every congenitally tainted human being brought into this world is of infinite importance to that poor individual. But it is scarcely less important to the rest of us and to all of our children who must pay in one way or another for these biological and racial mistakes. 8. It now remains for the United States government to set a sensible example to the world by offering a bonus or a yearly pension to all obviously unfit parents who allow themselves to be sterilized by harmless and scientific memes. 6. Margaret Sanger, the woman heralded by the Democrats and left-wing ideologues in the United States for her positions on women's reproductive rights, always failed to include her genocidal positions on ethnic cleansing. She died on September 6, 1966 in Tucson, Arizona. But Margaret Sanger was not alone. The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Gator Ginsburg said in a New York Times interview, frankly, I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want to have too many of. In L Magazine, Ginsburg also stated that poor people should have ready access to abortions because it makes no sense as a national policy to provoke birth only among poor people. In 2015, under $1.29 billion in total revenue, 553.7 million came from the government reimbursing Planned Parenthood for their services. In 2020, Planned Parenthood performed 383,460 abortions, the highest number of abortions it has yet reported, and an increase of nearly 28,600 from their previous year. In the United States, the abortion rate for black women is almost five times that for white women. In July 2020, Planned Parenthood quietly removed Margaret Sanger's name from his headquarters in Manhattan, New York. Obviously, the Times had called up with Margaret Sanger.

I hope you found that enlightening, if not extremely chilling in her words, that women in Europe should stop having babies for ten years, and her words about exterminating black Jews, soldiers, and the mentally disabled. But let's look at how those ideas carried forward. Most listeners are familiar with the horrific Nazi experiments under Dr. Joseph Mengele in Germany experimenting on living human beings in the concentration camps, predominantly Jews, but many Christians from Poland and other countries as well, people that the Germans considered inferior, and their experiments on the disabled. Those were horrific enough. But those same kind of experiments were continued in the United States in the 1940s and 50s and 60s in a variety of ways that is a dark aspect of our own history that most Americans today simply don't know. The 1940s to 1960s was also a time where based on German pharmaceutical company research on nerve gases for World War II, for the weapons of World War I and World War II, actually, those chemicals after the war were then developed as herbicides and pesticides. So that is one of the other aspects that most Americans don't know. Those pesticides and herbicides that were based on nerve gas research from World War I and World War II by the German pharmaceutical companies now have been over the last 50 years, have been spread on our food crops and contaminate the soil, air, and water. All of them are endocrine disruptors. In case you're wondering why I'm bringing that up in the context of depopulation, damage to animal and wildlife fertility was just the tip of the iceberg. The damage to human fertility has not been brought into clinical medicine other than a few of us who have been bringing this to the public's attention. For many years, I first wrote about it in my books more than 20 years ago about the threats to ovarian function in women and testicular function in men. The book that came out in 2003 called It's My Ovaries Stupid, which is still available on Amazon and through my medical website, www.vlifecenter.com. I wrote about the endocrine disruptor chemicals. They're called, appropriately enough, gender vendors, persistent organic pollutants, or hormone disruptors, androgen blockers, estrogen blockers. Basically, they all disrupt the endocrine system and impair human fertility first and foremost. But when you impair ovarian function in women and testicular function in men, as I talked about last week in the dark side of soy, you actually are causing harm to all of the organ systems of the human body. Because all of the organ systems, brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bones, muscles, skin, eyes, all and our immune function as well. All of our organ systems are regulated by the endocrine system, which are the hormones that are the chemical communicators between all of these different systems. Low testosterone in men causes diabetes, heart disease, dementia, depression, and a number of other health problems. Low estrogen in women leads to later dementia and heart disease, bone loss, diabetes, insulin resistance, middle body weight gain. That's not what you've been told, but that's physiologic fact. We will come back after the break and talk more about the continuation of these connecting dots. What are the spokes around the rim of this hub that talks about depopulation as the core end game goal? This is Dr. Lee for America.

Welcome back to the second half of Truth for Health, the rest of the story with Dr. Lee for America. So continuing to talk about some of the spokes around the rim of this hub of the depopulation end game. I talked about the escalation of chemical contamination in the environment with the underprint disruptors. And we're seeing more of that today with Atrazine that some of you are beginning to hear about. It's an herbicide. It's an androgen blocker. It causes cancer. It's a devastating chemical assault on the health of human beings and animals look up Dr. Tyrone Hayes research on frogs. And the endocrine damage to frogs that he identified in the 1990s, which was around the time that I was writing and speaking about these damaging effects in men and women in clinical medicine for humans. But you'll find that most doctors don't know anything about this and they don't they don't address the health effects. And then in the 1960s and 1980s, along the line of endocrine disruption impaired fertility and the long term depopulation agenda, we saw an orchestrated campaign to build more soy influence and components of American foods. That almost all American foods are processed with soy as I discussed last week. So that soy oil, soy lefthasin, soy protein texture vegetable protein soy flavorings. Soy has become ubiquitous in our diet and it's a major endocrine disruptor with adverse effects on the thyroid, the ovaries and testicles leading to premature menopause and infertility and women. Declining sperm counts and declining testosterone production in men. So that was going on between the 1960s and 1980s. Then another spoke on this wagon wheel connected by the hub of depopulation agenda was the push towards zero population growth by Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s. And some of you old enough may remember the book the population bomb. If you're too young to remember it, look it up because he was promoting the idea that we needed to reduce the number of children that Americans and people around the world were having very much like the China one child policy. Then in 1974 looking at another one of the spokes on this horrific wagon wheel rolling towards the endgame of depopulation. Henry Kissinger prepared a classified document for the US government called the Kissinger report on world population, which is on our website at www.truthforhealth.org. It was declassified in 1989 we have posted it we've done programs on this discussing Kissinger's role in the depopulation agenda that he proposed to the US government and propose that planned efforts to reduce the world's population should begin after the new millennium in 2000. And there were many steps working towards that in the 25 years between his report in 1974 and the turn of the new millennium in 2000. In 1994, another spoke of this horrific wagon wheel rolling towards depopulation was the passage of Roe v Wade allowing abortion pretty much on demand in 1973. The first thing that was called through the 1970s, 80s, 90s and into the present day until it was rescinded last year, and overturned by the Supreme Court. The 70 million American babies have been killed through the process of abortion. The majority of them minority 85% of the abortions in the United States are targeting minority women Hispanics and blacks and other minority ethnic groups. And so, we're now carrying out the eugenics policy that the extermination of undesirables that were was proposed by Margaret Sanger in the 1920s. Contraceptive vaccine research is another spoke of the depopulation agenda wagon wheel. In the 1970s and 1990s, are you beginning to see a pattern where we have many spokes on this depopulation agenda wagon wheel that are all coming together to reduce fertility systematically through contraceptive vaccines, food additives, environmental contaminants, and the abortion agenda so someone does get pregnant, they can just eliminate that human being on on a whim. It was in this same timeframe that the world's health organization and Gavi global Alliance for vaccine initiatives launched the hcg tetanus toxoid vaccines in Africa without informing either the African governmental leaders or the population on which they were experimenting that this particular tetanus toxoid with human chorionic gonadotropin as part of it would actually lead to sterilization of young women. And there are multiple references on that going back, as I said, into the 1970s and 80s. Then in the 1990s we also saw another depopulation spoke of this wagon wheel with the Liverpool protocol, which was implemented in the United Kingdom National Health Service hospitals to euthanize or kill euthanasia is a polite word for killing elderly people or disabled people that you want to eliminate from the cost of government controlled medicine. The Liverpool protocol was implemented in the UK hospitals until it was exposed and there was such a public outcry. It re emerged more recently as the COVID death protocol. We'll come back to that in a moment. In 1993 in the United States, Hillary Clinton was put into place by her husband, then President Bill Clinton. Hillary as an unelected bureaucrat was put in place by her husband to had a secret health care task force. No private medical care in the United States. Punishment and imprisonment of doctors who proposed continued to practice privately. All medical care was government controlled and rationed. That secret task force only saw the light of day in terms of all that was planned because the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons sued under freedom of information later to get the documents released. And those are all available at a A. A. P. S. Online. Dot org. 1993 was the Cairo, Egypt population of courts in which 194 nations signed on to the agreement to reduce the world's population from at that time about 5 billion people down to 500 million. That became agenda 2021, which morphed into agenda 2030, which is still the goal of the World Health Organization, W E F, the global elites planning the new world order. And the goal is still, if you listen to Bill Gates talk in many of his TED talks going back 25 years, he's talking about the target of 500 million people on planet earth that the elites will decide who lives and dies. In 1999 is a Kilimanual published his paper on the complete live system, which. Proposed rationing of medical care and people needing to end their life after age 50 since they had lived a complete life by age 50. And therefore those who lived longer were not worthy of medical care. That was published in 1999. He also advocated for limiting medical care for those under age 15 because they had not yet lived a complete life and they were not worth spending medical resources on either. Well, who was Ezekiel Immanuel? Is he Kilimanual? Was the brother of Rahm Emanuel, mayor of Chicago, famously quoted as saying, let no good crisis go to waste and use it for our agenda. Is he Kilimanual became the White House Chief Policy Advisor, Health Policy Advisor, under President Obama. And then was the Obamacare architect who resurrected the plan under Hillary care, but made a little bit more palatable by appearing to keep some elements of private care. Although Obamacare so highly regulated the private insurance companies that most people were priced out of the market. Many of you will remember all of this skyrocketing cost of healthcare once the 2010 Obamacare legislation was rammed through Congress in the dark of night by 100% Democrat control of the government with control of the presidency, the House and the Senate. There were no Republican votes for Obamacare, but it was forced through anyway. And that drastically changed the face of US healthcare, setting the stage for Ezekiel Immanuel's rationing proposals to go into place. Fast forward from 1994, 1999, and the 2010 healthcare law to 2010. And the healthcare law that did go into effect. But also remember that Ezekiel Immanuel was in the shadows as the Biden administration's COVID health policy advisor. And so the complete life system and rationing of care for elderly got played out in America as the COVID death protocol leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in our hospitals when they were denied proper care for COVID forced on to remdesivir and ventilators denied fluids and proper nutrition denied antibiotics and denied treatment for many other common medical illnesses that are treatable. And that's why we had so many deaths under COVID. I was personally involved in our truth for health foundation efforts to try and rescue a lot of patients who were trapped in the hospitals on this COVID death protocol. We know it well. And the hospitals were incentivized with bounty payments by the Biden administration in particular to follow protocols that they knew were killing people. And that escalated further under the Biden administration, although it was begun under the Trump administration covered countermeasures as part of the national emergency declaration. So those are some of the spokes related to health care that's that are causing the deaths of millions of people before their time, both in the US and overseas. Then in 2002 to 2003. Another spoke of the wagon wheel was the outbreak of SARS CoV-1, which was also an outbreak from Wuhan, China. It was more limited and spread at the time, but the NIH research showing that chloroquine and the sister drug hydroxy chloroquine were potent to antivirals for SARS CoV-1 was published in the National Institute of Health Journal of Virology in 2005. But that was all covered up by the outbreak in 2020. And we were not, we were persecuted as physicians for trying to use a proxy chloroquine to help treat SARS CoV-2 patients with the COVID-19 illness. In 2005, we have another spoke of the wagon wheel. The International Health Regulatory Agreement was signed again, led by the global elites and 196 nations signed on to that and seeded authority to the World Health Organization to dictate the world public health response to any designated, quote, public health emergency of international concern, end quote. That's the legal term that kicks this regulatory agreement into force. And that was the term that Tedros used internationally with the World Health Organization announcement in March of 2020. And that was the first time that we were considering a public health emergency of international concern for SARS CoV-2 viral outbreak that caused the illness of COVID-19. On elected bureaucrat puppet of communist China was what created the COVID tyranny that the world experienced, causing the lockdowns, business closures, masking requirements, mandated testing, and pushing everyone globally into the experimental mRNA gene therapy shots that were deceptively presented to the public as vaccines and declared safe and effective on no data. It has been crimes against humanity, as many of us have been saying from early on in this process. And you've heard Dr. David Martin speak vociferously on that point as an attorney and a specialist in the patents and having traced the patents back more than 20 years ago to when this all began being planned. Look up his name, Dr. David Martin and his recent speeches before the European Parliament and listen to the warnings that he has been trying to bring to the world. So then we come forward from 2005 back to 2009 when Ezekiel Emanuel wrote another paper on complete live system and was responsible for helping guide the Obama administration to slash billions of dollars from the Medicaid budget for older Americans, providing free contraceptives, free contraception and government funded abortion. Look at the connecting docs there. If you're providing free contraception to reproductive age women, government funded abortion, you are ending up with the agenda of depopulation. If you're killing older Americans, you're participating in the depopulation agenda. Then in 2009, unbeknownst to most Americans in the TARP legislation troubled assets relief legislation in the financial crisis that hit us in September 2008. The TARP legislation was passed under the cover of darkness in terms of what it actually contained. That was passed in February 2009 and hidden in this massive financial bill were the first two tracks of government control of health care. The Health Information Technology Act, when the government took ownership of our private medical records without patient consent. And the independent payment advisory board was created in the financial legislation called TARP. And that was what became known as the death panels that you heard about in the Democrats lied and said it wasn't in Obamacare. Well, technically they were correct. It wasn't in Obamacare, but they had put it into they had hidden it in the troubled assets relief legislation passed in February 2009 in case Obamacare did not get passed. So are you beginning to connect the dots? It's all aimed at depopulation. Killing off people in any way possible, whether it's through the foods, through the environmental contamination with endocrine disruptors, through climate change, cutbacks on food production, and energy, whether it is the rationing of medical care, abortion on demand, and every contraceptives, all of it. Each one of these is one of the spokes of this wagon wheel aimed at depopulation. In 2009, another event took place that the public generally doesn't know. The pharmaceutical company research pharmaceutical sciences research and published articles in the pharma scientific journals showed that the lipid nanoparticle technology for the mRNA shots damaged ovaries and testicles of every animal species studied causing infertility massively in both male and female of all of the animal species. They proceeded with this lipid nanoparticle coating on the mRNA coven shots, knowing that it caused reproductive damage for males and females of all of the animal species, and that it would have that effect in humans as well. We talked about 2010 being the year that the healthcare law was passed and beginning to ratchet down and ration medical care for seniors and provide free contraception and government funding for abortions. That was later blocked by Republicans when they took control, but there were a number of years that that was going on. In 2011 to 2015, again, under the Obama administration, we had a massive surge of illegals coming across our southern borders funded by our own government agencies. The federal government actually put into the budget in fiscal year 2011 planning for the Central American and other countries border surge in 2013 and 2014. All of this has been documented in research that many of us in Arizona were doing at the time and archived on our website. In the summer of 2014, there was a mysterious respiratory illness outbreak in multiple American cities that were killing young American children. And no one seemed to be quite aware of where this mysterious virus was coming from because children were not usually the ones dying from these respiratory virus. It was later traced to the Central American viruses that were brought in by the Central American illegals brought in across our border by our own Department of Homeland Security. And funded by American taxpayers transported in DHS planes across America. Most Americans did not know this. Those of us on the ground in Arizona were working with Border Patrol and other groups to document all of this. We tried to warn America at the time. 2016 in the election of 2016, the plans were for Hillary Clinton to be president. And the more draconian Hillary care with no private medical care whatsoever would finally be implemented tightening government control of all health care. And more intensive rationing of medical services for elderly and disabled. The election of President Donald Trump disrupted the Democrats plan under Hillary to bring in Hillary care and more government rationing of medicine. And as president, Trump pushed for free market reforms, patient center medical care, patient freedom to import lower cost medicines from other countries, and to cut the US funding to who WHO, the World Health Organization, of course Bill Gates promptly picked up the amount that the United States had been funding and gave that to the World Health Organization, even though it was clear that WHO had become a puppet of communist China. President Trump's reforms were all threats to the global plan to reduce the world population. In his last month in office in December 2016, President Trump, sorry, President Obama, before knowing that President Trump had been elected in the November election. At the end of November 2016, beginning of December, Obama appointed Rick Bright, Director of BARDA for the FDA. And he is the political appointee who in 2020, with the COVID outbreak, sabotaged the use of hydroxychloroquine for early COVID treatment, and directly over road President Trump's declaration. The first time that the president's election of making hydroxychloroquine available from the national stockpile, where they had gotten, President Trump had gotten $76 million donated by pharma into the national stockpile with the goal of distributing it to hospitals, clinics and doctors offices around the country to save lives under COVID, Rick Bright was the person appointed by Obama at the end of his term in office, who sabotaged the use of hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID and led to the deaths of millions of Americans. In fact, sorry, hundreds of thousands of Americans in millions worldwide. Rick Bright bragged about this in an article that was published later and referenced again in materials that I've sent out as editorials during that time. In 2017, Fauci announced that the new President Trump would face an infectious disease global pandemic. Most people don't remember that Anthony Fauci announced that and bragged about it. In 2019, highly significant events were taking place. In the event 201 at Johns Hopkins with China's Minister of Health in attendance, along with US public health officials, and they simulated a coronavirus pandemic. In the same time, the military games were taking place in China with the US military participating and likely exposed to the car SARS-CoV-2 virus that we now know was circulating in Wuhan, China as early as August, September 2019, but the world was not informed until January 2020. October, November 2019 military and intelligence personnel returning to the US had likely been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and many military flights were coming into the CIA facilities at Camp Perry, Williamsburg, Virginia, likely one of the major sources of the severe outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 illness, COVID-19 in the Williamsburg-Hampton-Rodes area, which was less was unusual compared to other cities from the outbreak. In January 2020, the world came to know SARS-CoV-2 and the illness COVID-19. Then in 2021, we had Warp Speed COVID vaccine available and mandated globally mandated for work, and mandated in the military, mandated for travel. It was a devastating violation of human rights worldwide violations of the US Constitution, violations of uniform code and military justice, violation of federal statutes, across the board, the mandate for an experimental EUA gene therapy shot with very little scientific study other than the development of a technology that damaged fertility and reproduction was truly a staggering adverse impact on the world, on the global population. This is Dr. Lee for America. Join our crusade. We are silent no more, and we want you to be part of our crusade, donate to support our efforts to bring this information to the world and support the legal defense grants that are defending the human and civil rights for all of us.
