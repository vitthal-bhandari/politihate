    "text": " Vivek Ramaswami is back by Popular Demand. You guys asked a ton of questions in the comments, and I felt that we ran out of time way too soon. So we're gonna get to some of his foreign policy perspectives. We're gonna get to China. We're gonna get to Zalinski and Ukraine. And we're gonna talk more about the moral fabric of America, which seems to be deteriorating. All that coming up today on Can of Sones. All right, guys. Vivek Ramaswami is back by Popular Demand. You guys very much liked that interview, said that we should do more of it. You wanted to learn more about him. You had pointed questions in the comments, and I said, you know what? 45 minutes really wasn't enough. We went over 15 minutes, and it still didn't feel like we got to the bottom of everything. I think especially because he's so new on the political scene. We want to further look into his ideas. I want to be very clear at the beginning of his interview. He has not said that there's anything off limits that we can't ask him, which I always think is, I just like to hear that. I like when they don't tell me, oh, but don't bring this up or bring up this personal issue. You are trying to run the United States of America. There's no such thing as a personal issue. We should be able to ask you everything. Vivek, welcome back to the show. Amen, Candice, you're right. If you want to sit across the table from Xi Jinping, you better toughen up a little bit. So I'm good with that. Yeah. Wonderful. So obviously the first thing that we want to discuss is what's happened here in Nashville this week, another horrific shooting this time at an elementary school, three nine-year-olds that have been killed. We have found out that the shooter was transgendered. Obviously not every school shooter is transgendered, but it does bring into question a lot of your ideas. First and foremost, I want to talk about your ideas regarding the Second Amendment. When you hear when something like this happens, calls for more gun control, what is your instinct? I think that is a politicized knee-jerk reaction. I have a very negative reaction to that because, I mean, a lot of people just need to learn the facts, Candice. We have the same number of guns in this country as we did in the mid-1970s, even in the early 1970s. What's changed is mental health conditions in this country that we need to have the courage to address directly. And I want to come back to the trans issue. I think the right answer here, though, the most important issue, we'll get to the trans element of this, but we've seen school shootings, as you said, from people who are not trans. I know this is difficult. You're a national. You're a parent of young kids. I'm a parent of young kids. I think it is in a front that we will protect banks in this country or shopping malls in this country or the thousands standing around, as I like to call them, the TSA in our airports in this country. Put federal marshals on airplanes without protecting our kids. Something I've said in this presidential campaign is I have committed to shut down the US Department of Education. That's $83 billion that flows through the US DOE. That by the way, subsidizes these trans ideologies, these gender ideologies in our schools. That's a big part of why you see that in local schools, is the US government foists race and gender ideology upon these local schools. Well, what I say is you could take a quarter of that, I'm in the math on this, Candice. A quarter of that budget could put two to three armed security guards in every school, at least every public school in this country. You tell me which is a better use of actually funds, protecting our kids physically to make sure something like this never happens again or foisting poison on them using the Department of Education to do it. Protecting children is actually one of the core planks of my entire platform. There's a lot of different ways, I think, about psychologically protecting children. I think the top way we've got to do it is actually literally physically protecting the kids we send to our schools. That's the number one takeaway from me from this tragedy. I love that you pointed out the fact that the same number of guns that are present today were present in the 1970s, that we are on the brink of a mental illness epidemic. I say this is in large part due to the fact that people don't even have the courage to call mental illness, mental illness. I just relate back to my childhood and growing up in school and learning about gender dysphoria. It was literally listed in the DSM-5 as a mental illness, a mental condition. Now you are not allowed to say that because the science has changed and it's actually not the mental condition and they say that now we need to affirm these people and that it is possible to pick your gender. How do you even address something like that? I think we have to address it with empathy, Candace. If somebody is a kid at home who says that I'm in the wrong body and I'm of the wrong gender, different from my biological sex, that is a smoke signal. They are raising their hands begging for help and guidance because clearly something else has gone badly wrong in their lives. I think that the idea that the humane thing to do is to then affirm that gender, then engage with chemical intervention, potentially with physical or surgical intervention. That's not humane. It is cruel. I think that what we need to do is wake up empathically to acknowledge that kids in their youth, in their adolescents go through tough times discovering who they are. That's this gender dysphoria epidemic and it is an epidemic in our country. It's just a symptom of a deeper loss of meaning and identity that we need to actually fix. That's the role for adults. That's the role for parents. It's the role for teachers to step up and say no, something is not okay there. It's not that I'm villainizing you as a kid who's lost. It's that we can't even engage in being empathetic towards a kid, actually reaching out and figuring out what's going on at home, what's going on at school to be able to get to the bottom of it. I reject that. There's a friend of mine even who was locked out of Twitter. This is a separate point. It's not operating the way it was supposed to under Elon yet. We're going to work with Elon to actually fix this for even expressing ideas like this. It's fallen out of the overton window, what you can express publicly. But I think that, and this is part of my broader worldview even in my campaign, Candace, I think we can go further with the America First agenda, with the American revival if we do it from the stronger moral foundation. And so I think that's one of the things that I want to see restored is moral authority in our movement and hear the moral authority when it comes to dealing with kids is that every kid actually matters so much so that I'm not going to stop myself from as a parent or as a teacher from helping a kid who's effectively crying out for help, claiming that they're transgender, when in fact there's something else going wrong in their lives, no, we will stand on the right moral footing and help those kids rather than to fall prey to this new orthodoxy. That is how we cut through this nonsense. So well said. And I know I do hold a lot of contempt for the individuals that are adults that are pushing this and there's an element of this that I believe to be first and foremost, obviously a social contagion. There were always individuals that had gender dysphoria, the sharp increase that we're seeing is I believe in large part due to the fact that when you go on a TikTok or you go on to Instagram, you see parents that are getting attention for affirming their children. These parents like the attention that they're getting and so they push their children further and further into this dysphoria. And I had commented earlier this week on a show that maybe you had seen or not seen that was on TLC, I Am Jazz, where we all watch jazz as a young boy essentially transition. It's been eight seasons now. Jazz has had four gender surgeries and is still depressed, has gained over 100 pounds and says that he still doesn't know who exactly he is. So this brings me to my next question and speaking about social pandemic and social contagions, you had what was considered to be a controversial tweet. Some people wanted you to further explain about how you would address social media. And I find myself agreeing with your take on the danger of social media for the youth. Can you expound upon your ideas? Yeah, so this is part of my broader, as I said, it's a core element of my campaign to really protect the next generation of Americans, literally physically. I think that's something we can do in our schools, but also from the different psychological poison from the physical interventions through this gender transition epidemic in our country, through the gender and race ideologies that teach children to become victims. But I think as part of that, it's not just in our schools. I think the algorithmic amplification of that through social media makes a difference too. So one core plank is that the same way we treat addictive cigarettes, okay, to say that you can't smoke an addictive cigarette by the age of 18 or in some cases 21 or addictive alcohol, we have to apply that same principle with respect to algorithmic exploitation of children as well to say at least by the age of 16, if you can't smoke an addictive cigarette by the age of 18, if you can't have an addictive drink of alcohol by the age of 21, it is completely inconsistent to say that we're going to feed you effectively digital fentanyl by the age of 13 or 14. I refuse to abide by that. And I think that the objection we hear, the reason it's controversial even in our movement is that that's considered a restraint on liberty. This is the argument that I hear. I actually have strong libertarian instincts in my own bones. Okay, I used to call myself a libertarian a decade ago. I don't anymore for reasons we can talk about. I'm a conservative today. But here's the thing, even the most staunch libertarian would not claim falsely that adults are the same as children. They're not. And I think for the same framework that we say that we treat children differently from adults, this is one of the areas where these algorithms are designed to prey on insecurities. Mark Zuckerberg was a year ahead of me at Harvard, okay, Facebook was founded the year that I, during my freshman year of college. But actually the predecessor to Facebook was hot or not. You'll remember this. I think on the face that's hot versus not from the Harvard directory. What was his insight? His insight is you can prey on human insecurities to cause you to click on something faster that gives him a window into my soul that's deeper than I have into my own at a population wide level. And that was the backbone of building a multi trillion dollar industry. Here's my view, if you're going to do that to adults, fine, it's the job of a society and a job of an individual to have enough conviction that doesn't lend yourself to exploitation. That's fair game as an adult and that's a separate debate we have to have in our society. But kids have not yet formed that psychic fortitude. We can't have that expectation of kids. So why on earth would we purposefully expose children, not yet fully formed free agents in the world to something that's going to poison them? And not just in the short run, but have long lasting effects on their sense of self confidence on their ability to think independently. If we're going to treat cigarettes and alcohol that way, it's totally inconsistent to treat addictive social media like TikTok differently when it's used by a 12 year old or 13 year old. And I refuse to stand by as a bystander reciting some slogan that we memorized in 1980 failing to recognize the real threats that we face today. And I would say Candace, that is part of my broader plank of really protecting our children in every way for the next generation of Americans to actually thrive. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best selling book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, has just cautioned that the world economy is an average of collapse. He suggests that you buy real gold and silver coins now. In this volatile market, diversification has never been more important. That's why buying gold with birch gold is such a smart choice. The government's spending is out of control. Long term bonds have diminishing value, which is crippling banks. Depositors are holding their breath and investors are bailing on bank stocks. You can't spend your way out of inflation. Gold is a tangible asset with a reliable store of value because it's not tied to anyone economy or currency. It can be a safe haven in times of crisis. Birch Gold will help you convert an existing IRA or a 401k into a tax-sheltered IRA and physical precious metals like gold and silver. It's time to start thinking about your investments and your future. You need to consider diversifying into gold with birch gold. Text Candace to 989898 to claim you're free and foked. With an A-plus waiting with a better business bureau, thousands of happy customers and countless five-star reviews, I trust Birch Gold to protect my future and you can too. So text Candace to 989898. Yeah, I was not understanding people's arguments. Well, you can't come for our social media. We want to have freedom. It's like, it's the exact same argument that we make in terms of saying why children can't come to their parents and say, I don't want to be a boy or I don't want to be a girl. They don't fully comprehend exactly the decisions that they're making and how it's going to impact the rest of our lives. I thank God because I am an adult and I can understand the implications of social media that I did not have access to it just because it didn't exist while I was a young person coming up and we see these suicidal rates that are increasing because a child makes a mistake, says a bad tweet when they're 11 years old or a child is on Snapchat and something embarrassing gets circulated at school. We are seeing 11-year-olds commit suicide over Snapchat. There does need to be a radical answer to this and I do think that children's brains simply need to be more developed. And since you mentioned Snapchat, I was actually just sitting across the table from someone earlier today who actually, earlier this week, excuse me, who actually knows somebody, he showed me the picture of a 13-year-old kid, you bring up Snapchat, who actually thought he was buying Percocet via Snapchat. A lot of drugs are actually dealt two kids via Snapchat because of the disappearing feature of the message. But actually that Percocet was tainted by fentanyl, which is a totally separate topic. But again, there's a 13-year-old who died and that would be bad too if that was a 22-year-old Candace. But there's something about a 13-year-old that makes him particularly vulnerable to that form of exploitation. And I think that this idea of treating kids the same as adults in the realm of social media, when we would not adopt that same mentality in any other sphere of our lives, highlights the inconsistency. And I think that whether it's school shootings, being a passerby and just saying that even though we could literally be applying excess budget that we're spending on thousands standing around TSA at the airports or $83 billion through the Department of Education to actually indoctrinate our kids when we can't protect them. To say that we have a regime that will somehow prevent a 20-year-old from having a sip of alcohol, but we're not actually addressing the real threats to our preteens and our early teens. I refuse to stand by as a bystander when there are obvious solutions hiding in plain sight to protect the next generation. And I think we need leaders with courage that unshackle themselves from these prior orthodoxies we memorized four decades ago to actually deliver real solutions to the actual threats of 2023 because it's not 1980 anymore. I just want to mention to people that are listening to this, not to forget the fact that a lot of these individuals that created these apps and you wealth these people in our society send their children to schools that do not have social media. And I worked for a few of these families coming up and it's incredible to see that they know that it's harmful. They don't want their children exposed to it, but they're happy to make money off of your children being exposed to it. Just super important to note. I want to shift gears here. We talked about one last note on that one last note on that, Ken, since you brought up that brilliant point, it's a great point. I know a lot about the Silicon Valley. Same asymmetry with respect to China. So China is fine with TikTok existing as it exists in the United States, but the version of TikTok that exists in China promotes math and engineering. So it's the same point you just made. Silicon Valley versus the rest of America vis-a-vis China versus America as well, which is such a good point you put on. Right. Wanting the children to be addicted to math and science seems like a better deal than it existed to making meaningless videos on TikTok, the version at least that we have in America. Well, let's get into foreign policy. You're talking about China. We got tons of questions, a huge miss on my property. I really didn't have time, guys. I promise to ask you about your thoughts on Ukraine and Russia and the billions and seemingly endless billions of dollars that we are sending over to there. Yeah. So I'll be clear on a few different things here. First is I would not send another dollar to Ukraine. I think we've already we already have spent far more than we should have. I would not have handled this the way that President Biden did, but I'm running to be President in January 2025. I will tell you that I will not commit. In fact, I will commit not to spending more money in Ukraine, but we've got to go deeper than that to understand what actually put us in this position in the first place. So a big part of what happened is the lack of energy security in the United States. Here's the dirty little secret a lot of people don't know about Biden's spending on Ukraine. With one hand, he gives $110 billion and counting an aid to Ukraine, 40 billion of which was direct cash aid, 60 billion in kind in military contributions. However, with the other hand, this is the part people don't know Biden was the number one world leader who lobbied the EU against its ban on Russian oil imports. Why is that? It's because we ourselves shot our ability in the foot here at home to produce fossil fuels, including both oil and natural gas, which increases Europe's dependency on Russia. So think about that with one hand, we're sending $110 billion to Ukraine, yet with the other, we're effectively lobbying the EU to take steps that would actually allow Putin to continue financing his war machine. That's the senselessness in all of this is the idea that our own lack of self confidence at home. And I think it is a lack of self confidence problem, a self loathing that causes us to actually take steps like we have in shooting our fossil fuel capabilities here at home. That's what puts us in a weaker position abroad. I also don't want to conflate my position with just saying I'm rooting for Vladimir Putin to win this war. I'm not. I just think that this is a problem for Europe to deal with on its own terms. So you want to talk about being the leader of the free world here. I'm not a commentator. I'm running to actually run this country. Let's get into the specifics. You know what? The real problem is it's Germany. Germany is the issue because we have 40,000, some are tens of thousands. I think it's about 40,000 US troops stationed in Germany. Germany is holding up Poland from sending fighter jets to actually help Ukraine because Germany has a say over one part that's needed in some of those fighter jets that they're able to use export controls to be that stops Poland from doing what Poland wanted to do to send fighter jets to Ukraine. Now, I don't blame Poland for wanting to help Ukraine because Poland shares a border with Russia. So the same reasons I stand for America first. I don't criticize Poland for standing for Poland first. In fact, Poland's an ally of the United States. So if you want to go and beyond just the usual anti-Ukraine funding talking points that have you'll hear from a lot of other candidates who recently came to that position because they deemed that was the popular thing to do before retreating from it when their donors tell them that's not the popular thing to do. I'm not a flag that waves in whatever direction the wind blows on a given day. But I also believe in being clear about where I stand. It's true that I will not give more money to Ukraine. And I know that's probably what your listeners want to hear from me. I'm just saying it because that's true to my actual views. But I also think the deeper problem is a fixing our energy independence problem here at home. And I would actually take steps to pressure Germany to say that, you know what, if you're going to get in the way of one of our allies protecting its own self interest, then why on earth are we stationing 40,000 troops in Germany and Germany's not going to love it. If we say we're going to remove many of those troops who are stationed idle in Germany, which I think that there's no good reason for us to have that many troops in Germany in the first place, that's how I would actually lead to be able to just go beyond the talking points here to be able to actually advance American interests without spending American resources on fighting a pointless war from America's standpoint in Ukraine. My top foreign policy priorities are protecting our own border, not somebody else's border. And I think it is legitimate to use our military to do it. That is controversial in our defense establishment. It escapes reason as to why. But I'll just tell you, even many of the briefings I get, this is a very controversial topic in the defense establishment to use our own military to protect our own border. I actually would go further. I think there's an opportunity to use our own military through targeted strikes, drone strikes, airstrikes, etc. If we devote intelligence resources of the kind we spent in places like Iraq and Syria through the NSA to take on ISIS, we could apply a fraction of that to actually end the fentanyl crisis south of the southern border in the failed Narcos state that is Mexico. That's a top priority. And that's a symptom of a deeper problem that we face, which is actually taking on China, which ought to be by and away our top foreign policy priority. And I have called and this will not be easy, Candice. I will admit this to you. There will be some sacrifice we may need to be willing to make to declare independence from China because I think it is impossible for us to succeed on the timescale of history if we're economically dependent on our arch enemy. That was never true of the Soviet Union in the last Cold War. We did not depend on them for the shoes on our feet or the phones in our pockets. Yet today, because we are, we stay silent. If that were a Russian spy balloon, we would have shot it down and ratchet up sanctions immediately. We didn't do it to a Chinese spy balloon because we're scared. If it was Russia sending actual fentanyl, not digital fentanyl in the form of TikTok, I mean, like actual fentanyl across our southern border, killing 100,000 plus Americans per year, including right here in my home state, Ohio, where it's a big problem. Would we be standing idly? No, we would not. We're standing idly by because it's China and we're scared of them. Why are we scared of them because we're dependent on them? And so I intend to lead this country in a way that doesn't take us to war with China. I think there's an opportunity because Xi Jinping did what autocrats do. He shot himself in the foot last year to take his third term to hold on to an unprecedented third term last October. China is in a weak spot and part of my sense of urgency to run for president is I understand this Chinese problem deeply. I've been an exchange student in China twice, including at the Harvard of China. I've done business in China. I understand this problem deeply. And I think China is in a vulnerable position where if we pull the economic rug out from under them now, declare independence now. And I can talk about how I would do that. I think we can defeat them economically now. So we will never have to militarily later. And I think we get a radical reform of the CCP in response to that if we actually have the courage and conviction to deliver, that's going to take a real leader, likely an outsider to do it. It's a big part of why I'm in this race. Okay, let's actually focus on that because that makes me feel good that you say that you believe that China is in a vulnerable place. I don't feel the same way. I'm watching the buildup of the Spratly Islands, which is something that it's unbelievable that they were allowed to do and nobody spoke about it. It was just like, hey, we're going to build an island out here and we're going to say that we're going to control what goes on in this sea. Why do you feel that China is vulnerable at this moment? It's economically vulnerable. Economically vulnerable. I think militarily, sadly, their naval capacity is ahead of where ours is, which does not bode well in the South China Sea if you play out the war games of Isabee, Taiwan. There's a separate dimension to this that nobody else is talking about that we can come back to, which is actually the role of India. India is willing to cut off the Indian Ocean. That's actually how China actually gets its energy supplies from the Middle East. That's a big lever that nobody's talking about that I am focused on. But back to the broader point about China's economic vulnerability, the zero COVID policy gutted at China's economy last year. And that the irony is Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy had about as much to do with COVID as the US climate called has to do with the climate. Both are just forces for dominion and control on different sides of the Pacific, but Xi Jinping went further. He also actually just read the news today. Alibaba is now breaking itself up at behest of the Chinese government into six separate companies and Jack Ma is nowhere to be found. That's just an example of why he's actually scared the Chinese business community into submission. But that tames the inner animal that has actually the inner beast that has allowed China to grow at seven plus percent for most of the last couple of decades. That's attenuated over significantly over the last year. So I think they're in a vulnerable spot. Xi, how do you know Xi Jinping is a vulnerable spot? The white sheet revolution, you know what I'm referring to there, which was last year Chinese protesting the zero COVID policies. The only way they could protest is they would get arrested if they said something so they all held up an empty white sheet. But he buckled to that. I think that there's a vulnerability and he knows it. And so I think if the US shows up, so what I'm about to state is an extreme policy. I'm going to be very honest. It's an extreme policy that I espouse. But I think if we show up and say that most US businesses, maybe even all US businesses are banned from doing business in China, from entering the Chinese market, unless and until we get this list of reforms from the CCP, no theft of intellectual property, no theft of data, no mercantilist practices where you force US companies like Airbnb to hand over data. By the way, there's Chinese laws that then prevent them from disclosing that back in the US and these what you'd call mercantilist practices. That's not capitalism. It's mercantilism. Then here's what I think we get. Right now, China would say would call our bluff. They'd say, you guys are so addicted to us. You can't do it. It's like the Joker in the second Batman laughing, right? You need me is the line. So that's the way China looks at us. You need us. Try. I don't believe that you can actually wean yourself off your addiction to us. Fentanyl, financial fentanyl, digital fentanyl, whatever it is, you're addicted to us. I think if we have the fortitude to say, no, you know what? We recognize that's going to make some sacrifice, but we're still going to take that step in the short run because we're thinking on the time scales of history, a little more Churchill, a little less Chamberlain. You know what we get? I think China has a weaker hand than we do on that economic trade off. It'll actually hurt them economically while they're vulnerable far more than it will us. I can explain why that's the case because I'm not saying automatically all of that supply chain comes back to the US. Some people in our movement conflate the two that because if we're declaring independence from China, that means we automatically have to have all of that in the continental United States. I'd love for more of that to be in the continental United States, but that's not my top objective. I'd say if those redundancies are born by Brazil, Japan, Korea, Australia, India, Western Europe, even West Africa, then I think we actually make this a lot more tractable for us. It's not a binary choice that it has to come to the US. Then we'll struggle a lot. But if all of our other allies can pick up the slack of the supply chains that we'd be missing in China and the market opportunities we'd be missing in China, it's actually a lot easier for us to take this on than it would be for China. What I think we then see is radical reform from the CCP, but the key is you have to be willing to make that sacrifice. And the key to success in geopolitics is just like a negotiation in business is that it's when you're most willing to make a sacrifice that you probably will never have to actually make one. And right now, that's what comes back to what you and I were talking about last time, the revival of this national identity, self-confidence, our national fortitude, our cultural fortitude at home is inextricably linked to our fortitude in our geopolitics abroad. Those aren't separate issues. There's not the culture war over here and the economy over here and foreign policy over there. Our problems in our economy and in our foreign policy are in many ways just a symptom of our loss of cultural fortitude and self-confidence here at home. That's why I'm focused on that. Some of the questions I get in this campaign is, well, you're not focused on kitchen table issues or the technicals of foreign policy. I'm actually quite deep in all of those areas. But I think the most important part is actually reviving our cultural fortitude because if we do that, it then becomes easier to sit across that table from Xi Jinping and deliver the mandate that I just told you about or to have the self-confidence to put us back to 5% plus GDP growth. But it's just that those come later, they only follow from actually reviving our national self-confidence. I couldn't agree more. And I'm just going to express, I think, the national fatigue that we have with believing that it's our position that we need to police all the world problems. Now, I'm speaking, I know many people feel the way that I do. I am an unapologetic nationalist. I'm very America-first. And I'm tired of waking up every day and hearing about how we have to help people overseas. I don't necessarily want our help. This kind of brings into call the question of how successful the idea of international liberalism has been following World War II. Well, not only do we want democracy, but we're going to demand that everybody else has democracy, too. What do you think about that? I look at that and I just say, is it really our business, if this is how they want to run their country? Do we really need to send over our tax dollars for these various initiatives? What about NATO? What about all of these groups that have now amassed so much power and so much say so in all the global affairs? Is that helping or is it ultimately hurting America? So I think it is the evidence would suggest hurting America to actually be as interventionist as we have from the stand of democracy as a value, mostly because we haven't even been successful in doing it. I mean, just take the China example for a second. Part of the project of the last 40 years was what the project of what they call democratic capitalism. This idea that we were going to use capitalism as a vehicle to spread democracy to places like China. This idea that we would export big Macs and Happymills and somehow that would spread democracy to China. What they realized is actually they could turn that game on its head. So we think we're good at this. I mean, you're questioning the moral foundation of the assumption itself, which I think is a good debate to have. What I'm talking about is the practical failure of its implementation, which is what China realized is, okay, these silly Americans think they're using capitalism as a vehicle to can play this game. That's actually a Trojan horse for us. So what do they do? They turn that game on its head where they say that, you know what, if you're Apple or BlackRock or Airbnb or Nike or Disney or whoever, we will allow you to enter the Chinese market if and only if you advance our objectives. If you don't criticize the CCP, but you end up applying emissions cap over there in the US, if you lobby for actually Chinese securities to be listed on US exchanges, if you actually criticize the United States for its social injustices, then they will roll out the red carpet. So actually we thought we were using capitalism as a vehicle to spread democracy. No, they sent back those Nike sneakers and Disney movies and iPhones as Trojan horses to undermine the moral authority of the United States from within. And I'm sorry to say it has worked. Now you look at other parts of the world where again, the question we have to ask is why is it in the American interest to actually advance this policy? I'll tell you, Candace, there's a good case for Mexico where if you have a failed narco state south of our border, here's the American interest. You have a hundred thousand people dying in this country as a consequence of a quasi state in the form of a non state actor in the form of these cartels that are purposefully, by the way, subsidized by the Chinese through raw materials to sell San Fentanyl across the southern border. So I'm not a prisoner of this ideology that somehow we should disband our military. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that we use it exclusively to advance who would have ever thought American interests foremost protecting Americans on American soil, which ironically our military doesn't do. Right? I'm not a fan of just building the wall. That's just table stakes. Build the wall and use the military to actually secure it. We give a Swiss cheese of a southern border that's resulting in an actual epidemic in this country that every year kills 50 times more people than those who died on 9-11. So I'm not some apologist for the use of our military. I believe in fortitude. I think the fortitude should be applied to actually protecting Americans on our own soil, but I share your view that some abstract philosophy of using that to fight someone else's battles somewhere else is not only probably on a flawed philosophical foundation, but practically if you don't learn from your mistakes, you're going to keep repeating those mistakes. The last 20 years would teach us that is a failed experiment and we need to learn from it and evolve a foreign policy that puts America first and doesn't apologize for other allies like Poland, even like Ukraine on their own terms. That's fine. Each of those nations can put their national interests first too. And I think we actually derive greater unity that way than trying to create some sort of participate in creating some sort of new global governance structure, which I reject because it's going to come back like a boomerang and hurt us in the end. Even with Gros overturned, the number one killer of infants continues to be abortion. In this country alone, abortion takes the lives of nearly one million babies per year. Preborn network clinics is determined to put a stop to abortion by introducing expectant mothers to their unborn children via ultrasound. In the last 16 years, preborn clinics have saved over 200,000 babies. From hearing that heartbeat, these women are 80% more likely to choose life. Hi, I'm Aisha and I just wanted to share my journey with how the clinic has helped me come along this way. I just moved to LA to pursue a career without myself going through an unplanned pregnancy. I was debating whether or not I was even pregnant, so I did an online search and I found the clinic and for sure I was doing this. I made the appointment, showed up to my appointment, I spoke to one of the counselors and took a test. While I was waiting, they talked to me about different pregnancy choices and different options and information that helped me be more educated. The test is positive. To confirm, I got an ultrasound of the pregnancy test and it was for sure positive and I got to hear and see my baby for the first time. Hearing the heartbeat made me cry and it was certain that I was going to keep my baby forever. And from time to time, I still go to the clinic to get additional services like baby clothes and diapers and other things. And I've had so much support from everyone, the staff, the volunteers. I now see my daughter and I cannot imagine my life without my happy, lovely, joyful, smart baby and I'm so grateful. The majority of mothers who enter pre-born clinics are being pressured to abort by offering them the opportunity to choose life as well as necessary support in doing so. The pre-born network has saved over 200,000 babies from abortion. How can you help? A donation of just $28 will provide one ultrasound. $140 will provide five ultrasounds. Let's save some lives today. Help me secure my goal of rescuing 10,000 babies by the end of this year. Donate securely, dial pound 250 and say the key word baby. That's pound 250 baby or you can go to preborn.com slash Candace. That's preborn.com slash Candace. I think one of the biggest uphill climbs for anybody that believes, okay, well, let's keep the jobs here. This is one way that we can defeat China. It is obviously a necessary thing to do. But I think one thing that will represent a major hurdle is going to be the fact that the American ethos has changed. The ethics of the average American has transformed. We no longer have the average American wanting to work hard. Almost used to be synonymous with hard work, right, and diligence. We're seeing that the classrooms have become prison yards. People feel entitled. They think, oh my gosh, today I had to work six hours and I don't deserve that. I'm going to launch a lawsuit against my employer. We are known, by the way, I travel extensively as, oh, it's an American. They're going to sue if they're unhappy. Their coffee's too hot. They're going to sue McDonald's. I wonder if that is too steep of a climb. If that's too steep of a climb to say, we're going to bring it all back home. But also, we have people that don't even want to show up to school, that don't even want to show up to do their math homework or their science homework, and they're going to really grab this by the reins and launch us into the future. So I share your concerns, Candace. I was in a pretty bad mood when I wrote my second book. I wrote Woking first. My second book was Nation of Victims. I was in a bad mood when I wrote that book. I think that I asked, the whole book is really about the question of examining whether we are Rome. Are we in the fall of the American Empire, if you will, of the American experiment, just like we were of the Roman Empire? And where I concluded about two thirds through the book is we should be so lucky as to be Rome. We might be Carthage, because Rome lasted thousands of years. We're talking about actually an empire that's more an empire, American experiment, that's lasted more the length of Carthage. Maybe we're actually Carthage. I think the path to conviction though runs through doubt. I have been through my version of doubt, Candace, and I've emerged with conviction on the other side of it. I don't think we have to be Rome. I don't think we have to be Carthage. I really just think we're a little young, going through our own version of adolescence, figuring out who we really are. And if we're able to come out of this national identity crisis, and it is a national identity crisis, we cannot even answer what it means to be American. I'm running for president to deliver an answer to that question. Yes, you and I are America first conservatives. But to put America first, we have to rediscover what America is. And America is built on a moral foundation. That's a big part of why I'm in this race. We've lost that moral foundation. And I don't like obsessing over the question of the who I prefer to talk about the agenda, but I'm happy to talk about the other people in this race and why I'm in this race despite the fact that there are potentially other good people in this race is that I think we have to take that America first agenda to the next level with national pride. But we can only do that if we rediscover what America is. And America itself is grounded on a moral foundation that we lack. And even that version 1.0 of the America first movement did not fully embrace. That's what we're going to have to actually rediscover to take this the full distance. And that's a big part of why I'm in this race. And I'm optimistic Candace that we can do it. We've been through a national identity crisis before in the late 1970s. Reagan led us out of it through leadership and yes, through doing so with moral authority. That is, I think the moment I think 2024 can be that moment. I pretty much believe deep in my bones that we will win this election in a landslide. I see myself doing it. That's why I'm in this race and leading that way. And I could think of nothing more galvanizing for this country than a revival of self confidence revealing to all of us that actually quietly. Today, we think that most of our neighbors probably share these views in common. But we can't be sure because we're not allowed to talk about it anymore. By November 2024, we will be talking about it in the open and rediscover that most of us are actually, forget the Democratic Republican version of this. But are on the pro-American rather than anti-American side of this. And that gives us the self confidence to then unshackle ourselves from the climate cult. To put people back to work, to stop giving incentives to people to stay at home. Feeding that epidemic of laziness that you were referring to. Those are actually the biggest impediments to GDP growth in this country. We had GDP growth of 3 plus percent for 1980 to 2000. Since then, it's been well under 2 percent. Economic success. What does GDP growth mean? Translated, making more money. Making more money itself as a country can be a source of national pride. We just need to revive that sense of national pride and all of our other problems from economic to foreign policy become that much easier. It is going to require leadership. I don't think we're going to get it done by having a professional politician. Somebody who's a product of the very system that constrains their ability to actually lead. Somebody who's beholden to a donor class, to donorism. I think it's going to take us Trump delivered in 2015, 2016. That's what I respect about him. Being an outsider that's willing to dismantle the system that holds us back. That's a big part. I think it's a two person race. I think we have two outsiders who matter in this race that ought to matter. That's where we're going to be by the end of this year. I can talk about why I'm running against my friend anyway to take this to the next level. For now, I think that it's got to be an outsider that delivers this national revival. That's a big part of why I'm in this. I love this. I love everything that you're saying. I don't know how time keeps going by so fast with you. I think what we have to do also is we get Trump on. We've got to set up a time in the future to get both you and Trump on because I think that there's so much that needs to be said. I don't know why we wait until the debate stage to get candidates together. We don't have to do that. That system is corrupt anyways because people that are asking the questions are not at all concerned and actually it's not well-known. I love that idea. I think Trump would do it too. I think he would. I know Trump is. I know Trump is. He's never given me restrictions either. He's like me. He's like me. We have a lot in common. We're cut from, in many ways from similar clause, there are differences. He and I can talk about that openly too, but I think that's a great idea. We should do it and it'll be good for the party and good for the movement. I love how open you are. I'm very happy that I was able to introduce you to some people that listened to this podcast and had never heard of you before and maybe weren't taking you seriously when you first announced and now they're like, wow, I'm 100% on board and I'm following him and I want to hear more of what he has to say. You guys, you know I'm an eternal cynic. So if you're listening to this podcast, please dig up some dirt on him. I want to give him some hardball questions. Next time that we have a mom, we're definitely going to follow this throughout the campaign. Anything you know about him, that's bad. Give it to me. I hope in book, we'll ask him about anything from, maybe from his childhood. Maybe he stole some pencils or something. Give it to me. I want it. But thank you so much for being so willing to join back to back both weeks and we are definitely going to have you on the future and I really am going to work on getting you in Trump on it the exact same time. Cool. Thank you, Ken. It's appreciated and I love your skeptical attitude. If we've learned something from the last 10 years, be skeptical and I love the fact that you know what I'm new and people are skeptical of me, they should be. Right. If you know me over time, you want to run the free world, you better be willing to go through that process. So I appreciate what you do and we'll be back. Vivek, we will see you next. Thank you. All right, guys. I hope that you enjoyed that. I certainly did. I am serious when I say I am a cynic. So dig up all the dirt on the Vague Rama Swami because I do want to present him with it. We have a right to know everything. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time that we have for today. As you know, we have some very exciting, exclusive content coming up on Daily Wire Plus. I believe that that begins next week. So be sure to click the link in the description and subscribe right now. Also be sure to come back tomorrow for a brand new episode."
