 Probably a pizza place,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't call the other one,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a wonderful piece in the city journal by Harry Stein, spring 2019, the red decade redo",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I want to get into this with you because it really cuts across so much of what's going on in this country,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as I give you a few excerpts from this piece, you've been watching the media this week and you've been watching the Sunday shows",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You've been watching the vicious interrogation of the president, rude reporters interrupting him, all pushing the same agenda, whether it's immigration or climate change and so forth",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What I try to get across and unfreeting with the press, and you'll notice the cover is red for a reason, is that this is a very, very, very dangerous thing the media in this country are doing",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then, of course, being progressive's hardcore left us, they attack people who disagree with them, whether it's certain hosts on Fox, whether it's me, whatever it is",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's not enough to engage, it's not enough to debate, they wish to destroy",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 And this has been a long time practice of the left,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's happening in the media today,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So in this piece, Harry Stein writes about Eugene Lyons, who, by the way, happens to be in my book too, in a book he wrote in 1941 called the red decade",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he writes in part, looking back from a time when, according to surveys, more millennials would rather live under socialism than capitalism",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's apparent that all through Eugene Lyons was documenting not just a historical moment in 1941, but also a species of historical illiteracy, as unchanging as it is poisonous",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's utopianism able to flourish only at the expense of independent thought,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" As I also wrote in America, in a meritopia",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" On a range of issues, alternative views were defined as not merely mistaken, but morally reprehensible",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And among the leads who dominated the cultural sphere, deviance from approved opinion, were subject to special abuse",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course, having lived and worked in Soviet Russia, Lyons made distinctions about relative abuses of power, and, under Stalinism, dissidents were liquidated, or vanished into the gulag",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The American left can only liquidate careers and disappear reputations,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" It's not surprising that during those desperate depression years, the program of the Communist Party USA would have held such wide appeal, especially among the young, who else stood up so adamantly or at all against Jim Crow, who stood so fearlessly on the front lines with labor against the power of rapacious, big business capitalism",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What other party spoke so passionately for peace and justice? Soviet Russia was nothing less than the future of humanity,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They are all were free and equal, poverty and oppression banished in food, lodging and health care guarantees, sound like the Democrat left folks",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A screenwriter, Richard Collins, would later recall, of his time in the party, communism was for all devotees, a cause, a faith, and a viewpoint on all phenomena, a one-shot solution to all the world's ills and inequities",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What should be thinking about what we've talked about over the months about the media and so forth? As I bounced around in this article, that it was all a colossal fraud, was obvious all along or should have been, for anyone willing to see Stalin's Russian paradise was a totalitarian horror show, equaled only by Hitler's Third Reich, for all the regime's numerous apologists in the press, led by the New York Times Walter Duranti, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his efforts",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Word of the true state of affairs in Russia was not hard to come by, because by the mid-1930s reports on the great famine, the planned execution by starvation and millions of recalcitrant Ukrainian peasants, were too persistent to ignore without sustained effort",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now we've talked about that and I've written about this,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Remember, the New York Times was behind that",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So too were those of systematic state-thugry, culminating in the Confessions by Torture of Veteran Bolsheviks, in the Purge Trials of 1937 and 1938, and in Spain in the guise of fighting fascism, the systematic elimination of rival leftist parties by Soviet secret police",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And by the time he published the Red Decade, Lions, a rare journalist, a rare journalist, given to damn the consequences honesty, had come to know his twin subjects exceedingly well",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is, Stalinism and the American liberals, so ready to overlook its savage immorality",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" Having arrived from Russia as a small child and grown up in the poverty of the Jewish lower East End, he came of age and committed leftist, and as he later acknowledged, when he returned to the land of his birth in 1928, as a 30-year-old correspondent for the United Press",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 His aim was to use the privileged perch to promote the Russian Revolution,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was on this basis that in 1930, he scored a stunning journalistic coup that brought him worldwide recognition",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The first ever interview by a Western correspondent with the reclusive Stalin, and to a subsequent shame, he joined other leading reporters closely running cover for the regime, including on the famine that slaughtered Ukrainians",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I move on,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yet at least as troubling to Lions as the reality of the Soviet paradise was the refusal to face it that he encountered in America on his return,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" To the contrary, ran up against an almost perverse eagerness to embrace every fabrication in its defense, and to cast doubters as hostile to all that was good and true",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Stodleness methods, even acknowledged, often met with tacit approval",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Was it not true that foes of the revolution were plotting on all sides, reactionaries, Trotskyites, other class enemies, and the New York Times Durantifamously summed it up, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yep,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That during this depression, these depression years, the legions of starry and steely-eyed included a disproportionate number of what we'd now call millennials was unsurprising",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For the idealistic emotion-driven young, hard questions always have easy solutions, and even in good times, there's no competing with the romance of the left",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what Lions found far more unsettling was the credulity of those in the bad guard a progressive thought, leading figures in academia, entertainment, publishing, media, and the highest councils of government from New York to Hollywood and everywhere in between",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These were the powerful and influential, the men and women who shaped public attitudes in opinion, while among them were many convinced ideologues, more numerous still were the careerists, or those simply following political fashion, sentimental liberals drawn to causes by the magic words, justice, democracy, peace",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Lions well understood this seductive power of the call for fundamental social transformation, but he also knew, as did few others, that it invariably led to the naming of enemies and the doling out of retribution and the unspeakable moral chaos and moreover that it didn't even work",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In the red decade in 1941, Lions charted how so many in positions of power and responsibility had come to think and say idiotic and often dangerous things with great seriousness, again, be thinking of your media",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How would America lost such faith in itself and its guiding institutions, leaving capitalism for all its intended faults, under siege, as the collectivist ethos gained greater currency? His was a clarion called a sanity and a plea that totalitarianism be seen for what it was before it was too late",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I move on,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Over the course of 400 pages, Lions covers the cultural landscape, a lighting and turn upon all the capitals of progressivism",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At each point, examining the behavior of its most celebrated deserts when it mattered most",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There were the men and women of letters, almost all dedicated for most to status within their own insular universe",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Small and number, their impact on a nation's mind is subtle and incalculable, he wrote",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They set the styles and not thinking,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At one point he details a petition signed by nearly 150 of the days, most notable writers, artists and composers, a certain quote, the weight of evidence established a clear presumption of guilt, unquote, of the Soviet purge defendants and jeering the verdicts as essential to the preservation of progressive democracy",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In other words, defending a Stalin's genocide",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Then there were the professors and administrators at esteemed universities, then as now, given to political correctness in every particular",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He wrote college teachers slanted their lessons to match the latest views out of Moscow and met with the communist faction among students in conspiratorial caucuses,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Much as he faults young people for their susceptibility to socialism's appeal, Lions faults even more than grown-ups, observing that views of the young are always crudely colored by undefined emotional urges, which leaves them perfect raw stuff for demagogic molding",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The glorification of youth is a modern development, puts a prima among lack of experience, mental fuzziness, and intuition as against intelligence and maturity and now you know why Bernie Sanders is focused on wiping out college debt and college for all",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is what the left does, the Marxist left",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" Hardly least, there were those in the left of center media who habitually assumed the worst about their own country",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well in America, we executed people for murder and for holding unorthodox political views as he quotes the new republic's defense of the Moscow Purge Trials, but in Russia, they execute people for abusing positions of high responsibility",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Our official rifle squads of the Cheka anymore depressing to the morale of the workers than the hired class acts of the American mill towns or they any worse than a New York police, quote unquote the new republic",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" You hear these parallels today, do you know? When people blame America rather than Iran",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Lion's own role of book and magazine publishing was so dominated by leftists that former adherents who turned against the party deem moral monsters and turn codes could be made essentially to evaporate from mainstream view,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He lists no fewer than 30 writers who suffered that fate during the intellectual red terror, including as if the underscore the point for contemporary readers, such now largely forgotten former luminaries as Max Eastman, Joe Dos Passos, James T",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Farrell, he includes himself on that list",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because the goal is to bled out opposition, destroy Fox, destroy talk radio, may I say destroy me among others",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Another figure who makes a brief appearance in the red decade is screenwriter Maury Risk in an app in a new sun now in terrific,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" An example speaks to the influence that his leftist foes would continue to wield years after the red decades publication, even during the blacklist years of the late 40s and the early 50s",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" One of the industry's most successful writers, he enormous credits running from the Marx Brothers' animal crackers and a night at the opera to my man Godfrey and stage door",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Risk and broke ranks in 1947 by testifying in open session against communist influence in the film industry,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In the 12 years prior to my testimony, he'd write in his memoir, I shot an elephant in my pajamas",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was consistently one of the 10 highest paid writers in Hollywood,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I turned down on the average at least three assignments for everyone I accepted, and I feel safe and saying I was welcome at every studio in town",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" After I testified against the Hollywood 10 communists, there's never again to receive one single offer from any studio",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For all a left's capacity to shape opinion in lines time, the power will of by today's progressives is even more of a line",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 For its heavy hand is all but unconstrained by countervilling forces,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For one thing, 70 or 80 years ago, organized religion held much sway in America, that even committed leftist understood it it could be derided only behind closed doors",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And while there were prominent clergymen who fell hard for the progressive line, they usually made sure to do so only as private citizens",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Even they would have dismissed as lunacy, the possibility, the one day not only their congregants but entire religious orders, might be widely characterized as dangerous zealots by adhering to traditional beliefs, where that agencies of government would compel them to violate their most deeply held spiritual convictions",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Even more so, business and industry stood as bulwarks against fundamental threats to the ways Americans thought about themselves in the world",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 1930s radicals were realistic enough to seek what he's getting to here is their devouring our institutions today, which they failed to do, excuse me, in the 1930s and 40s, which they failed to do in the 1930s and 40s and then he makes a point at the end that I've made to you",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 One of the most striking differences between the world of the 1940s lines described and the one we contend with today,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's no longer a tiny, if disproportionately influential political entity waving the left banner",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's one of two major parties,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" True enough, the Democrats have long cast themselves at the party that dispossessed",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the policies have steadily moved the country left for it,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it's also the case as lines recounts that during the New Deal years, leading administration figures like Eleanor Roosevelt unknowingly served as props as communist sponsored events advertised for the unknowing served as props",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But today, the Democrat Party is the bulwark for the radical left progressivism",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The media, academia, Hollywood, certain religious orders",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What does all this mean? I'll explain further when I return,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Much loping,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Welcome to Hillsdale,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So what's the point here at the point of those audience? I think none of this could be happening without the willing support and in fact the promotion of the modern mass media today,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's all around us,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The modern mass media is not a check on big government,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is the portraying guard for big government,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The modern mass media's hostile to those who seek to reduce it, contain it, and hold it accountable",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And by that I mean government,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're a hostile to those who seek to reduce government, contain government, and hold government accountable",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" They are exactly, as Lions wrote, about other institutions",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as the city general writes about Lions, that is they're not about freedom",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not about speech,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not about a healthy press,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're the mouthpiece for progressivism just as the New York Times was the mouthpiece for Stalin,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 And this is the whole point of unfreeing them with the press,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" They no longer allow free and open discourse, rejecting the idea of objective truth",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 They pedal moral and cultural relativism,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" Thankfully, none of this applies to Hillsdale College",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But here's what he writes at the Washington Examiner,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Shockingly,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The American Conservative Editor,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, this is a website that is really repulsive to me",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They used to trash liberty, tyranny, and other stuff",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not a traditional Conservative website in my view,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And neither is Hunter,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hunter pretends he is and he's not,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's more alt-right than anything else, as you'll find out later",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he was, he had to leave Senator Paul's staff even",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In 2011, after having helped him write his book, he's a former a lot of things",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Says the American Conservative Editor, Jim Antel writes, Thursday night was the night Donald Trump became president",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, it's not",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Donald Trump has done many good things,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In over two years and off,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not the night he became president,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you have to understand, I'm dealing with these code, pink, radical, left-wing, excuse me, alt-right ideologues, although they sound very left-wing",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You can imagine the hyperbolic hosanas that would have been sung if Trump had gone ahead with his plan strikes against Iran, adding to the list of undeclared presidential wars steady-pulled back",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hyperbolic hosanas, indeed",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Who might have led this pro-war chorus? Conservative pundits Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mr,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Butuzer? It's there for free,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Did I specifically point out that we should not have an all-out war? And that was unnecessary,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That we shouldn't send in 500,000 troops",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" But in order to engage in debate when you have a low IQ and when you're an ideologue, alt-right type, you've got to create straw men",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So he puts up Shapiro and Levin,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When President Trump decided not to strike after being informed to could potentially kill 150 civilians, was the words civilians used? Maybe I don't remember that, but it doesn't matter to me",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He explained on Twitter, 10 minutes before the strike, I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A disappointed Shapiro tweeted in reply, see he's obsessed with Shapiro and Levin",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why do you think? This guy has been a stalker, literally, for years until he wiped himself out, but the Washington Examiner has breathed new life into him",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He wrote, Shapiro, disproportionate response to attacks on US assets are a good way of showing our enemies that we will mash them if they continue to escalate",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The US doesn't want war,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 You know who doesn't want war even more,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Ayatollahs who find themselves quite dead if war occurs,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's exactly right,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Even the President has said something like that today,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In other words, rights hunter, because you're too stupid, you see us don't interpret it for you",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mashed them to show these pesky foreign countries we mean business,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is that what Shapiro said? It's a pesky foreign country,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because such strategic military intervention, including regime changes, always worked out so well for us in the past",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Thanks against Barack and Hillary Clinton,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Worked out well with tojo's Japan,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just pointing it out as a matter of history,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Levin was similarly irritated, Trump didn't strike",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That wasn't irritated,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He might have been more upset,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People were picking on John Bolton,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's now a clear campaign against John Bolton,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm sure China, Russia, North Korean, Iran, love it",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When they hear people trashing John Bolton,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a fact,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 John Bolton is a great patriot,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he's been a great patriot,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When he served as our ambassador to the United Nations and stared down the enemy,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When he served in the Justice Department during the Reagan administration,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And now, as National Security Advisor to the President, look, I've got advisors of all stripes",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I make the decision,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's where Hunter and the rest of them are really dismissing the intelligence of the President of the United States,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's the final decision maker,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's see here,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Levin's defense of the National Security Advisor alone,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hold on,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just lost it,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, please",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Speaks volumes about what kind of conservative impulse is the talk show host still has when it comes to foreign policy,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, tell me",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's that? No issue defined George W,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Bush's presidency more than the Iraq war,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" After the majority of the country, including most of our veterans, eventually came to the conclusion that the 2003 U",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
S,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 invasion of Iraq had been a colossal mistake,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 Our veterans,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Was there a poll taken? That settled fact would help set the stage for the next Republican President who would reject the entire Bush-training GOP brand in no uncertain terms,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump said there should be no more nation-building,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Who's talking about nation-building for God's sakes? I'm talking about responding to an attack by the Iranians,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 But he can't help it,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's got a great strawman,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No more policy regime change,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But Trump does want regime change in Iran if they won't come to the table,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 What do you think these economic sanctions are about? What do you think these sanctions now on the IRGC commanders? And the ayatollah himself,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 What do you think they're about? They're about regime change,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And by the way, what would be wrong with regime change against a country that keeps talking about putting nuclear warheads on their ICBMs to shoot at among others the United States, their enemy? Oh, Mark, they're not really going to do that",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's see here,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, much the President has actually stuck to his own promises in another debate",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Needless to say, this is not the kind of thinking that appears to guide the foreign policy preferences of Shapiro and Levin",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" First of all, you're talking to yourself, dummy",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Both are major advocates of the Iraq war, and unless a mistake can remain unapologetic about it today",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's true,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The closest Levinas come to saying the Iraq war was wrong,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 It appears to be that we should have attacked Iran instead in the first place,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" Why don't you mention, Hunter, that I didn't believe we should attack Libya? That I thought we had Omar Khadafi exactly where we wanted him",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was in a cage,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He gave up his nuclear plans,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why don't you mention that? You can't mention that because you're at disgrace,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Neocons,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why he's focused on Shapiro and Levin,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you understand what I'm saying? See, we're Neocons",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" In other words, we're Jews",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 I'll explain that later too,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In some respect, perhaps Shapiro and Levin should be cut some slack",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 He doesn't care for the additional sanctions,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That he believes that we ought to try and talk to the Iranians,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He praised George Keenan,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He said he was a big fan of George Keenan,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Those of you who know who that was, he was a Sovietologist who wrote about containment and so forth",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Just so you know, Ronald Reagan rejected containment and he rejected George Keenan and he wanted to defeat the Soviet Union",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He went about defeating the Soviet Union and he did defeat the Soviet Union,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So he rejected this idea of containment,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He thought it was a weak country economically,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he struck at that, not militarily, but otherwise",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so Rand Paul is embracing, and this is what happens with the radical libertarians",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They kind of embrace the alt-right and they embrace the progressives,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a real mix of an odd mix,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it doesn't strengthen United States' national security in the least,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So who's criticizing the president now? Rand Paul and his acolytes and his acolytes,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they don't care for more sanctions,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 And it's very strange,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We want to talk to Iran,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, Iran doesn't want to talk to us",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 It's not like North Korea,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Islamah Natsu who leads Iran is a killer,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 He is a religious Islamo ideologue,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 He doesn't want to talk,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So people say, I want to sit down and talk with him",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Rand Paul says, we ought to emphasize diplomacy",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's almost like they're living in their own unreality,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 George Keenan in containment rejected by Reagan and Reagan was right,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Rand Paul cites him,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because Rand Paul is addressing this from an ideological point of view,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am not,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm addressing this from a prudential point of view,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got to look at each situation,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are historical examples and parallels,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, you need to learn from that",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they're not perfect,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Which is again why I thought it was ridiculous to try and take a Gaddafi,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When Gaddafi was actually working with us,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So those are the radical interventions,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what happens with people like Jack Hunter, in addition to being an absolute crackpot, is they try and paint you with these broad brushes",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And yet I never said anything that he would suggest,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a McCainite or for that matter,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In Rubio's camp where they felt we should have militarily intervened,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Libya and I never understood that,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So the President of the United States,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is not only is targeting senior Iranian guard commanders and the eye, told himself the further economic sanctions, which I fully support",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He also hit them with cyber attacks apparently,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And hurt them significantly,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We believe in terms of their computer networks and their capabilities with respect to firing the missiles, including the missile that hit our drone",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a perfectly good response,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's an excellent response,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if they hit us, I suspect this President will hit the militarily",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 And then you will find the Ron Paul Code Pink Bernie Sanders' wing of the Republican Party attacked the President of the United States rather than the enemy,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll be right back,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I remember many of these same voices were dumping all over the President when we launched attacks in the Syria,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Remember that? They were threatening the President, should he attack Iran for attacking our drone? I'm just waiting to watch how they react",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The President does pull the military trigger at some point based on what Iran does,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They claim to be for America first,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, actually, I am for America first",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a regime that has killed thousands of American troops,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 This is a regime that threatens my family and yours once they get the technology to lob a few nuclear missiles into our country,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" That's really a deep, deep, misguided idea that that country is incapable of it at some point or won't do it at some point",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't really give a damn what these other people think when it comes to nuclear war,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" This entire society rests on their ideology, which is preposterous",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
" The President of the United States said today, they will not get nuclear weapons",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,HS
 So what if they don't come to the negotiation table? What if they won't give up their nuclear weapons? They wouldn't give up their nuclear weapons in exchange for $150 billion,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Rand Paul says the other deal was working,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Of course it wasn't working,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They have no ratings,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 CNN is effective with the elites in Washington DC and the elites in New York,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Yes,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the story, this is quite a bombshell report and as the, this is whistleblower inside Google who came to me, he was, he interviewed him in a silhouette and he was telling me things that we also expected to be true but never were able to prove",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And perhaps the most bombshell of all is this secret recording of this Google executive, Jen Janiah's her name",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Shockingly, these documents talk about algorithmic unfairness and a weight of changing reality that is unfair",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So Google gets to define what is fair and unfair,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now there is a little bit of breaking news,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 This is the executive at Google and she's saying I'm a quote her here,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Quote, I was having a casual chat with someone at a restaurant and used some imprecise language",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Project Barrett, Toss, got me well done",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She also writes, I was explaining how Google's trust and safety team is working to help prevent the types of interference that happened in 2016",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So she just landed apparently,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was on airplane coming from Ireland to San Francisco,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Marcus story is very significant,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can I just stop? I don't even understand her point,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Which is you guys got her,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But she wasn't really talking about Trump,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was talking about interference in the election,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, then what does she mean you guys got her? Well, but that's a great question",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think we just got her and there's nothing for her to say,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So what we'll talk about this story is that it's not just whistleblower,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not just documents,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's recordings of executives,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is what it's all about,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, this is more and more powerful than anything else because if Google can tinker with their algorithms to define what they think is fair and make it political, this is a guy that's inside her Google Hillary Clinton's emails and then he Google Donald Trump's emails",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what he showed me was that it doesn't autocorrect on one of them,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't autocorrect on Hillary Clinton's emails,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it doesn't complete the sentence like it does with Donald Trump's emails when everybody is Googling Hillary Clinton's email,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're actually able to tinker with the algorithm and he proved it,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a huge story mark,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And I think this is a watershed moment because I think other whistleblowers are coming forward,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Likewise, when you hear the term binding arbitration sounds pretty good, right? Are drug pricing? No, it's not",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not what it sounds like,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" The effect will be the permanent and binding price controls I've been warning you about, like the European Socialist Health Care Models",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I just want to say, as far as regarding the Chuck Todd interview, honestly, I feel that that really wasn't an interview",16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was more of an interrogation,16630_Mark Levin Podcast_2019-06-25_transcription.json,Non-HS

 politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our life our liberty our property and to use the policies the strategies and the initiatives that matter in the way they matter at the timely matter that's a tall order but that is our agenda we are relentlessly focused on what matters Daniel Harowitz back here today at CR podcast blaze media brand new week of broadcast Monday October 21st and a lot of people ask me they'll,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
bump into me in a store on the streets and the neighborhood at services and I'll say hey Daniel must be really busy for you you know before the election and everything and I look at them and say actually you know it's kind of in a holding pattern it's relatively quiet now I'll really get busy after the election and they don't understand what I'm saying you guys do because after the election is when you have the leverage points on policy on strategy on leadership elections for Congress for state legislatures for things that governors should be doing that,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
attorneys general in the states should be doing if only Republican voters were as focused on that stuff as they were on the election the elections that they work so hard on would actually be meaningful but absent that focus they're not meaningful so that's why the next two weeks we're gonna largely focus on the news of the day through the prism of how in the world do we break this GOP fake illusion of opposition and force them to either really oppose the WEF trans humanist agenda the fourth Reich let's just use the fourth Reich for short form,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
of all of our grievances or at least expose the mountain open so they can't continue to play this double game and we talked about this a lot last week and I want to continue with some examples this week of how they're going to continue to try to events this illusion of an opposition while all the policies that matter get worse and like we said the only things that actually matter are two things the budget and debt ceiling votes in Congress and the red states willing to pass sovereignty bills push back against the federal government and protect,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
our liberties take their own destiny in their own hands anything short of that is meaningless now the two have a lot to do with each other in other words if you had a party that let's say only had the house or the house in the Senate but a not 60 votes in the Senate not the presidency you would pass stand alone legislation you would hold hearings in addition to using the budget leverage and in fact you would do that as a messaging tool building up towards the budget fights and that would also harness the states to,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
help you so in other words you know people always ask well Daniel what happens if you do have a government shutdown I mean who blinks first you know we say we're you know we pass a budget bill let's say out of the house defunding the FBI defunding catch and release at the border defunding Pfizer Ukraine war all this stuff transgenderism throughout federal government transgenderism throughout the military and all other bad stuff in the military we have a list of 15 20 things we want we pass a budget done Senate and by the way the Senate Republicans,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
would oppose it but let's just indulge me here that the Senate Republicans would support it but Democrats would have enough to filibuster and either way Biden obviously would veto it okay so Republicans obviously always give in and they passed the Democrat bill but let's say they wouldn't and they would have a you know wouldn't pass theirs Democrats would balk and you passed the deadline as government shutdown so what happens at that point one of the pieces of leverage is the states it's like who breaks the log jam we want these policies you don't so we're kind,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
of divided well the states could come in and implement a lot of the things we want so in other words let's say we have no budget on the FBI well states would come in and say we're going to prohibit FBI agents from arresting people for x and x crimes let's just one example that puts further pressure to make it seem like we're winning and by the way don't sit and look me in the eyes and tell me you can't win a government shutdown media war with a dead carcass like Joe Biden you know in theory you,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
could say the last time we went through these debates with a Republican Congress Democrat president you had too charismatic somewhat popular Democrat presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton but the notion that somehow you can't win a fight with with Biden is absurd you can't win because they won't fight it because they don't believe in it and that's what we're going to talk about today and that's that's the point I want to make is that if this stuff happens it's not because they didn't have the power it's because the Republicans really are Democrats and supported because if,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
they did these issues are so destructive let me let me bring your mind back to the 95 96 government shutdowns picture living during that time that was a much tougher hill to climb for conservatives because then we were actually really fighting for conservatism the economy was pretty good the roaring 1990s people generally felt very good it was a very good time to be alive it was a lusory but it was it was a you know juiced-up stock market and a lot of technological advances and the peace dividend from Reagan's ending of the Cold War and kind,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
of before the war on terror whatever that was and wasn't commenced it was a really good time to be alive okay so conservatives didn't have any we weren't dealing with a fourth Reich now we would argue the build-up of that started then and we allowed it to fester for many years and didn't do anything about it we were just talking about the debt in itself which by the way at the time was a fraction of where it was today was like five trillion or something four trillion now it's over 30 so then we were literally talking,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
about social security Medicare Medicaid had start these different programs so the people were fine and we're like we're gonna cut programs and again I I I'm conservative I believe these things are harmful they don't do anything they created to me they were the foundation of the government we have today and the rotting out of individual rugged individualism dependency people thinking for themselves working for themselves I haven't changed in that sense but let's just face it politically that's a lot harder contrast that today when we're not asking for them to do major things the economy is horrible,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
the Democrats are openly saying rather than we're gonna give you freebies we're gonna sell you scarcity eating bugs and drinking sewage and having your lights off and getting shots every second and illnesses and pandemics it's so criminal what they're doing it's so easy to fight and yet they won't do it they will not do it and I want to give you a number of examples of this illusory game they're gonna make they're gonna play and our responsibility to stay focused and not allow them to sweet talk us because remember Kevin McCarthy is a master of this,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
I will tell you this here's what I do know Kevin McCarthy is he he learned the mistakes of John Boehner he doesn't what he's not going to joust with conservatives openly and in fact he's going to go on a charm offensive and this is why I'm not gonna mention names but as you well know he has saddled up to major prominent conservative talk show host and he's gonna continue doing that it's like yeah this is terrible and he might even express some of our skepticism maybe to a certain degree on Pfizer although he hasn't done it,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
yet and a certain degree on Ukraine he made one statement about that but in the way it actually matters at the time it matters he's going to ensure that the opposite happens and we need to stay there to be focused and that's why I was focusing you know on Friday with Marjorie Taylor Greene and trying to get her to talk about some of these Freedom Caucus ideas to lock leadership into a decentralized process in the house to allow conservatives more more leverage but absent that we're gonna be in big trouble this is all gonna get worse,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
"in other words we can no longer just sit calmly and see how do we go over the federal budget and cut spending cut spending or cut taxes in the abstract I wish we could return to those days we are fighting for litter I mean I mean you look at immigration we now have the final numbers 227,000 migrant encounters in September 2",6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
"378 million apprehensions in in the fiscal year we now have the full FY 2022 data not to mention 600,000 known godaways which is really double that 28 on the terror watch list we caught which means it's probably a thousand we didn't catch because they pay a lot of money not to be caught you you can't last another a few days with it you can't have like oh yeah well we'll have some standalone bills yeah the borders terrible every Republican including by the way the rhinos that for years promoted illegal migration they're like yeah it's terrible yeah",6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,HS
now that it requires a tend to deal with it you'll move from a negative two to a two but that doesn't do us any good the FBI arresting people I can't even tell you the things that are happening now with private researchers that just you know I'm not talking about January 6 or even the people protesting outside abortion clinics no one's alleged to have even committed a bogus crime just that you know you're doing the work I do literally the FBI is hacking into them the entire military national security state is is working on that and,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
the Republicans they want to fund those programs in the military more than the Democrats do and Ukraine the 101st Airborne Division they now stationed on their border this has got to stop we can't afford this this dog and pony show oh wait another 10 years until Republicans have 90 seats in the Senate in the president we'll be dead by then there is an easy way to fight the Democrats on these issues but you have to stay focused and you have to force them to focus on it so I want to show how they're they're creating this,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
illusion and why we need to hold them accountable no this is what you can be doing this is what you should be doing and that's what I'm all about that's what separates this show as an advanced postgraduate study of politics versus these other people offer you garbage and one thing I am really proud of today you know if I can't get Republicans to do the right things cannot help elect conservatives that are actually conservative and actually work for us at least to promote products that actually work so many products are on the market now there's a,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
product for every element under the Sun any inconvenience under the Sun the problem is most of them don't really work you know Pfizer phony shots not working is not unique on the market a lot of things don't work we're sick of those products that just don't work especially the Chinese junk there's one element that terrifies me and that's why I want to introduce you to relief band so you know everyone has their things in life they're scared of since I was a kid I had this phobia and it's still in me of nausea severe nausea there's,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
nothing quite worse than that like I'll take fever any day of the week you know you could at least lie in bed calmly if you have fever I mean when you're like you know bratching I mean forget it I guess I had a lot of that when I was a kid I don't thankfully I don't get it that much now I wish we would have had this out on the market relief band it's something you put on your wrist you have to charge it up you put gel on kind of like just like a wristwatch and,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
it literally works for motion sickness anxiety this is this is proven to work it's the number one FDA cleared anti nausea wristband that has been clinically proven to prevent not prevent and treat nausea and vomiting motion sickness anxiety migraines hangovers morning sickness this is very important for for people are pregnant on chemotherapy whether it's everyday nausea or again you know people that have those those severe circumstances you got to try this out at relief band calm and use promo code conservative so my youngest Zach he gets terrible motion sickness 15 minutes into our car ride even,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
if it's not a big trip like you know Sunday trip to a park or something you know we got to get the bag and you know he says yes to throw up so we went on a recent trip last week that's why I was I was out for a day and the kids were all fighting over so my only problem is I only have one of them now I got to get more of them but they really really do work and it pre-amps it so you do we did it right away and didn't have problems so,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
we didn't even have to have the kids take dremamine these things make you groggy and who knows what happens when you put these chemicals in your body you just put it on your wrist and boom never go on a trip again without it whether you're flying or whatever and again there's people that suffer such terrible terrible nausea and and the good news is they allow you to try it out for 30 days so if you want the band that actually works that relieving your nausea check out relief band that's R E L I E F B,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS

budget it would be nice but frankly I don't even care about the debt anymore I do know it's a big part of the inflation I get that but it's like we have so many easier things to accomplish that will kill us quicker you have a lot of these Republicans even conservatives that are talking about oh Medicare Social Security it's making the Trump tax cuts permanent it to me that's not where it's at it's like the the debt could be important it's like someone has chronic diabetes that's important that could kill you it's chronic and then at,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
some point the person gets pancreatic cancer or one of these brain cancers that are that go very quick if you don't come up with something really immediate and innovative you're done so to focus on the diabetes at that point is is a ridiculous but that's what they're gonna try to do oh we're gonna solve the hundred-year conservative issues when you won't even fight the radical destructive unpopular things the left didn't even think of until five minutes ago it's not so much the amount of spending cuts it's the quality it is what are those things funding it's,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
the catch and release it's the FBI persecutions it's the medical fascism relative to Social Security Medicare they're not a lot of money something dollar amount you're not gonna balance the budget off of those defund provisions you'll save life liberty and property and humanity off of that that needs to be the focus but I want to warn you what is going to happen if you don't push some of these freedom caucus rules of decentralizing power some of you might know that there's a position called the rules committee was a committee and the and the obviously the position,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
the rules committee chairman that in many respects is the most powerful position in the house that's the point man for leadership you're always working you're the those the people that they have hearings throughout the night why it's the committee that holds a quick hearing on the rules structure of debate for any piece of legislation it's literally the gatekeeper of what hits the floor of the United States Senate or house right so in some respects even if you're a chairman of ways and means or you know energy and commerce these big committees appropriations obviously very very powerful,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
but ultimately what rights the bill out to the floor and what amendments are brought up that's the rules committee and the rules committee chair that's the number one position the man who is likely to be rules committee chair I think because he's the ranking member unless he's gonna be termed out is Tom Cole from Oklahoma he's the biggest rhino leftist big government whore you could ever imagine but there you have from the state of Oklahoma he's been there forever and there's no way of getting him out he is a top he's a subcommittee chairman on the,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
appropriations committee and he is likely gonna be rules committee chairman and he's on the steering committee which chooses all the other committee chairs so he can treat he he what when when when we are like telling people wait another two weeks the cavalry is coming reinforcements the red wave that rev red wave is all gonna be funneled through a trickle quite literally of Tom Cole he's gonna control the business on the house floor now ultimately it is at the behest of the speaker and majority leader who you know absent any ability to fight that it realistically,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
is gonna be Kevin McCarthy and Steeze Gleeze but he's the man who is this man NBC reports that the justice justice department is begging for more money to prosecute January sixers now you might think they already arrested eight hundred seventy people like who else could be involved I mean even if even if you would count anyone who technically broke any law they they're accounted for believe me they immediately had them spotted which is very interesting how they were able to have all those cameras all those websites the snitchers set up very very interesting but say what,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
you want they were quite efficient even if you don't believe that it was pre meditated which it certainly was but if you don't want to believe me on that but they certainly did a great job of rounding them up and they're saying they need more money and simultaneously we know we have agent friend the whistleblower who came to the Republican members of that very house that Tom Cole would be among its leaders and the guy was like dude they're they're they're now roping in people who are never in Washington people just you know just just for,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
their own just just for political views to you they're literally asking for funding to investigate and potentially prosecute people like you and me for for opposing politically this administration the hallmark of any democracy and they're trying to as NBC notes they're trying to rush it in very quickly because they know that next year there's gonna be a Congress so they want to get it in December when the CR expires and they're likely to write an omnibus which again shows you the betrayal of Mitch McConnell for allowing an omnibus when he could oppose it and get his,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
members to oppose it and just pass a CR for another few months so the Republican Congress could deal with it meaning not only is this important to note not only by writing an omnibus and not allowing the GOP conference to deal with it are you gonna allow the Democrats to control an entire another year of the budget and not defund these positions but actually in December it's going to provide them with one more opportunity to add that funding and add policies to the fourth Reich and which they will do especially if there is a big election,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
win for Republicans they're gonna get it in and McConnell will go right with it and again people say well McConnell's the leftist is nothing we can do and the House Republicans are better but they don't have control yet that's true but Kevin McCarthy could you imagine being on the other side of November 8th he will be a much bigger name than Mitch McConnell he's gonna be the new Gingrich of the time that's a pretty big platform for him to hold a press conference in St Mitch McConnell absolutely you know you're gonna underwrite you're gonna undercut the,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
entire leverage the entire purpose of this election I want to deal with fiscal year 2023 appropriations you're gonna send that to me believe me that would have its effect but I'm not exactly seeing him do that anyway to cut to the chase the political not NBC notes some Republicans are open to it meaning open to it increasing not only not defunding and demanding that we have the budget expired next year so Republican Congress could defund it but that they're open to increasing it representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma senior GOP appropriator who objected to certifying the election,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
results after January 6th attack says he's open to authorizing more money quote those people ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law I don't have any problem giving the just apartment the resources it needs to do that I don't have any problems spending extra money to make sure that anybody that broke into the building is brought to justice mind you broke into the building these most of them simply walked in when the police let them in and they didn't do anything and then left the chanted left and yet you have people that broke,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,HS
two billion dollars worth of insurance claims and for BLM and Tifa riders injured thousands of cops killed people maimed burned like 800 businesses to the ground in Minneapolis and he's not calling for more resources meaning it's not a matter of that they're scared to use the budget leverage they're scared of a government shutdown they're scared of being accused of defaulting on debt if they hold up the debt ceiling you know bill they agree they agree with the left on the fourth Reich issues I mean not just that Tom Cole is a big spender he's a likes,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
government programs likes pork yeah we know that he agrees with the persecution even after everything he knows about what they did this is not just a you know emotional reaction when you know to the media's spinning of it in the immediate aftermath this is almost two years later after everything we know about the persecution about the FBI raids and the FBI agent provocateurs the solitary confinement the pretrial holding there's a guy literally dying there of celiac disease and they won't give him you know non whatever gluten free food or whatever the Trump appointed judge McFadden denied,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
habeas corpus petition on that after literally seeing him in you know he showed up to the court case you know emaciated down 50 pounds didn't care through Republicans agree with Pfizer fascism they agree with the tech the transhumanist technology and people like Cole for sure his whole career they agree with open borders but he has the nerve he tweeted out the same guy so you say man Cole is a big leftist no but he tweeted out during my travels around Oklahoma for this month that's his district I spent a lot of time talking to constituents about,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
the issues that matter to them most including inflation the need for a strong national defense securing our southern border and much more yet when it comes down to it they'll do the opposite and by the way a strong national defense to them means you know what you know what that means let me translate that means giving even more funding than the Democrats want to the current woke and broke military rather than you know again using the leverage to change policies where we're not going to fund green energy in the military not gonna fund transgender is we're,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
not gonna fund you know gender bending we're not gonna fund vaccine mandates things like that no they mean throwing more money at these spying programs by the way let me tell you this is from vice vice news came out with this couple weeks ago multiple branches of the US military have bought access to a powerful internet monitoring tool that claims to cover over 90% of the world's internet traffic and which in some cases provides access to people's email data browsing history and other information such as their sensitive internet cookies according to contracting data and other documents,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
additionally senator Ron Wyden he's actually a Democrat from Oregon says that a whistleblower has contacted his office concerning the alleged warrantless use and purchase of this data by NCIS a civilian law enforcement agency that's part of the Navy the tool called Augury Augury bundles a massive amount of data together and makes it available to government and corporate customers as a paid service agencies that deal with the criminal investigations have also purchased the capability according to vice and the US Army US Navy Army Cyber Command and Defense Cancer Intelligence Security Agency they've spent 3,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
5 million to access this tool folks the military and and the national security state is a greater threat than the traditional leftist agencies HHS HUD EPA you can't think with the old mindset of of Republicans and conservatives oh military good military is the is the most potent tool of a society it's been captured and neutralized and used against us so funding it more absent putting writers and you know you know defunding these programs and again creating criminal and civil causes of action in court to any individual within DOD call using this anything short of that that's,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
what we're gonna need by the way defunding and then you have to have a cause of action because often they won't listen they'll do it anyway it's lawless so you see what I'm saying how they could use malefluid sounding language to indulge some of our historic broad platitude nature of our principles like refer a strong national defense and they'll do the opposite but they certainly won't do what it takes to fight it again it's not it's not hard there's a budget CR that must not be turned into omnibus it must be kicked into next year and,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
there's a debt ceiling that will come up sometime April May I whenever I don't know exactly when the debt ceiling runs out and then they have these extraordinary measure games they play that gives them a couple more months on the clock and those bills need to be used not for the old things I'm gonna change Medicare Social Security you know no it needs to be used for defunding Pfizer fascism catch and release immunity for for vaccine companies transgenderism military spying the Ukraine war just to mention a few things and obviously obviously obviously the FBI DHS ATF,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
and all those agencies from persecuting political opposition those are things for which we cannot wait anything short of that is BS and then states where they can need to fight those as well meaning they're gonna ban transgenderism with the state whatever the feds do they're gonna ban feds from coming in and grabbing individuals and they're gonna make them register with the state to get a license it's an idea we've been pushing they're gonna deport a legal is on their own they're going to find ways to hit up Pfizer on anti fraud statutes convene grand juries and,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
certainly certainly ban all these shots not just say see that that that's another game they're playing so over the weekend almost all these Republicans came out and said you will you know yeah we're not gonna force our kids to get a shot and it's like what this thing is a killed people what are you not gonna force it you need to get up there and say we're gonna ban it from our states yet their departments of health are still pushing it um amin Bundy you know we had him on the show he's running as an independent,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
Idaho Brad chicken little the leftist Republican who's then come bent and you know running again so he is one of them said oh we're not gonna do this in our state and amin Bundy tweeted out he said hey hey Brad there's a fine line between a mandate and co and coercion and then he cut a video of Brad little from last year saying now is the time to get a vaccine like okay well I guess you're saying you're not mandating it on kids but you're using every tool of your rhetoric and the state funding and state,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
organizations and state backed NGOs to promote it it's a death shot that's not good enough that that's the game they play we're we're beyond that we're beyond that point they're gonna play games all along with this stuff let me go on to another example of what the rhinos are doing where is this daily caller in a June 10th letter to Secretary of Transportation Pete butt gang National Republican Congressional Committee chairman representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota Express support for a multi-million dollar infrastructure grant application that strives to serve as a social justice measure it aims to address,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,HS
safety and equity equity concerns surrounding Minnesota State Highway 65 the completion of this project means improved economic opportunities for ethically underserved communities currently highway 65 is very difficult to travel or cross for people walking or riding bikes which is often a barrier to economic prosperity for many living around their emmer wrote to butt gang Emmer's letters sparked criticism from some other Republicans who told the daily call it will call it that the letter proves emmer agrees with Joe Biden and butt gang that America's highway system is racist so he supports this stuff he's saying that our,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
highway system somehow is racist meaning again we're not asking Republicans to fight like a hundred year ago or even ten year ago level conservatism you know you know like what Reagan wanted to do which is basically reverse the new deal that would have been nice but they didn't do it lied to us at the time and here we are where we are we're not I'm not asking them to be conservative I'm asking them to fight the fourth freakin right to be what Tulsi Gabbert is today to be what Naomi wolf and RFK junior are today that's,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
all we ask I'm not even asking for conservatism maybe one day we could rebuild a society in a couple new states where we could then push for conservative governance we're not even fighting for that now we're fighting for our lives and yet Tom emmer another example that he's part of leadership he has a vote on the steering committee he's the NRCC this is the guy who is in charge of funding and recruitment for the house races that will lead to the GOP majority he's the chairman of the Republican House campaign arm and he literally supports the,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
most woke insanity you could imagine that's what I'm telling you you don't even have to look for but like every other Republican he'll put out a thing saying oh you know yeah the inflation's bad the world the government the Democrats this but he supports it meaning what I'm the only difference between Republicans and the European fake right wing like like the Tories is that because we have more of a robust movement in America and tradition of Liberty so they have to play a double game whereas in Europe they just openly just say screw you I mean,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
you know this guy oh my gosh this guy Rishi the guy that just became prime minister and by the way you have all these prime ministers that are just chosen by the party no general election he was just picked you would think if you have a crisis where all these people just resigning you would trigger an election Rishi Sunak the new leader he said no we're not gonna hold general elections I don't know when you know statutorily they have to hold elections I'm not sure when the next one is but it's still a little while off,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
this guy is literally he's not he's not like the equivalent of a rhino he's like he's literally Claude Schwab he supports the common communist Chinese party he supports social credit scores pushing digital ID he's a Goldman Sachs guy wealthy as anything he's an animal this guy and he's the Tory leader so these Republicans won't openly use these terms they'll privately use them and like in this case a private letter to the transportation secretary but then they'll they'll play this double game and the light us this is the game I don't know how you recover from it,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
I don't know how you recover from it and folks let me go on to another rhino so we talked about Tom Cole in Oklahoma the governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt most people think he's a conservative the guy's a leftist the guy doesn't believe in incarceration except for January 6 the guy is he said we're gonna support electric cars green energy and freaking Oklahoma do you know what's interesting if you go to RCP polls you look at their map you see all these toss-up states the swing states the blue states it's supposedly a red wave year right,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
yet in Oklahoma the governor's race is a toss-up and the all the recent polls have the Democrat ahead of Kevin Stitt they might ask how in know and what's presumed to be a wave year is the guy behind in Oklahoma well the answer is he's corrupt as hell again I know people say well the media the Democrats are just corrupt yeah I know but the Republicans are also just corrupt so the media feasts on it there so he's very unpopular and you know that the candidate did the Democrat candidates doing great job she was a Republican,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
she has this whole line I was a Republican longer than you Kevin Stitt you know she recently changed and she's kind of playing this game so she's picking off a lot of people now I'm not telling you that for sure he'll lose he could still possibly win but the fact that he is technically a few points behind and I spoke to people that are very plugged into Oklahoma politics Oklahoma legislature they said that is it is it is real it's not like fake polling it is real doesn't mean he still won't win ultimately or can't win,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
but this is what we have in red states we have utter corrupt frauds and it's not changing it really is not changing unless you hold them accountable unless the top names at Fox and Newsmax and all the talk radio shows do what I do and pressure and expose these people expose the leverage points expose the dates that are important for different legislation different ideas make the play calls it won't happen on its own what will happen on its own is the inertia of everything I'm showing you what they're doing privately could you imagine they have the,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
hundred and first airborne there on Ukraine's border CBS reported it's not just about defending NATO territory the correspondent said they're fully prepared to cross over into Ukrainian territory think about this I have you ever seen the graphics comparing how much we've spent on Ukraine to every other country in Europe if this is really man I mean Putin's just gonna take over Europe he's like Hitler Ukraine is like check us a fuck your Poland and we got a defendant you would think Germany and England and France they'd be spending a boatload of money right why are we,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
spending the money why are we the ones doing it say if it's really what they said it was of course it's not we're literally provoking nuclear war over defending one of the greatest proxies of the WEF and Hunter Biden corruption the Republican Party 90% of the Republic no a hundred percent of the Republicans that matter and 80 to 90% of elected Republicans they support the very Ukrainian administration that essentially took down Trump all that Ukrainian corruption the the Russian hoax it all came out of there ties back into Hunter Biden the fake FBI petitions for the,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
FISA court all comes out of that Ukraine administration we have we have bled and spent tens of billions and are going to continue to now we have the 101st Airborne protecting the man that brought down Trump Zelensky I don't get it and you have a lot of like Trump supporting Republicans that are all into Ukraine I just for the life of me I don't get it meaning it's not even like they won't do the things that will help us meaning we're now at a point where even if you just have the status quo if Republicans would,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
quite literally spend the next two years of a GOP control of Congress doing no harm which would never have been that that would be unprecedented because they've never done that we're screwed because they have the news around our neck if you don't find ways to really raise what raise public awareness through the hearings through the standalone legislation through the media interviews through the states pushing back and through the budget bills of the fascism the tyranny the spying I mean it's no longer even COVID or even illegal immigration or even transgender terrorism I know that sounds shocking,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,HS
but if I had to if you put a gun to my head and said the number if you if you have one request to the genie out of the bottle one favor that could be done Daniel you're here to save people what's one thing I could do typically I would have said you know get rid of COVID fascism I'd probably say now to get rid of the national security apparatus and FBI NSA the spying and apprehension of American um dissidents because while right now it's only a counted amount of people everything we know this is going,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
to explode we will be in prison it absolutely will happen I'm convinced of that so absent a massive effort to focus on the issues message them properly get the governors to engage in interposition and then finally all that build up to the budget battles where you defund and refuse to sign any other bill absent a defund provision we're screwed yet Republicans not only won't do that they'll add to it they agree with the Ukraine stuff they agree with the January 6 persecution which again at this point it's it's not about January 6 they've gotten all those,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
people I'm saying even if you believe demonically in locking up someone pre-trial for walking into the freaking capital when the police actually open the doors and they and a lot of them got fired for that so that that's an admission that it's their fault right you can entrap someone let's say you know law enforcement says hey it's fine come in here you can't prosecute the guy for that and even if you would you know you never serve jail time these guys pre-trial they'll get five years is this guy from Tennessee I'm forgetting his name now it's,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
just slipping my mind you could look it up he he just got sentenced to four years he spent 22 minutes in the capital 22 minutes in the capital four years that's more than the people who burned down the police station in Minneapolis to the ground okay Republicans have no problem with that and the border is all a mirage they'll they'll pad they'll have some standalone things they're not gonna stop it they'll have more border security funding which by the way the Democrats will vote for that because you know what that funding is gonna go towards catch,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
and release there's only two ways to leverage against what they're doing number one at a state level deporting and at a federal level we don't have control of the executive branch so at the end of the day they're not gonna deport but at least to ban any release of any illegal alien into the country in anyway and to cut off all funding for any benefit anything education health care you name it so security cards and again a civil and criminal cause of action in court for any executive branch official caught engaging in that in that activity,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,HS
that is the only way out of it but here we have Republicans are screwing us by the way one other thing just so you know Carl Rove is now running ads in Pennsylvania saying that Fetterman is so extreme he's not nearly as extreme as Josh Shapiro right he's the attorney general is running for governor do you know what you know what they're doing it's a two for one it's a way of electing Oz a way of electing Oz but making sure that Shapiro wins the governor's race which is what they want can you imagine that they,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
don't want Doug mache triano we are always told oh my gosh whatever piece of crap comes out of that primary it does it he could be a world economic forum Republican you have to vote for him in the general election that's what we're told but yet when our guys win the primary they literally campaign for the Democrat you can't play by those rules anymore and of course the opposite needs to happen you need to vote for mache triano not Oz and again nobody name me one other person who does what I do maybe one other conservative,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
writer or talker who is addressing this who is properly diagnosing this and giving a solution they have no answers to this any of this what did you get in do with these subversive Republicans look through their rhetoric and everywhere not only are they not fighting for us they're actually in other words they're not only not putting out the fire with water or they're coming with a blowtorch with with lighter fluid we can't even get Republicans to talk like a new Canadian leader I don't know the background those of you from Canada would know more I didn't,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
see this coming I guess they had a new election so Alberta is the most conservative province in Canada but but even Alberta had a garbage leader throughout Covid they got a new one Danielle Smith the premier of the province listen to this clip of her it's beautiful apologizing for lockdowns take a listen here finally the Ottawa problem there can be no doubt that the current NDP liberal alliance is just the latest in a long line of Ottawa governments that have frustrated the legitimate aspirations of hard-working Albertans that stops now when Ottawa announces policies and laws that,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
attack our economy or violate the rights of our people or when Ottawa seeks to take control of our sovereign areas of provincial jurisdiction our UCP government will not enforce those laws and policies in this province period and let me and let me be very clear I will never ever apologize for standing up for the people of Alberta and the province that I serve so we will pass the sovereignty act worked as already begun on crafting it we worked on it earlier this week at the caucus retreat we still further work to do but I've asked for,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
it to be ready by the time I take my seat in the legislature we will then introduce it and we will pass it and we will use it to push Ottawa back into its own lane every single time that they step out of line and intrude on our constitutional rights Alberta will no longer ask permission from Ottawa to be prosperous and free so again that was Danielle Smith the new premier in Alberta apologize for lockdowns and she says we're gonna have a sovereignty act anything that Ottawa does that is you know tyrannical or even harmful economically,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
it doesn't happen here now I don't know the legal structure of Canada so well but I do know there's no doubt that provinces are not nearly as powerful and autonomous historically and sovereign as American states are so here she's willing to say that in Alberta how many Republicans have taught how many Republican governors have talked like that the closest is Rhonda Santis but I mean where Texas Oklahoma the Dakotas Wyoming Idaho South Carolina Alabama Sippy Tennessee where do you see this Arkansas Missouri they just said we won't force kids to get the vaccine oh okay wow,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
that's great great that's that's that's very brave but no the most important thing is what she said we've been talking a lot about the budget bills you know the hearings the way to leverage the feds but ultimately I still believe the most important thing are the Republican governors and state legislatures they could they could end this tomorrow remember Danielle Smith is a lot more isolated there's only one of her and Ottawa is much stronger the people are more leftist you look at the polls the people are not even souring on Trudeau that much they agree with,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS
a lot of this they're brainwashed like in Europe here at least the people are like dude vote the Democrats out we want them out they're gonna have such a freaking Mandy that's why getting back to what I started the show with November 9th the day after is so important I need help I need a movement focused on every Republican state with a trifecta what are all the legislative things we can do on the border on Transient genderism on medical freedom on interposing federal tyranny including political persecutions on energy policy other economic policies pushing back against discrimination,6350_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-24_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Those were horrific enough,204_AMERICA OUT LOUD PODCAST NETWORK_2023-07-16_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But those same kind of experiments were continued in the United States in the 1940s and 50s and 60s in a variety of ways that is a dark aspect of our own history that most Americans today simply don't know,204_AMERICA OUT LOUD PODCAST NETWORK_2023-07-16_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It was in this same timeframe that the world's health organization and Gavi global Alliance for vaccine initiatives launched the hcg tetanus toxoid vaccines in Africa without informing either the African governmental leaders or the population on which they were experimenting that this particular tetanus toxoid with human chorionic gonadotropin as part of it would actually lead to sterilization of young women,204_AMERICA OUT LOUD PODCAST NETWORK_2023-07-16_transcription.json,HS

 But also remember that Ezekiel Immanuel was in the shadows as the Biden administration's COVID health policy advisor,204_AMERICA OUT LOUD PODCAST NETWORK_2023-07-16_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so the complete life system and rationing of care for elderly got played out in America as the COVID death protocol leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in our hospitals when they were denied proper care for COVID forced on to remdesivir and ventilators denied fluids and proper nutrition denied antibiotics and denied treatment for many other common medical illnesses that are treatable,204_AMERICA OUT LOUD PODCAST NETWORK_2023-07-16_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You hear that guys Chelsea Handler is here to clear up your miss education,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Dylan Mulvaney is helping her clear up your miss education by telling you that the most holy thing that you can aspire to is to cut off your penis,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's actually what they're talking about,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the only reason that you don't realize that is because of capitalism or something, horses conversation makes entirely no sense",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And she believes, I guess the number has jumped",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now there are 50 million different things that you can plausibly choose from,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you guys just go ahead, just decide what you are today",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But don't worry guys, they're going to continue this conversation and you're going to feel really, really bad for Dylan Mulvaney and realize that you are irresponsible in your miss education",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Take a listen,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's what I think a lot of these haters don't realize is that the the mental effects of of misgendering in the media, it breaks my heart because you know, there are people calling me a man and I don't right now, I feel like I'm not even processing any of it because I'm so scared to do that deep dive and to know what the effects are",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, so you get it, Dylan Mulvaney is not processing the fact that there are people that are calling him a man and Chelsea sees this as something that is cruel",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And of course, we don't ever intend when we refer to Dylan Mulvaney as a man for him to be sad or for him to feel that we are being cruel",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is like when we say water is wet or that we breathe air, these are basic facts",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is not something that is meant to hurt you,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, people that are trying to hurt you mentally are the ones that are lying to you and telling you that you are a woman or that there are an amount of pills that you can take to become a woman or that there are an amount of cosmetic procedures that you can fulfill that will suddenly make you a woman",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those people are trying to hurt you,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are trying to encourage you to fall out of the delusion that you are existing within,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I got to thinking about Chelsea Handler more of than Dylan Mulvaney here,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What is it? What is Chelsea Handler? Somebody that I actually when I grew up when I was young and I was in middle school, I used to love her",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I thought she was so irreverent,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She had this great sense of humor,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was constantly actually offering commentary on how crazy and ludicrous people in Hollywood are,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is actually how she made her name, like talking about how foolish and delusional people are in Hollywood",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then she became them,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So how is she served by the trans narrative? Why is she putting herself in front of Dylan Mulvaney in an effort to say to other people it is not okay to tell this person the truth? What does she gain from that? Because of course, Chelsea is not doing this out of an act of altruism",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's doing this for herself for selfish reasons,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" And I started thinking about other women in Hollywood who similarly put themselves in front of men and say no, he can also be a woman",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 And I come up with this list,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Emma Watson is somebody that instantly comes to mind,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've talked about her on the show because it was so hideous that a girl who referred to herself as a feminist, right? I'm talking about the girl who played her my own engrainger in a Harry Potter referred herself as a feminist all throughout her career only to turn her back on JK Rowling, the person who produced the Harry Potter's book",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it basically gave her her entire career and said, I don't stand by JK because she says that she's a woman and she doesn't understand the plight of transgender individuals",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" So she stood up for men when it really mattered, when it really mattered for her to prove that she was a feminist and stand up to the mob in defense of actual women, she chose to stand up for men",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why? Another person that I thought of was Charlie Stearan,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We talked about her on the show yesterday,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Charlie Stearan is a person who has a child that she adopted and purports that he even though she adopted a boy is now a woman,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And she was one of the first people in Hollywood to speak out on this, the first person to say, I have a child that identifies this way",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why? What about Jamila Jamil? You might not be familiar with her,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She is a podcaster now,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was or is an actress,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's British,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She is 37 years old,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she similarly speaks out and is one of the loudest voices to protect this transgender narrative,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" What do all of these women have in common? Well, feminism for sure to be certain these people of proportion that they are feminists and that they care about women, even if they aren't acting that part",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" But when you examine their personal lives, it becomes abundantly clear why it is so necessary for them to defend and explain the transgender movement",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" Emma Watson, she's 33 years old",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So she still has time, but she is single",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She now says that she is self partnered,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She has essentially pushed men out of her life for various reasons,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, she once told a story about a man that tried to pay for her on a date",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And she said, no, no, no, no, no",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want equality,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 I will pay for myself,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I guess men didn't actually like that,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so she's becoming stranger and stranger as the years go on,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She recently did a birthday post purporting that she has witches that are around her super strange,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can look it up on Instagram,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not making that up,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Jamila Jamil, she once said that her own abortion when she was younger at eight weeks pregnant had left her with not a minute of regret, only quote deep relief and gratitude that I'd lived in a country that made abortion accessible and safe",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Similarly for Chelsea Handler, she spoke out about the three abortions that she had in high school",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She wrote about those abortions,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She wrote about how proud she was to have those abortions,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, Jamila Jamil is now alone and single and childless Chelsea Handler is now alone and single and childless Charlie Stherin while she has adopted children is alone has never been married and has never had a biological child",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I often talk on this show on what happens if you play with feminism for too long,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" I have said colloquially and only half kidding that if you don't use your eggs, they scramble",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm not saying that there aren't exceptional circumstances of maybe a woman who has never had children and never had a husband and truly lives a remarkably fulfilled life,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Maybe that you listening to this, but do not consider yourself the exception",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Consider yourself the rule,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Women were made to nurture whether it is a relationship, whether it is a child, women, our natural biological disposition is toward nurturing",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" And when we deny that within ourselves, when we deny ourselves family, we deny ourselves marriage and or children, we become something else",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so I think has happened with these women is that because they believe that they denied themselves their own femininity because there is a deep, tremendous underlying sadness that exists within all of these women",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" They now want everyone in the world to feel that they want to believe that femininity can be denied writ large that you know what, everything that I ever heard about what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a feminine is just an idea",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 It's an ideology,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 Anybody can be a woman,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 Anybody can turn off their womanhood because I've done it and I may be happy and I may be fulfilled,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" And actually, no, I'm not",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So instead, I'm going to jump on the side of the people that want to erase femininity, that and want to erase what it means to be a woman that want to downgrade it and degrade it, really, to just lipsticks and heels and fake cosmetic procedures, all the things that do not equate to womanhood",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 And so that's what I believe is happening,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I believe that radical feminism must necessarily find a home and lock arms amongst transgenderism,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 It's a sad truth,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let all of these women be a warning to you,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" Do not play with feminism for too long or you will have a very lonely, sad existence and turn yourself into an activist for things that are horrific",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 And that's all I'm going to say about that,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Living a healthy lifestyle can be challenging when you're always on the go,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You need simple, manageable routines to make sure you're getting the proper nutrition every day, which is why I'm a huge fan of balance of nature",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Balance of nature, fruits and veggies are a great way to make sure that you're getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Through balance of nature's advanced cold vacuum process, the vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients of the fruits and vegetables are preserved so that you can get the vital nutrition in each capsule",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Balance of nature is a whole food supplement with no additives, fillers, extracts, synthetics, pesticides, or added sugar",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The only thing in their capsules is pure fruits and vegetables,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's not a bunch of their fruit and veggie capsules down to the studio for my team to try and the whole team is feeling brighter, healthier, and more energetic",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When you're disciplined enough to take care of your health, you will reap all kinds of benefits",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Make balance of nature fruits and veggies a part of your daily diet,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Okay, now it's time for some topics to show",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I make a lot of cultural predictions on this show and usually they pan out to be correct with time,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Sometimes they get yelled at by you guys and you're like, you're wrong and then like some months or year passes and you're like, come back and you're right to comment",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, I didn't see it coming",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's okay,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm making another prediction,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've already made it about JoJo Siwa,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She was the girl who started on Dance Moms, super cute, ecstatic, and fun",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, another child star",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are a lot of bad things that happened as we learn in Hollywood when children find fame too young,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so I made the prediction that she was going to become like a Demi Lovato, that she doesn't actually know who she is",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she's becoming more and more extreme in the character adaptations of JoJo Siwa,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 First she came out as a lesbian and she said that it was because she essentially had a bad date and that she likes the way Jenna doing dances,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I guess that makes her a lesbian,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" Well, she's now gone on to a podcast",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And all I can say is I do not recognize this iteration of JoJo Siwa from the JoJo Siwa that we had yesterday,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So before I show you the clip of her talking about sex on this podcast, I would at first like to put you in a time machine and we're going to go back 20 years ago",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this is JoJo Siwa appearing on Ellen because the contrast is well, stark",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Take a listen to JoJo Siwa one year ago,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I have watched 4,550 people come out on this stage and I just got to have that moment and I'm so happy",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm so happy to,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just want to put my feet on it,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can do whatever you want to say,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just really happy to be here right now,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She said, however you want",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm happy to have you here,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a big deal,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're here,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You were born the same year that we started our show,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's wild,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You probably don't remember the first episode,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, that's me as a little baby",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, I don't remember the first episode, but I do remember watching everything on Ellen",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I love all the little kids,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I could name them all little Brielle, little Emma, Noah, Macy, all the little kids that have been on the show",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, number one fan",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like have watched every single video,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Love all of them so much,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All the games,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh my gosh, ones we drop the people",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The one,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Oh my gosh,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You bet your wife,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One of my favorites,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So great,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mine too,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So there you have it,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 JoJo Siwa,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's super bubbly,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's super cute,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's still appealing to children,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, she's a lesbian and she's so proud to be on Ellen stage",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And of course, it's necessary once you become a lesbian to always wear rainbows or else how else would we know you were gay? So she's wearing a nice rainbow coat, but she's bubbly",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 She's fun and she's sparkly,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So this is the JoJo civil adaptation of since she's been on YouTube, right? Appealing to children",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, now she's on a podcast",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think she does her YouTube show anymore,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I might be wrong about that,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't matter,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And she is essentially, I don't know, all I'm going to say is somebody different",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Take a listen,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's hard for me,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's hard for the person that I'm dating or talking to because like, I can't do things",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what I mean? Like how most people can go on a dinner date,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I can't go on a dinner date normally,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know what I mean? Like I can, but I have to call and say JoJo Siwa, can I have a private table in the private room? And it's great",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what I mean? But then you have to know that like you're not just you can't just go,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can't just go,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And like, I also can't there's freedom in that there's freedom in that",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And also any time that I'm away from my house,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So like census is about gay sex,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've only had sex in the privacy of my own room,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Besides your dad calling in size, my dad calling in",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But in my own room or my own hotel room, like I mean, I'm, I don't know really what normal teenagers do, but I'm assuming that it happens",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A car, a park, a bathroom stall, like whatever, you know what I mean? But like because of who I am, like, I can't do that",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's JoJo Siwa today,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I guess now she's a butch lesbian,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 I don't know when that happened,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She essentially became Rosie O'Donnell, kind of stole Rosie O'Donnell's thing",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's wearing a backwards cap,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you're listening to this on just audio and you're not seeing it, she's wearing a backwards cap",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's got on baggy jeans,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Her whole style, just the whole demeanor looks very butch lesbian",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" She's wearing a big oversized black t-shirt, but it does still have a rainbow on it because else, how else would we know she was lesbian? You got away from the rainbow everywhere",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 Just how down you are with the movement,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why I say that I think that she's a fake lesbian,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 I don't think JoJo Siwa knows who she is,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot going on in that clip and I'd like to unpack all of it,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" First and foremost, how cringe to say that you think you're so famous that you can't go to a restaurant",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know what has happened to JoJo Siwa or why she thinks that she has Taylor Swift level fame and Kim Kardashian level fame,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She doesn't,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I can assure you that if she was walking down the street right now in London, where I am right now, and not a single person would recognize who she is",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Maybe some children might recognize her, but she has not achieved the global level of fame that says that she can't walk down the street",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's already cringe,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But then moving on to what necessarily must happen once you come out as a lesbian because there's something that is overtly sexual now about the LGBTQIA plus at every letter community where every single time they speak to us or if they're doing their pride parades, they have to be wearing a dildo",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" To show your allegiance to pride, to show that you are really proud, you need to be making out on the streets of Los Angeles during the entire Pride Month",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have to show people how proud you are to be sexual,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's obviously incredibly demeaning,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's something attractive about it, as I say, that you should not feel pride in what they are putting in demonstration during Pride Month",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I would be horrified if this was my children,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But for whatever reason, she believes that she's not having sex like a regular person because she, very famous JoJo who can't walk into a restaurant, JoJo Siwa, without being seen, has to have sex in the privacy of her own home",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What am I missing here? What did she think that we're all straight people or people that are unknown are all having sex in bathroom stalls, incredibly young, incredibly immature",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it is this particular code switch that I'm the most offended by that,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 JoJo Siwa just keeps adapting who she is and adapting who her character is,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I won't fault her, the clothing change, I think that with time, whenever you look back on photos, the way you dress when you're 19, 20 is not going to be the way that you dress when you are in your early 30s",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Those things change, but the way that you speak and the way that you communicate are not things that change",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I am again making the prognostication that JoJo Siwa is going to end up like Demi Lovato,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a girl that is screaming for attention and she's getting attention for all the wrong reasons,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" So now we are on sex, butch, lesbian, Rosie O'Donnell, JoJo Siwa version, adding it to the list and with more time, there's going to be many more iterations of who she is",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All right, guys, as a final cultural topic, I have to get to this",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's so much that I want to say about this,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no way that I'm going to have enough time,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is, I would probably say, the number one prediction that I have been making that divides my fans because I have a legion of Swifties that also listen to my podcast",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I love you all and I do not fault you for being Taylor Swift fans,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have her music on my iPhone,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let me actually slow this down,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm going to make myself at first say three really nice things about Taylor Swift, okay? Number one, she makes really catchy music",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I like her old stuff better than her new stuff, but there is no doubt that Taylor Swift is definitely musically talented",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Number two, nobody rocks a bang better than Taylor Swift",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, that girl actually looks better with bangs every time I see the way she wears it, whether it's shaggy, whether it's straight",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think she looks phenomenal,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Number three, she is incredibly hard worker",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I deeply respect how hard she works,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Her current era's tour, I think each of her stops is three hours on stage",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you guys knew how much energy that takes to commit, Taylor Swift had us off to",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're an incredibly hard worker,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And now that I've gotten that out of the way so that the people that are Swifties, I also love me",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't get too enraged to me,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm going to tell you my very longstanding prediction about her,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Taylor Swift is a ticking time bomb in conservative worlds,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 I have been saying this for a very long time,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She has amassed a legion of fans,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've seen her kind of dabble her toe and say a thing here or there about politics,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Taylor Swift, it's the same age as me",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're both born 89,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that means that Taylor Swift is just about to turn 34 years old,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we've not yet seen Taylor Swift go fully crazy because she's had boys to keep her busy,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, aside from the fact that she switches relationships way too fast, which I think is problematic",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it is a bad example to the young women that follow her and decide from the fact that she pretty much collects friends like their beanie babies, is where all things that I fault her for",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The bigger issue when it comes to Taylor Swift is that she is an actual fraud,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" I mean, I cannot make this clear enough",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And like I said, you might just you might disagree with me now, but I am telling you that I'm going to give it about five years for everything that I say to be proven right",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Her entire stick and you know that one of the things that pains me the most are women that infantilize themselves, right? So I just told you that Taylor Swift is 34 years old",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" When you hear Taylor Swift talk to her audiences, she sounds like she's a little scared girl",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's her act,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a little scared girl,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I need my legion of 12 and 11 year olds fans to all attack the person or the thing that I'm no longer happy with,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, essentially, she is a bit of a glorified bully",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's routinely makes music about individuals that she feels she's been burned by and the way that she gets even with them,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's basically got the Mean Girl Burn book is she creates a catchy pop tune,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then she has a legion of people singing tunes that are that is actually about a real person,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But nobody thinks about it this way because you say it's art,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And maybe I should learn from that,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe what I should start doing on the show is creating catchy songs about everybody that annoys me that I don't like,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe I should make a catchy pop song about transgenderism and Dylan Mulvaney,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" I'll try that next year, but that's not going to be my stick today",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to point you to just an example of what I'm talking about in terms of her pretending to be a little girl when in fact she is a woman that is 34 years old,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is a clip from her Netflix special, which was called a documentary that was called Miss Americana",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she's going to sell to audiences that she's just a scary little girl that wants to find her voice to speak out about politics as she's speaking to her parents,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Take a listen,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It really is a big deal,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She votes against against fair pay for women,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She votes against the reauthorization of the violence against women act, which is just basically protecting us from the best of abuse and stalking",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stalking,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She votes,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She thinks that if you're a gay couple, or even if you look like a gay couple, you should be allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 It's really basic human rights and it's right and wrong at this point,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I can't see another commercial and see her disguising these policies behind the words, Tennessee Christian values",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those are Tennessee Christian values,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I live in Tennessee,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am Christian,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not what we stand for,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I need to do this,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I need you to just die,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 I need you to forgive me for doing it because I'm doing it,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If Taylor Swift was a 15 year old little girl and sitting on that couch cross-legged crying in front of her mommy and daddy about how she wanted to find her voice, I would buy that",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, Taylor Swift is 34 years old",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She does not need to ask mommy and daddy to do anything at all,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She never has to have for a very long time has she had to ask her parents whether she can do anything,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She owns homes all over the world,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, she buys homes wherever her many boyfriends live every time that she's dating them",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is her selling an act,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's very thoughtful,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's very intelligent,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a marketing act of her once again being the little girl, which is fine because that marketing act works for her",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But when she uses it to attack individuals and to send people, get her lesion of fans to send death threats to every single person that makes her angry, it becomes extremely problematic",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I will give you just one example that made me really recognize how absolutely insane Taylor Swift is,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 Scooter Braun is a huge executive,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He owns Big Machine Records with Scott Borchetta,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is who Big Machine Records is who Taylor Swift signed with when she was young, when she was just 15 years old",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Something to know about Taylor Swift is she's never been a victim,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Her parents are extremely wealthy when she decided that she wanted to be a singer and pretend to be from Nashville,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Her parents moved her from her hometown in Pennsylvania down to Nashville and got her the meetings with music execs,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is not a come-up story where Taylor Swift was some shy girl who had a little bit of talent and was maybe living on the streets and got discovered,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was an executive decision between her parents and their lawyers to sign with Big Machine Records,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like I said, had lawyers that were present and at the time, they never knew how famous Taylor Swift was going to get",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They made a bet that she might sell some music, but obviously if they had, if hindsight 2020 and knew how big of a star she was going to be, they would have never in a million years signed the deal that they signed then",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So Taylor Swift decides, learns that her masters have been sold to Scooter Braun by Scott Borchetta, which is a regular business decision",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She is allowed to buy her masters,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Scooter Braun decided to buy her masters,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When she found this out, rather than realizing, oh well, I lost out on a business deal, she instead appealed to her legion of crazy fans to attack Scooter Braun by pretending that she was a victim because she is a woman",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
 Here's what she actually wrote on her tumbler,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For years, I asked, I pleaded for a chance to own my work",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Instead, I was given an opportunity to sign back up to big machine records and earn one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Music that I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos that I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars and then clubs and then arenas and then stadiums,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Some facts about today's news,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I learned about Scooter Braun's purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All I could think about was the incessant manipulative bullying that I've received at his hands for years,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated in a legally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or when his client Kanye West organized a revenge porn music video, which stripped my body naked",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now Scooter Braun has stripped me of my life's work that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is my worst case scenario,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is what happens when you sign a deal at 15 to someone for whom the term loyalty is clearly just a contractual concept,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And when that man says music has value, he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When I left my masters in Scott's hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Never in my worst nightmares, I imagine the buyer would be Scooter",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Anytime Scott Borchetta has heard the words Scooter Braun escaped my lips,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was when I was either crying or trying not to,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He knew what he was doing,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They both did controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them in perpetuity,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That means forever,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you get this, she does this routinely",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When she doesn't get what she wants, she paints it as this feminist moment as a little girl on a scared little girl, these big men are bullying me",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,HS
" No, you made a business decision not to purchase your masters",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Scooter Braun took his money and he purchased your masters,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nothing happened to you,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He didn't mug you on the street,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He didn't do this to spite you who did this to make money, which is the point of business",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what happened as a result of this post, Scooter Braun and his then wife were harassed",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They received death threats,5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They had to triple up on their security because Taylor Swift's little fans who don't understand the way business works, who don't understand that acting the part of an innocent little girl when you're actually in your 30s is actually wildly manipulative and sociopathic decided to attack them because their queen, Taylor Swift, is hurting and they have to make it better by threatening to kill people that are hurt by her",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, there have been so many people in Hollywood who have said that Taylor Swift is manipulative and sociopathic, what she did to Katy Perry, marching hot girls against her in a music video when she got upset with her",5442_Candace Owens_2023-05-11_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But embrace it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a fight worth having,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're in the freedom,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the Buck Sexton Show podcast,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you think you'd get fair treatment from CNN if your brother had a prime time show on that channel? Well, if an ifson butts were candy and nuts every day would be Christmas",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think it's pretty clear some of these networks obviously they have agendas,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're doing narratives,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not trying to report facts anymore,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all about spinning whatever narrative they think and get ratings,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's just the reality of the situation,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it doesn't impact me,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to continue keeping our eye on the ball and working as hard as we can to deliver results,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And results have been delivered,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's focus on some positives here,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The lockdown lives,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Democrat left they have been wrong on this stuff on how to handle COVID,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I know you'd say, well, but buck, look at how the elections are going",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, but it's really just Trump and Georgia that we have to to mourn at this point as elections go",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really just those,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I know that's a lot,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm not saying it's it's it's minor, but the house Republicans actually picked up seats and state legislatures did well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, there there is some there's some reason for limited optimism about that",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know if we had if we had held the Senate, everything would have felt like it was okay, but I wouldn't say okay, but it would have felt better folks",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm trying to find silver linings,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't have to say, but still, but Florida is one big silver lining because you have a governor who has defied the consensus",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have a governor who has refused to go and bend the knee to the fauciites,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That guy fauci is a complete jackass and it's disgusting what he's done to the country,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He should be ashamed of himself,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He never will be,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's important for everybody to know it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't matter,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They'll never come a time when the people who advocated for all of this sit back and say, you know what? We were wrong",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what? We didn't have to lock down the country after all,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That didn't really give us any benefit and it caused a lot of drawbacks for us,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we're sorry,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Unfortunately, I can sit here and tell you that's never going to happen",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Doesn't matter what the data shows,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Doesn't matter what the eventual epidemiological advances are where we have a better understanding of how really the virus spreads, meaning how quickly how easily we have some general numbers about all that",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But all right,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know how well how well do you learn? Notice you can't even ask this question,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I say how well do masks work, people start screaming masks work",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How well I can tell you how well a vaccine works based on large controlled trials that nine of different vaccines, 95, 94% effective for COVID-19",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Though that's real data,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How well do masks work? Anyone want to try it? Oh, we've got a model that says if 80% of people were a mask 90% of the time",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And 40% of places, then it would be 95%",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is all just make believe they don't know,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not real data,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's like when they're telling you what the climate's going to be in a hundred years,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't and they're wrong,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course, every 10 years they have to keep adjusting these things",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't know,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they're never going to change,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're never going to admit that this was all disastrous,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in fact, I'm of the belief that the Democrats ability to dominate the narrative because of the media panic that was induced or the media inducing panic in the public, the Democrat narrative about COVID and how Trump was so inept and so ineffective and handling it, I think that played a very large role in the election because that's not something people would necessarily tell to a pollster or it's not something that the data would all that clearly indicate",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think that it affected overall perception is Trump doing a good job,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A lot of people would look at what happened in 2020 with COVID and they'd say, well, look at how terrible things are in the country",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is that fair? No,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Did the media exploit this? Yes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it worked,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It worked,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what we're going to see now is there are going to be these red state or redder states placed like Florida,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Havens set up and where you have you have these mass migrations occurring from the blue strongholds, California, New York, they're going to have enormous problems",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now they're going to try to make up that shortfall in tax revenue at the federal level now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The federal bailouts are coming for these cities,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So understand there, that's the socialism that we don't spend much time talking about, the redistribution of wealth to prefer Democrat enclaves at the federal level",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now they would say, oh, but they, you know, they pay more in taxes and the red states have, you know, to get more benefits per president",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What I'm saying is that, yeah, but they're about to turn this whole thing around because they're going to start shooting the money gun at all these blue states that are hemorrhaging residents",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They can try to shore up the public sector unions,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They can try to make it seem like the holes in the budgets are not so catastrophic,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So they're going to try to stop that mass migration from happening because it's bad for the, for the Democrat brand",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 have Florida,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I saw the sent us say that they're up 20% in housing sales, 20% during a pandemic",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" People are, are fleeing",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going there,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're saying, no, if I can't do this anymore, I talk to friends in New York",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I got to say we're under, you know, a strict lockdown here and people are just there, they're cracking up",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, they're losing it for what, what's the benefit? What would happen if you opened up restaurants in New York City, but you had these mitigation measures in place and the limitations of people",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The answer is it would basically be what it is right now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So why not open up the restaurants? It would 90 based on their data, it would be 99% the same",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that's not worth it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not worth it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's worth putting tens of thousands of people out of work, immiserated, sick, homeless, perhaps all, all, it's worth that to have a, a, a possible 1% reduction in cases",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Wow,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I guess, you know, if it's, you know, saves just one life, we better shut down every year for the flu",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If that's going to be our approach, every year got to shut down the flu's coming",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What those tens of thousands of lives don't matter,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know what happened if we, I also, I have to wonder, the flu is basically eradicated",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How is that possible? Oh, because social distancing and mask wearing now, we're led to believe is almost 100% effective against the influenza virus, but like not effective",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Really, well, you can't prove it at any data effective is whatsoever based on what's happening right now with COVID",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Notice they don't even have an explanation for this other than, yeah, it works against the flu super well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hmm,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's quite strange,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Considering there are tens of millions of flu cases every year, it's pretty contagious, folks",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But DeSantis is a shining light from a sunshine state,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" No charges for the police officer who shot Jacob Blake in canocha, Wisconsin",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, you may recall this was over the summer when BLM was engaged in riots across the country",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And BLM was looting stores and attacking innocent people's businesses and homes and throwing rocks at police officers,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Antifa was trying to blind cops with lasers fired in their eyes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You remember what all that was going on? All about what's happening,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The media was also looking for any opportunity to take a story of a police involved shooting and turn it into some kind of evil racist look, another cop doing what cops do being terrible, shooting an unarmed black man and then get the cycle going all over again",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I will say just as an aside, it is deeply disappointing to me as an American that the Democrats did not pay a bigger price for their their reckless demagoguery on this issue",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they're they're really wholesale embrace of not just the BLM movement, but also they're either turning a blind eye to or just open support of Antifa",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And remember Antifa took up the Black Lives Matter banner at different points in order to give them a kind of moral legitimacy they would not have otherwise had,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's what that's what was happening in the summer,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I will tell you, I think I may have heard of canocha Wisconsin before this summer, but I might not have not a place that I could say I know very well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So a city of about 50,000, I think it just barely qualifies as a city",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really kind of a big town,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there was a shooting in canocha Wisconsin and we have video of the shooting,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What occurred? What happened that that led to riots? Remember canocha was the scene of riots and those riots were so so extreme that then people like Kyle Rittenhouse showed up to protect some of the businesses and some of the government buildings that were being mobbed and assaulted,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then Rittenhouse was mobbed and assaulted,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then he shot shot and killed someone he says in self defense,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it certainly seems from the video and the evidence presented so far that it was self defense,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we'll see what the courts say,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We'll see where this goes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now we have canocha a a final determination about the officer involved shooting that led to the riots that led to the Rittenhouse incident,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And here's what happened,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The Democrat district attorney, the Democrat district attorney found that the police officer here should not be charged",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right? The police officer involved in this shooting didn't actually break the law,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is a pretty a pretty straightforward case if you actually look at the facts,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's not surprising to me that the Democrat, oh, the Washington Post deleted the they deleted the tweet I responded to",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not surprising to me,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Democrat prosecutor didn't bring the initial, they didn't bring criminal charges",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And here's why they have video of of Jacob Blake refusing police commands, obviously and repeatedly and clearly the police are saying stop, stop, don't move, don't move, show me your hand, show me your hands or yelling at this guy",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he's going moving around to the driver's side of a car, reaching into the car to grab something",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what's happening,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's reaching into the car to to seize something,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he grabbed a knife,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The officer who shot him had his hand on Blake's back holding his shirt, yelling at him to show him his hand, show him his hands",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He waited,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He did everything he could do,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The next level of this would have been that officer sitting to or waiting to see if Blake was going to stab him in the face or the throat or the chest with the knife,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why are you going for a knife when police have guns drawn on you in broad daylight and are saying stop, stop, stop",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If police cannot fire under those circumstances, what we're saying is police are not allowed to defend themselves against lethal force",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Very straightforward,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not a close call situation,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If someone if if police say show me your hands, show me your hands and you have a gun in your waistband and it's on video and you reach for and grab your gun, they're going to shoot you",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're not going to wait to see if you draw that weapon and fire at them first,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That act of refusing commands and reaching for a weapon is enough under the under the the rules of force use,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The rules of application of force for people in the law enforcement community,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is a legitimate use of force situation,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The way the way that Washington Post reported on this was appalling,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no surprise here,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What do they do? They initially said the headline and now they've deleted it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was going to read it to you but it was on Twitter,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They deleted it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The headline was something like no charges in the shooting of Jacob Blake and unarmed black man who was shot by police seven times in the back,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Long headline,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why was that the headline? Why wasn't the headline just no charges? I mean, if you were just doing a news story, wouldn't it be no charges against police officer and Jacob Blake shooting? Why did the garbage key publication notice the Washington Post? Why they make the decision three people on the byline by the way of a on a breaking news story that was clearly going to get a lot of attention like this to say that Jacob Blake was unarmed and that he was shot seven times in the back",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Are those now those are those are details that you put in a news story,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why is that of the headline? Because what the Washington Post was trying to do was say that this was a racist murder by police and it's going unpunished and what LeBron,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do we have the LeBron audio mark? Yes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, this this LeBron James, one of the most wealthy, famous, influential people on the planet",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is how he reacts to the story publicly on his social media accounts with tens of millions of followers,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I'm smart enough to know that even though we're playing a game of basketball that there's so much more that's going on in the world,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not so much more to see even more important than us playing a game,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And to hear what happened in canoesha today was a was a blow to the heart and to the gut,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know not only to that community, you know, what to us and to every, you know, yes, you know, black person that that just has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And to happen to his family and to happen to the kid himself, see that verdict",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was just, it was a blow to the gut",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like I said, the blow to the heart",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" He's, he's known pretty much everywhere where they have, you know, internet access and a TV",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to know LeBron James is for all intensive purposes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's probably worth a billion dollars or a close to it already,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 For playing basketball and this guy is an international superstar,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and what I want to know is yes, there is absolutely a need",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's absolutely a role for sympathy for Jacob Blake's family,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that's true",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's always the case,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, even if someone is in a drunk driving accident that they cause and they die, you feel bad for the family, they've lost someone",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Jacob Blake as we know was shot,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was paralyzed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So he did live, but he was paralyzed after being shot by my police",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that has a, that's obviously a lifelong burden",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a, it's a loss for that family as well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's something that is a tragedy for them,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what's interesting to me about this is, is that LeBron James clearly wants an attempt, an attempted murder charge here",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, this, this man was paralyzed",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 He was shot seven times,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so LeBron wants this cop to be treated like a racist would be killer,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This cop out of, out of racism tried to kill and paralyzed Jacob Blake",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Does that, does that sound like justice to anyone? Does that sound like something that should happen here? I mean, in, in what world is that a fair outcome? You know, the Washington Post in their headline said unarmed, you know what the problem with that is he wasn't unarmed",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they had to delete the headline,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They had to walk that old thing back,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're still at this stage lying about this incident because they're playing to a narrative,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that narrative is deeply destructive,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And LeBron James is playing to that narrative too, although I think, you know, I think he believes it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that is that police are racist murderers of black men and that the police, and the policing in America is deeply rooted in systemic and vicious racism",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's a really dangerous charge to put out there, especially because it's not true",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just not true,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, they keep finding these incidents like this and they tell us that it's racism and then we see it or we learn more about it, whether it's what happened in Ferguson, Missouri",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not saying there's no racism,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course, I'm not saying there are no cops who are murderers",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Of course there are,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you know, to treat all cops as though they're the bad guys and then to hold up these incidents where the cops aren't even doing anything wrong",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a tragedy, but it's not a crime",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's irresponsible,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's reckless,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's destructive,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the Washington Post, of course, the Democrats are all a part of this",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why would the Washington Post get that such a key detail? He wasn't unarmed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The guy had a knife,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's on video,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the district attorney in Kenosha saw it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all very clear,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He went for a knife,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or what are we going to do? Tell cops that they have to get, you know, stabbed in the neck before they can use their service weapon and defense of themselves",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And what phase are cops allowed to actually take action so that they get to go home to their families? And they're, you know, we're talking to all human beings here",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They people who love them, people who care about them",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we have police to protect all of us to protect you and me,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are very important laws and rules and regulations and use of force escalation that is taught and that is necessary for law enforcement,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what happened here was all within the scope of this officer's lawful duties,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But that, but see, they lie about it because they're so desperate",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" The Washington Post lies, but they deleted the tweet",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've admitted this at all,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have a correction,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The family says he was unarmed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They said on their correction, but the DA and the video says that he actually was grabbing a knife",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, I'm sorry",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the family lawyer now, that's, that's how they do reporting",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, this person's family lawyer says, you know, that they were innocent of the charge",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we're, our headlines going to say innocent of a charge",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not how it works,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Although it is for Democrats and for leftists,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But here's the other, here's the other issue",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's the bigger part of this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Democrats are going to do a lot more of this going ahead now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They feel emboldened to do this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're going to build upon and try to hammer home this narrative of cops or racist law enforcement as racist,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And therefore we have to do things to hurt law enforcement,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we have to offer up sacrifices of law enforcement officers who will be ruined, who will be sent to prison, who love their lives, who won't be able to see their families and be treated like murderers, be treated like racists in order to assuage the anger of the Democrat base and in order to play into this narrative of our police officers as evil, bad racist people, which is a lie",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't care how often LeBron James says it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't care how many celebrities say it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't care how much the Democrats pander on this issue,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just not true,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The rare and occasional criminal and or racist police officer in America out of hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers across the country is not in any way a fair basis for maligning all law enforcement as racist,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is what the Democrats do,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is reckless,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Someone like it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're in countries that nobody even knows the name,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nobody knows where they are,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're dying,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're great,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They're face,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I brought them back home,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Largely back home,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" And he is making a very good point here about the GOP establishment wanting to continue, wanting to go back to this forever war position",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because one of many things we're going to have to be fighting against is going to be on our own side,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are people who for reasons of ideology or because I don't know,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it's going to make us all safer,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" But for the soldiers who are actually fighting for the people who have to pay the price for this, it's still astonishing to me how many Republicans really would prefer if we would go back to invading countries and trying to build them and using the American military to do this and then just not even having an exit plan and not having any real real idea what we're supposed to do beyond that",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's go invade and we'll see what happens,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 There's going to be a whole lot of illegal aliens surging to the border,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It is something that we do is going to happen because they're hoping that there would be a greater opportunity for them to get a part of the amnesty that's coming,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 We know that's going to be that's almost a guarantee,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But if you're too dumb to understand that wearing a mask on a train only for part of being on the train or wearing a mask on the plane, except for when people are reading that that's not really rooted in epidemiology or science, but just this desire to do every little tiny thing that maybe will kind of possibly theoretically help against the virus",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you don't do it, you're a bad person",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I don't know what to say,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everybody should be able to apply reason and rationale to this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everybody should be in a place where they can understand exactly what's going on here,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You know why cases aren't exploding as much in New York City? It's not because we're better at masking,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not because we take it more seriously,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's because so many of us got infected in March, April and May that there is a smaller population among whom the virus will spread now, thus lower cases, thus less of a spike",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And here's an instance of this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was on the train,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" There are a couple of guys who are drinking coffee and have their masks down while they're drinking the coffee because that's those, those are the rules",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Rules are your drinking mask comes down while you're drinking because obviously you can't drink through a mask, right? Okay",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so you can't be somebody who's a stickler for the rules, but then decide that there's some additional set of rules beyond it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That doesn't work,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You know what's same for the name,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Social distancing,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" They had masks on, by the way",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" or they had masks, I should say, on their faces, but they were pulled down so they could drink coffee and that set off this woman",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you see the rules are stupid,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's something you have to remember,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The rules are dumb, but if you're going to enforce dumb rules, you don't get to add a whole set beyond that of, of even dumber rules",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And people are just so nasty over all this stuff,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, I'm still angry about the few times I've had people say to me, Oh, weren't you wearing a mask? I look at them and say, because I'm outside and wearing a mask outside is stupid",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you know I'm right, but you're just too scared",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Right,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you want me to do this too because you're too scared to not do it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, again, as I said, anyone who wants to mask up, go for it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" You want to mask up, go for it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is the mentality that you want to tell other people when they're obeying the rules that that's somehow not good enough,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's where I've got a problem,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's where I have a major issue,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you see this continue to happen,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And there's also the, you know, the nastiness that this is creating in our society where people really believe that they take this propaganda to heart where they think that someone who does not obey the mask mandates that somebody who tries to stand up the mask shammers is really a bad person and should be humiliated, should be undermined, should be publicly mocked",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's gross,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's wrong,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I would never do this to my fellow Americans,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" The moment we don't have to do this, we can actually look at this process and look at what's happened here with some clarity and the most strident, I mean, the people that are putting masks on their faces and their Twitter photos, for example, are the same people who are putting pronouns in their Twitter bios",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why is that? Is it because they're so concerned with the risks of COVID-19 or is it because they have made this a virtue signaling opportunity and they use this to separate themselves politically from other people? I think we all know the answer and I think it's time that we hold those who are going to be so vicious to others to account for just the insanity of this continued authoritarian view about something that if they just spent a couple of minutes, if they just thought about this for a little bit",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They'd be so much more willing to compromise,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" As I've said, when they'll finally agree that we don't have to wear masks outdoors, then I'll feel like we're having a real conversation until they'll say that everything they say is tainted because they're not being honest",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" No, actually, I just had a receipt blowout of my hands, stopping such a lunatic",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They were really abusing the generosity of the American people,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" But they wanted, I'm sorry, not asylum",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And they didn't show up in many cases for their court hearings,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They didn't show up and actually deal with our system,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They just knew that they could get entry by claiming asylum and then they would just stay,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Rogan,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, thank you for having me on, brother",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am down here with literally hundreds of thousands of patriots,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Every single person I've talked to is from a different state in the country,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've heard as far as California, Nebraska",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I talked to someone there from Portugal,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's freezing out here, but the energy is insanely high",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People are not going down without a fight,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Rogan, tell me this, what are you, what are you seeing out there? I mean, when you're talking to people, why, why have they shown up in these numbers? What are they, are they hoping to just send a message or is there still a real sense that they think the outcome can still be changed? I think no matter what, they're not giving up",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Until Joe Biden is sworn in, there are options, there are legal options",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And right now today in Congress, everyone is here to put pressure on Republicans, especially to acknowledge the rampant fraud of which there are mountains of evidence and to stand up for the Constitution and the integrity of our election",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I'm looking around, everyone's wearing very casual clothes, you know, a ton of Trump flags, a lot of camo, a lot of mega hats, don't tread on me flags and everyone smiling, everyone's very polite",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we are all marching down to the Capitol,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We just saw Trump speech,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was optimistic,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was hopeful,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not conceding,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And now he said, you know, I'm going to be marching with you to the Capitol",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't know how exactly he's going to do that, but he said it there as well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And now tell me this, are you, are you seeing counter protest elements already out there? Or do they just wait till night time as the cowards they are? You know, these anti-fuh groups and others that are trying to menace what you guys are doing, which is peaceful assembly as protected under the Constitution to have your voices heard",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Are you already seeing some of those figures out there? Is there a concern about it? I haven't seen any counter protesters yet,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They would be wildly overwhelmed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, Trump in a speech said there's probably over 250,000 people, which is the largest gathering he's ever had, you know, rally",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But based on what we've seen before, chances are they're the counter protesters, the Antifa scumbags as Senator Holly are probably taking the high-end approach and waiting for night time, looking for stragglers, looking for people that have, you know, gotten stranded from the big group",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then, you know, they pick on the weeks and the defense",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So thus far, nothing, it's a celebration of, you know, the Constitution today",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And these people, that's what they're here for",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They know a scam when they see one, they've seen a scam in these swing state elections and they're going to do everything they can to stop it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Rogan, you're kind of Maga Vanguard and have been now for four years",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, you're a frontline Maga warrior",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've known, I've known your work and I've known you now for years",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What are you thinking? I mean, try to give, give us some words of perspective from what you're seeing here",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hey, Georgia doesn't look good, my friend",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, I, you know, who knows, but it looks like we may have lost these Senate seats",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of people were Trump voters and really believe in the movement across the country are hearing you as you talk about this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What do you want to say to them? I mean, because I got a lot of people that are feeling, look, man, they're feeling dejected and they're really upset about this",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, and that's, and that's what the news wants you to feel",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, it's a suppression tactic",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They want you to feel like you've lost the war before the war is over,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I refuse to, you know, obey those types of commands and I personally see, you know, at least a couple pathways still to do this",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a lot of constitutional ambiguity with what vice president Pence can do,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're chanting USA right now around me,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, you know, anyone that says, well, can or each can't with a hundred percent certainty, you know, it will ultimately be determined, I think, if Pence does pull something like that, does stand up in a historic sense, does position himself firmly in the lead for 2024",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If he does send these electors back to their states for clarification, for the state legislatures to do their constitutional duty and either certify or de-certified based on all the evidence of fraud that has been uncovered since the original certifications, you know, that's, that's what people are expecting to happen",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's what President Trump was talking about, you know, brought up vice president Pence multiple times during his speech, encouraging him to make the right decision",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, you know, again, until hand is on that Bible, taken the oath of office, this ain't over",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And frankly, I think even after today, if it were to be certified, if they were fine, which I don't think it will be today, regardless, just with all the objections, you know, these states can possibly still certify",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then, you know, now we have a constitutional issue that we haven't dealt with before, and we'll have to fight that front as well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So still a couple pathways, stay optimistic, stay hopeful",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, you know, pressure your state and federal representatives to do the rough thing",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're speaking to Rogan O'Hannley,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He is DC Dreno, those of you on Instagram and Twitter",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, Rogan's work",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's one of the great meme creators and one of the, really the culture warriors for our side in the, in the Maga movement",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and Rogan, just, can you, you're also a lawyer, which I know people who know you know, but that might not come across all the time from, you know, the fact that you're doing the memes",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Tell me this, the pathway with, with Pence, Trump is putting a lot of heat on Pence",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What, what is the mechanism, put aside whether it's going to happen or not for a second, put aside the likelihood of it succeeding",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what would the mechanism be involving vice president Pence, essentially, what would Donald Trump like his vice president to do at this stage? I think he would like for, you know, from what I've read on Twitter briefly before this call is that the Arizona electoral votes have already been objected to",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Mike Pence, I believe, has a adjourned or just missed the joint session so that they can go deliberate for the constitutionally required two hours up to two hours",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, and then when they come back, I do believe the mechanism would be a house and Senate vote",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It would need a majority vote to, um, reject the, uh, Arizona results in favor of Biden based on the fraud",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, realistically, that vote will not, uh, you know, happen",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so then there is a great deal of power vested in the president of the Senate, which is vice president Pence in terms of what he can do",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, and, you know, one of those options based on some constitutional, uh, professor theories is that he can say, you know what, we're basically going to table this issue, send it back to the Arizona legislature, uh, you know, and, and see what they, what they do have, have an evidentiary hearing, have a debate at the state level and then resend the electoral votes based on all the information that we now have",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, uh, Rogan, I also want to ask you, because you, you've done a, you've done a lot that, that I would say is in the, in the cultural fight realm, for, for Trump and for the Trump movement",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do you see that continue irrespective of how these processes play out right now with certification and DC and vice president, Pence and, and where the votes are",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What do you see as, as the future of, of manga as a cultural phenomenon? Well, I, I see it as a, you know, a patriot party",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, and, and whether the Republican party is going to be the home to this very, um, powerful grassroots movement on like anything we've seen, probably an American history, just by sheer volume of people",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, you know, the Republican party is now a big 10 party",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it's got, uh, you know, record numbers of black Latino, female, Asian, LGBT support",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And frankly, that's because of president Trump",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in the message he brings this populist message, a message for the working American, you know, not the coastal elites",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" That, that problem is still here",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump didn't get rid of it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These people think they know better than, than, you know, the people living in Nebraska and, and in the suburbs of, you know, Ohio",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Uh, but they don't",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I think that this movement is only growing in strength,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, you know, regardless of what happens with this election, uh, it's not going anywhere",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the Republican party and its leadership, they have already shown that they're trying to revert to the, you know, polite losing strategy of, you know, Mitt Romney and John McCain",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, but the, you know, modern day Republicans are a lot more awake and aware now that that strategy, uh, you know, simply does not work",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is not in touch with, uh, you know, who these people are and what our problems are",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I think this is just the beginning of the Republican party wants to shape up and be a home for these people,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think it'll be, uh, you know, welcomes",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if they don't, if they want to backstab us, if they want to cross us, uh, you know, we'll dump them faster than we did Fox News in the NFL",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" DC Dreno, also known as Rogan O'Hannley Rogan",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You're a warrior, my friend",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Good to have you with us,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Thank you so much for joining,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stay safe down there,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Thank you, bogg your warrior as well",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My friend and it was great talk with all with all of you,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're in the freedom,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the bug section show podcast,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need the federal government to step up here and ban all travel from the United Kingdom to the United States of America,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And I'm obviously specifically most concerned about the three airports serving New York City,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's time to stop the half measures,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, right now you can still get on a plane in London, not even have proof that you have a negative test and merrily come over to New York City and spread the disease",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" I mean, build a Blasio is a moron",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know who's going to try to defend him at this point,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know who wants to take the other side of this debate,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But build a Blasio is a moron,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, really, this is a guy who, the more, the more you look at this, the more you just see, what does he not understand? Banning flights from the UK, we already have the UK variant in the United States, which means it's already spreading",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's spreading very rapidly all throughout the population,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, what we've learned, I mean, in the early days, you could say before we knew what we were dealing with, before we knew whether we'd be able to handle this in our hospitals and everything else, trying to just for a short period, shut down travel from say China when we thought that was the, the epicenter of this whole thing",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was one period in time,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it might have helped us get ready for what was coming,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But now at this stage, it's already all over the place",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So what is you talking? We need the federal government to step up,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know what you're going to see now, my friends? So much finger pointing from these Democrats who spent the spring and the summer padding themselves on the back, news some Cuomo de Blasio, Lori Lightfoot, Gretchen Witten, or all these people who were, oh, look at us",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We, we listen to the science",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We really are they listening to the science now in California where they're having the worst COVID outbreak pretty much in the whole world right now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was that, is that because they were listening to the science at the government level there with all the mandates and everything else? Who could really believe this stuff at this point? Who really thinks that any of this could be considered true? And I, I, I sit here and I ask you, what is it going to take for us to be able to have a more forthright conversation about this? I don't have the answer because we've already seen everything we need to know",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, Florida is open for business doing well, continuing to operate and places like New York and California are locked down",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in the case of California, I'm being terrible, terrible time dealing with COVID",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What thesis do they have to explain this? I have a thesis,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 California didn't get hit as badly because of the seasonality of the virus when it first broke out in a major way in the United States,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so they had fewer people get infected then,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're getting more infection now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 New York had a very high level of infection in the first wave,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" So we're still having infections now, but it's a, to a lesser degree because of the limited herd immunity that was built up, not true herd immunity, but the limited herd immunity",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That thesis is completely plausible,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What thesis do they have in California? Oh, that people just got tired of masking",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's a lie because the more they add onto this, the more, the more lockdown measures they put in place, the higher the cases still continue to go",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They can't even bend down the curve,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's been weeks and weeks of this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They can't even begin to get the caseload to come down,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now why is that? Because people still need to be out there buying food,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can actually the fundamental problem with lockdowns all along,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I mean that with their effectiveness, never mind with their destruction or freedom and liberty and their unconstitutionality",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" I just mean the ways in which the lockdowns were not sound as a, as a tool even to try to bring the, bring the cases down is that you're never really locking down",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're never really preventing human beings from seeing each other,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't prevent people from going to the store to buy food,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have a lot of people that have jobs that have to continue to happen for society to function essential workers,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Essential workers was expanded to include a whole bunch of things that if we're being honest aren't really essential workers,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then they are posing some risk of infection out there or at some risk of infection,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then they come home and they give it to their family and then their family and then so on and so forth,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what's happening,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what's actually occurring,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You and Mrs,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mark, I think, would straight up fall asleep",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a lot of people like, but what would we do for the poll? We're running out of bread",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh no, the mind will be closing tomorrow",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How will we afford our tea? You know, there's a lot of that",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All I had to do is Google and see the cover and I started falling asleep,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like, you know, it's not, it's not something you're going to like at all",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I'm really, I'm really enjoying it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A lot of fancy accents, British people",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a little bit of a post revolutionary war vibe to talk about the French Revolution too,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So good, good things, good things",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're into that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you like, you know, British accents and people walking around talking about tea time and stuff, but it's set in the 1790s or 1780, 1790s",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have for a day,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" One of the other, you should, you should check it out for sure",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, and will I run for President Andrew? No, I have way too much fun doing this radio show",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're growing too fast,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Too many people people listen to the show,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" One of my favorite things, we just did more people to know about it",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I have so many listeners who say, well, I didn't know about you until and I'm not going to say, and then they say, I either added you to or replaced whoever I was listening to before",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I will say that's very nice,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's very encouraging,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People hear about the show,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They want to listen to the show,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, I think it's the best show out there",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just going to say it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're a lot easier on the ears than some of your competition,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, that is, unless you want to punish your drums, there's some people with very grating voices out there and like the scream a lot",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's see,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mike, hey, Buck, as I sit back and watch these case numbers skyrocket in Massachusetts",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They have since October makes me wonder about the whole mask, mania",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's quite obvious to anyone with a logical thought process that masks just aren't working,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Brings me to my question,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do you think they're pumping a sense of fall security intentionally through mask mandates? It's almost like they know they don't work and everybody can see that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But in turn, they want to provide people that sense of security, maybe in order to keep the economy going at a snail's pace, but going to say the least, thank you for all you do",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, Mike, I think I understand what you're saying",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that's a good thinking,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I would tell you this, I believe that they really think that wearing a mask is critical and science and they don't think beyond that",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've been told that this is what people who believe in science will do,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so that's what they are going to do,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they think that the dumb, you know, redneck Trump supporters are like, I won't wear a mask because I don't believe in science",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That that's their, this is a whole caricature that the left is created",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And yet if you just sit around as you put out, if you just think about this, masks work so well that we're sitting here",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do they really think that if masks were great and they protect people, what I have a problem with that? No, I want no one to get COVID",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want no one to die from this virus,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" So if I thought this was some highly effective thing, you know, I would be the first one to say everybody should be doing this all the time",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But as I've said, it's perhaps minimally effective",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Might help a little bit sometimes in some situations,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But as a policy that will turn this whole thing around, we can all see it is obvious",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is clear,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It does not work the way they told us it would,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They can keep repeating themselves, keep demanding, keep, but you know, and I think a big part of this is also ego, as I've said, not just the ego of the people in charge like Dr",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fauci,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, he's not going to say at this point, I know I told you mitigation and it didn't really work",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I ruined your business and I stole you,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're life away from you and I prevented you from seeing you loved ones and you got no benefit from this,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 He's never going to say that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So what is he going to say? Well, exactly what he has been saying",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There is no turning back for these, these mask maniacs",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And beyond that, I would also say that there's such a big part of this is ego driven",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are so many people out there who don't want to admit, don't want to accept that they were fooled and that they're not as smart as they think they are",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of those people because there's a direct correlation between smugness and self-satisfied with ones perceived intellectual abilities,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And thinking that you were right on this issue of masks, I come at this the whole time and I've been saying, I didn't start out as some big, you know, anti-masker",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I kind of looked at this and said, okay, well, they say, where I'm asked, I was wearing a mask, I looked at this, doesn't work",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What is a policy? And the fact that social media companies won't even let you say this now on their platform is appalling,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Appalling,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, I mean, of course it could work in some situations in sometimes under certain circumstances, but that doesn't mean that this is a good idea",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's very, very frustrating",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All right, muffet",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Wow, is that really someone, is that really the name that was on it Mark? Yeah, that was their Facebook name I guess",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is it miss muffet? I don't think so,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Didn't who didn't miss muffet sat on a tough it, tough it and eating her curds in way, right? Yes",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Miss Molly Muffet or something like that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I believe that is the nursing prime,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yes,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, miss Muffet, we don't know if you're sitting on a tough it, but we hope you're eating curds in way because that sounds kind of yummy because this is the part of the show where producer Mark and I get hungry",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You write in cool name by the way,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Love the show,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You and producer Mark make me feel safe and warm at night,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, miss muffet obviously also has fantastic taste",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Any restaurant recommendations,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, muffet, you are in luck",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You gotta go to a place in South Beach called Stubborn Seed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Went there on my birthday December 28th food,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It doesn't, it looks like a nice maybe gastropub",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It doesn't look like a fine dining restaurant really from the outside,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Very new looking,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The food is amazing,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fantastic A plus very good service,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can't say enough good things about Stubborn Seed,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I went there for my birthday dinner December 28th,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So Stubborn Seed was absolutely off the charts,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I will tell you that the meal I had at the standard hotel in South Beach was Subpar and Bad and Overpriced,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So sorry, don't go there",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I also like this place Amara at Paradiso, I believe it's called Great Restaurant",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Really nice views,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Highly recommend that one,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And those are the wrecks that really come to mind for me,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those are the ones that I would say,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, and go to the one hotel",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Make a reservation at the one hotel rooftop restaurant,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it's called Haven,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I forget the name, but it's the one hotel, which is a beautiful hotel in South Beach",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And go to the rooftop there,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'll think it's expensive,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's expensive,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's pricey,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just want to be very clear about that,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, you're going to pay $15 for a sushi roll, but the food is very, very good",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Sat outside like a civilized person eating food,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was great,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're in the freedom,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hot,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And we continue on with roll call here,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Roger writes, Buck, it's no princess happy with her Buffalo Bills",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Roger, indeed, she is",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She is a big Buffalo booster and all things Buffalo,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think she is very happy with her Buffalo Bills right now,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think she's actually going home to Buffalo soon, maybe to go skiing",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, and maybe I'll go with her because I got to learn how to ski",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Steven, hey, Buck",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I love Mandalorian season two,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think it was much more Star Wars fan-oriented than season one was I'm a lifelong Star Wars nerd,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So for me, it was great",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I could see you liking season two much less than one,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you're off the hook,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, Steven, Mandalorian season one was awesome",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you didn't have to know anything about Star Wars to appreciate it,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You just come in cold and be like, Oh, this is really cool",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mandalorian season two, you know, there was there were some weaknesses",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And my biggest problem was the action sequences,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mandalorian season one, he was like a space, a space Navy seal or something",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mandalorian season two, he's like everyone else running around with the pure, pure little laser gun going, pure, pure, and Mark",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what laser gun sound like,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Good to know,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll cut that for later,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So that was disappointing because the you don't think of Star Wars as having really, me at a lightsaber fight, so whatever fine",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you don't think of it as as looking like it's almost tactical stuff in space,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And season one Mandalorian really had a lot of that, you know, and season two Mandalorian, it was just him running around with a blaster folks",31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to rally,31783_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Glad you're with us right down our toll free number at 800-94 one shawn if you ever want to be a part of this program today and we got a lot coming up in the course of this program,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I got to start with I know so many of you and even many of you that went to the rally earlier in the week are living a level of frustration you probably have never felt before in your life,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you know when you're falsely accused of things it's understandable,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now we watched about 1% of people and we're beginning to be we're trying to piece together exactly you know who some of the leaders agitators were as they raced into the Capitol building, etc",57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 and they will be held accountable for their actions,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there's always this desire to paint with a broad brush,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When 99% of the people traveled to Washington for reasons I have outlined repeatedly on this program and on TV about how they feel about things is you know when you have 83% of the American people feeling one way about an election in one party and you know about 30% of independents and millions even in the opposition party, there's something to it",57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The whole purpose of what they were doing trying to do in the House on the 6th now it's the 8th two days ago was to try and say okay we hear you we need to look at it we want to attend a commission that's that's what that was all about,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And and then when you are watching and listening and hearing you know every good American we've been consisted on this program when there was violence going on rioting going on the burning down of our city cities blocks being taken over etc,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 etc,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 we we condemn those that that did these specific acts and the same about the 1% not the 99% of people that went to peacefully protest,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 We're not denying what happened the way Democrats did over the summer what we saw before our very eyes our eyes were not lying to us,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And in part is there's an agenda to everything that people do and say and you know what really I think it's gotten a lot of people upset it is not only the 99% and let me remind everybody it was not the most pleasant task in my career to have to really on peel every layer of the onion and it took almost three years to do it to expose corruption and abuse of power and by the way proven right now multiple times on every level as it relates to people in an organization for example the FBI,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
one that I revere and but so I made a a determined effort if you're a regular listener if you're a regular viewer of I made a determined effort to isolate and separate the 99% versus the 1% because people in the FBI the overwhelming vast majority are good honorable people that serve their country and many of them putting their life at risk every day the same with the intelligence community,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a reason I have an FBI pin and I wear on Hannity every night and an intelligence pin I also wear on on Hannity every night it's actually you know for the 99% because we spent a lot of time having to go after people that did abuse their power oh knowing what we'd know now we'd never have signed those Pfizer warrants we signed you know that we never verified that we that we told the Pfizer court was verified and even when they knew it was unverifiable and debunked and false they kept going ahead with their,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
scheme to spy on a presidential candidate and then president and for the record not one Democrat that I can think of and nobody in the media mob that I can think of short of me and a couple of others some of us on talk radio just a couple on Fox that spoke out of against it you know you look at fake news CNN they just lie with abandoned to the American people for three well really longer when you include it when it's all encompassing just light every day did they ever admit that they were wrong ever,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
correct or no how much damage does that do to the country does a lot um it's destructive it's hateful and so people that went they're law hardworking law-abiding uh honest American citizens that were peacefully protesting they get painted with a broad brush I'm not somebody that does that I didn't do in the case of the FBI I can say pretty accurately that pretty much the media mob now as they speak with one group think voice few rare exceptions in the media I can name some of you want we can go down that road if you feel,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
like calling it and asking me I have names of a few that are actually pretty fair sure Al Atkinson would be one uh Catherine Harridge I think does a good job she used to be a colleague at Fox he's now at CBS um but I'm not gonna go down the whole list but you could just you just know that they have an agenda they they all push the phony Russia hoax conspiracy they all ignored Hillary's dirty Russian dossier breathtaking hypocrisy they never criticized those that abused power at the at the highest levels in the FBI you,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
know the same thing with with you crane and hunter Biden and and Joe Biden and quid pro clothes you know they peach the president over one phone call with one fact witness the phone call was fine the fact witness said no there was no quid pro quo you create a lot of movement and a lot of noise and you know Americans begin to think something nefarious happened it never happened you know they'll vet Trump till the day goes home when did Joe Biden really ever get tough questions um anyway so no American like what we saw,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
at the Capitol and we're gonna get to the bottom of it we need to get to the bottom of it although I don't know if you put John Durham in charge of it me we mean never get to the bottom of anything it'll just you know be in an investigation and perpetuity you know Americans all of us as conservatives we love this country we believe in this country there's no greater country that God has ever given man Americans you know every conservative I know respects and honors law enforcement you know you watch the violence that took,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
place over the summer and the excuses that were made by by many in the media many Democrats it's breathtaking I'll play some of it and you know I watch and I listen and we chronicle this I think we probably do more than anybody else but I mean you literally now we're at a point where you could have you have big tech companies deciding to outright censor anybody whose opinions they don't like it's that bad and yet get liability protections that are not afforded to anyone else in the media which by the way is a huge cost,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
reduction to them and and also you know they would then become editors like any news organization which I'm a part of and etc etc anyway um and then you know we're gonna now we're gonna silence Josh Hawley's book like really he's about this very topic and you know if you there are a lot of institutional forces I've been warning you about way before this election that don't particularly like conservatives this this statement by Anderson Cooper's revealing in that sense the year they're gonna go back to their olive garden or holiday in or court yard gardens I,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
mean I love the olive garden I like Walmart you know I like my second amendment rights and my Bible and God and my religion too and I'm not an iridema who's deplorable and I actually take shower every day and use the odor it but I go to Walmart I like to shop at Walmart and you know now people just with a broad brush you've been well have your or have you ever supported Donald Trump I mean this is how crazy some of these people are taking it and you know there is righteous indignation for all of,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
the reasons that I have laid out on this program many many times we can go over them again today you know this country whether we like it or not I mean it would be great if we all just got along but we have very deep a very deep divide and deep political differences and and that's what this country right now is going through it's gone through this many many times it's not unusual but if you live in a country that has freedom of speech and assembly you know people are going to express those differences now what,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
happened over the summer was wrong does that represent all Democrats now he doesn't does the guy that shot Steve Scalise in the ball field represent Bernie Sanders no he doesn't you know we can does every the the the people the percentage of people that is minute compared to the massive crowd of the rally this week does that represent conservatives and Trump supported no it does not you know and what what really I think a lot of this is rooted in is one of the things is is that Donald Trump has fought back against the establishment he,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
has exposed this you want to know how ugly the swamp is when you start draining it and you get to the tar at the bottom and the swamp creatures that are emerging out of that tar don't like being exposed at a little disinfect in it's called sunlight and people become aware of you know just how bad the media is quote fake news just how corrupt the Democratic Party is what breathtaking hypocrisy they have and they don't like it and they have they have basically been on a never ending campaign since this guy and his his wife,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
came down the escalator at Trump tower five years ago and you know because in large part because he fought back and he exposed them does he is he a fighter for his views and is like yeah yes fierce and he's he's had a backbone that probably stronger than all the Republicans in the party group together and so for example was he just supposed to not fight back against Russia conspiracy lies and a hoax that he had conspired with a hostile regime to this country and a hostile actor Vladimir Putin to get elected over Hillary Clinton no,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
I don't I think he was right to fight back three long years of his presidency wasted on the country being told nothing but lies and ironically at the end of it we find out well there was Russia collusion it was a dirty Russian misinformation dossier and Hillary Clinton paid for the thing and then worse the dirty Russian disinformation dossier you can't make this up in a spy novel was then used as the foundation and predicate to spy on candidate Trump transition team Trump and president Trump same with the Ukraine oh quid pro close okay Joe Biden,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
yes you got six hours you're not getting the billion let's you fire the prosecutor it would be the prosecutor investigating a zero experience on goes on ABC GMA and he's experienced an oil gas energy Ukraine nope nope nope nope why do you think you got the millions I don't know it's only the tip of the iceberg you can factor in Russia wire transfers causa transfers other Ukrainian deals China deals China national shopping spree bank of China 1,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
5 billion nobody cared about exposing any of this and there are people that that have legitimate you know anger about what has been happening in the country and they went to Washington express it all I try to explain do they care about the 99% of peaceful protesters and so this is not gonna end unfortunately the political disagreements I'm just saying that anytime we disagree we got to be you got to do a peacefully and then if people not gonna be peaceful we're gonna be consistent in calling it out the Democrats weren't consistent this summer and I'm,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
gonna prove it to you when we get back because I actually have a great memory like an elephant and I got a I've got audio and videotape that nobody else will remind you of all the only hundred nine four one Sean toll free tell of the numbers you know it's you know to deny that we don't have major massive political differences and and a very closely divided country just lying to ourselves doesn't mean but but no American good American would want any of of what we've seen over the summer and what we saw earlier this week,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
nobody wants that but you know we can also you know ignore four years of lies and conspiracy theories psychotic rage either and but that's what you know these the self righteous and self righteous indignation that is fained by the left it's it's just utter hypocrisy you know and if when you when we I'll play this after the news at the bottom of the half hour you know how the left never even criticized violence over the summer and denied what our own eyes showed us or some of the unhinged rhetoric of their supporters the biggest names of,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
their supporters against this president not a word not a peep out of them celebrities calling for violence against the president Madonna Johnny Depp Kathy Griffin Robert DeNiro you know you know when they're down we kick him said Eric Holder or you know if Maxine Waters get in their faces I didn't see any outrage by the media mob I didn't see it outraged by the Democratic Party either on any of this I have a timeline we're gonna do tonight on hand and I'm gonna play some of it next on the other side of this and the media,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

over the summer and you know the double standard of what it is that they have said and done it is spectacularly breathtaking the hypocrisy and it just wreaks I don't see anybody really willing to take a hard honest look at it we will do their job as usual we'll continue all right 25 to the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of this extra amigans of you know I'm just I'm just pointing out what is just such obvious extreme breathtaking hypocrisy you know we we've got all,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the celebrities that love the Democratic Party and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the newly elected off-sulf and Warnock etc etc am I the only one that remembers the call from violence against president Trump Madonna Johnny Depp Kathy Griffin holding the severed head Robert De Narrow wanting to punch in the face you know Donald Trump Joe Biden wanted to you know take him in the back of the schoolyard or wherever the hell he is you know we wanted to take him to have a as fight he's so tough and you know this is there legacy this,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
is these are the things that they have supported over time let me just play some of the highlights yes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House one's last time an actor assassinated a president but dare you say the things he does of course I want to punch him in a face right you know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gasoline station you get out and you can't,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

was some violence no organization is perfect Antifa yeah they're not perfect you know I've never forget I mean we've been showing it the last two nights on TV got an MS DNC reporter covering you know the mayhem and the rioting and the looting and the arson that took place over the summer literally right behind a live shot this fires everywhere mostly peaceful mostly yeah mostly peaceful or the the still shot we have of this fake news CNN reporter you know behind up just nothing but flames everywhere but mostly peaceful I mean it's insane you got the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
media got Democrats all they did is downplay the violence and even denied it on a level that is like huh you think our own eyes to see us they don't listen this is a question that's been done by a commissioner of the city council not a mob in the middle of the night from the department what they do this violence across the whole country he does about the history that that's happening Portland right now that's that's that's been spread only in Washington DC about the anti-fascists yes they're not going to stop before election day november and,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this isn't they're not going to let up and they should not this is not generally speaking on rolly but fires have been started perhaps this is a some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country a restructure yeah well they're going to do what they're going to do Pelosi said there's the idea that this violence that's a myth come on that's not true it's a myth you know Kamala Harris you know protests are not,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
going to stop and should not and then goes on everyone be aware and take note of that huh well the very thing that they're just they're fainting their outrage that they're saying that not all day Trump did it I'm going to show all of this tonight on Hannity because it's it's it's eye opening you know you you look at the hatred the contempt for the president or you know for his supporters you know pasket of deplorables drug addicts um well molly walmart shoppers olive garden eaters now I mean it just never ends it's stunning and they're,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

exactly what they're referring to I mean yeah you've got this video of this former you know high ranking four tours of duty arms forces patriot veteran shot as you don't arms now I granted I didn't think anybody should have gone in the capital didn't deserve to get killed over it and you know so it's selective moral outrage as anyone forgotten Kamala Harris a massive supporter of the la defund the police movement you know supporting the bell raising money bell funds in the wake of the Minneapolis riots and biden staffers also supporting this idiotic bell fund this,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
all happened what do I always say feign selective moral outrage double standard you know it was um it's it's just painful we really have a truth deficit in this country the likes of which we've never had before and and it's it's beyond troubling journalism I declare dead in 2007 and 8 it's probably the one example where I can almost speak with a broad brush and I don't like speaking with broad brushes hence the 99% in the FBI the 99% intelligence community you know but if you look at the wage Donald Trump and his supporters you know,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
we can pull up my favorite cut of all was how they mocked and laughed and ridiculed the idea that Donald Trump would run and then he won and they never stopped attacking this man every single hour of every single day you know one of the challenges the mob is gonna now face all right they'll have their what 120 days of Biden and oh there's you're gonna get a lot of this so refreshing it's not gonna be long before it goes super viral miss me yet hashtag trump 20 24 trust me and then all of a sudden,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
I realize wow joe is a lot slower than we thought maybe hannity and some conservatives were not wrong in their criticism that he lost his fastball if he ever had one they looks weak and frail we don't get to see him very often another is what he does his press conference is now he pulls out his notes and he likes flips to every section starts reading from the section he probably forgot um what are you gonna do if he forgets what job he has what day the week it is look I'll do what he's unable to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
do I'll lead to effective strategy to mobilize true in an ass ever depressor isolated plenty's China I know how dare Hannity bring these things up just say in my humble observation um time will tell put the the stated policies are outright scary for the country and you know and and that's why for a lot of you that just want to say the hell was it you can't there's too much at stake ah I'm gonna retire you know what it doesn't matter if you care about future generations you know what a Reagan say freedom is one generation,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
away from extinction I don't want it to be on our watch this country is too great too many people of you know for the principles that make us great and this is the most radical socialist agenda ever advanced by any major political party it just is so you know we have our challenges we have our differences and you know we're gonna get through all of it we'll get through all of it together and you know they're always they're always bumps in the road and I know you know it's funny because I've I've talked to a lot,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
of people that were actually at the rally and they said they've actually declared to me some they said yeah my soul was happening I knew that would be trespassing I'm not going near that well that's the 99% you know when you look at the left do I think to I think the the leaders of the left the Biden's Kamala Harris's and and everybody in Washington Pelosi and Navler's they should have condemned the violence and the arson and the looting and the taking over city blocks and police stations and we shouldn't have been told this is you,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
know the summer of love and a chopchas autonomous zone that can't happen either in America when they're pulling down American statues you want to change them all right go through the legal process try and do it that's the way things work in this country the same with those that enter the Capitol apparently some now reports that Nancy Pelosi's laptop may have been stolen another Democrat Jeff Merkley said rioters stole a laptop from his ransacked office and we don't need to see this in this country we can prevent it the biggest questions I think we need to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
answer this how come we were not they were not prepared for this knowing so many people were in town and knowing that they were marching from the monument straight on over to the Capitol anyone been to media pay attention that the president was condemning it at the time was telling people to leave and be peaceful yes they didn't want to pay attention to that anyway so you know let's impeach the president that's what we're gonna do it was very interesting the comments that Nikki Haley gave um rana McDaniel's been the national republican republican national committee dinner,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
in florida and she said about the president I didn't always choose the right words and I told them so with the time when these moments came up um she didn't like the rally but she pointed out that that i'm one who believes our country made truly extraordinary gains in the last four years and up and then Haley's right Nikki Haley because conservatism works that's the thing you know nobody looks at the extraordinary success that this president has had nobody nobody looks that no president in history has ever had to go through as much as this guy's,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
gone through the media just ignoring you know calls for violence against the president they never cared you know this ideas molly walmart marchoppers and olive guard eaters and i mean it's very revealing in terms of what they think of we the people for those we the people people are the ones that make America great people that get up every day and they go to their job and they provide goods and services for other and they obey laws pay taxes you know i'm pretty much just want to just leave us alone with the rest of our lives,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
let it raise their kids their good examples nobody's perfect but the good examples then you have a media that defended antifa and a media that defended the violence this summer now they're all lecturing everybody about how they really feel well be consistent we're consistent on this program they've anything but consistent we don't we care about Russian interference not Hilary's dossier care about quid pro clothes yeah not Joe's quid pro quail with Ukraine we care about Russian interference we didn't care about the dossier we don't care premeditated fraud on the five-sighort spying on a president we don't,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
care about hunter the money wire transfers from an oligarch in Russia or Kazakhstan or Chinese national shopping spree we don't care about any of it is but if it was Trump okay about all of it and you know that gets frustrating for people frustrated me i'll tell you that um but you know i'm just going to tell you what mark my words they're going to overreach and the country is not going to like it's a center-right country and then we'll have an opportunity to get back in power in the meantime you try and you know fight,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
for the values make people aware of everything that we don't agree with peacefully something they should have called for in the last four years and they didn't right hour to Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program i mean censorship here there and everywhere it's amazing isn't it the short-term memory we don't even have to go back a full year and you got Democrats you got the media mob you know there the way that they have defended and not spoken out against you know violence in the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
streets of major cities and americans pretty unbelievable i we even have specific instances of them you know defending antifa or antifa if you prefer let me let me play that one first they are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the trump administration and what they see happening in this country they see they see the neo fascism that we see and they've taken a principal stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists wherever they may show up it says it right in the name antifa antifascism which is what they were there fighting listen there's,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
you know no organizations perfect there was some violence i think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response to white supremacist neo-Nazi violence the problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment the radiation is tough treatment but it is meant to remove the cancer there's a group of antifascists called the black block which do tend to get violent their idea is look non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
but they wouldn't have been there they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been for the fact that white supremacists neo-Nazis were out scaring the living day-lout out of most of the people in that town sogishness is thogishness whatever it comes from politically and we should be the first to call it out i disagree now why would they defend antifa how about if we all forgotten the last four years of we've forgotten the rhetoric against Donald Trump and violent rhetoric of the left because i might it's pretty fresh in my mind listen yes i,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

I don't know what I was watching that Chris Cuomo clip from a while back when he said why does the protest have to be peaceful and he was defending the lawlessness and the craziness but he we had a 126 protest the first 125 which were far more violent are some looting smashing destroying statues monuments tens of thousands of businesses destroyed they never said a word you saw Jimmy Fallon with that the fearful speech about from mob to get out of control he was crying when it happened in his own city outside his own a window for,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
months he never said a word so I guess only the consistent about his total inconsistency yeah the total the only thing consistent is the inconsistency which is which is forever true you know Joe Concha you you been on radio and TV with me a lot over the last four years and you know we've talked at length we we expose that they they pushed conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory they lied to this country for three long years they have made excuses for even violent behavior and and showed no condemnation of violent rhetoric of the hard left or,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Hollywood or even within their own party you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either president trump mike pence or jeff sessions who would it be does one of us have to come out alive yes I'm angry yes I am outraged yes I have thought and not a lot about blowing up the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
white house what was the last time an actor is sesame to the president I life really did you see anybody from that cabinet and arrest you up Donald trump is a guy who none whatsoever and now I want to these things supposed to so supposedly we're supposed to believe this matters to them as they feign their new selective moral outrage you ever see naked gun the great Leslie Nielsen he's the detective Frank driven your aging yourself mr,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Concher you're aging yourself the week 1988 that wasn't too long ago okay Reagan was president good point so he accidentally uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 set fire to a fireworks warehouse and suddenly you just start to see all these explosions behind him in a crowd starts to form and he says nothing to see here please disperse that's the alley velshi on msnbc saying these are mostly peaceful protests and behind him it looks like it is fires burning the die hard yeah exactly it's a frickin inferno right and then even CNN has kyron's you know mostly peaceful protests continue and again you see fire and chaos behind these people show you how are people not like flabbergasted by this what's the thing,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
i mean this was the uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 in terms of bias it was literally right in front of you on your TV screen and you're being told otherwise by the reporter so the lie is right there in front of you and all one up uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 the great marks of own on uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 chris quomo he wants compared had the audacity to compare and keep up to the allied troops storming normally day day because you know the fighting fascism now i'm pretty sure it's not the same thing that the bottom line is that we're letting the extremes control the narrative at this point and then mark pen who worked for uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 helary clinton and bill clinton he was a chief strategist he doesn't great polling and he found that seventy six percent of the country either describe themselves as moderate or conservatives were right of center country yet if you watch our media you would think we're completely liberal on everything but again it's that disconnect and it's making excuses for black lives matter and in tifa during the summer and then being rightly outraged of what we saw the capital but without that key word and mark used to be for consistency then no one trust the messenger anymore how,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
do they mark some on just to sort of like well you know just just sort of forget conveniently everything that they've done and said and all that they've supported over the last four years and and and they they act as though they didn't even say any of these things or tell these lies or spread these conspiracy theories or support the attacks against Donald Trump most of which came from them uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 over this extended period of time there's just about a narrative of the long you know they come up with the narrative you don't have to execute it you don't have to do it just give out the narrative and act like it happened and not not only do they not condemn any of these rioters before but you remember the Harris campaign the Biden campaign people were contributing to the bail funds that were the right to manicute the domestic violence and Kamala Harris was promoting that bail fund to get it to them uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Portland is still going on the anarchy in Portland continues and yesterday protesters found the mayor in the cafe and hit him in the face I haven't heard anybody mentioned it's totally inconsistency you know it's like Joe Biden calling for unity while uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 while they're trying to prosecute the president while they try to put him in a mental institution while they consume arrest them this is this is a call for unity it's just keep the narrative you don't have to do it let me remind everybody what Kamala Harris had to say protests are not going to stop this is during the summer she said all of this she said it on a Colbert show uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 they're not going to stop and they shouldn't stop listen to this they're not gonna stop and that's there this is a moment I'm telling you they're not going to stop and and everyone be wear because they're not gonna stop it is there not going to stop before election day in novembre and they're not going to stop after election day and that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that this is not they're not to let up and they should not and we should not they're not gonna let up these should not,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
and will not wow I mean I mean how do we characterize those comments or the fact that she was helping the raise money for those that were arrested in many apples to her in those riots right the bail fund and since she almost took no questions leading up to election day no one ever asked her about that particular bail fund or about the fact that she sowed so much doubt in the vaccine saying that oh well if this comes out in 2020 I'm not gonna take it if Donald Trump says the take it as if Donald,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Trump's in a lab making it somewhere you know it she's made so many reckless statements already and the fact that Joe Biden yesterday with that speech Mr,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Unity right supposed to bring the country together says that well it black lives matter were involved in the capital siege well it would have been a lot different in terms of police using guns a lot more it's like what are you doing this has nothing to do with race and yet he went through this whole all these horrible things that he says Donald Trump did bad leave it last four years I can't wait until say February or March when Biden actually have to answer for Biden and his administration and his ideas and his proposals he,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
"promised that Democrats took back the Senate that the $2,000 checks would go out immediately and you already got Joe Manchin saying yeah I'm not signing on to that so suddenly he's gonna run into a lot of problems despite having the house in the Senate and the Oval Office and it's gonna be a civil war within the Democratic Party because progressives and guys like Manchin are gonna see eye to eye and it's gonna be quite entertaining to watch until the GOP takes back the House in 2022 yeah I'm not exactly sure how much ability he's truly gonna",57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
have to stand up to the hard left in his party because they're the ones that helped elect this guy if you want to believe that you know this guy got 80 million votes I have a hard time believing that number I don't see on that front marks a moan Joe Biden in any way is gonna do anything but what the AOCs and the squad and and the Bernie Sanders are gonna insist that he do and I think it's gonna be as bad as they as they telegraphed her in the campaign I don't know you know Democrats,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
those crazy Democrats may be in for a shock with old swamp Joe you notice the stock market once they want everything on Monday Tuesday the stock market starts soaring now I hear that's because this administration the Biden administration has contacted everybody in banking finance Wall Street to let them know everything's gonna be okay for them that they'll be taken care of there'll be some corporate tax but corporations don't pay the tax anyway they just pass it along so there'll be a couple of little tiny symbolic crazy left-wing things just to keep you other said happy but,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
it's gonna be swamp businesses usual Wall Street banking big tech big corporations will be taken care of again it's a great observation although Bloomberg had an article out today that said get ready because taxes are gonna be raised dramatically on quote the wealthy you know top 10% pay 70 whatever percent of the tax money in this country top you know top 10% pay like 80% so they're already paying the money all right quick break right back we'll come back more with Mark Simone and Joe Concha on the other side on this Friday Hannity tonight we're gonna,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
remind everybody of the left wing rhetoric and things that they have said and done the last four years it's fresh in my memory it's nine eastern on Fox quick break right back more with them on the other side we as we continue I 25 to the top of the hour toll free it's 800 941 Sean you want to be a part of this extra amigantah I don't know what it is I mean I spent a lot of time in my life had like a courtyard maria or Hilton garden more time than I would prefer because you,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
go on the road my kids are you know into athletics we used to travel quite a bit and when they were younger and you know it was a big deal of one of the first things I always checked all right is you know what are the good restaurants in town and whenever there was an olive card I'm like all right great I love the olive card unlimited salad unlimited you know amounts of garlic delicious breadsticks sometimes unlimited pasta specials you know in some cases I remember just starving myself all day because I'm going to olive garden,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
tonight and then for dessert they have like these hot it's sort of like donut things and you give it chocolate or caramel and you put it on top I mean it is with powdered sugar it's just amazing loved it loved all of it well apparently it is not particularly up to speed when it comes to a fake new CNN anchor former fander built I guess current fander built himself Anderson Cooper is what he had to say about it it's stunning and they're going to go back you know to the olive garden and to their holiday in,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
that they're staying at in the garden mario and they're going to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in Washington and they really did something and stand up for something and they stood up for nothing other than mayhem you're going to go back to the olive garden or the holiday in or the you know he doesn't even know the names of the hotels I'm like wow not sure where does he do is fine dining no boo I mean most Americans don't dine there I've never been there I don't,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
know any play I know like two places in New York City where I go and that's it unbelievable and I have my steady restaurants here in Long Island and by the way one is just like the olive garden except better I mean just a little bit better I like the olive card you go over to fake news msd and see and they're talking about you know trumps ride or die base is a bunch of people with Nazi t-shirts so we've gone from olive guard eating olive garden eating holiday in courtyard mario at Hilton Gardens people smelly,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Walmart shoppers here at demable deplorables people that cling to god our guns our Bibles and our religion that are angry and now I guess now we're a bunch of ride or die people that wear Nazi t-shirts according to msd and see he has the voters we saw who the president's rider die base is Peter it was a bunch of people wearing Nazi t-shirts homemade for pelts and horns that is not the Republican party so as far as the president's kingmaker status have we just realized it was maybe all just a marketing scheme because think about it,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
on his watch yes he wanted to 2016 but his party lost the house they lost the White House they lost the Senate and think about his big reveal on Wednesday we saw who his rider die base are a bunch of Nazis and you just never ends anyway we continue our analysis Joe Kancha Fox News contributor he writes on the media opinion calmness for the hill marks Simone host of the morning show on w or r I will say this about marks Simone he's probably been all those fancy restaurants because he pretty much mcs every event that,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
takes place in New York City is that connected it is it is part of his DNA is not a single person that doesn't know who marks Simone is in New York City but I'm not sure marks Simone that you'd dine at all these places on a regular basis maybe you do I'm kind of pretty sure I'm just guessing here that you you've been to all of garden and I'm betting you're probably like it actually it was terrible when the innocent Cooper said that because it got me thinking about the olive garden it's taken every out the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
strength let the go there because I don't want to start with those breadsticks they got the best columnari yeah shrimp dishes and I don't know who does the photographs on the menu but that guy's the greatest photographer in the world I want them to do by the way is the one in Times Square still open yeah good good curbside delivery take out and of course they're all over and the great shopping malls and there's a couple of long island and I love that place you know when Anderson Cooper said that about low-lives that would go to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
the mario the Hilton garden or the the olive garden he didn't realize everybody in the room all all the crew all the union guys what they love these places he was insulting them right to their face I don't know I've been on MSM BC whenever you're done after the host yells at you as you walk out everybody on the crew all the union guys all the workers whispering your ear I agree with you I don't think they realize how hated they are but their own crews over there no I think that by the way there's certain,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
truth to that too I've by the way I've had people that hate every word I say when I work by the way but that's fine I don't know you know Joe I'll be honest and and this is an honest feeling so you know my kids would be in you know whatever city state small town we happen to be and and you know I can't help it I'm older and I take you know great delight in the little pleasure of life of eating and you know I'd get to the town get to where my courtyard mario there's,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
or Hilton garden get settled in whatever we had to do we do whatever practice whatever was going on that day but one of the first things I would do is I would I would check out in google what restaurants are in town and I mean this with all my heart and if all of garden popped up boom we're going to the olive garden that was it or outback state cows another plan to be like yes touchdown whatever I go to all of garden the first thing I say to the waitress after I'm done with my meal,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
which is mainly breadsticks is my compliments to the microwave I mean they do great microwave there no question but I look I see it and I don't know if you knew this it's what the acronym stands for it's the condescending news network and it's why so many people dislike the network on a personal level because it's hard to find too many folks there that don't speak down to people you know they're the smartest people in the room don't you know and they're going to tell you exactly how they feel about things as Anderson Cooper did remember,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
he's the same guy and he's called an anchor by the way which is hilarious just own it you're an opinion host and he called the president no beast turtle just a month ago you know he's the funniest guy in the room so when he speaks like this to Marx point I guess the plan is for CNN to alienate completely already have I suppose they probably don't even care anymore half the country when you say those things and again they keep claiming to be the objective down the middle network and clearly it's almost impossible to tell the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
difference between MSNBC CNN and media matters as it pertains to the media team there so look that that's what they have and when the Donald Trump is gone in two weeks and Joe Biden comes in and they settle in it is going to be a ratings crash like we haven't seen since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of a number being in one place and going down to another because once you lose your central character and that's all Donald Trump has been on that network for five years they got nothing and they can't go back to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
being in the Bernard Shaw Gulf Wars the end of because they got people like Anderson Cooper there to alienate their audience yeah but let me tell you where it's also going to go you're right I mean they'll get their first hundred days and and I can predict the coverage marks on what it's going to be oh how great it is to have somebody with the integrity of the great Joe Biden of course like during zero experience Hunter ignoring the quid pro quo ignoring the Biden foreign family syndicate in China and Russia and Kazakhstan and Ukrainian oligarchs,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
and Chinese national shopping sprees and the deal with the bank in China we're going to ignore all of that's going to be a relief after a hard days of all of this relief and they'll probably pledge we're not going to cover Donald Trump anymore we're going to censor him just like big media big tech and then all of a sudden their ratings chose right at some point hundred days maybe 120 days I can't give the exact date they're going to start tanking and then they're going to realize that their daily dose of feigned outrage against Donald,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Trump and their hatred of this man fueled you know their entire network for all this time and I'm just guessing they're really going to miss this guy yeah the big question is what will they do when there's a tremendous loss in ratings and then revenue and they got to do something that executives are going to get the fired will they turn on Biden will they start to go after hunter to save themselves I don't I don't know or will they keep up the the plan they're going to go back they're going to pledge to stay away,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
from all covering Trump then they're going to be forced to cover up because they're going to need it's like it's like a drug to them now I mean that was going to be major withdrawal symptoms in all of them you know and at the media should be outraged about Facebook and Twitter censoring Donald Trump you know what in Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone that was the most important invention he changed well he mentioned to be said only people I agree with politically can use it if I don't agree with you I'm not giving you a,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
phone and you can't talk kind of imagine a phone company did that why why do we allow this face the commander in chief of the military is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States he's not allowed to speak on Facebook anymore how does this allow this it's insane how could the media just sit back I don't care who and allow some like that to happen in America here's how I see that evolving Joe Consha all right so they're going to silence the president on on social media big tech companies Twitter Facebook etc which by,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
the way makes the case to eliminate their their liability protection is provided by section 230 the silencing the president okay and the silencing prominent conservatives and any conservative for that matter free speech is out the window it's not free in in America then it's the assignment is used to say no to Josh Hawley's book on this very topic and then they're going to go back to their you know tried and true efforts which is to silence every conservative voice talk radio people like me the few conservatives that we have on the Fox News channel just silence,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
those guys and get rid of those guys because that's all they've been trying to do now for years pretty much throughout my entire career if we're going to be blunt and that's the thing right it is slippery slope when you say all right we're going to ban this guy from speaking on our platform whether it's Twitter whether it's Facebook snapchat whatever then what do you do with say the leader of Iran who tweets out often that Israel should be wiped off the map or Chinese government officials that say that coronavirus was actually invented by the US,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
army and now being weaponized by the right is any of them ever been censored I don't recall no that's the thing right so Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey from Twitter they can say well this doesn't meet our standards well if that's the case if we're talking about world leaders and government officials then you got to take those down just like Maxine Waters when she said inciting violence inciting riots that if you see anybody from the Trump cabinet or administration you get up in their face all right that is a call to physically go after people and we,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
saw time and again it happened again with Lindsey Graham just today he was in an airport and he started to get harassed by god knows who so yeah when you start calling on people to get in the faces of government officials because you disagree with him because god but you forbid if we actually disagree with some civility anymore this is the result of Maxine Waters her account is just fine so unless you're consistent with this don't bother trying it at all because it may look like it might have some bias and some activism against one party,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
of course they do that's all they contributed to was the Biden campaign if you think that section 230 is suddenly going to go away because Biden gets then forget it because the check is going to become due from all those donations and all those people from Silicon Valley that are now in the Biden administration Sean and look at look at Pelosi today marks them on you know on he left to know you don't have to but if you hear her today if you if somehow you know maybe you accidentally tuned into the show or TV tonight,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
you might hear something but unhinged as she is and and needing her her radical base as much as she does now more than ever because of the tight margin in the house but to move to neutralize America's nuclear strike force okay Russia's watching this the Iranian moles are watching this China's watching this every hostile regime and actor on the world stage is watching this and and then they see Joe coming in and if they see Joe the way I and many other people see him is weak and frail and seemingly compromised cognitively um what are they,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
thinking about all of this I would think that from their strategic geopolitical standpoint they're probably liking what they perceive as a weak in America hey it's just crazy and you see these cabinet members leaving early and I have heard off the record from some people uh no names but they're leaving early because they don't want to get in the middle of whatever shoomer and Pelosi are plotting with some crazy 25th amendment thing they don't want to be there for any of that they don't know what these people are going to try to pull next the nuclear,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
codes are fine that this is the most anti war president we have ever had he's the first president that didn't send a single troop anywhere uh we've got nothing to worry about there who's been more pro war than Joe Biden from uh a rack to whatever but uh it it's uh a weak and a couple of days just calm down if you're Pelosi and Schumer he's leaving don't be sore winners just let it go yeah okay that's not that's not possible anyway um anyway I'm gonna let you guys go thank you both for being with us,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 New York and uh Joe Concha uh we appreciate both of you being well as we're gonna do a great history lesson reminder tonight on Hannity because those so saying to Monius and self righteous the damage that they've done um is real and they just think that they're so superior and meanwhile ignoring the 99% of good people that went to Washington this week and we've got to get the other people those that those that you know rated the capital that there's gonna be justice maybe we can even get justice for the deep state actors too while,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
you know I'm watching and watching and I'm like wow it's it almost takes your breath away not only all the things we discussed the last hour about what they would like to have happen and that is that Donald Trump never speak again and they forget the things that they have said that they have done for the last four years as if it's it never occurred I mean it's kind of breathtaking gonna be very blunt and to be very honest with you but if you think of all of these big tech companies now have decided what you,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
can and cannot read it's it's a form of censorship and I remember the president saying get rid of section 230 which would which would then take away the immunity for liability that companies like Twitter Facebook etc have because then did not content providers any longer but they literally at that point become editors just like newspapers newspapers and TV stations and news networks they don't have the same liability protection as Twitter and Facebook and all these other groups and anyway it's it's kind of amazing to watch all of that happen then of course we're gonna cancel Josh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Hawley's book just cancel it which is about this very topic it just so happens and look this is something that as a conservative on radio and TV and let me let me stop here and promise all of you I'm not changing I am who I am and I'm not changing and but I can tell you the things that we deal with behind the scenes and have for many many many many years is nothing short of an effort to silence to get fired to remove advertisers and boycotts just because they don't like a conservative point of view,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
Julie Kelly political commentator seen you contributed to american greatness author of disloyal opposition and kreg marshal special counsel to the american center for long justice guys what do you think here that what we are shot we are part of the apocalyptic cancel culture movement and unfortunately when you've got these mega monolithic monopolistic uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 silicon ballad giant like facebook google amazon twitter apple that control information they've joined uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 partnership with the mainstream media and now capital hill is tilting only in one direction as a result of an election this is a threat to the republic no questions asked crag your answer you just exactly right here what you're what you're pointing out of something you know you as an expert in the law you deal with these platforms all the time you deal with every day let me ask you there was a lawyer is there is there any other recourse that people can take in other words you finding that people are coming to you that,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
are being silenced and suppressed and demonetized in this case yeah in fact uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 this is comprising the majority of work that i'm doing both for the american center for long justice and american principles project both on on internet free speech issues and it's not just crag partial uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 opining about this more and more folks on capital hill on both sides of the aisle are saying this is a gigantic problem and a threat because they are monopolies by the way section two thirty pass by congress in nineteen ninety six before they understood that these companies would become monopolies and then start controlling not only information in opinions but tilting elections as a result um,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 this has to be changed and i think it will be interestingly regardless of the election this is a bipartisan issue on capital hill because law makers of both sides are worried about it by the way this is inside information i want to share and next week a block buster bombshell bill is going to be introduced in the house uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 representatives by representative greg stuby called the case it act as in you can bring a case against them if this bill passes right now you can't they have immunity from law suits if this bill passes silicon valley will have shockwaves because they will once and for all be responsible in courts of law to those of us who are centered or suppressed for viewpoint purposes you know grab your brain about so many so many good points julie i want to bring you in here i know you wrote the book disloyal opposition how the never trump right,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
tried and failed to take down the president when when we see a social media platform you know the names of the mall literally silencing like twitter like facebook a president of the united states is you know in the case of twitter's twitter handle as a means of communicating with the american people just like you couldn't even print the new york post story about the biden syndicate and and hunters laptop you know what can you say about that well and can we talk about this before i've written about this the last few months a bigger problem is,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
that this is straight up election interference from these big tech democratic party so the time bally ole garks we saw this with their platform starting in sptember when they started to roll out all of these policies related to tagging or flagging or banning post the question uh male and dalak and eppson key ballot so they have really contributed how could you do it in calculator chan hundreds of billions of doctors maybe in free illegal by the way in kim kampeen donations to the democrat party to julbyton and so be just be this as a continuance i,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
think what happened is you know the democrats are aware that so many republicans and about thirty seven percent of independent you this election it's illegitimate they think that julbyton was uh not fairly elected because of all of the and legalities related to male and an eppson key ballot so that's what they're trying to shut down now they're gaslighting and exlating the events on wednesday to do that the publicans and never chompers of course are going along and so they are creating a really dangerous uh situation that they really started several months ago well we look at,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
how easy it's been though to silence voices that confront our contradict their the narrative if you will they just completely shut us down i mean that that's that's the big problem off my friend dambon jino yesterday was talking about how his twitter was completely shut down and now by the way he's on parlor exclusively by the way we are on parlor as well but then you add to that google you add to that apple and they're saying they aren't even gonna support that platform so now they want to take down a platform because it's completely allows,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
them to do what they're doing and you know how how do we get around this i don't know how we get around that i mean parlor is is the good platform it's sort of new obviously all of us are over there right now but it's these bullying totalitarian tactics that they're using and look they have the biggest voices behind them we saw what Michelle Obama released yesterday begging social media platforms to uh ban a Donald Trump voice we see mark zuckerberg in his statement hilarious statement about we can't undermine the peaceful transfer of power hello that,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
hasn't even happened in the past five years you know where with Facebook uh deep platforming people and banning content about the imaginary Russian collusion hoax i mean we could go on and on and so you have these really powerful people behind that fueling it um you know some people were reading today trouble that chon could be and i mean they could refuse to allow people to you know go to his hotel or register to stay at his hotel all with his businesses how they could try to deep platform those as well so it's it's really scary,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
territory Craig i have a question about another server you know having another platform in other words what does that mean what are the legal implications if you will for a google or an apple if they say no we're not going to do this you know in other words is there any recourse they're private companies but at this point they're serving on a global scale with a massive reach they're allowed to what silence anybody they just don't like is there something in the law that would prohibit them from from doing this so they can they just get,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
away with that well let's take a look first of all a keen off of what julie had talked about in terms of uh in kind contributions to the democratic party through their efforts to support only uh excuse these support only democrats and to suppress uh only conservatism republicans i've filed a complaint with the federal elections commission over this last election on behalf of american principal's project whose advertisements were stifled by facebook uh as a result of their political bent uh and we showed with data in our complaint the fact that the election in the state of,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
michigan as an example for or against prompt or biden as well as the democratic senator but likely would have changed had these advertisements been allowed to be aired over their platform that's the election impact now problem the federal election commission and all other federal agencies are now going to be under control of the biden administration there's a problem there section two thirty as i mentioned uh gives them almost completely reliability unless uh uh law like the case at act by uh representative stubie gets passed there's gonna be a real cat fight in both houses on that,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
uh but there is also bipartisan support something has to be done uh in terms of parlor i'm on their uh a lot of us are on there it will take probably a year or two or more for them to gain the traction they need to have the influence coming anywhere near facebook uh which has a a global scale in terms of its support now there are anti-trust lawsuits filed by the department of justice still pending but again again against facebook and twitter and and google and others but we now have a biden administration that's going to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
be controlling the department of justice who is investigating and prosecuting so it's all gets down to campaign uh integrity that is uh do we have an election system now that gives us a real honest uh confidence in the fact that when we go into a voting booth we put the people we want in the majority will rule we don't have that confidence so i think shows like uh Sean hand it easy and others the alternate media needs to fight for its existence because that's the only place people are going to get the truth and the real,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
facts so we talk about section 230 now Craig you you're incredibly versed on on this you wrote a piece about it about the bill in particular as a matter of fact but people are kind of misunderstanding what it can do and what it should do can you kind of delve into that a bit the section 230 was passed as part of the communications decency act which was trying to clean up the internet because in nineteen ninety six when it was passed people in congress saw the potential for a lot of scandalous and harmful things particularly for,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
families and children going on in the internet but they also wanted to stimulate uh instead of eyes these new startup companies in silicon valley so that we would grow the internet they want to do both things so what they did it said look we're going to give illegal immunity to these uh internet what we call platforms they're not newspapers they didn't come into the internet business in order to be content providers we you and i and julie and Sean hand ity were the editors in chief of our own content that simply on their publishing or dissemination,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
platform it's really the twenty first and twenty a century version of the printing press uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 they simply disseminate this and they use our data of course which has value to them and in return uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 we get the opportunity to have our content distributed well it doesn't work that way when they decide from time to time to be editors in chief and they know your content we don't like and we're going to strike it down their private businesses so the first amendment technically does not apply uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 to protect our right of free speech and that's going to change again if if some of these bills get passed and they're of up really a flotilla of them right floating around capital right now one is great stuby's uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 representative from florida there are many others uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 if these get passed then suddenly these monopolies will have some responsibility in courts of law for you and me advocacy organization businesses will be able to sue them for the first time since nineteen ninety six and actually prevail now they're worth billions of trillions of dollars but you get enough of these losses particularly clair faction losses and i think we could bring them to heal right quick break welcome back more with uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 julie kelly and kreg parcell on the other side later on will get to your calls and much more and so julie kreg we have about a minute left uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 welcome back by the way uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 now so stuby's bill the republican at a florida he's taking a good look at at section two thirty immunity and he's looked at the new york post for example before the election and and some of their behavior in the shutting down a kelly mac and a need and how they censored on you crane and you know you've written a ton on this what what is the platform speech in other words uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 on which you think this needs to happen so in other words so that the section two thirty is not manipulated i would defer to kreg and so happy here is optimism about it because i'm left optimistic all i will say is uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 as we finish up here what another last opportunity this was to bring the reforms to big tax that were needed the republicans when they have the house and senate but certain when they had the senate made a lot of noise about one to two thirty was another last opportunity when they had control so i hope what that what kreg is saying i i i i sure that he's right at great studios great congressmen uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 hopefully they can find bipartisan work there uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 because something has to change i quick last thought what what do you think if all conservatives just decided to have a texas like exit texas in other words you know another words people just run over to parlor and rumbull and just say see it to the rest of these people well uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 you know a lot of us are tempted to do a lot of us have changed over uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 to parlob but continue to use of facebook and twitter and we do that uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 through gridded to get the biggest platform for our information in the opinions to get out if we don't continue to do both things if we just picked the new start-ups that better like uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 parlor and others are doing great work but a very small we are going to eventually uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 silence our self out of the marketplace of debate and i don't think that's a good thing right julie kelly thank you kreg partial thank you can thank you enough for going to uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 take our dollars in our movement to other platforms i mean i'm i'm starting it by the way when you go on twitter just always hashtag parlor that's a smooth transition and you're telling other people where you're going quick break right back top of the hour on this uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 friday you know we're gonna take a little trip down memory lane in the last four years of violent insane lies conspiracy theories calls for violence uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 that the media did not pain outrage at just so everybody could know in the democratic party or they said nothing and and this is this this has been the great hypocrisy that is all things radical left democratic party media mob in sync as one now add big tech to the equation uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

dirty dossie they ignored the unverifiable dossie a and premeditative fraud on five secort to spy on a presidential candidate in the president uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 the hypocrisy over russia okay that's what hillary but it also is hunter bidens the the wire transfer three and a half million dollars from a russian oligarch the first lady of musca and the same with the ukraine and the same with kazakstan and the same uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 thing happening with china in chinese now i i mean there's no shortage of madness here gym and and you know it's funny because i think with what really almost is not many of us to call this out you do know that right no i knew no that that's what bothers me is that you know they don't call that out they don't allowed them to go and check out the election test of why there was fraud and maybe five states why would they not just be willing both sides of the aisle to check that out to,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
be sure it's legitimate number one but more importantly with with biden it's the law white how can we not have somebody say go arrest this person for quid pro quo since we have his own admission on national television it makes no sense and i'm trying to figure out a way to get that done listen your your your your your your somebody that has a sense of decency honor fairness and you don't have double standards you know like i can them for example violence of summer i can them that this week too i don't want to see,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
this for our country this ways to prevent this this peaceful protesting out that was the ninety nine percent but for them to you know deny think and office started with i think an awful lot about blowing up the white house and it went down i want to punch him in the face i want to take a mind the school yard and and fight Donald trump everyone seems to forget and and they don't do it that's not that they don't know i don't think they want to politics trumps everything no pun intended it's the ends justifies the,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
means and a lot of this effort now this this feigned outrage is just the latest and what has been for the half five years now of an attempt to deal legitimize and and in this case prevent anybody from ever wanting to publicly support Donald trump have you or will you ever have you ever been are you now or have you ever been a Donald trump supporter uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 that's where they're headed but meanwhile they ignore their own you know their own rhetoric their own supporters and the things that they've said into things that they've done i mean that's what i'm putting on tv tonight this you know nobody else will do it i guess i have to but i'll tell you it's uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 seventy four plus million picked off patriots over what's going on in our country i so much want to believe that what our president is telling us is true here's my problem the republicans don't know how to fight and when i see john derum you know he was gonna investigate where where's he been hot we haven't seen high in her hair of the elections coming on we're getting kicked we're down seventy four plus million of us are really ticked off so where john derum better yet city power supposedly has the evidence to prove the algorithms were,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
painted to get by all these votes they have the evidence Rudy Giuliani stood in front of hundreds of thousands of americans right before the president to the stage with an expert they've got the evidence where's the evidence how we ever gonna overcome this chaos this hypocrisy and let humor and policy get away and and Hillary Clinton get away with what they're doing to us if they have the evidence produce it every day that goes by it's too late yesterday look the president said yesterday every single remedy he fought for they've been denied the courts don't want,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
to deal with it you got to understand though and the one court that very bravely did the supreme court in the state of Wisconsin it ended up being a three four decision but the beat down in the descent by the by the chief justice was something you don't see very much from any supreme court and you you got to understand what's a play here didn't they're not seeking truth they don't listen as long as they win they don't care what whether or not laws were violated the constitution was violated you know i don't i don't i,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 you know listen to the state law of michigan in Wisconsin why did we have two standards for signature verification in george a y you know why was the pennsylvania constitution ignored good people you know don't comprehend it because it's so antithetical to who they are and what they believe and you know the answer is now going to be going forward i could tell you right now if we don't fix america's broken busted down election laws and by the way we've had to fix it in recent times the state of florida you know exhibit a but,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
if you put your mind towards it you can fix it so that people have faith confidence believe in the integrity of the election confident in the results that's where we got to go and you know this idea that you know they've gone after this guy with lies and hoaxes and conspiracy theories there's been violent rhetoric and not a word from these very people that that now want to paint with a broad brush you know ninety nine percent of the people at the rally this weekend washington did not go storm the capital they went away we've had,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

went to the capital you know some people didn't go to the front of the capital some people went on the side where the train station is because it was more convenient and on the backside if you look at the video on the back side there's nobody attacking capital police they're standing on the senate's steps the senate's side i believe it is and nobody's attacking them they're standing there if you look on the the congressional side the congressmates there was people on the staircase there already and nobody was attacking any police and when i went up this,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
there was floor capital police standing by a broken window and a couple of kids came by with megaphones and tried to incite the people and said there's only floor them over there used to take that window and i said to those kids what are you doing you're inciting here and and they just looked at me and walked away naked belong in that crowd and then after that some other people started spraying whatever it was to make our eyes burn and it wasn't the capital please there was people there looking to incite and no matter what nobody,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
when after those police you look at all the footage on the back side of the capital facing the supreme court there was no capital please being attacked there was no vandalism there was no breaking an entry everybody on that side was warfarin had no idea at least i had no idea what was going on the other side and then all of a sudden the big bread store opened it opened from the inside no windows have broken somebody opened that door from the inside and then people were pretty much stampede it in it was almost like Walmart,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
on black Friday morning years ago so for other people to their peacefully protesting and and being maligned as traders and insurgents that's that's very hard to hear because we've been standing up for this country our whole life sibrettians people in their 60s grand parents high stood there with them and there was people that infiltrated that crowd and caused all that problems and they weren't from supporters by no wait how did they come with gas masks they brought note with them how did they know to bring note with them to pouring in their eyes when they got,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

for things that other people did you know all throughout our coverage of the deep state and those that abuse power fill and and were corrupt how often uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 if you're a regular listener or viewer of hand any how often that i always go out of my way to point out not the ninety nine percent that a good people not the ninety nine percent in our intelligence community i did it on purpose i had an f-b-i-p in on my lapel and uh,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

reached in minutes and then the second thing is is for the ninety nine percent that came and i i tried to explain as best i could why people like yourself were there then you get painted with a broad brush it's not fair and it's not just and it's not right but it's been happening now for five years and i can tell you i live it every day i mean you know i've i've the new york toilet paper times falsely accusing me pretty much of murder you know when it came to you know covid when it was,57904_The Sean Hannity Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That was a commercial put up by the Bernie Sanders campaign that forwards the root fallacy of Democratic socialism for for all to hear and it's very open about it very upfront about it that it is the obligation of the state to provide for all of your needs as determined by the state and that is inclusive of taking from you and from me at the state's whim to provide for people under this obligation,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Are you free if you don't have a job a home a you know the the doctors that you want to see if you have to work 80 hours a week to buy for all this is are you free if you have to do all those things well what does freedom mean to the left if freedom is only possible with a state providing for you then that means that the state is able to give you freedom and absent the state there is no freedom that's a I think that's a troubling concept but also they never figure,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
into all of this and this is why you know people are saying that they like Medicare for all and I've seen the statistics on this and this is not this is not surprising people like Medicare for all because Medicare is free stuff that you're told you paid for but it's not true most people take out twice what they put it Medicare is the magic piggy bank that you put a hundred dollars in and then you take out two hundred dollars and just say oh well I paid for that no you didn't you just didn't I mean,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
this is the truth overwhelmingly people end up taking out more Medicaid than they put poor they put into it so it's a nice idea people like Medicare for obvious reasons and you know Medicaid just pays at a fraction of what Medicare you know reimbursement rates are and that's why a lot of doctors won't take Medicaid and we get everyone wants someone else to pay for their health care this is really the problem and even those of us with private health insurance we like this this idea that you can pay twenty dollars as a co-pay and see,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
any doctor you want you know I haven't had that in a long time I mean I I end up just writing checks to doctors now all the time I have health insurance and it's it doesn't feel like insurance I don't know maybe if something catastrophic happened heaven for bid but in terms of the day-to-day expense you got to pay for a lot of things but people like Medicare because well one it's accepted by a lot of doctors but they also don't realize that Medicare for all for all ages and all people even if that were just,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
an option would mean that you would have changes to your health care plan they don't understand it's not just someone else is going to pay for stuff you wouldn't be able to keep your private health insurance if Medicare for all becomes the norm every business would say no no I'm not going to provide health care for you go get go get your Medicare for all go go go hook yourself up with that I mean how many of you listening to this show right now who have your own private health insurance how many of you would willingly,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
switch to an Obamacare plan I think the answer is probably zero unless you happen to have really bad private health insurance but I don't even know how it could be worse than whenever the Obamacare plan is because you know you know there's these basic truths keep coming back there's no such thing as a free lunch Bernie Sanders is promising you a free lunch in fact in this video he's saying or rather his campaign is promoting the idea that you deserve to have a free actual lunch you should not have to pay for lunch at school you,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
should not have to worry about your your home expenses and paying your bills and look economic anxieties real for everybody I have economic anxiety you have economic anxiety but I have no faith whatsoever that the state is ever going to be in a position to make my economic anxiety go hey in fact I think the state makes it a whole lot worse by taking a lot of my money in taxes and promising to give me services that never materialize in services that I would never want to rely on but freedom and you know we discuss often,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS

have to work to achieve this freedom or does the state just give me whatever it's whatever I think it needs to give me these are all very real questions that I think these sander nieces they never wrestle with it they never deal with the reality what their ideology would do to this country that and that economic freedom is inextricably linked to social justice and social justice means you know racial and and gender justice as well and the state then determining what people can get paid how much they should get paid who they should hire on what,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
basis they should make hiring decisions this is how you get closer and closer to a truly socialist system all in the name of providing you with freedom he that's what is what is so disturbing about this is that they are they're telling you Bernie Sanders campaign is promising you that you will be made more free if you just allow the state to take away your freedom that's I know that that is self-contradictory that's the point it is self-contradictory but that is their platform give up your freedom and we will make you free this is what the,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS

a lot of promises made there were a lot of overtures about how there would be a workers paradise Bernie's campaign here is telling you that if you just had Bernie Sanders in charge this is a form of utopianism they're gonna provide for all your needs you're not gonna work 80 hours to buy food you're not gonna have trouble paying for your insulin for you to survive you're not gonna have to they can't he couldn't do this even if he was president that's what you have it's not even just a function of whether this is a good,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
idea to try it's that the government couldn't execute on this if it wanted to it just wouldn't happen so this is all ultimately a lie but it's a lie that we never seem to ever get past we never seem to learn the lesson at least the left never learns the lesson in this country that socialism is not a good idea it's been our mission since the beginning of this administration to convince the Iranian regime not to move forward with their nuclear program and not to continue to engage and to all other missiles and all the other,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
activities the malign activities that they've been engaged in around the world it's why we put in place the pressure campaign that's now been ongoing for a year and a couple months it's been very effective and now we need to make sure that we continue to do that so that we ultimately get the opportunity to convince Iran that it's not in their best interest to behave in this way we all have to remember this isn't just two and a half years or five years this is 40 years of Iranian activity that has led us to this point,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
this moment right here communicating to Iran that we are there to deter aggression President Trump does not want war and we will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region Secretary of State Pompeo gave press conference today I watched it live and you heard a little snippet of it there on Iran and I think he brought a very important context a very important perspective to a lot of people right now that are one concerned and those are the people that are taking a fair mind that,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
approach so this I can understand concern but there are also those who see this and this is certainly true a lot of the media and the Democrats as the moment to start screaming about how Trump is a warmonger he wants war with Iran and Pompeo said definitely Trump does not want war with Iran and I can tell you that everyone that I know who either fought or assisted the war fighter in Iraq or Afghanistan everyone that I've talked to thinks that there is absolutely no way we should go to war in Iran and that if we,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
do take military action it should be punitive and defensive in nature which should not be an offensive regime change effort at all and that means no can you know because nice to get a little what is a regime change effort look like you know you look at what happened in Iraq it didn't start off with it didn't start off necessarily this the second time we went in wasn't about an invasion it was about a no fly zone and it was about protecting and battle of minorities and oil sanctions and all these different things but we had,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
military and we had military force in place so that that framework would hold I don't want us to go beyond where we already are in terms of military posturing or military positioning I think that we have what we need to have and the administration is trying to make clear to Iran that unlike Trump's predecessor when Trump says I forget about Obama because ever knew it wasn't true that's why the red that's why Obama's failure on the red line with Syria with the Assad dictatorship was so important because once Obama in front of the whole world had,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
said if Assad does anything I will take action you know if he does anything with regard to chemical weapons and then he did nothing you know that's you wonder about causing up the dictators it certainly makes dictators feel a lot more cozy and at home certainly helps them quite a bit makes them feel like things are going to be more to their liking and once that happened then to say that all options were on the table was just clearly not the case with trump it's true I've said before that Trump on foreign policy is a little,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
bit like doc holiday on the shotgun in the movie tombstone where they say that you know they want doc to be on the street howitzer essentially because he's just crazy enough that he might pull and use it pretty fast and with trump that's that his foreign policy has had an off balancing effect for the bad guys they're not uses somebody who will just call out their leadership and and say that you know military action will follow any provocation they're not used to that they're used to a lot of boilerplate foreign policy speak and stuff that they,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
can that they run in regime can largely ignore but what we see with Iran is they've been ignoring that for 40 years as as Pompeo was pointing out I mean this stretches back to 1979 and the Islamic revolution in Iran and the way that since then the relationship has just been one long series of of deterioration really and that it doesn't have to be this way you know we don't have to live in a world where there's an Iran that says that they're going to enrich uranium so that it's very easy for them to go nuclear,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
we don't have to accept that here's what the news spoke spoke been for a spokesman for the state department morgan or tag is says about how Iran could just choose to be a normal country play five think what we're seeing here is really a challenge not only in the jcpo but really a challenge to the international norms a challenge to the international norms on freedom of navigation and freedom of the seas and so we you know would say to the international community that we should not yield to nuclear extortion by the Iranian regime look we need,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
to take a realistic view of these things we can't just militarily tal china or tal russia you know do this or else that's very risky business there's some countries that we have to do business with some countries that sanctions won't work on at all Iran is not one of them Iran is not a very wealthy country does not have a very large military we don't have to accept any Iran that is constantly threatening and blackmailing the international community with the claim that it will get nukes soon we do not have to say that that is okay,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,HS
or we don't have to accept that is the status quo and this administration unlike previous presidency takes the position that that's not going to fly anymore that doesn't mean that we go to war it doesn't mean that there's regime change it does mean that you know if the Iranians try to shut down the Strait of war moves which would affect not just America would affect oil for all of East Asia and it's 30% of the world's 20 to 30% of the world's oil reserves are going through that one waterway every day a lot of countries care,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
about this and if the Iranian step out of line those should there should be massive consequences for them but that's the way we should deal with the Iranians not the Obama administration approach of let's just find a way to placate them let's make them want to be our friends they don't want to be our friends the mulas the irgc the revolutionary guard core and the the the guardian council and all the real power in Iran they don't want to be our friends and we have to view them as people to be defeated and that's what Trump,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,HS
does we're talking about what we're doing now and we are honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the constitution of the United States Congress has the right to seek information to honor its oversight responsibilities we will not let him stand in the way as I honoring out of the stuff office Nancy Pelosi still sticking to the whole oh we're just doing oversight man this isn't we're not beat a bunch of political hacks or anything here we're just just doing a little bit of oversight you know that's how we that we get down that we,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
roll we all know that this is highly highly political and it's really all about politics nothing to do with upholding the constitution that we've already we already had a special counsel we've already been through a two-year-long investigation that was unobstructed that's right that had so much at its disposal in terms of resources almost led by anti-Trump partisans so what what more could a sane person ask for? Well perhaps I go too far perhaps I'm assuming that we are dealing with sane individuals and we quite obviously are not but I think that the the Democrats and one,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the reasons that they've been so so slow on all of this on the on the impeachment train even though I think I saw a poll today that said that 50% of American voters you know think that Trump should be impeached or something like that what I think that Democrats maybe have started to realize is that going through this process again is if nothing else going to be a distraction from the messaging that the Democratic Party is trying to do on why they should why the American voters should go a Democrat instead of Trump for reelection,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
and there's the concern of the blowback the people that are saying things like Trump should be impeached they don't they're not ones who necessarily understand that it'll be more investigations more process more this more that it's just going to be this endless saga of nonsense from Pelosi and the rest of her crew and it's not going to end with anything with anything happening I bet if you asked the people that are for impeachment of Trump a big chunk of them I couldn't tell you how many but a big chunk of them think that impeachment means he's,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
no longer the president a big group think that there's a real chance that if he's impeached he could be removed from office by the Senate that would be a fun man on the street thing just to find people who want Trump in peach and then ask them okay how how does he get removed from office do you know the process I think you'd find that 90% of those who want Trump in peach probably couldn't tell you that it requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate for him to be removed from office and then their file of,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
convey how many do you think Hillary will be president if he gets removed how many do you think what how many do you think Hillary will be the name president if he's removed I guarantee there's a whole bunch of think that oh for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's very possible as well they'll just they assume this makes it all all right all over again remember this isn't a strange number at all 50% of voters that's not the same as 50% of all Americans 50% of voters because in the last election 50% of voters,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
really was like it's 51% voter for Hillary Clinton so yeah if you voted for Hillary you want Trump in peach because you're angry because you didn't get your way this doesn't really mean anything I think the Democrats and you know tonight is going to be the night when you see Trump being Trump again and starting to make the case but I think the Democrats are in for a rude awakening they've had a pretty easy go of it for a while here yeah Trump tweets at them and will tell them that they're you know they're lazy or,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
dumb or whatever and he's right but there hasn't been a concerted effort by Trump to tell the American people why they should vote for it again that changes as of tonight and Trump is a beast on the campaign trail I mean this guy gets people so fired up and does and has such amazing energy I mean for a guy his age too to do the the things that he does is astounding and that's why I think you know that the media this is going to be something you should you should keep an eye on they are,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
going to be caught flat footer again because they've lived in this echo chamber of Trump is evil Trump is bad you know he's not somebody that you can not somebody that anybody should listen to or trust because he's worse than Hitler but all the stuff that the media tells themselves and then you have to also remember that they don't the media doesn't really understand what most people think that's how you have Chris Matthews Chris Matthews I'm gonna show what I'm gonna say who's this guy and why it's he on TV still who thinks that he's insightful,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
or worth listening to on anything yeah Chris Matthews you guys young yeah I am bad man it's just horrible I guess he's friends with the executives over MSNBC or something and they just you know keep him there and that's that's why TV is full of such it's such a nasty business and full of somebody generally very nasty insecure people because you can really put anybody at some of these places and some will watch them yeah okay's Matthews got it's just just blather it's just nonsense that comes out of Chris Matthews mouthful of Trump but he was,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
in a town hall and he was really taking a back by people saying you know what I actually kind of like how Trump does things play ten something Trump looks out for you absolutely he cares about you yeah I think he's honest I think he's okay anybody else when I agree or sorry you want to say what you think I look I'm I go by faces guy Mike on the dock is I think absolutely the president of the United States cares about all of us because he provides opportunities like there's 300 some million people in America,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
he doesn't make a relationship with every single one of us but what he does do is create opportunities so then we can use our god-given talents to go out and make a living in this country and that's where we are today yeah yeah yeah yeah that's actually I think it's a pretty astute observation from that random audience member but that is really what a lot of Trump voters want they just want a president who is not trying to mess with their life is not trying to get in their way tell them what to do all the,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
time be a busy body this is something that is unique to Democrats unique to left us they are busy bodies they are hall monitors they want to be up in your stuff all of it all the time do this do that do it this way not that way with whatever it may be with what you can eat with what kind of light bulbs you can use with how many toilet flushes you can get you can get away with with you know you name it they are busy bodies and that's not good for business and it's not,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
good for the general mental well-being of the American people we like to be left alone like we left our own devices as much as possible we can't harm each other and we have to honor our contracts and we have to obey the law that's pretty much it other than that it should be a real light touch from the government not not absent entirely not not non-existent you know we're not going for some libertarian paradise here just never going to happen but it should be very a very gentle presence in the background instead of we have now,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
as a government standing behind you all the time telling you do this or else that's not good that's not good at all but I'm telling you now the Democrat media apparatus also known as the mainstream media they have learned nothing they have learned nothing since the last election about connecting with the American people understand the American voter they will be forwarding their own perceptions of how this will all work as much as they want as long as they they're not going to change at all they're going to say that you know this this is oh what's,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
really going to motivate people is you know Trump's ethics and all the lies in Russia collusion meanwhile those who are voting in Ohio and Pennsylvania they don't care why would they care about that they know the media is hyperventilating a hyperventilating about all the time they know that it doesn't it doesn't ever lead to anything where it's told oh my gosh look what Trump has done it's so awful but it's really not as awful as they say it is they're constantly exaggerating they cry wolf we know that that is what happens they cry wolf so I,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
think that Trump's obviously going to have a strong night time when many of you here that's already have had his speech I'm going to be getting over to watch it as soon as I possibly can but Trump the Trumpster is back in action folks and the Democrats just don't have anybody who can line up against them they don't have anyone who brings the same the same gusto the same X factor it just the the ability that this president has to mobilize people around an idea and to make it fun and to make it compelling and it,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
keep the energy up he is a political phenomenon there's nobody else like him and I was not somebody that right away saw it and I've been seeing it now for a long time in action so that'll be a nice reminder for everyone too those who voted for Trump and those who are thinking about voting for him again who may be your own the fence for one reason or another when they see this president doing his thing I think that any doubts they have will be quickly wiped away at least that's what I'm expecting operation center all,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
sensitive programs must be kept strictly to know team buck is cleared and ready for the buck brief nine states wants to continue the conversations about structural changes regarding intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers and market openings and tariffs we're looking for an enforceable agreement as we always have that's absolutely vital so all those general topics will be on the table I think the market is saying better that they are talking than not talking no results for guaranteed I think people know that but I think there's a certain joy that their um the big stuff coming,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
when the administration sits down with China at the G20 president Trump meeting with that with Xi Jinping there's a lot of issues and people are starting to get a little bit of economic anxiety over just where all this trade war stuff is going we've got somebody who can answer this and and more tell us what's going on here we have Michael Pillsbury with us Dr,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Michael Pillsbury he's the director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute and the author of the hundred-year marathon which all of you know of because I've talked about it here on the show I recommend it to you we have the author with us now Dr,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Pillsbury great to have you sir hi there thanks Buck all right let's start with what should happen at the G20 I mean what what's critical going into this for the administration to you know what what should they try to get at what can they realistically get out of Xi if anything well the talks broke down and the president was quite angry and then both the comments on the to the press and also when tweets the explained that these just can't accept their reneging at the last minute they had a hundred and fifty page draft president,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
said and it looked like he thought he was going to be able to get a deal and for some uncertain reasons that are quite opaque and the topic of what are debate here in Washington the Chinese backed out so the pessimists thought this is the end of it the Chinese are just not going to make a deal and they already are behaving quite arrogantly and so they're the dominant power in the world so the president's effort over the last two weeks has been to get things back on track without himself making any concessions so it looks,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
like this phone call that he's talking about this morning and his tweet has really saved the day the talks are back in existence and the minimum the two teams will go back to work discussing the last ten percent is it sometimes referred to which is a lot of it's the enforcement and there was not a button by which is not just words to some kind of enforcement mechanism with the review process and possibly additional tariffs so if it if the Osaka G20 is like the Buenos Aires G20 December 1st there'll be a dinner or some kind,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
of a meal for two or three hours the two presidents with their staff president will talk back and forth on the outstanding issue and then try to improve the area of agreement and get toward the final version let's see that's an optimistic outlook now because it looks like the hawks in China have really asserted themselves and the president she isn't as fully in charge as we all sort of thought that the hawks in China don't really want an agreement one of them came on the radio in Beijing just about a month ago saying he does not,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
want any agreeable to Americans at all so we're dealing with factions apparently in Beijing in which one group to be so-called reformers actually want this kind of agreement because it will increase the the power of the free market in China will reduce some of the subsidies and it will probably increase their growth rate the other side the kind of Maoists if you will they that that's what they often call themselves if they love Chairman Mao they want a much more state controlled economy they love what they call the national champions these huge companies that are some,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the largest companies in the world now and the economy this party basically being in all enterprises so that even a foreign company in China has to have a Chinese Communist Party member to observe everything this is what the debate is going on in China for many many decades the whole thing the Chinese created the president Trump is dealing with was created back in the early 1980s this kind of predatory mercantilist system where these huge state of enterprises Chinese call the national champions they would have not only subsidies cheap loans but also espionage collected trade secrets,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
given to them to help them succeed so this huge beast if you will is what president trump's been taking on previous presidents wouldn't do it they were either defeatist or they didn't understand the problem so saka in some sense could be a showdown that they'd talk restart there's some momentum to them and the Chinese agree on enforcement mechanisms how much perinear that other Chinese how much pain of the Chinese been been taking to their economy because of the the Trump policy and the tariffs so far and and do you think that trump has the the both,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
the mindset and also sufficient leverage with his team to at least to get a have a realistic shot of bringing the Chinese to some kind of deal the great question the Chinese perception of how much pain they're going through is that they say it's zero they say all the pain is going to be on the American side they had a piece yesterday in china daily saying only America will suffer from the trade war on our side we tend to look at objective indicators for example auto sales have really plummeted since the trade talks began does the,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
tariffs began to be applied so we see these objective indicators that tell us China should be feeling pain but they're claiming that they don't that's part of the problem the president i think wants to go and i support this you want to go for the full five hundred billion dollar range of Chinese exports to our country and put 25 percent on all of it and even that may not be enough because we're dealing with this machine created in the early 80s that as the president likes to say a past president's let this happen he even says,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
Obama let them get away with murder so the amount of leverage it will take to get china to do major changes in its economic system i think it's going to be pretty high and we've obviously got their attention they're willing to talk but the fact that they could remake and essentially stop the talks that shows me that they're still fairly arrogant fairly confident that they they don't have to do what we request do you think that they're just trying to wait things out until they figure whether they're going to be dealing with trump or some democrat,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,HS
going forward how much stock do you put in that analysis uh i i agree with president trump that they they think they wait him out uh i'll get joe biden who's already sort of scoffed at the idea that china would ever surpass america uh president trump likes to say they want to surpass us but it will not happen on my watch and the implication of that is it's ever another president a weak president let's say hoe reclinton or joe biden that the chinese would surpass america that's the vision the president trump's holding out for what's mistaken,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
these talks uh i agree with him as a matter of fact um but the level of of leverage it will take to make up for these weak presidents in the past and how much china has gained on us i mean even by you look up to see a uh fact book uh they use purchase power parody they're indicating that china has surpassed on the american economy as of about three or four years ago to lose what we've used what they call the currency exchange rate figure then we are about nineteen trillion and they are close to,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
fourteen trillion so something like two thirds of ours size but they grow twice as fast as us they used to grow four times as fast when they were at ten percent a year now at six or seven percent they're still double our growth rate so it's a matter of time unless we can uh get them to play fair and give a level playing field with the president likes to say to our farmers and our workers but that's been happening so far we're speaking to Dr,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Michael Pillsbury who is at the Hudson Institute in the author of the hundred-year marathon which i have read covered a cover i recommend to all of you listening if you want to learn about what's going on with china you do the same um also uh one to ask you uh Michael what do we need to know about these protests in in hong kong people are saying a couple million turned out maybe the largest protests in the twenty first century anywhere in the world so far at least that's what i've seen some of the estimates say,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
uh it why does this matter so much and what does it tell us about the direction not just of hong kong but of china what i would tell us about the direction of china is that chinese who live in hong kong who have their own identity in some ways and they have British law uh pretty institutions they're guaranteed to them until twenty forty seven they are saying and and large numbers that we don't trust the rule of law the legal system the system of trials up in china so this new proposal that china can come in,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
and sort of a rest whoever wants in hong kong and they must be extradited immediately to china by the way it includes visitors there's uh foreign visitors by the millions also there's eighty five thousand americans who live in hong kong so this new order to demonstrate against for giv china freehand to bring anybody back to china and they they're claim of course is you'll get a fair trial so apparently two million people don't believe he's the kid a fair trial if they're expedited back to china um that's the that's the issue and it's a vote of,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
no confidence it's highly embarrassing worldwide because she's in paying and the chinese leadership uh they obviously thought they could get away with this and now it's very amusing to me because my book uh under gimme marathon as you know about it's all about deception and the chinese use of deception their story had been we have the rule of law in china hong kong should welcome this and we support it to pull up your members publicly endorsed it the extra edition law now the chinese ambassador in london who used to be here in their embassy he is,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
publicly said no we never asked for this you know this is kerry lam's own idea so they're throwing her under the bus because it's so politically unpopular but i think it's extremely significant that chinese is close to china as hong kong chinese do not believe that the rule of law exists but we'll china get its way eventually on this i mean how along can hong kong resist the second largest economy in the world then increasingly one of the largest military powers in the world as well a lot depends on this concept of faith and this desire,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
by the chinese chinese party up in bajang to portray itself as virtuous uh friendly honest they're trying to sell a deception story i think it's what our gimme marathon it's going to be a new chinese led to world order and under this chinese led world order yes they'll have the largest economy by far they'll end up with the largest military forces but everyone's going to be happy everyone's going to be attracted to the virtue of this new chinese led world order it'll be so much better they say than the american led world order which was so,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
unfair and brutal and involved in vations not approved by the UN Security Council so this is what they've been pushing now for more than 10 years that this new overhead tour toward as much better than the old american led order when these two million people turned out it's the kind of a stab in the back from the chinese communist parties point of view and i i think is long as the rest of the world pays attention there is enormous media attention to the demonstrations it means hong kong has not been abandoned and the rest of the,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
world still thinks that chinese should agree to its agreement it made with the british back in 1997 that hong kong system of government want to go the highest degree of autonomy will remain until 2047 that's a long way to go but we're going to have to keep watching the situation there i think and probably while warning the chinese not to be too heavy handed dr michael pilsbury author of the hundred year marathon and over at the hudson institute where works on china strategy michael great to have you on sir appreciate it will have you back they,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
were going to discuss the military balance next time that's what i'm only agreed about by well count on my friend will get in the military balance for sure everybody will be back in just a moment i'm not been at a shape i'm fine i'm bent out of shape for them these are the first heroes and veterans and victims of the great trillions of dollars war on terror and they're currently still suffering and dying an and terrible need you know you would think that that would be enough to get congress's attention but apparently it's not we've spent,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
a year compiling bipartisan co-sponsors and advocates for this bill all the hopes that when it finally gets to the great michbocanels desk you won't jack us around like you've done in the past so if you want to know why the nine eleven community has been at a shape over these past let's call it eighteen years meet with them tomorrow as soon as possible and don't make them beg for it you could pass this thing as a standalone bill tomorrow meet with them so john steward is really pushing this moment here and i was initially very supportive,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
of it because of nine eleven in nine eleven first responders we have a we have a a debt to them as americans not just as new yorkers as americans and obviously also first responders that were at the uh pedagon as well uh but john steward is now going beyond just the congress at the problem to naming specific members of congress and blaming people for things and and calling them up by name and i would note that there's not a i haven't heard him criticize a democrat yet which i just this this is a thing that happens,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
where someone who maybe is on the right track overall but then it starts to get partisan away where i think it's fair to ask questions uh michmicano who uh by the way they've been funded i mean that the funding is and i think i told you on the show that i can't remember that john steward's part of his big monologue that he gave that got so much attention he said this room is empty and it's a disgrace it's everybody in congress who was supposed to be at that hearing was there it was just it was a,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
bigger room than some of their different size congressional hearing rooms this is i read this from some of you worked in congress for years and years and so everybody was supposed to be there was apparently there from what i understand so john steward was just that was a grand standing moment that he was but look i'm going to give him some leeway if he's going to grand stand on behalf of of people who were at 9-11 doing what they at the world trace they're doing what they could but here's michmicano responding to what's starting to feel,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
like a pretty political or or i should say partisan criticism play 14 we've never left the 9-11 victims behind and we want again i don't know how many times i can say we've never left the 9-11 victims behind and we won't again we see the obstacles with it it's something we always take care of any other subject yeah michmicano saying that this always gets done it has never not gotten done in whatever so i i do get curious some point john steward is he upset that they that this isn't automatically in the budget every year is,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
that is that is this supposed to be a part of automatic spending and i asked that question not rhetorically or in a smarty way i ask it honestly i don't really understand what his the the room wasn't poorly attended when he gave his speech you have co-sponsors for the bill like dang crenshaw who's a wounded navy seal and veteran the war in afghanistan i mean you've got people that are very much but attending to this issue he's a you've got major coast maybe major sponsors for the bill nobody thinks it's not going to pass the bill,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
is going to pass it can be funding so why is he calling out michmicano act like he doesn't care there's something else going on here folks there's some there's some other considerations that are being or that are latching on to what should be a pure duty and obligation moment which is that we we should be helping the first responders but it shouldn't be we help the first responders but let's also just just bass bash michmicano because he's the bad guy here the funding is going through it it always has so i'd like to know what john,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
steward is getting so angry at certain individuals about this was a troubling article that i came across today from someone who is a a phd i believe a psychologist and or psychiatrist i'm not sure which about the the bigotry this is not what it's called but this is what the articles about it's really the bigotry of trans or rather of cisgender heterosexual people against transgender individuals and you might be saying well what what is that book i don't understand and that's fine because it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense until you dig into the,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
details the purpose of this article are trans people excluded from the world of dating and it goes into some detail about how for a transgender person sexual attraction does not line up with what they might want it to be as in a man who decides to be a transgender woman which as we know is still not biologically a woman may wish to have heterosexual male partners but heterosexual males speaking as one are overwhelmingly not attracted at all to transgender females now the dating world is interesting because it's one of the few parts of life where there's,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
a an acceptance of you get to kind of pick and choose what you want you can pick by religion you can pick by it's a very personalized decision making process that the social justice warriors have not yet been able to override you know as much as they may want people to date a non binary non cisgender you know eight hundred pounds Eskimo you know as much as they may want people to view that as what is sexually attractive and and what we should all aspire to people tend to be attracted to what what where and by,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
the way there is somebody out there I'm sure who this mythological person I've just created I'm sure there are people who that is their cup of tea and that's great but we tend to like what we like we tend to be attracted to what we're attracted to as people but what's interesting to me is that now within the medical profession there's already this early because you know the most left wing doctors are psychiatrists and I'm not making that up that's that's true there have been studies the most left wing doctors are psychiatrists and what we're finding,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
is that now there's a pressure on doctors to try to come up with explanations of why transgender women are not attractive to heterosexual men and the answer is because they're not women it's very straightforward they have different uh I'm not going to try to you know beat around the you know be cutesy about this I'm just they have different genitalia I mean they are different down below and there's a very basic biological impulse of attraction that heterosexual men have and that we don't find uh women who are trans or sorry transgender women rather we don't find,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,HS
transgender women attractive is exactly what the medical profession should expect because they're not women and that that I knew you say that a oh no you can't say that they are no no no they're not you can say they're transgender women but they are not in fact just women that's not that's not accurate that's not true that's not reality um but in this article they get into some uh really interesting social analysis of how this is a problem to be over that must be overcome that there's a really a bigotry a sense of um exclusionary feeling,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS
toward people who are who want to be attractive to heterosexuals but who themselves do not line up in a gender sense with what a heterosexual would be attracted to this should not be complicated doctors should not be be fuddled by this but sure enough they are in this piece in psychology today are trans people excluded from the dating world no they're not excluded at all but we all live in reality folks and gender is still real even if some people want to pretend it's not hey team bud it's time for roll call you putting it air,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS

said that Michael that they got awarded this that doesn't mean they're going to get it but you don't know this stuff goes in a court for a long time and well what will actually happen because I have some familiarity with the way these settlements tend to work is they'll end up paying a much smaller but immediate fee just to make the whole thing go away but even even if Gibson's got a couple million dollars that would probably be I don't know what their legal bills are but if they got a million or two above their legal,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,Non-HS

they wouldn't really be able to wage any kind of offensive war i you know i guess it depends on what the parameters are when you say unable to wage war on anyone uh we wouldn't be able to take out all iranian ground forces and and stop them from activating proxy terrorist forces abroad so there's a lot of ways that they would hit back even if we let's say took out their entire if we took out their entire air force and air defense system which i think we could do pretty easily and pretty quickly they still would,37575_The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show_2019-06-18_transcription.json,HS

 Right now we're in that phase because we're a very rich country or we think socialism is just you get free stuff,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're just going to keep getting free stuff,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's an endless amount of that free stuff,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And while that's not true, it works for people who want to be in power",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When you and I say socialism, there are a lot of Americans and states like Georgia who say, well, does that just mean I get free healthcare and my kids go to college for free? That sounds pretty good to me because they get the benefits up front and the pain comes later",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so much of life, so much of our existence is really the battle between short term and long term gratification",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You don't care,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the way this has been set up for the American people,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are not winning this battle,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 they don't tell you openly and honestly what they're really planning to do,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" What are you going to do then? Now Mitch McConnell's decision to block $2,000 checks for Americans has only done one thing",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It hasn't even stopped Americans from getting those checks,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" We're going to start talking about it now, but until people feel the pain of that, until they understand what it means to the currency, to the value of the dollar, to your purchasing power and the global marketplace, until people really understand that and who knows when that will happen, it just seems like it's all free, funny money",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mitch McConnell picked a very strange time,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He'd take a stand for this,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Then his leadership is over and I don't know if he'll ever be sent a majority leader again,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think he should be,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was an unbelievable blunder,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The focus on the cheating in Georgia, and I'm going to say this, I'm going to speak to you always honestly from the heart, the focus on the cheating from, from the Trump campaign in the last few weeks, I think was too much because are we actually going to, are we working to get the message out there to drive up votes? Or are we going to get bogged down in the continued, oh, but they cheated in the election rhetoric? I'm just speaking purely about what we're, I don't need to hear about, oh, but it's, you know,",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
the principle of the thing,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've been talking about the principle of the cheating in Georgia for now two months,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I told you that we had to get ready for January 5th and that this was going to come up on us and I was worried,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Those of you who listen to the show, yes, I've been worried that we're going to lose these Senate seats from the beginning",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, ever since the November election, I thought, hold on a second, we got a problem in Georgia as well beyond what just happened at the presidential, a presidential level",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you know, this Raffensberger feud with Trump and all this stuff, we needed a united and competent GOP in Georgia and we did not have it",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm not here to tell you to despair,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I can't even remember how many a huge red wave of house seats, a tea party",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They're unscrupulous and they want power and they will wield power and they'll do it in such a way they hope we can never get it back in his,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 That's right,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They gave us a lesson for four years in the extremes they will go to to thwart the Trump agenda and unfortunately they were successful in some key areas,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Pull out, stymie, stumble, hobble, slow it down, sabotage, whatever we have to do to stop them from turning this country into a one party state where you exist effectively at the whim and will of government bureaucrats",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Where nothing is sacred anymore, you have no right that they can't infringe on and we see all this with COVID",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" That's what's really pulled, pulled off the mask if you will",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What their real long term plan is is to tell you that they can make you do anything they want,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They didn't have to pass legislation to do it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's the height of hypocrisy for people who claim to be the champions of rights for women to deny the very biological existence of women,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this recent rule change at the house just actually voted and passed on today that you were talking about removing references to, you know, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters from congressional rules and administration",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's mind-blowing because it shows just how out of touch with reality and the struggles of everyday Americans, people in Congress are, but also it shows that, you know, their first act as this new Congress could have been to make sure that elderly Americans are able to get the COVID vaccine now alongside frontline healthcare workers, elderly Americans who have the highest mortality rates from this virus, but instead of doing something that could actually help save people's lives, they're choosing instead to say, well, you can't say mother or father in any of this congressional language",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's astounding,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's a very important point that a Democrat, Telsey, God, and Telsey, Gabbard, who is a wrong on politics, but clearly a good person, clearly a person of some decency and character, wrong about a lot, hate's Trump",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I get it, but still a good, still a reasonable, you know, a reasonable person on some things",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think at her core, someone that you can at least have a real conversation with that",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She's not, you know why the left is always hated her? Because she doesn't disparage Republican",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She doesn't despise them,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She disagrees with them, but she doesn't think if you voted for Donald Trump in the past, you're beneath contempt",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe it's in part because she served her country in the military and has greater ideals and aspirations beyond just the partisan fight,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" As I've said, I think she's wrong on some things, but on this, she's making a key point",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The vaccine rollout at many different levels is too slow and is preposterous,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And so for bureaucratic reasons that they can't get it to, you know, the exact right group",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they give it to no one to throw it out,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Think about that,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's actually happening,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And while that's going on instead of taking urgent action to get this to people on, don't I look, I'm talking about seniors should get the vaccine",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The vaccine is less dangerous for seniors than the viruses,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That's a decision he's made as an individual and so he'll have to be judged for that,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's certainly not in keeping with everything that he claims to stand for as a human being and as a politician because there's simply no excuse for trying to thwart the will of voters,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We need more than that,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need to win on the battlefield of ideas,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that means also winning the culture,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They're not trying to report facts anymore,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all about spinning whatever narrative they think and get ratings,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's just the reality of the situation,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it doesn't impact me,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to continue keeping our eye on the ball and working as hard as we can to deliver results,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The lockdown lives,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Democrat left,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's really just those,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" You don't know what I'm saying, but still, but Florida is one big silver lining because you have a governor who has defied the consensus",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have a governor who has refused to go and bend the knee to the fauciites,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That guy fauci is a complete jackass and it's disgusting what he's done to the country,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You know what? We didn't have to lock down the country after all,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That didn't really give us any benefit and it caused a lot of drawbacks for us,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we're sorry,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They're never going to change,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're never going to admit that this was all disastrous,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in fact, I'm of the belief that the Democrats ability to dominate the narrative because of the media panic that was induced",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or the media inducing panic in the public, the Democrat narrative about COVID and how Trump was so inept and so ineffective and handling it",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that played a very large role in the election because that's not something people would necessarily tell to a pollster,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not something that the data would all that clearly indicate,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think that it affected overall perception is Trump doing a good job,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of people would look at what happened in 2020 with COVID,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They can try to make it seem like the holes in the budgets are not so catastrophic,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It would be 99% the same,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not worth it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not worth it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You remember what all that was going on? All about what's happening,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The media was also looking for any opportunity to take a story of a police involved shooting and turn it into some kind of evil racist look, another cop doing what cops do being terrible, shooting",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Black men and then get the cycle going all over again,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I will say just as an aside, it is deeply disappointing to me as an American that the Democrats did not pay a bigger price for their their reckless demagoguery on this issue and their really wholesale embrace of not just the BLM movement, but also their either turning a blind eye to or just open support of Antifa",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Remember Antifa took up the Black Lives Matter banner at different points in order to give them a kind of moral legitimacy they would not have otherwise had,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's what that's what was happening in the summer,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I will tell you, I think I may have heard of canochia Wisconsin before this summer, but I might not have not a place that I could say I know very well",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a city of about 50,000",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it just barely qualifies as a city,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really kind of a big town,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there was a shooting in canochia Wisconsin and we have video of the shooting,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What occurred? What happened that led to riots? Remember, canochia was the scene of riots and those riots were so so extreme that then people like Kyle Rittenhouse showed up to protect some of the businesses and some of the government buildings that were being mobbed and assaulted",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then Rittenhouse was mobbed and assaulted and then he shot shot and killed someone he says in self defense,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it certainly seems from the video and the evidence presented so far that it was self defense,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we'll see what the courts say,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We'll see where this goes,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now we have canochia a final determination about the officer involved shooting that led to the riots that led to the Rittenhouse incident,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And here's what happened,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The Democrat district attorney, the Democrat district attorney found that the police officer here should not be charged",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The police officer involved in this shooting didn't actually break the law,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is a pretty straightforward case if you actually look at the facts,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's not surprising to me that the Democrat, oh, the Washington Post deleted the, they deleted the tweet I responded to",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not surprising to me,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Democrat prosecutor didn't bring the initial, they didn't bring criminal charges",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Here's why they have video of, of, of Jacob Blake refusing police commands, obviously and repeatedly and clearly the police are saying stop, stop, don't move, don't move, show me your hands, show me your hands or yelling at this guy",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he's going moving around to the driver's side of a car, reaching into the car to grab something",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what's happening,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's reaching into the car to, to seize something",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he grabbed a knife,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The officer who shot him had his hand on Blake's back, holding his shirt, yelling at him to show him his hand, show him his hands",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He waited,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He did everything he could do,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The next level of this would have been that officer sitting to, or waiting to see if Blake was going to stab him in the face or the throat or the chest with the knife",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why are you going for a knife when police have guns drawn on you in broad daylight and are saying stop, stop, stop",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If police cannot fire under those circumstances, what we're saying is police are not allowed to defend themselves against lethal force",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Very straightforward,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not a close call situation,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If someone, if if police say show me your hands, show me your hands and you have a gun in your waistband and it's on video and you reach for and grab your gun, they're going to shoot you",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're not going to wait to see if you draw that weapon and fire at them first,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" That act of, of refusing commands and reaching for a weapon is enough under the, under the, the rules of, of force use it, you know, the rules of application of force for, for people in the law enforcement community",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is a, that is a legitimate use of force situation",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the way, the way that Washington Post reported on this was appalling",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's no surprise,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or what do they do? They, they initially said the headline and then now they deleted it",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I was going to read it to you, but it was on Twitter",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They deleted it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, the headline was no, it's something like no charges in the shooting of Jacob Blake and unarmed black man who was shot by police seven times in the back",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Long headline,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why was that the headline? Why was the headline just no charges? I mean, if you were just doing a news story, wouldn't it be no charges against police officer and Jacob Blake shooting? Why did the garbage key publication known as the Washington Post? Why they make the decision three people on the byline, by the way, of a, of a, of a on a breaking news story that was clearly going to get a lot of attention like this to say that Jacob Blake was unarmed and that he was shot seven times in the back",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Are those, now those are, those are details that you put in a news story",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or why is that of the headline? Because what the Washington Post was trying to do was say that this was a racist murder by police and it's going unpunished,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what, uh, LeBron, do we have the LeBron audio mark? Yes",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, this, this, this LeBron James, one of the most wealthy, famous, influential people on the planet",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is how he reacts to the story publicly on his social media accounts with tens of millions of followers played,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm smart enough to know that even though we're playing a game of basketball that there's so much more that's going on in the world,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So much more to see even more important in us playing a game,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And to hear what happened in Kenosha today was, was it blow to the heart and to the gut? Um, you know, not only to that community, you know, what's us and to every, you know, yes, you know, black person that that just has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And not only just in the black community, but also in the white community as well, who, will see, you know, mom was like this happened to us",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, and to happen to his family and to happen to the kid himself, um, to see that verdict",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was just, um, it was a blow to the gut",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like I said, in the blow to the heart, um, but we got to continue to, we got to continue to stay strong, um, continue to, to, to believe in each other and continue to push for for the, for the greater of change and for the greater of good",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So here, here you have one of the most powerful, most influential, wealthiest people in in the world, really",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 LeBron James has tens of millions of followers on social media,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, he's, he's known pretty much everywhere where they have, you know, internet access and a TV",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to know what LeBron James is for all intensive purposes,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's probably worth a billion dollars or a close to it already,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 For playing basketball,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, this guy is an international superstar",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and what I want to know is, yes, there is absolutely a need",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's absolutely a role for sympathy for Jacob Blake's family,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that's true",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's always the case,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, even if someone is in a drunk driving accident that they cause and they die, you feel bad for the family, they've lost someone",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Jacob Blake as we know was shot,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was paralyzed,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So he did live, but he was paralyzed after being shot by my police",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that has a, that's obviously a lifelong burden",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a, it's a loss for that family as well",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's something that is a tragedy for them,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what's interesting to me about this is, is that LeBron James clearly wants an attempt, an attempted murder charge here",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, this, this man was paralyzed",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 He was shot seven times,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so LeBron wants this cop to be treated like a racist would be killer,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This cop out of, out of racism tried to kill and paralyzed Jacob Blake",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Does that, does that sound like justice to anyone? Does that sound like something that should happen here? I mean, in, in what world is that a fair outcome? You know, the Washington Post in their headline said unarmed, you know what the problem with that is he wasn't unarmed",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they had to delete the headline,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They had to walk that old thing back,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're still at this stage lying about this incident because they're playing to a narrative,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that narrative is deeply destructive,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And LeBron James is playing to that narrative too, although I think, you know, I think he believes it",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that is that police are racist murderers of black men and that the police, and the policing in America is deeply rooted in systemic and vicious racism",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's a really dangerous charge to put out there, especially because it's not true",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just not true,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, they keep finding these incidents like this and they tell us that it's racism and then we see it and we learn more about it, whether it's what happened in Ferguson, Missouri",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not saying there's no racism,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course, I'm not saying there are no cops who are murderers",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course there are, but you know, to treat all cops as though they're the bad guys and then to hold up these incidents where the cops aren't even doing anything wrong",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a tragedy, but it's not a crime",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's irresponsible,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's reckless,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's destructive,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the Washington Post, of course, the Democrats are all a part of this",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why would the Washington Post get that such a key detail? He wasn't unarmed,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's on a knife,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's on video,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the District Attorney in Kenosha saw it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all very clear,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He went for a knife,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do that,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or what are we going to do? Tell cops that they have to get, you know, stabbed in the neck before they can use their service weapon and defense of themselves",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And what phase are cops allowed to actually take action so that they get to go home to their families? And they're, you know, we're talking to all human beings here",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They people who love them, people care about them",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But we have police to protect all of us, to protect you and me",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are very important laws and rules and regulations and use of force escalation that is taught and that is necessary for law enforcement,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what happened here was all within the scope of this officer's lawful duties,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But that, but see they lie about it because they're so desperate",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" The Washington Post lies, but they deleted the tweet",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They've admitted they said, oh, we have a correction",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The family says he was unarmed,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They said on their correction,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the DA and the video says that he actually was grabbing a knife,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, I'm sorry",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the family lawyer now, that's, that's how they do reporting",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, this person's family lawyer says, you know, that they were innocent of the charge",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we're, our headlines going to say innocent of the charge",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not how it works,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Although it is for Democrats and for leftists, but here's the other, here's the other issue",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's the bigger part of this,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Democrats are going to do a lot more of this going ahead now,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They feel emboldened to do this,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're going to build upon and try to hammer home this narrative of cops or racist law enforcement as racist,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And therefore we have to do things to hurt law enforcement,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we have to offer up sacrifices of law enforcement officers who will be ruined,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Who will be sent to prison? Who love their lives, or won't be able to see their families and be treated like murderers, be treated like racists in order to assuage the anger of the Democrat base",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And in order to play into this narrative of our police officers as evil, bad racist people, which is a lie",31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I don't care how often LeBron James says it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't care how many celebrities say it,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't care how much the Democrats pander on this issue,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just not true,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The rare and occasional criminal and or racist police officer in America out of hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers across the country is not in any way a fair basis for maligning all law enforcement as racist,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is what the Democrats do,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is reckless,31784_The Buck Sexton Show_06-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

the chopping block it will not happen with the current fake phony opposition not just the Republican Party in America but really we're seeing this certainly with the Tories in the UK all of the party strategically set up to serve as controlled opposition and it's it's time we realize that it's time we recognize that never has there been such a dichotomy between the type of issues the severity of issues confronting us the severity of the actions and consequences of the policies by the incumbent leftist party yet the lack of focus from the supposed right-leaning opposition it's almost,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
as if these issues don't matter they're not even campaigning on the issues that matter they're not even calling a flag I never could have imagined a couple years ago we would live in times like this yes America was very profligate libertine the social values were in the toilet but people like their stuff they like the opulence they like their comforts I never thought we would have the government literally locking down killing millions rounding up political opponents evidently one of the 12 pro-life activists just locked up by the FBI was a 95 year old Holocaust survivor singing,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
hymns outside of of a Planned Parenthood or something I never thought this would happen and see we would have a Republican Party doesn't even call a flag doesn't say Democrats bite in you just did what you got to be kidding me and just raising cane about it they don't say a word so I never thought it would get this bad but in my mind I was hoping would get really bad and what I thought really bad at that time was nothing like what we're facing today I couldn't have even written a script like this but at,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
least it would finally elicit a righteous reaction we would suffer but that would force a reaction to finally reform government and bring us back to the constitution in a way that we really never wore my entire lifetime but instead it's the opposite it's worse than I could have imagined and Republicans aren't even in in word much less deed raising awareness of it see typically no one party in a stable political system with real opponents no one party could get too far a field with destructive unpopular policies without the other side immediately crying bloody murder right because,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
they would immediately contest it would immediately challenge it and maybe they'd be able to get a couple yards down the field with it but eventually it would grind them down because it would raise such outrage they would bring the data and information and all the anecdotes and the suffering of the people yet what the GOP is doing by allowing them to arson and arson and they're like hey it's it's a nice nice sunny day out here hey Kanye West hey whatever other distraction the day well in the eyes of the people makes it look like it's,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
consensus well I guess it's not a problem I guess everyone agrees that the vaccines are where it's at I guess everyone agrees that this is what we need to do with illegal immigration I guess everyone agrees that January 6 was an interaction or at the very least if the people don't form a consensus behind it because the party's former consensus and I don't think that's happening in this case they just put it on the back burner of their minds we know that no matter how destructive an issue is there's so many distractions people are artfully distracted,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
with the Google Apple headlines that they won't think about something so historic for that for bad reasons right in front of their eyes this is how Biden and really Biden is just a carcass but these elite globalist masters the fourth Reich could get away with even declaring an emergency for another 90 days when it's over here we are Joe Biden slipped up and said the emergency is over with a normal party would have been the very next day Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy would have held a joint press conference major governors other people wait you just,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
said what so you admit this is over with and you're continuing to fund Pfizer and Moderna after millions of adverse events to approve a shot for babies for a variant that doesn't affect anyone for a virus that never affected kids based on a study of eight mice I mean the talking points the press releases write themselves they love talking points right that that's what they love okay you got it in spades this is not January 2021 when it's only brave souls like us that fought it it takes nothing to fight it now you have reams of,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
experts you have reams of data you have I mean heck you have Paul Offit who's one of the most famous vaccinologists of the generation he's on the FDA advisory board he supported the vaccines up to wazoo but then it got so bad he was like oh dude like okay no this this is a problem and he's actively almost like campaigning on all of media against the boosters and the media is actually not even that bed with it especially the local Philadelphia media he's a he's big in Philadelphia he works in Philadelphia what's it called chop children's,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
hospital Philadelphia and they they bring him on pretty complimentary and even he said look this thing is a big problem you shouldn't ask tens of billions of people to get a vaccine based on my data have you heard Kevin McCarthy or Mitch McConnell say a word about this all the studies all the data I don't even have time to go through everything every day but every day I could bring you another two dozen new studies papers on damage to another part of the body that they cause negative efficacy and to this day Republicans not only didn't,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
say whoa Biden we are not passing this CR unless the emergency is rescinded the prep act is reformed funding for Pfizer and Moderna suspended we have an investigation into all of this we offer compensation for those injured we offer grants to expedite studies for diagnosis and treatment of these injuries not a word no matter how much it was like yeah Democrats will be like yeah we just killed 10 million people with the COVID shots and Republicans would go on the next day talking about you know the economy should really bad um a vote Republican like what,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
what do you what just happened there it's it's so bizarre Republicans are even behind what a lot of the the medical profession people in terms of coming to to the truth on this yet because they declined to do this not only are the Democrats not held accountable it's not all just like we we thought it would be a matter of the Democrats and the Biden administration just moving on just gliding into the next thing without saying a word okay you know we're just just moving on they're not even moving on this is huge news yesterday this,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
is from PBS it's all over the news obviously it should be a big story Biden administration extends COVID-19 public health emergency for another 90 days and they haven't said a word they still haven't said a word they didn't respond before they didn't respond to that so in other words typically you have 50 50 America maybe you could push a policy that's 40 60 60 percent opposition but Democrats could push something that is killing people and could have five percent support right only like four percent of the people got the boosters yet they could succeed in doing,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
it and do even worse and build upon it because Republicans will never hold them accountable they won't even throw the flag much less do anything about it and they promised to funded it's not like they're like oh my gosh we know this after the revelation of Pfizer at the EU Commission that they admit they never even studied transmission we are going to make sure all the mandates are defunded at least that the mandates got for which you defund the shots themselves but at least the mandates no they're not even promising in the omnibus they plan to,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
write in the lame duck to undercut an incoming GOP majority that they're saying you need to vote for for an entire year giving the Democrats the full budget at least they look we're going to demand it into the mandates they're not mentioning a word that omnibus is going to fund Pfizer and Moderna up the wazoo all of their products every single one of them we're going to discuss is negative efficacy causes rebounds and causes serious known and unknown injury and death and they're funding it they're gonna continue funding it they're not promising not to fund it,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
think about this so the emergency is extending for 90 days so that means it's gonna go into mid-January that would be two weeks or so after Kevin McCarthy is is you know 99% chance sworn in a speaker see what what Kevin McCarthy should have said is that Mitch McConnell you do not undercut my leverage as incoming speaker pass a CR that expires not in December so they could write an omnibus then for the rest of the fiscal year but have it expire at the end of January and then you would come in and that's where you,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
had your have your leverage Biden we will not send you a budget bill unless the emergency goes bye bye but no now they would have given away their leverage they would have given it away sealed sign sealed and delivered to Biden's desk for signature the entire FY 2023 budget so now they won't even have any leverage but then again they don't need it because he's not even rhetorically saying you need to get rid of it but not willing to use the leverage that was like 2010 you know they'd say we hate Obamacare but they wouldn't really,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
use the proper leverage to fight it now they're not even articulating it it's utterly insane that is the perfidy of the Republican Party Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy he's not even rhetorically promising us on anything no matter what comes out yeah likely half a million people died in America from this no problem they're gonna continue funding it's not like he just doesn't want to unravel the last two and a half years but we've moved on we haven't moved on the emergency is still there the prep act is still there the shots are still there and by the,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
way the cases will go up because the shots induce viral immune escape so come Janimos they look it's hard the wintery of all these cases we need to extend the emergency another 90 days and therefore allow emergency use authorization of more death products so you got to take your own destiny in your own hands you got to go independent one of the ways of doing that is by securing your food security 60% of us poor production comes from one company owned by the freakin Chinese the rest of it is full of garbage antibiotics pro-inflammatory additives and,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

no you're not why do you think they don't care so first of all you have to understand that on the one hand it's not like no matter how bad and destructive they are especially because republicans refuse to actually acknowledge it and expose their weakest most perfittest policies so it's not like there's a road map to getting 60 70 80 Senate seats right where in one election you essentially wash out 80% of the democrats saying even a wave is nowhere near that in american politics it's no matter what the blue states are blue you might have a,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
fluke here and there you'll win a district here and there in a blue state could happen probably will happen but for the most part it's not like i i mean also just based on the senate map the type of sentences that are up it's mathematically impossible anyway for them to even get 60 seats and that includes mitt romney and susan colons lee'samer koski all these you know tom tillus all these rhinos anyway i mean that are downright to the left of even mitch mcconnell but forgetting about that you don't you don't have that ability so it's,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,HS
not like they're gonna lose everything where theoretically if republicans ever got some principles and believed in something they could just win an election and just march right in with their policies which they wouldn't do anyway because they don't believe in anything and they believe in what the democrats believe in but it's not like they're scared of that because they do have a certain minimum that they're always going to be able to hold and they know that the governors are bought out and they're not going to do what i say they should do so at a federal,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
level they have the presidency and then in addition they're going to have a filibuster enabling minority in the senate no matter what so and they know republicans aren't going to use the budget bill and in fact they're purposely getting rid of it for the first entire year so they're not scared of that but also it's not democrats per se that that run the show it's not like the elected democrats in the senate and house that's old thinking it should be that way if we were in a healthy republic it would be congress that mattered it doesn't,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
it's a cabal of masters of the universe that work with the bureaucracies and the so-called private sector that's not it's an artificial monopoly created by government over the years to get what they want knowing that republicans with the levers of power they have will never do what it takes to even wage an information warfare to expose them much less used leverage points power-wise to downright halt their advance in action so that's why they're just not scared they're not bothered by that never forget that they're not bothered by it they know that their policies will continue no,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
matter what and this is how they're able to approve a shot with no clinical trial for children after the president already said the pandemic's over it's literally in the FDA press release i'm just going to read to you for each of the bivalent covid-19 vaccines meaning one's modernos version one's Pfizer's authorized today the FDA relied on an immune response and safety data that it had previously evaluated from a clinical study in adults openly yeah well we're using old data from the old shots like what and it's totally fine because no one will hold them accountable for,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
it that's what people need to understand they're not scared they're not bothered by it let me give you a perfect example of this there's a lot of talk in the news about um aoc aoc and a lot of the conservative thumb suckers are really excited about this because it's another own the libs moment it's an important story but they're taking the wrong lesson from it so it's like oh aoc was humiliated she couldn't be left enough for a left-wing base she shows up at a town hall and they just lambasted her you say you're anti-war but,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
really you've thrown in with the elite warmongers you know just pumping full-hearted support into the ukraine war and and you're a fraud and they're like ha ha ha look at aoc she became a fool but they're missing the point the point is it's not so much right versus left anymore it's not about that it's not about oh the democrats want this republicans want this what's interesting is that those two individuals that spoke up they had twitter accounts and they were getting very popular because they gained a lot of notoriety i forget their names twitter suspended their,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
accounts i mean these are these are hardcore left-wing bernie sanders type of people they actually had their accounts suspended because it's not so much oh they only suspend conservatives it's not about that those terms don't mean anything because aoc it's not that aoc was anti-war she was never anti-war aoc was always just a mindless conduit a supporter of the next current thing so now the next current thing is ukraine so you have to support a war so they support it they'll turn off and on that faucet is needed the point is aoc is a nothing the,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
democrats are nothing they'll just follow the leaders and the leaders are not these psychopaths that are brainless you know serving in congress it's the people associated roughly with the gates of the sources wef whatever that is fizer moderna big pharma big big banking all of that that's where it is that's where the power structure is and on that front yes aoc and mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy literally agree a hundred percent on arsenic our future over russia you know biden's warning he might embargo aluminum from russia could you imagine what that's going to cause and that's,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
done on purpose and mcconnell mccarthy would totally support that if you had a vote on an embargo of aluminum russian in congress it would gain you know all but 30 40 house republicans support from them so that's why they don't care because they they buy off both parties they agree you look at the uk just to understand a fake opposition the republicans are no different it's just they're a little bit more open there because the people are less conservative than in america but you look at liz truss she just announced an energy plan that will basically,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
focus on conservation not production of natural oil natural energy and by the way fred are one of our long time listeners had a great idea he noted that i said we shouldn't use the word fossil fuel that's their term so he came up a great term is natural energy natural energy because there's nothing natural about solar panels it takes so many heavy metals and and chemicals to put that stuff up yeah sun is natural wind is not natural not the way they're capturing it water is natural likewise coal oil and gas are natural they are replenished,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
and god designed it that way but anyway she's she's a raving lunatic less than a month into her tenure so today the big news is she appointed this guy jeremy hunt as as her finance minister in the uk i want you to listen to this clip from the now the chancellor of the uk jeremy hunt from during the lockdowns take a listen right here i very much agree with the central point in gables paper that we should be aiming for zero infection and elimination of the disease because that is basically the approach taken in countries which,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
have a sars strategy as opposed to a flu strategy and those are the countries that have overwhelmed when you've been the most successful in in tackling coronavirus um and uh you know i just my sister uh lives in Beijing and she flew back to Beijing in the middle of lockdown and just to give you an idea of the contrast uh she was escorted from the airport in Beijing to her home by ministry of health officials and then uh put into her home for two weeks quarantine the door was sealed and uh she had a police car,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
sitting outside a house uh periodically and i'm not saying we go that far in this country but i just think it's an indication of how serious they are in the countries that have had to deal with sars about stopping at the root every possible source of infection so you heard that he praised China's lockdown he had a smirk on his face you have to see it he was like yeah they put people in concentration camps it really worked maybe won't go quite as far that is the conservative government's finance minister right now so that's what's so,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
bizarre you could have one side get into power do the most egregious unpopular immoral illogical destructive things that are not just destructive values wise but literally affect the people's quality of life you know before no one cared about values that was our big problem but now it literally does i mean you could totally get people are anxious with the supply chain stuff and the persecution everything you could totally win elections on this you could have your principles and electoral success work in tandem but they won't because they're bought out by the same system on what actually,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
matters they're literally the same and it's even better for them when the so-called right-leaning party is doing their most transformational things because if you have the left-wing party there's there's always this concern some people in the right-wing party will start raising awareness yelling about it raising concern but when you get the right-leaning party to do it well the left certainly is not going to fight it because they support it and then the right's like well we don't want to damage our guy we have to support trump remember that i mean covid fascism started literally under trump,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
not by then fizer fascism the fizer death shots all of it he brags about he digs credit for it to this day there's actually an old saying in this rally politics it takes the right to make peace and the left to make war and their point was because whenever you have a war it's under the right-leaning government the left will scream bloody murder but if it's under the left and the right you know always wants to be patriotic and support the troops so they're not going to fight it and that's how you get consensus and vice,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
versa with the so-called peace deals when when isra would like you know commit suicide and give their stuff to his bolan hamas by the way speaking of that uh there's this left-wing uh prime minister that's interim while they have an election the biden administration pressure them to basically give away their offshore natural gas reserves to his bola unbelievable so not only are they arsenic our uh our reserves they want to make sure globally nobody is using it because again just like with covid they didn't like a sweeten they didn't want a control group they don't want,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
you know one country living high in the hog with oil gas and coal and nuclear and everyone else languishing because people are gonna say hey i want what they want just like with the lockdowns they had to have every government almost every global government did it so everyone's gonna do the energy lockdown transhumanism as well so that's the story that's why the elections don't matter and it's not even like you could try to believe in it man i i just i just want to believe i i just want to know even i did this until fairly,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
recently as much as i knew the republicans were frauds this time of year you know couple weeks before the elections i would get swept up in the fervor it's just because the left is so obnoxious the democrats are so obnoxious just just let the republican win and then we'll we'll try to pressure him to do the right thing when he gets elected but now they're not even promising so everyone is obsessed with the az versus fetterman race but if you look carefully what's the outrage over it's not over any policy it's over the fact that fetterman,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
is a vegetable and he's not fit to serve okay i mean it's true but it's like so you have a vegetable communist versus a versus a lucid communist i frankly i'd rather have the vegetable and ironically the stroke almost for sure came i mean this guy's in his 40s the stroke almost for sure came from fetterman getting the shots for which az not only won't call it out he is more supportive of it than the democrats so there's just news today az announced that he supports biden's marijuana pardons and rejects minimum prison sentences so the one,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
issue he's kind of running on is tough on crime because fetterman literally wants to open up the prisons but even then on the issues that matter which are mandatory minimums that's the way to lock people up um and mind you the mandatories it wasn't as draconian as people say most of them got through that what's called the safety valve all the first timers were eligible for that um it wasn't locking up low-level people and like an idiot he's like we shouldn't tie the hands of the judges the judges are animals who do you think that becomes,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
a judge who do you think is in the legal profession those who believe that only january sixers should be locked up but anyway like an idiot like i support biden again a republican party was a wait a minute wait a minute who is serving time for a simple possession of marijuana and federal prison and why they're the cartel illegal alien traffickers we have the data to point this out this this is not hard 91,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
5 percent we're caught near the border to the cartel traffickers that puts a whole different spin on it but yet not only don't republicans throw that punch they actually agree agree to biden's point but yeah the lucid communists are going to do really well against the vegetable communists in this election what a great time to be alive own the libs every one of my colleagues is like that almost everyone but in reality the magnitude of what people have suffered the last few years life liberty property dreams of small business owners destroyed that was the big story,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the lockdowns you know we talked a lot about civil liberties and controlling people in the transhumanism and and the compliance in order to get us into this mode of complying to the great reset and that's all true but a big part of the lockdown itself was really to consolidate the market share for the big corporate players and destroy small business which was always the bulwark against tyranny the broad swath of the middle-class middle upper-income people providing goods and services that can't be centralized and monopolized by the government-controlled entities again Walmart Amazon Black Rock I mean,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
Vanguard these these places are essentially Freddie May or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the post office their GSEs their government sponsored entities through and through they're not private I have no problem inherently with large corporations naturally it's just almost all of them are not natural anymore the pain and nobody is addressing them nobody has a plan how to rebalance the power from small businesses I have a plan I would exempt small businesses from a number of regulations and tax taxes for a period of of 10 years only small businesses I don't like means testing on a,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
individual level or corporate level none of us do but what do you do when the government did the ultimate mandate that that tip to playing field back you have to tip it back to reach that equilibrium you can't just start out okay now now we're equal no more lockdown well that the damage is done I could read to you all the painful emails I get from military members from people that have no treatment for COVID no treatment for the shot injuries lost loved ones the amount of death is crazy the amount of long-term injury is out,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
of control the dreams destroyed I'll just read you one one email I got last night I just need to vent we lost our five bedroom three bath home thanks to COVID and I've been unable to find a rental we can afford the we F in their dystopian ad tells us that we will rent everything we need and be happy so at this point we were looking at renting a one bedroom apartment one fourth the size of our home at two and a half times the cost of our monthly mortgage payments oh wait we can't even do,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
that because we have been trying for months and our application is always rejected because our house was foreclosed on because the government destroyed our small business in solar livelihood so we are we are a bad risk you know by the way it's interesting that for years they force people banks to lend to people that shouldn't get loans and whatever and get credit that that that were reckless yet here you have small business owners that had their livelihood destroyed all these laptop people they enjoyed it they they didn't lose a penny and I'll tell you yours truly,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
I did not lose a penny of income I was able to to earn income indebted to you guys otherwise that'd be nothing I was able to I didn't have to wear a mask I didn't have to get a shot I I wasn't harmed by it in that sense so many people were like that but then there's the forgotten people it's a minority it's a small minority but it's a lot of people in a country 330 million that they you know middle upper income had small businesses in this case both the husband and wife so they're self-employed,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
so now the government literally destroyed their business and now they're like hey you're bad risk we also have no work history after being self-employed for decades and we are now working many old jobs making less money than we need to get by and our daughter had to give up on our MBA after finding herself thrust out into the world unprepared no longer having the ability to pay for school she has had to start cosmetology school at nights while working at a restaurant during the day and renting a shared room she is so excited at the prospect,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
of abandoning her lifelong goals and cutting hair for a living instead how could we just walk away from this yet name me the republican of consequence that is even tapping into this even telling the story much less promising to do something about it they need reparations Pfizer and Moderna need to be made made to pay for vaccine injury pay for small businesses destroyed those people that did the gain of function research when we find them some of them we know who they are but the kind of the entire net of it they need to be sued,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
for everything they have and that needs to be redistributed to the people who got harmed and that's redistributed redistribution of wealth I can get behind because the government caused that they are in that that's reparations I just it is so sad and she said your doom and gloom give me hope somehow which is nice to hear because I think the hope is that at least there's someone it's like you and you have an itch somewhere on your back that you can't quite reach and it's very frustrating it's it's it's a satisfying when you can finally reach,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
it finally finally finally reach it because if you're actually articulating and diagnosing the problem there's some hope with God's help of solving that problem of redressing that grievance but if you if you're distracted and you're talking about Kanye West or this or that when we have civilization literally life liberty property in its most literal sense being destroyed the human mind the human soul the human lived experience being destroyed families continuity of parents to children man and woman and these guys are just flatulating are you kidding me nothing matters how do you think republicans have all this,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

are at least talking about being tough on crime that is one issue they're talking about not really they're blaming the democrats for what's going on they're not saying what they're going to do about it and in fact one of the things you would do is mandatory minimums if you don't want to do it on drug crimes but certainly on on you know rape murder robbery certain number three strikes and you're out on violent crimes you should all agree to and no then maybe a single one even campaigning on that formal police but that's meaningless you the,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
police will apprehend them but the system will let them go but all the industries oppose that they're for criminal justice to form republicans are kind of talking tough on the border we talked about this many times i'm going to do what it takes and they're still in the pockets of the open borders but why would they support them with such harmful rhetoric the answer is they're not stupid they know they're not going to do anything about it and they want to grease the skids of both sides because it's the same side and you need the same,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,HS
side so you can have just one side of the same side because then people will rebel against it right and people are rebelling but they have no choice but to do what vote republican that's the rebellion so they're going to make sure the other side is perfectly bought out that's the bottom line that's why nothing will change that's why the left doesn't fear a republican tsunami and yet the conservatives are happy about this while the people suffer i don't know i guess the problem with a lot of these republicans is that they're cut from the same,6355_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

And that was an unarmed black male climbing through that window who was shot and killed instead of this, this woman Ashley Babbitt",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Could you even imagine, first of all, if the election had gone the other way, there obviously would be much, much, much, much, much more widespread left-wing violence, just look at the cities before the election, cities boarded up their windows",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why did they do that? Why did Los Angeles board up its windows? Why did New York board up its windows? Why did DC board up its windows? Did they do it because of all those Trump supporters in those extremely left-wing cities? Did they do it because they thought Trump supporters were going to riot and loot the shops? No, they did it because they knew what BLM would do because they'd been doing it for six weeks, six months rather",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what Antifa would do, they'd been doing it longer than six months",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So no question about that,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Same as true of the woman who was killed,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Very, very sad that this woman was killed, Ashley Babbitt",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why you don't riot in the Capitol,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" I mean, you're putting yourself in a dangerous situation",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I suspect a lot of people who were there thought, well, look, these police went so easy on BLM",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no way that they would go harsher on us,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But I do know if you have somebody like George Floyd he's got a rap sheet, what a decade long or something",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Or even somebody like Jacob Blake, Jacob Blake is, at least with George Floyd, you'd say, well, maybe the police officer should have gotten up sooner and maybe the whole situation was a little strange",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Jacob Blake, it's like an open and shut case",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The guy was refusing arrest,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The cops were called because he was allegedly sexually assaulting this woman,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He walks out,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He won't surrender,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's getting taste,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He keeps walking and he reaches for a knife on the cops and finally they shoot him,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And even he is, he's called an unarmed black man and an act of unjustist by active injustice, rather, by the Washington Post",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're still seeing this kind of nonsense,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So of course, of course, it's certainly, I guess you'd say it's a double standard, but it's not what the left would probably just say is what Herbert Marques wrote in the 1960s",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's called the father of the new left,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He wrote an essay called Repressive Tolerance,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he was very honest,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He said, liberating tolerance means that we need to censor the right and we need to encourage speech on the left",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that's what they would believe,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's not exactly hypocrisy so much as hierarchy as the law professor Adrienne from you would sometimes say, it's hierarchy",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, you know, Marques, it was very honest about it",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I actually sort of think if you want to fight back against leftist politics, political correctness, woke is some cancel culture",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Use whatever term you want,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You actually would do very well to read these left wing intellectuals,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" I think they actually understand this sort of stuff, speech, censorship, politics",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" How do we young conservatives give hope to our elder conservatives who have lost hope or is hope lost? You know, a great priest friend of mine has this famous sangre says the difference between a Scottish optimist and a Scottish pessimist",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is that a Scottish pessimist says things can't get any worse? And the Scottish optimist says, oh, yes, they can",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think conservatives are kind of like this too,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, conservatives know that things are going to get much, much worse",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And there's, it kind of cuts away at this distinction of optimistic and pessimistic",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's hope,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But our hope ultimately is not in this world,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Our hope ultimately is in the next world,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We know how this world's going to end,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's not going to look all that pleasant in the final days,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So our hope is in the next world,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now that doesn't mean we should throw up our hands and throw in the towel in this world,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But we should know we're not going to have utopia on earth,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It ain't going to happen,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The great conservative consolation, of course, is that reality reasserts itself in the end",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so no matter how insane things get, you know, eventually, utopias have to crack because utopias are no place",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what it means,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it can take a very long time,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It can take many lifetimes,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so we're going to have to fight back,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But for your grandpa, I would just, I would say, put your hope in the knowledge that politics is going to get a lot worse",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then it's going to get better,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's going to get worse again,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's going to get better,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And it's not even, by the way, necessarily an abridgment of freedom of religion so much as a shifting of the religious standards",51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We always hear there are all these kinds of different expressions on this point,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The politics is downstream of culture,51352_The Michael Knowles Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Peter McCullough coming up soon but to tie into the whole debt ceiling adultery betrayal Trump actually saying he doesn't care about it like every other important issue and everything we're at on the one hand where we face this onslaught on the other hand there is this budding bottom up movement I think we are seeing some degree of backlash people did call their congressman we are seeing the boycotts against the rainbow jihad be more successful than they've ever been but here's where the rubber meets the road we do not have at a leadership level a movement,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
at a leadership level to connect the dots to connect the fire and put that led down radiance to where the target needs to be see ultimately we face a crisis of truth that no matter what comes out and more information is coming out exposing the debt ceiling thing was a fraud the covid stuff was a fraud the vaccines were dangerous as hell but the policies don't change is like there's no way we're all looking at this debt deal and it got worse every day the more we found that about it there's no way I mean there's,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
gonna be a whole sale rebellion but less than a third of the Republicans voted against it they got what they wanted even though more Democrats actually supported it than Republicans which is all we need to know but nothing changes and this is what I saw yesterday when I saw the headline it was kind of washed away in the news cycle that the FDA gave full approval to Pfizer's RSV shot and I'm thinking after everything we know about what Pfizer did never has a private company been so empowered by government to commit such an atrocity against life,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
and liberty in its most literal sense and yet they could come along with a new trial oh it's 67 to 85 percent effective against RSV here's another shot for you knowing that there's nothing we can do to stop it just like the debt ceiling betrayals like come on Kevin McCarthy cannot get away with that yeah you can because we don't have a serious movement with a serious leader as we see we have this guy writing these psychotic screeds about DeSantis's name every day sounds like a retard so we don't have a critical mass we don't have,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
the sons of liberty we don't have a Sam Adams we have a bunch of vaccine injured retards running the show on the fake right that's too busy embracing rainbow Ramadan month and we're left with this onslaught against our society of this most disgusting agenda the salt on our bodies with every seniors now gonna be convinced to get this death shot wherever you turn we don't have a team on the field which is why no matter how compelling our case is for or against something the policies won't change until we get some sort of political leadership to,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
"lead that fight and I don't have easy answers to this I really don't not show what to do with it but it's amazing how Pfizer could come out right in the open right in the open in their own data their own data shows that it would take 16,000 doses to prevent 22 RSV cases and seniors remember seniors already got it so it's gonna be mild doesn't know evidence even in their data that it prevents death that there is death because there is no RSV death among seniors meanwhile the vaccine group had 22 more serious adverse events",6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
than the placebo it had 14 more severe adverse events and three more deaths so there's no evidence that prevented an RSV death but in their own lying data imagine a company that literally lied about everything from my or Corditis to strokes to fetal maternal problems and menstrual bleeding everything from A to Z they could put out another more lying data but even their lying trial and by the way Ventavia that same company that that fabricated the entire clinical trial for them coordinated it they also did this one and they could show more all-cause mortality in the,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
vaccine group and I forget the amount of time but it was a short follow-up time one month one month it was I'm looking at it now table eight one month follow-up okay so that's that's a big deal in one month to have three more deaths you can imagine it gets worse over time and also the negative efficacy kicks in over time like we've learned with these respiratory viral vaccines and it's like it doesn't matter I mean this is a big deal this will be given to every senior at a doctor's office at a pharmacy and then,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
in short order will go down the totem pole of the age stratified approvals and eventually be placed on the child vaccination schedule so we're gonna talk about that with Dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 McCullough as well we are nowhere closer to having Republicans focus on that so let me just say the good news let me read to you a quote this from Olivia Beaver she's the political white not White House Capitol Hill corresponded Randy Weber who's supposedly a Freedom Caucus member but never sides of the Freedom Caucus he said he thought the debt deal was good but that he and his wife were inundated back in their district well I would like to think that people don't understand that this bill does actually move the ball forward they're not getting,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
it and so they're saying don't vote for it so if I listen to my constituency I'll be voting no so I always tell you guys calling your congressman and organizing other people to do it and certainly a state legislature because you'll have more of a outside share impact you'll be more impactful than than even voting so this along with the boycotts is starting but imagine if we had the top 50 shows and voices doing what I do so I would encourage you to still call your members look at the ones who voted for it there are,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
71 really would have been 72 Lauren Bobert couldn't make it or something so on the one hand there were 72 Republicans would have voted no only 46 Democrats voted no you saw Hakim Jeffries the minority leader of the Democrats working hand in glove with McCarthy the uni party was on full display full display before our eyes and by the way 29 Republicans voted against the rule so that forced him to come to Akim and get Democrats to vote for the rule and Axias is reporting that he promised them earmarks he promised them favors to do it,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
so he sold us down the river to get Democrats to support such a horrible thing there will only be a handful of Democrats voting against it in the Senate and by the way even the ones voting no it's just kind of like because there are so many provisions in it so it's always easier to vote no you don't want to be hit by your base for even cosmetically voting against something that could be portrayed as cutting welfare benefits but it's not like even the AOC and Bernie Sanders types are hopping mad at it it's on full,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
display in front of your eyes whether it's vaccines whether it's the transgender jihad whether it's obviously the debt ceiling and the spending and the weaponization of government this entire conservative movement and Republican party is fake what do we do about it that is what I would challenge my colleagues with what do we do about it it's just unreal here is a clip of Donald Trump he was finally asked on a Iowa radio show what do you think about the debt ceiling deal take a listen here there's a lot going on in our country and there's a,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
lot of things we need to discuss the debt ceiling has just passed I think it's a horrible deal but I don't know what you think well it is what it is it was going to pass and then plenty of votes and then we'll get it done permanently and properly so here it is what it is was gonna pass they had the votes he sounded he wasn't too interested in it but if you look at his facial expressions in the video because there's a video of it this is how he governed this is what he did when,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
he was present it's like yeah you know that's the votes let them do what they do yeah okay I'll sign whatever you give to me the notion that this man has somehow changed and learned his lesson if anything he's gotten worse again it is indefensible from any MAGA America first populist conservative any perspective to support this guy it is indefensible I'm sick of my colleagues like I like them both this like fake gay neutrality that they're putting on you know what I mean give me a break take a freaking stand for once no one's perfect but,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
between the two it's night and day on every issue that matters give me a break but that's where we are now anyway obviously following this debt ceiling deal I will tell you we're gonna have major problems with the dollar with we're gonna have a repo crisis from this like we did last time they raised the debt ceiling now is the time to diversify with gold as they talk about fake diversity this month talk about financial diversity birch gold makes it easy to convert an IRA or 401k into an IRA in precious metals here's what you need,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Peter McCulloch doesn't need much of an introduction to this audience it's obviously been a fixture in the medical freedom movement notorious for fighting for early treatment fighting for truth about the vaccines fighting for informed consent but one of the things I think we've all discovered throughout this fight is that covid likely wasn't the first go-around of this mass psychosis among the medical profession where they will literally do what's antithetical to the Hippocratic oath and it certainly is not the last time as we're seeing with RSV shots with the monkey pox shots all of these rushed,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
vaccines that are prima facia problematic have a negative cost benefit matrix and they just get approved but then there's other aspects of this so we have a lot of these trends and civilization and typically you'll have trends with physical health mental health over time people become sicker with certain illnesses and there's often a reason for it but then you have a scenario where according to CDC over a period of two years the number of high schoolers who identify as transgender has tripled then you have every every major hospital medical association promoting castration mutilation hormone this cutting,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
off breasts there and I'm thinking what this can't this can't be true and then we have all these trends with autism we have all these trends with mental illness now you have to see what's connected what's not but dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 McCulloch has actually been working on a theory of medical malfeasance that runs much deeper than what we saw with COVID and clearly it's deeper than just the code vaccine there's problems with other vaccines that we've been lied to but also their mentality with this transgenderism and what they're doing and not doing and how much does that tie into mental illness how much does that even tie into this mass violence we talked about this school shootings certainly they're not exclusively transgender but we've seen a lot of it that's been covered up by the media so dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
 McCulloch has really branched out in terms of his research his thoughts he has a terrific sub-stack courageous discourse it's really a must read every day in your inbox you could follow him at p underscore McCulloch MD on Twitter dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 McCulloch it's been way too long welcome back to Blaze Media well thanks for having me and thanks for all your courage out there I tell you what you've been a crusader for truth and so many of us feel connected in this battle I can tell you as a practicing internist and cardiologist like any doctor now we are becoming very familiar with LGBT and with the T being transgender since the rise of transgenderism it's actually in our medical practices now so it's ubiquitous so so here's the thing I thought in my mind I never looked for,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
any medical physical explanation to me it was very simple we never had social media before this generation and now you have the ability to make something ubiquitous you can make a fat ubiquitous for example in three seconds everyone could do something so unnatural as covering their breathing holes with masks you know in the most absurd situations you could have people obsessing about Ukraine that they couldn't even find on a map in three seconds so you could have people you could have a fad now with kids with rising mental illness here's here's a thing you're really you,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
know you might not be a man after all maybe you're a woman maybe you're this if you tell people that it's cool to dress up like a cat and a dog on TikTok there's no question you'd be able to gain a lot of traction with that over time so to me that explains a lot of it but but you have a working theory that I wanted you to share with the audience a pandemic of mental contagion autism and the rise of transgenderism take it from there you know I asked the question as an epidemiologist are two,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
exploding epidemics are they related and the two epidemics are the explosion of autism when I was a kid the rate of autism was one in ten thousand the CDC now says it's one in thirty six there is no childhood illness that is more rapidly epidemic than autism which is a severe disorder it's a neuropsychiatric disorder to forever influences that child the rest of their lives family members there's quite a spectrum of autism from being severely disabled unable to leave the house you know needing full-time 24 by seven care to to being mainstreamed but with what's called,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
autism spectrum disorder where there's some features of it but child is able to go to school and then ultimately enter society independently and the other epidemic as you mentioned is transgenderism and while there have always been homosexual males who want to dress as a woman that was relatively rare among homosexual males and there were always women who may have tendencies towards men what has really evolved almost it seems like in the last you know year or so is an absolute explosion of transgenderism to the point of it influencing marketing various brand trends etc so I asked,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
the question could autism be related to transgenderism and sure enough Vander Miesen and colleagues published about ten years ago from the Netherlands an observation that 20 percent of young people in Dutch transgender clinics had a clinical diagnosis autism 20 percent and so there's a giant spectrum beyond those with clinical autism called autism spectrum disorder and so it I said oh my Lord this is an incredible overlap and then study started to hit one after another one this paper by warrior and colleagues I thought was very important and what they demonstrated was that and let me get,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
"the exact citation for you warrior and colleagues which was published in nature communications a really high-level journal analyzed 641,860 individuals with gender dysphoria so that so gender dysphoria is the clinical diagnosis for which transgender hormones and surgeries are prescribed and they assess people of gender disorder for autistic tendencies with some standardized scores and there was about four different I'm sorry about five different transgender scores used and guess what those with gender dysphoria are off the Richter scale testing out for autism Wow so it's not that every woman who has this gender dysphoria is necessarily autistic but",6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
"a good number of them are a good number then seem to be right very large overlap and then more data started to come in which was I think very very disturbing so a paper was published by by Mendes and colleagues and it was a literature review describing 2,921 murders murders where an LGBT person was the victim this is in the peer-reviewed literature this is absolutely stunning 16 papers in total and in general it their perpetrator is generally a male the victim is generally a male and about 40% of the time they knew each other and so",6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
that paper was out there and then to really bring it home was a paper of mortality and this just hit the mainstream mainstream this was in JAMA journal the American Medical Association first author is Sarah Jackson titled the paper is analysis of mortality among transgender and gender diverse adults in England and this is alarming suicide homicide death from accidental poisoning many fold higher in transgender compared to normal men or normal women so mortality is higher and again that was you know published in a very high-level journal and the burden of psychiatric care is much higher after,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
the transgender procedure so so this paper was published by Heisel Gorman and colleagues from the uniform services University in Bethesda titled the paper mental health care utilization of transgender youth before and after gender affirming treatment so to actually take the hormones and surgery worsens the psychiatric problem and so finally I think the coup de gras on this Daniel you're gonna be astounded by this because states are moving forward with legislation to ban hormones and surgery in the youth to show to ban this you know nobody has a problem in adulthood if someone wants to whatever they,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
want to do an adulthood but during childhood to ban this with this idea that you know autistic children in a sense are being preyed upon by this transgender industry but so because this legislation came out I was astounded to realize this and I posted this on May 4th that the the autism self-advocacy network ASAN condemns restrictions on gender affirming care they they came out with a statement on this so this is an advocacy network these are largely adults with autism or other concerned individuals and so it's basically saying the autistic people want gender change so you,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
know this brings it full circle here I think it's conclusive that that transgenderism is driven by the epidemic of autism the autistic people want this and the question on the table is should it continue because it increases the burden of psychiatric disease and increases mortality so obviously increasing mortality you know when someone is this severely mentally ill they're gonna be prone to suicide and things like that and certainly when you start screwing with the hormones obviously you have the concurrent rise in general mental illness depression to me it's not a surprise that this same hockey stick,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
that you're seeing the last few years with the rise of people saying I'm the opposite gender suddenly you also have the just the explosion of you know 25 30 percent rates of clinical depression among among teenagers just just a perfect storm obviously the lockdowns you know certainly aggravated that all going on but you referenced another extra point there that you brought up in the wake of that you know shooting in Nashville of that Christian school by this this female who said she was a really a male and you have this theory about hormones this hormone treatment,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
creating this undercurrent of violence that has not been noted could you be it could you elaborate on that a little bit well you know as I pointed out the Mendez studies shows that LGBT are the victims of homicides in a large number but the the Jackson analysis that was in JAMA points out that both suicide and homicide are causes of death in these individuals and some of these suicides occur in the context of mass murders and we just need the case example now and I think we're close to half a dozen or more of transgender individuals,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
young ones actually becoming the perpetrator in a mass murder in the case you you pointed out and and so there remember autism is a neuro psychiatric illness meaning there's neurological and psychiatric aspects to it and there are certainly outbursts of anger inability to control various you know emotional states now add into this hormones particularly the post-pubular hormones which are straight androgens or estrogens you know that makes even normal people irritable so you can imagine having the neuropsychiatric disorder or some other related disorder and then hormonal manipulation creating this situation where you know it's sad for everyone,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
because in these mass murders many times the perpetrator loses their life as well and this I think the Jackson analysis is so disturbing that you know it increases mortality all the way around it's it honestly if there was another surgery or hormones that were increasing mortality they'd be taken off the market so so you're saying we have an autism bubble that no one denies you have a broad mental illness skyrocketing across the spectrum and then we have this rise in violence okay we have this rise in you know these mass shootings now obviously you know you,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
take this whole gender dysphoria out of it you still have there's clearly this culture of violence we could just talk about the way our youth are raised and just this lack of wholesome life there's so much to say on that but but you rightly noted it is covered up by the media there is a growing percentage of these cases that actually are from from an gender dysphoric individual and more than we think so you're saying you take a 15 year old girl a 17 year old girl and you and and especially if they're already autistic I,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
don't know if that was the case in Tennessee and then you juice them up with hormones well what happens yeah it's not it's certainly not good the Jackson analysis again JAMA open network January 30th of 2023 so it's pretty recent data let's just take compared to normal women just use the example of the I believe it was Nashville where it was a transgender woman a girl who wanted to be a man you know the the risk there is the relative risk was 5,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
62 greater risk of suicide or homicide and the confidence intervals were 2,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
65 to 11,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
91 that's highly statistically significant it's very hard in the psychiatric literature to ever achieve statistical significance so these are striking results and the fact that they're coming out in the peer reviewed scientific literature where you know in general medicine doesn't have an opinion on people's choice you medicines a very diverse you know always have had equity inclusion people make their own choices as a doctor you know I take care of drug abusers well I don't go if if you didn't get the shot yeah I take it and they weren't so diverse I know but listen you,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
listen I take care of drug abusers I take care of prisoners I take care of people of all walks of life homosexual heterosexuals bisexuals I mean that's just medicine we see people of all walks of life and I don't think anybody has any problem with someone's choice however when when physicians are prescribing the hormones in doing the surgery and the result is a transgendered person and the result shows that there is harm it has to be stopped it just has to be you know it took with it from the time we knew smoking caused lung cancer,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
it took doctors 40 years to ultimately come around to doctors used to smoke they smoked in the operating room from the time we knew the opioids were addictive and could be life threatening it's taken over 20 years to get this opioid pandemic under control is largely prescription opioids that doctors prescribe doctors are not quick to recognize systematic errors and delivery of care and this one this one I think is going to be shut down honestly before the the doctors shut it down themselves there was a recent paper in New England Journal of Medicine highlighting the fact,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
that there will be severe penalties for programs that continues papers published by Mallory and colleagues and it was in Gemma May 18th 2023 and they indicated that boy states have legislation all over the place moving forward there is going to be bans on care with clear legislative attraction in it highlights everything that's going to happen the states include Alabama Arkansas Arizona and Texas 118 bills across 31 states total they're all going to move forward 11 bills have been passed into law Arkansas Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kentucky Mississippi South Dakota Tennessee Utah and West Virginia and yeah,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
and listen to this yeah Daniel listen to this 15 states have laws and policies that ban gender affirming care for minors with the stipulations the state bans physicians who continue to face four major direct penalties one medical license disciplinary action to private right of legal action against physicians which can include extensions on malpractice and statutes and limitations three civil actions against this the states can take against physicians and four felonies felony provisions this was in New England Journal of Medicine Wow no I mean that is definitely something I think because it's just so jarring cutting someone's,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
genitalia off it doesn't take a doctor to understand how systemically damaging that is but I think this is a good way to transition into the second half and really we need a whole show just for this but you mentioned something very profound that it takes generations for the medical profession to correct an error and let's talk about what could be the greatest lie of the century I think you and I are in the same boat you as a famed cardiologist published and so much so much medical literature and me as a layman we're you know it,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
kind of never questioned it we back we were born with with the notion that there's vaccines and okay this vaccine that vaccine all right you know you just kind of put in the body and it stimulates an antibody response and okay you know everyone's happy you're now immune and never really thought about it and then you know I heard people over the years saying well you know vaccines is caught all cause autism like that's crazy of course it's debunked it's debunked and I thought that really up until um covid and then even when the vaccine the,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
covid shot started coming out and we're like oh my gosh this is poison I had this cognitive distance yet this thing is really I mean this is like a bio weapon but everything else is amazing but then is 2021 went on and I had people like you and Dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Cole and all these other people on and we started learning immunology and epidemiology in real time so we're able to really learn these things I was like wait a minute I'm learning a lot about antibodies they're not all good there's God made the right type in the right amount in the right classification in the right location like well wait a minute the stuff we're seeing about the IgG 4 and the tolerating rather neutralizing and the auto antibodies and all these syndrome autoimmune syndromes we see in theirs I'm thinking wait a minute what's with all these,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
other respiratory viral vaccines and even other vaccines that are ever increasing and then to bring the show kind of full circle we have this explosion of autism which you know could come from neurological inflammation which we certainly see this crosses the blood brain barrier we see the explosion of the allergies I'm a lot younger than you Dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 McCullough but still we never had peanut allergy issues when I was in school it started like abruptly shortly after my time as a school age kid you have all these allergies all these auto immune that the colitis and the the um well these stomach auto autoimmune stuff exploding and there's no good explanation here's the question for you is it does it take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that taking a kid and just shoving an ever-increasing amount of uncontrolled antibody spikes might be problematic for some people you know when I was a kid we had the,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
oral polio and we had diphtheria tetanus pertussis and smallpox so basically vaccinated against five things now it turns out that diphtheria and pertussis are easily treated with a Z-pack if we would have had a zithermize back then we wouldn't have needed that and then tetanus is largely managed with wound care there is neonatal tetanus but that occurs before that you know the the baby has a chance to defend against it so a maternal vaccination is thought to handle that and then of course polio which which could could be devastating that's pretty much what we have and,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
"as I mentioned the rate of autism one in 10,000 now today a child today receives 72 shots 72 different shots that's before SARS-CoV-2 the COVID shots which add a lot more because they're every six months I think it's up over a hundred and about 16 different diseases with new ones being added all the time including recently the rest choice and social virus so it's causing all of us to re-review the data so here's just one paper just one paper Gayer and Gayer published from an early paper from the VAERS system this is long before COVID it's",6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
published in 2002 the title of the paper is an analysis of the occurrence of convulsions and death after childhood vaccination so convulsions and deaths so we we you know we're not even talking about autism we're just talking about something that occurs immediately with these shots and what they found is that the more shots that are given together so diphtheria pertussis tetanus together as opposed to separate shots markedly increases the risk and and and then the time at which these occur is strongly related to you know the outcome so if they have been closer and closer to,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
the time of vaccination the relative risks are become even higher in terms of association like 60 relative risk of 62 which is which is through the roof and what what the Gayer and Gayer is is saying is basically listen this is this is real there are kids who die and in this analysis that sadly there were as I recall I believe there was I believe there was over a thousand deaths so you know this occurred over a long period of time but you know we have a situation where papers like this have been published in the,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
literature there's about 80 papers or so publishing in the literature suggesting vaccines could be related to autism what's most convincing are the vignette papers so the vignette is there's a normal child comes in gets six different vaccines at one six different antigens at once has a febrile seizure doesn't die but then from that point forward the child is autistic and there are many of those vignettes published you go on social media and mothers will tell you that all the time and I think what's going on those because usually talking about a kid a few months old,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
so you don't have much of a baseline go off of but the mothers do the mother the eye tracking is different the breastfeeding becomes different suckling response to the environment and the mothers believe they can tell that they can tell a difference and then on top of that we have a growing literature which is very interesting about going natural going natural meaning that there are parents who say listen we're not going to take any shots now interestingly the parents who decide to go natural tend to be older and they tend to have another child with autism,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
so when the next one comes there a bit wait it turns out those are the two risk factors for autism older adults and siblings with autism so here we have a child that who's already predisposed autism and I can tell you in all the studies done so far going natural that is getting no vaccines has a much lower rate of autism and neuropsychiatric disorders asthma allergic dermatitis need for tympanostomy tubes a pharyngitis it's it's clear that natural is better there's multiple studies Paul Thomas published one hooker and Miller published another multiple pediatric practices you know and,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
looking at this concept so in my analysis so far I you'll see a bunch of these come out of my subject I don't think it's any particular vaccine that is the smoking gun for autism but it looks like the process of hyper vaccination that is it's the multiplicity and it's the multiplicity of antigenic exposures with the right susceptibility the cytokines are the inflammatory mediators they that you know quickly rise they penetrate the blood bane barrier quickly some of them are neurotoxic and they look like they forever change some of these kids to becoming like autistic where,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
it was all at once like like Aaron Siri always says that you know with the kids it's gray it's gradual and be generally they're given to babies and you have so many people that either the person themselves say you know I just don't feel right I just haven't felt right since I got the shots or their relatives are like is that guy okay either physically and I know you've written a lot about this there's um our friend Aaron has put togethers the 29 case studies on psychosis from the covid shots but but with the traditional kind,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
of childhood schedule shots you can't really the kid can't articulate that and it's not as apparent but now that we understand the mechanism I'm thinking like yeah I mean you got all that inflammation from the overstimulation of the immune system and now that I understand the relationship between that and pathogens but also cancers autoimmune allergy response and then yes the neurological which we see all over theirs and all over the case studies so here's my concern I don't doctor mccoll I don't understand how this is not the biggest public policy issue this affects every human being,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
I got four kids unfortunately we're already over most the hump but but we're running around from one pediatrician to another and when we think we found a good one that they harass the heck out of you make you feel like you're a dirtbag for questioning it you're stupid it's all good any make any manufacturer any amount but the more I study I look back even to things that I thought were like gospel I mean like the pertussis one and by the way now they're they're loading it on pregnant women more than ever because in 2016 they,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
expanded the indemnification to shots used during pregnancy so there's a torrent of them and they even pressure the the husband to often get another DPT for pertussis and I look at the data and I see more negative efficacy like we saw with covid I see immune suppression we see with a lot of the flu shots the T cells tamping down there's been tons of studies over the last 15 years on that that we never noticed on which make a lot of sense we see a lack of rationale we see a lack of all cause mortality benefit,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
and and and you know to be fair I was always saying oh the covid shots we never did anything like that it's rushed and the manufacturers were like we've never had bigger trials than ever and they were actually right they're fraudulent but they were bigger I look at like HIB and some of this stuff and or HEP be I mean they had like a few day follow-up with this stuff well yeah I mean hepatitis B is the is I think the most egregious giving it on the first day of life the registration trials were just a,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
few hundred children and there was only five days of follow-up and the only clinical indication where as a doctor I would say a child needs a newborn child needs it is is with a mother who has active hepatitis B who's actively IV drug abusing which is very rare but for every baby born to be blasted with the hepatitis B shot on the day of birth is is simply overkill you know a paper is going to come out of my sub-stack regarding homophilus influenza B which by the way there's almost no disease that's had a greater reduction,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
coincident with the with the introduction of vaccines as homophilus influenza B it's a it's a bacteria a encapsulated bacteria introduced in 1985 and the rates of invasive disease plummeted but I asked the question do people still get the illness and does the vaccine really protect them and I a paper by suitors and colleagues from the CDC published in 2018 summarized it now remember the vaccine only stops homophilus influenza serotype B it doesn't stop any of the other serotypes it turns out that only 1,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
8% of all homophilus is serotype B and of those there were 77 cases reported it turns out that 73,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
9% of people who got them were either fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated they were following the vaccine schedule so you know while it may have had a broad public health impact you know we can't look at somebody in the eye and tell them they're protected here when the majority of people who get the disease you know are vaccinated I used to think this stuff was like a coat of iron I you know the vaccine was synonymous with a cure and the more we look at things you know this concept of a leaky waning efficacy it's pretty,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
ubiquitous it might have been really egregious with this one and particularly respiratory viral ones are never really successful but you look at a lot of these mumps and measles outbreaks we've seen it we've seen it obviously the monkey pox is a joke that recent cluster in Chicago I believe was at nine out of twelve or something like that were you know just got the two doses of Johnios this whole thing we've been lied to and then also just the rationale a lot of people say are you anti-vax or pro-vax and to me it's like saying are,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,HS
you pro-surgery are you pro-kimotherapy well you know I mean rarely is something good for all people at all times I think of something like German measles I never even realized this that German measles really aside from pregnant women you know giving birth to a fetus and potentially being problematic to a fetus no man should ever get this I mean before you even look at safety and efficacy just the rationale for it um isn't isn't that true that a lot of this stuff is not necessary for everyone it's true that I remember as a kid that German,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
"measles also known as rubella they had a big push for rubella vaccination well it's compelling for women as they enter the child bearing years we used to have 20,000 cases of congenital rubella now we're done like two cases a year so the vaccine is very effective but it should only be restricted for women as they entered the child bearing years there's no reason for a boy to even take the rubella so that's MMR that's actually the R in MMR measles is a non-threatening illness you know mumps is worth a discussion there is mumps orchitis and sterilization",6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
that can happen in boys but doesn't happen in girls you know we have to look at each one I I think what's gonna happen is you know 72 vaccine shots plus COVID-19 over a hundred it's too much they're just getting started I mean you got nipa and Zika and I mean they have everything in the pipeline um and obviously the RSV thing really scares me because that was the original ADE shot with negative efficacy and and even Fauci just published a couple months ago admitting that the respiratory viral vaccines are all leaky that they just don't,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
don't address the mucosal and and they're just there's no backstop well Daniel let me say that I can tell you as a doctor we're gonna need to do risk stratification so respiratory syncytial virus in you me our kids and our grandparents is nothing it's honestly like a cold at most we have to do a nebulizer but RSV and a kid with cystic fibrosis could be severe so we're gonna need to do risk stratification some people will need vaccines but not everybody needs a routine schedule I think what needs to go away is the routine schedule and,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
vaccines need to be given according to risk stratification there needs to be a medical necessity and a clinical indication but this idea that you either you're either in or you're out and parents being made to feel uncomfortable by pediatricians that needs to go away because right now it's too much and we need to do risk stratification this is what I fear but you know getting back to the beginning of our discussion with the with the castration stuff it just so I guess evident the draconian nature of it so it has drawn sharp backlash that has spread,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
not just from the people but actually to the political representatives at least in you know the so-called red states but I look at what the second half of our discussion here and forget about the other shots I mean those are sacred whenever we try to address them in legislation and when I'm talking about just the mandates mandating them it was a non-starter in every state but even the COVID shots despite everything that has come out about it itself evident negative efficacy attacks every organ system every corner of the body potentially there's only to my knowledge one,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
state where the health department is putting out informed consent you know dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Joe latipo in Florida putting out information warning about the risks and and while most people still aren't getting it at this point they're on to it but if a woman becomes pregnant that's kind of a status change the OBGs are pressuring them and I'm thinking here's the thing certain things are like you said a concern for newborns RSV is a concern um rebel is a concern but what's gonna happen now that you take a pregnant woman we all know the European medicines agency documents seem to show that Pfizer knew about um the the intervention spreading,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
through the placenta you take a woman and now you give them flu RSV COVID another MMR another DPT and who knows who knows what else what does that portend for the fetus no one can know I mean any injection that a mother takes is risky um I would say this that anything that can cause a fever in a mother that just put that alone a fever a fever in a mother can cause precipitous delivery of the baby it can actually cause a miscarriage or a stillbirth it's too risky so the benefit of any of these shots,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
in women is far outweighed by the risk of losing the baby and and so many mothers are going to decide to go natural in pregnancy because it just makes a lot of sense and a recent Kaiser family foundation survey suggests parents are in a much higher proportion gonna go natural on the childhood vaccine schedule and decide later on you know there may be compelling the kids go to college to get the meningococcal vaccine it may be compelling if they go into health care to get hepatitis B vaccine they're gonna basically opt to go natural because they've,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
lost trust in the CDC ASEP group because of this hyper vaccination adding COVID and they don't seem to show any concern over safety now that's what scares me because you want to tell me hey there's some risk whatever that's believable but when you start saying everything is good for everyone and needed at all times there's just something funny there final question here if I make you king for a day what is the one policy change that you feel could bring out the truth and up end this entire racket but I think the big policy change that,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
would happen immediately is we would outlaw any mandates associated with vaccines any so any at the school level K through 12 college for any vaccine routine vaccines COVID-19 and so if vaccines became completely elective then we can let them you know stand on their own merits and the evolving data what makes everybody uncomfortable is a mandate and also the the indemnification I think is the big one every day you see Honda you know recalling different airbags because they're on the hook for liability and often you wonder how dubious those recalls are whereas with with this I,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
mean it's an all you could eat buffet and there is no incentive for them to make this stuff safer I mean I'm just looking with my mouth open watching these a sip and verboc hearings and they'll openly admit that yeah we don't know if there's all cause mortality benefit we don't really see seniors getting sick from RSV so we can't tell yeah there's a signal for Guillain-Barre yeah someone died in the you know GSK Pfizer trial or GSK RSV trial and the Pfizer shot is pretty similar but we'll approve that anyway and it's like nothing seems,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
to ever matter what is it gonna take is it doesn't have to start from the medical profession does it have to start from the political realm does it have to start from parenting I just I feel like there is more of an awakening because I'm an example of that well let me let me respond to what you said what makes people uncomfortable is a mandate they feel like they have to take it for some reason to go to school go to work and then if they take it if they're harmed there's no recourse there's no liability,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
there you know there's there's indemnification the manufacturer so I say if the mandates go first if you know we can't mandate that you swallow a pill or mandate you have a surgery we certainly can't mandate that someone takes a vaccine if the mandates drop and even if the liability protection is still there then people can make a choice and people can say listen if if if if there's there's no liability you know if there's no recourse if something happens I'm I'm probably not gonna take it it be similar to renting a pair of skis you may,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
say listen you know you rent the ski rental you know there's no there's no liability for the guy who makes the skis that you know you may not ski so people can make their own choices now the 1986 liability legislation said the vaccines have unavoidable harm and that's the reason why they have to have liability protection for the manufacturers because no one would take them and the vaccine manufacturers wouldn't they provide them because they have unavoidable harms but we have to address that that's really the the elephant in the room is the harms and one of,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS
the ways to make large numbers of people harmed go away is to have fewer number of people take the product there there has to be targeted protection for people at risk no absolutely and there has to be an honest discussion of what those risks are of the shots themselves boy we've come full of circles has been very enlightening folks you could still get the courage to face COVID-19 Dr,6214_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-06-01_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I know I'm not working unless Biden wins Like that's not a thing scientists do to my knowledge,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think so,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think he's probably saying I'm gonna dump a bunch of money into the research right,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

and which polls to dismiss and which ones not to dismiss and he's usually right He was pretty close on the election last time if I'm not mistaken and This time he has really put about a year's worth of work into developing a system that takes into consideration 30 different metrics can you go through any of those stoot to so we understand sure like I mean you think everything from polling we use even some prediction market stuff we go through endorsements and The organization the campaigns are building You know the debates the media coverage You know fun-draising,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean really you know it's a couple of a few dozen and they actually grow we change We change the formula as it goes on so for example now polling is going to be less important Then something then you know a lot of these that indicate potential right potential is going to be more important now Then a week before an election when You know the polling is going to take into account all those things There's a lot of these candidates that people don't even know so you have to you There's a little bit of art,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
inside of there But overall it's a good way of like looking at the entire field and seeing who's going up who's going down who you know Over a long period of time you can kind of follow the race and make sense out of it because it's freaking chaotic I mean there's 24 people in here and how do you how do you even understand the entire field? So I'm not really interested in the 24 people,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

 What should I thought were pretty interesting? One was the biggest drop of any candidates since we started doing this And you may instinctively know that was a better work who Fell seven point four points the way we do this is all this giant formula basically spits out a number zero 100 So 100 would be in theory the perfect candidate that couldn't lose zero would be the worst candidate He is still kind of an oddly still the top tier of the race I mean people look at O'Rourke and say this guy's failed however He's still beating,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
about 18 candidates in polls like he I mean a lot of these cans I think the answer I think it's 17 candidates are at zero or 1% of the 24 so to your point like you're right a lot of these guys Really seem to have no chance to Well the Blazio says he's just getting started,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He is he's at zero, but he's just getting started He should start just getting finished But as of right now he is just getting started But I mean there are examples of this for example, I mean people to judge is one who was at zero and 1% for months And now is not you know people these things do change over time Elizabeth Warren looked done at one point during this campaign and and she's another big story in this She had a big rise and she's having a little bit of a moment I mean she's pulling",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
better and better and her approach seems to oddly be working with people Which is essentially going out and churning out a new a new policy proposal Every week or so that's going to get involved in another aspect of your life I want to get into this possibly at the bottom of the hour that she seems to have an answer for everything now not cancer Now Joe Biden is the answer for cancer Literally play that audio in this case,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

"before or this was after we did all these calculations But that you know, he's that's where he's focused most of his attention It's where he's polling best obviously if anyone who who wins Iowa is a real factor in the race sort of Automatically so the fact that he's right in there, you know, this is Biden's probably weakest early early state You know Sanders does okay there Warren does pretty well there and so does Buttigieg right now I mean if if Biden loses it'll mean something but if he's five eight ten points ahead It's not gonna mean",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
"it is this the number two will mean something because The media doesn't I don't think the media really wants Joe Biden to win but You still I mean the chances of of anybody else beating a ten point lead coming out of Iowa Well, I mean we had to step back here though",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's very early We haven't had one debate yet if you I mean Joe Biden yesterday came out and Promise that if he was elected he would cure cancer We all realized that Joe Biden is going to have 20 to 30 complete foot in mouth you know Face to rake sort of moments in this campaign The idea that he's gonna win by 20 points,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

is no he doesn't he doesn't he carved his own path and he held that But he is his own man I'm not sure Biden is his own man Maybe he is not sure he'll hold this path for very long At least after an election if he became president of the United States so he is he is sensing that these parties are not reflective of America as a whole because it leaves out the independent and I think there's a lot of people in America that are tired of the hard line The hard party line because they don't,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

 This is not a guy who he likes to say he was from you know Pennsylvania and he likes to kind of portray that those midwest values That's not what this guy ran on and the only reason people get confused with Biden and they think well Maybe he's sort of moderate is because he's old He he was taking liberal positions in 1978 that seemed conservative today because the country has massively moved to the left and so they go back and like well You said this in 1980 well in 1980 was like basically socialism What he was,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
recommending right right and so he's constantly been on the progressive edge this entire time and if he becomes president He will be at least Obama and who knows may go even further But he'll be he will be a very Liberal president that will try to change things up he might not be Sanders he might not be Warren But he's gonna be he don't don't let him fool you There's this idea that and there's several candidates that are attempting this in the race Which is moderation with a wink Right like basically they're saying I'm a moderate wink,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
wink Hey Democrats,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want you to know I'm not a moderate And you know that is something that Biden is attempting There's a bunch of candidates at the bottom of the field who are attempting as well and successfully But that's largely because Biden so far has been successful you have to imagine there's some lane for people who want a normal Biden sort of Democrat here as they see it and That lane is not going to be taken by Elizabeth Warner Bernie Sanders This is the Glenn Beck program,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

" It's not not well I would say but look at certain candidates on here and a couple that I would highlight would be Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg who have still massive gaps in their familiarity I mean like it's about a third of Democrats have never heard the name Pete Buttigieg before I Mean that is like we you know, we talk about this stuff every day So to to us this guy's been you know invading our lives for several months But I mean he is basically As far as candidates go pretty unknown I mean he's in",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
the area of you know Julian Castro as far as name recognition And he performs much better than Castro does as far as favorability when I was in music radio I used to pick the music for radio and I remember I look at research and you would look at the familiarity and there was a tipping point But if you had a pop song that was very very popular and people loved it but it was unknown to the mass You had a pretty good shot that once it was exposed it was going to It would take off So,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
that's the thing with Buttigieg Once people know who he is if his numbers out,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Do you look into that at all? Yeah, that's that's part of this You know, he's at 42 11 right now one important thing to understand though is Basically every candidate in this race has about 10% of people who will say they don't like them And it goes up from there like you know Bernie Sanders is almost 20 But you know Buttigieg is at that floor basically it's at 11% And he has 42% so a four to one ratio plus he has a third of the audience that has not even heard of him yet So if",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
he can continue those sorts of ratios He's in a really nice position and that's the thing about Buttigieg and why he performs so well on the power rankings is because he's got tons of room to grow Right and if he has deep passion not people who are like I like that Pete guy but deep passion And that much room to grow,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He is a real contender,45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I think the thing His big concern I would say just watching him as a candidate is He needs to he's one of these people and there's a few in this race I would say Cory Booker's kind of in this position I would say Chris Cuomo on CNN is this type of person who thinks they're a lot smarter than everyone else on earth and He definitely shows that from time to time He thinks an awful lot of himself and it comes through In his speeches and that will say good hurt him that will think the",45344_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-12_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Well, I am too",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I was born and raised in California, and I moved my young family from California to Indiana in April of 2020",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I knew it was right in the beginning of the pandemic,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 We didn't move because of the pandemic,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS

" And to be frank, I was just tired of fighting",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In California, you're just fighting all the time, and at the time, you didn't realize that some couple generations of kids had already been indoctrinated in academia and then in K through 12",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because California is always ahead of this, with the rest of the country seeing now",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And in Indiana, especially the Midwest, they'll go, it'll never happen here",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" What is, we're talking about casually 20 years of indoctrination, but what exactly was it that was being taught back then? And what is it that you say people are being indoctrinated with? Instead of teaching children in schools, high-rigger academics so that they could be independent, successful people, they were teaching them a certain brand of politics",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And when you do that, children will naturally grow up, of course, to vote one way",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's what happened to California, as everybody laughs at California about how do they get that way? Well, they got that way because they were indoctrinating the children to vote only one way and to vote no matter, even if it's to their own demise",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So when I saw the same thing in Indiana, I saw the same seeds being planted",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But I realized that there's nowhere for my children or anybody's children to run,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's nowhere to go,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" As I always allude to that, nobody's escaping the United States to go to Cuba in the middle of the night",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS

" 20 years ago, there wasn't as close a tie between voting for the Democratic Party and say, woke ideology",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And by no means is it a one-to-one thing, even today, or anything like that, even it's definitely much more prevalent",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But why? So it was voting that you noticed, or was the ideology that you noticed, or both, and they're always tied together, or what would do you mean by that? It was a lot of young people having opinions and thoughts that when questioned, they fall back to a lot of rhetoric and a lot of slogans",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So one of the things in California is the whole illegal immigration,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've convinced a generation to people that letting floods and floods of illegal aliens coming into the state has no impact on your finances or your safety or anything,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" No matter what facts, no matter the kind of statistics you show them, it doesn't matter",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

" When you're growing up there, you have no idea, because you grew up there",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when you start having kids and things of that nature, and you're trying to build businesses and things like that, you start to go, why is it like this here in California? And then you start traveling",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think about people in California, they don't travel very much",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's the funny thing, they just stay around California",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And when you start traveling in other parts of the country, you start to realize that that's not just, why is this state using their tax dollars so well? They don't have any of the GDP of California, but yet their roads are better, their infrastructure is better, this is better, that's better, schools are better, their safety is better",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why is that? And then that's what started me, started kind of working backwards",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, I understand",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then you decided, I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna go to Indiana",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You realize now that there's, as you say, there's nowhere else to go, so you kind of got busy doing something",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so it was like, okay, I must make educational materials that everyone can understand",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So how did that happen? Well, I had a small nonprofit in Indiana focused on a very local level",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I live in a very nice city called Carmel, Indiana",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even then, the school board and the schools are, they already have these ideologies in there",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The transgender ideology, the critical race theory that pawns in schools, the superintendent straight up lie and say, no, I don't think we do",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And we presented to them in school board, read it out loud, same thing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is in a really nice affluent place,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But then I also realized that it's something that's been blanket, is gonna blanket the whole entire country",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it's not a red state, blue state thing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And to be fair, it's not even a Democrat-Republican thing, it really isn't",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really just this attack on children's innocence,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a complete attack on separating children from families,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we can talk a little bit about how they're doing that and some of my tools and explaining that,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But really, that's really what it is",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My great grandfather ran from communism,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

" They were college kids, the Red Guard",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I see that that's what they're creating now with a lot of these kids,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's this revolutionist and to hate America, to hate American values and to drive a wedge between the family and you have to drive a wedge between parents and children first before you can get them to be revolutionists",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 That's throughout history,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's always the playbook,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That has to be the first step,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So how is that wedge being driven? In K through 12 today, the way they're driving that wedge is using both race and gender",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's coming through a mental health program called social emotional learning,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it sounds really great,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They use terms that all parents love like empathy and personal responsibility or responsible decision making,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All those things sound great,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they're doing what we call language contamination,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So for example, empathy",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You and I and probably everybody watching all the just normal people watching, we kind of generally know what empathy is",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What the schools today, what social emotional learning when they bring it in, what they mean is today when a little girl's in a breastroom or locker room and the boy walks in changing next to them, now they have to have empathy",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're not using empathy,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're weaponizing kindness and they're weaponizing empathy,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 So they're not using it in a way that we think,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now school counselors, and we did a big expose on school counselors and social workers, they're redefining two words, safe and abuse",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We always believe that safe or if a child's unsafe is because they're being neglected at home, beaten, starved, that kind of thing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You don't use their pronouns,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't let them have breast binders,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't let them take puberty blockers,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Then the schools are like, the parents aren't safe",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're causing the suicide,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 They're neglectful and abusive,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And now, but we're in a safe space",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what's interesting is that if you redefine a term, you don't have to change the laws",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You just expand on that existing law to be able to separate the kids from their families, which is why we see a lot of these stories now becoming more and more prevalent across the country",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like in Maine, there was a school, a social worker that gave a breast binder to a 13 year old",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have one in Wisconsin where they're transitioning a minor against their parents and there's a lawsuit there,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So on and on, you're seeing that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's happening due to the counselors and the social workers,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it's coming through the mental health program, social emotional learning",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So in a minute, we can go into more detail, but in a nutshell, that's how they're using to separate the kids from their family by sexualizing kids early",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when the parents disagree, because what parents wouldn't disagree with this, they use that to say they're unsafe and they're abusive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, because there are parents who are abusive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are parents who create unsafe situations at home,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just that basically what you're saying is that the concept of that now has been redefined to include people who are trying to instill a loving home,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But because it doesn't fit with the gender or race ideology specifically,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 Now they're the abusers,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, it would be like, let's say there are parents that goes, I don't ever feed my child fast food",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everything has to be freshly made,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, great",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But imagine if those parents, which is great, if they went to school and they wrote the policy and they said, if you feed your child McDonald's, you're abusive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The problem is with social emotional learning and all these really arrogant teachers and school board members and counselors and social workers, they believe they know better",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 They know better,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They want to push their idea of what good parenting is onto everybody else,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 But that's not what a government entity is supposed to do,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a public school,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If they are truly abusive, we already have programs existing that protect those kids",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is it a perfect system? No, of course not",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We see a lot of these terrible stories where the system does miss it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the answer isn't to do a blanket wide program in the schools and say all parents are abusive,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And to continually expand on that, that's how you separate children from their parents",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think when you hear about social emotional learning as a kind of multifaceted tool to kind of bring people into this way of thinking,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's just a survey,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's wrong with the survey? Yeah,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, the survey is how they continually do a self-fulfilling prophecy",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, I can talk about the data mining",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The data mining is actually very, very important",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's something that every parent can do,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Every parent should be getting their kids out of this data mining survey,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But before I talk about the survey, let's talk about why social emotional learning is so deceptive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I spoke earlier about empathy,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You use empathy, but then really it's about to get girls trying to get them to suppress their natural rejection of having a male in the locker room changing next to them",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But let's take another example of social emotional learning,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Responsible decision making,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You wouldn't disagree with that,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Who would disagree with that? Right? What parent do not want their children to have responsible decision making? We teach them that from a very young age, pick up your toys",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's responsible decision making through the lens of a critical race theorist,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It means that if you're white, when you become a voting age, you need to vote for things like reparations",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's your responsible decision making,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or you need to give up certain things because of white privilege,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And if you're not white, you need to be taking down the systems that are oppressing you and everybody else",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" Doesn't matter how successful you are, you're being oppressed",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 That's your responsible decision making,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's you being responsible,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me give you an example,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this is an analogy that I use for parents who are just kind of getting into this because a lot of this can be very nebulous, right? By design",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By design, yeah",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When parents go to schools and say you're pushing political indoctrination, you're pushing critical race theory",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you've probably heard this many times, you're not teaching it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're not teaching critical race theory,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm going to say they are correct,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are not teaching critical race theory,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 California is they actually have a critical race theory program before you graduate high school,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But most other states don't,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you teach critical race theory, it means that you have a class like fifth period critical race theory",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Parents can opt for kids out,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Kids don't have to take it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's fine,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not teaching kids what critical race theory is,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are teaching students on how to think and behave and live like a critical race theorist,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me give you this example,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's say you and I decided to start a private school,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you and I sit down and go, you know, our goal is to create world class mathematicians",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The students coming out of our private school are going to win the most Nobel Prize ever,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, in the mathematicians",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you and I sit down and that's our plan,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But of course, we can't sell it like that because most parents don't want to pay that much money for a private school unless it's a well-rounded private school",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we advertise it as a very high end private school,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We have sports, we teach history, we do science",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We do all those different things, right? But our school was structured",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In a way, we're as soon as the students walk in",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The hallways have math formulas and pictures of historical mathematicians,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Our teachers read during personal development,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They read books about how mathematicians have changed the world and how important math is,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You and I are sitting at these beautiful seats,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, that's engineered through math",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's engineered how we're holding our weight,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Students hold everything that we're looking at here,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's on math, angles, right? Cameras and things",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Teachers wear t-shirts with formulas when we have assemblies,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We bring in mathematicians from NASA, from big tech, from finance",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Then after a couple of years, parents come to you and I",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You're like, you're on Alvin",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I really like your school, but your school seems really heavily focused on math",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're like, no, no, no",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All we do is just teach your basic algebra, pre-cal, calculus, geometry",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, if you and I created a school like that, what are the chances of kids graduating high school, there's a K-312 private school, where all of them are extraordinarily good at math, better than the average person, even if they don't have an aptitude for it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the ones who have aptitude for it, they are going to go off and win Nobel prizes",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" Now, take everything I said and replace the word math and mathematician where critical race theory and critical race theorists",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're teaching children to live it and to be it and to think like one and to behave like one and to structure their whole life purpose, to push that mission",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So tell me about how school counselors, you were saying how they're the biggest purveyors of this",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I mean, that feels like a, you know, there's a lot of purveyors",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So why are school counselors so significant here? There's a lot of attention given to teachers and school board members superintendents, rightfully so",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, the teachers largely affect the culture of a classroom",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" School board members can sign a, they can spend the money like on data mining and things and I'll get back to the data mining",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They can sign the contracts for the teachers and stuff, but they don't generally impact a culture of a particular school",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They will impact kind of the school district, right? But they don't say that particular school board members are affecting that middle school",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the school counselors do,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The school counselors and the social workers, they're the ones in the break room, they're the ones in the back wagging their fingers at everyone if they're not using the right pronoun, not using the right slogans, whatever the slogan happens to be",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the American School Counselor Association, I'll refer to them as ASCA, A-S-C-A",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are the largest organization that trains all school all school counselors and social workers in K through 12,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have a chapter in all 50 states,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're the ones that drive the mission and the training and the objectives for school counselors and social workers,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They had an annual conference in July in Austin,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The conference was called No Limits, which by the way, we found that very obtuse when you're around kids all day and you call your conference No Limits",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We thought that was kind of on the nose,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But we made sure that we went and we grabbed their videos, their training, their speeches, their power points, their slides, or handouts",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because we knew that parents did not know that the counselors are completely ideologues today,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They still think that they're the nice guidance counselors when we all growing up that helped you with their academics,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Maybe you didn't feel so good, they talked a little bit, but they thought there was a real problem to bring your parents in to work with the parents and that's long gone and no more",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's hard to prove that,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we decided that we are going to use their own words and their own habitat to expose who they are,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We found so much,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Some of it was online, some of it's in that conference",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then since then, we found a lot of different things that they're, you know, all the webinars and things",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we created something called Behind Closed Doors,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if anybody wants to see them, if you go to courageisahabit",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
"org, this courageisahabit",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
"org, under school counselors, you'll see our Behind Closed Doors Expo say, and we're gonna do a lot more this year",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But we found all these videos and all this training of them essentially driving the transgender ideology, telling these counselors, keep secrets from parents",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" If you're in a different state that doesn't have good parental rights laws, you can behave differently than if it's a year in Florida",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have the head of their ethics committee,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Her name is Caroline Stone,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's been the head of the ethics committee for 20 years,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In their opening monologue, kick off the conference, she talked about how a young school counselor came to her and said, I took a minor girl to go get contraceptives against her mother's wishes",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a little nervous about it now,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What should I do? And her advice to her, she goes, there was three things I could have done",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I could have told the counselor, you have to convince the girl to own up to her mom",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Number two, you can call the mom and own up to what you did",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or number three, hold your breath and pray",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And she goes, everybody, what do you think we should have told her to do? And everyone said, number three, and they laughed and had a grand old time",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then she explained that she had just taken a child to get contraceptives at a clinic because her mother wouldn't let them let her have them,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She said, what do I do? Our high school counselors solve this for me",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you one, do you tell her to go back and convince the student to tell her parent? Or do you tell her two, call the girls mother yourself and confess? Or do you tell her three? I'll go get your breath and pray",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll go,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Turn your neighbor to you, and everyone should be gonna tell her",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Three, I hear",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" See, you're all ready to be part of the ethics committee",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So sign up,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I told you this story without a video proof, everyone's gonna go, you're lying, you're exaggerating, there's no way that's true",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So behind closed doors is showing them in their natural habitat,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's obvious to everybody in the room what the answer is already,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She's not even telling anybody, it's just a kind of a private joke, that's what you're saying",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so there's all these videos and handouts,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's some handouts where they're saying, the question was, if students aren't comfortable with calling someone by a different neighbor pronoun, what should we do? And the handout was, well, you can re-educate them and have a talk with them, or you can turn them in for bullying and harassment",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So now if you're a family that sends your kids to a private or a public school and says, I don't believe in calling someone a different pronoun, I don't wanna participate in this",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're the ones that are bullies and they're harassing,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now you're petting students against each other,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, because it's one thing where someone says, hey, I'd like you to call me X, and then someone can make a decision, sure I'll call you X, or I won't because I don't want to",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's fine, it's different when it's a coerced thing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you don't do it, then it's called bullying or something else",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, it's very popular and it's true to say that children are being brainwashed",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But really what courage does it have it really also focuses on is not just that the children are being brainwashed, the parents are being brainwashed first, because parents know how to stand up for their kids",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Parents have been standing up for their children for eons, crossing oceans, crossing deserts, risking life and limb just to give their children a better life",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What is so special about this time that parents have no idea how to stand up for their kids all because you point a finger at a parent's face and call them some label, whatever the label they wanna call them",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's so magical about that? It's because parents are brainwashed,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've weaponized people's natural kindness and empathy towards them,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So let's say the parent goes, my 11 year old saw this pornographic book and the mom and dad is just a livid and they had a head full of steam",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They go into the principal's office ready to just hold his feet at the fire,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he goes, what is this? Why are you showing my 11 year old? And the principal goes, what's the matter? You want kids to feel bullied, you don't want them to feel included and then the parents goes, well, no, that's not what I mean",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you see, all you have to do is just tug at one of the brainwashing levers and then the steam comes right out of the parents",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I wanna go back to these surveys because you describe the social, emotional learning process which the survey is a key feature as brainwashing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so how is it brainwashing? And then there's also this data mining component that you alluded to earlier,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So every time when parents push back against these really radical policies, oftentimes the answer is this is data driven, it's evidence based, research shows",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They never tell you where, they just say that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then most parents go, I don't have an answer for that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What they're alluding to is these surveys, these social, emotional learning surveys that they give in class that the parents never see",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's also surveys, they call it health surveys that come from the Department of Education that the parents can see",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But in either case, those surveys, both those types of surveys, they can call them climate surveys, they can call them health surveys, social, emotional learning",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can split hairs on those surveys and there are differences,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the point that I wanna parents understand is that data is being manipulated to justify more social, emotional learning, more radical policies",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, the problem with these surveys is it, most of the time, it asks very innocuous questions that most parents won't find offensive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are some questions that are pretty offensive, especially when it gets to the older grades, like the middle school in high school, talk about sex and anal sex and blow jobs and things",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they ask those questions,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then that is when parents, they have a reaction to that, it's the innocuous questions that are equally as dangerous",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I will give you an actual social, emotional learning question",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What is your level of confidence that you can complete the work assigned to you in school? What is so dangerous about that question? And in another time and place, that's probably a pretty good question",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But instead of using that question to really try to help the child do more work, they will then take that answer",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the kids who say answer is too much work, I can't",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But of course, kids are gonna say that, a lot of kids are gonna say that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They'll say the school climate is oppressive, the system is oppressive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Certain students of color cannot complete their work because the school is not inclusive enough,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So the suggestion to improve academics would be to include more LGBTQ books, more Black Lives Matter flags or the GSA clubs so that children feel included, then they'll be able to do their work",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But of course, we all know when you bring that stuff in, all that does is it destroys academics",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It destroys actual personal responsibility because now they're thinking more about activism than education,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So, make sure they run that survey again",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Guess what? Scores are even lower,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's just one question,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These questions are a lot,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You basically are saying that just the woke ideology is baked in to how you analyze the questions,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Correct,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for one of the largest companies, there's a lot of companies that give these surveys as sales surveys, one of them is Panorama",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in their website, they talk about how we look at these answers through an equity lens",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And anybody that studies even a little bit this knows that is through the lens of critical race theorists,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So every answer that is given will be interpreted through the lens of equity lens, through the lens of critical race theorists",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then they will justify bringing more policies,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it doesn't matter how you answer it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It will always justify bringing in more policies,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So for example, there's never a school that got one of these surveys and said, hey, we're doing really good on inclusion",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can tamper down now on the inclusion and the books and the flags,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can stop that this year and we can do something else,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's always more,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, the other thing that struck me about these surveys is that they would provide very individualized information about which students are more susceptible to being indoctrinated",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Absolutely,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's a question that they're given to young kids,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That will fit exactly what you just said,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How many times a week do you have dinner with your family? What's wrong with that question? They shouldn't ask that because that's very personal,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's got nothing to do with the schools,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if a child answers, oh, we have dinner in my parents at home four days a week",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, chances are the parents would probably involved, right? They're having dinner four times a week",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The child goes zero or one, a little more vulnerable, maybe not as much adult supervision",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is there any evidence of these things being used in such a way? Well, sure, because social emotional learning is completely in the schools",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And every time you say, why do you need this, they go as because it's evidence-based, it's data-driven",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's why they collect the data,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this is also why when parents try to see the SEL surveys, they're told they can't see it because it's a private company and they have proprietary",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So literally we're spending taxpayer dollars, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, depending on how many years are doing it, to hire these companies to survey your children, not showing you the questions, and then manipulating the data to bring in more policies",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when you ask, they'll say, oh, is this data-driven? This is evidence-based",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can I see the survey? No,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Basically what I think people who are critical raised theorists will say, well, everything is brainwashing, really",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we're just, we're brainwashing the right way",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Sure,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Sure,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Whatever religion you believe, whether you believe in a religion or not, I think everybody should believe, or at least I think that parents should have the authority to pass their values onto their children, of their families, whatever they believe",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When you weaponize parents' kindness against them, to guilt them, to emotionally blackmail them, so that they give up control of their kids, there's no way that you're the good guy in this",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So for example, every time you push back against a transgender cult, they'll immediately go to, well, if you don't succumb to this, they're going to kill themselves",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 Many people on this show have talked about this,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, you know, they were told, if you don't help, if you don't participate in the social transitioning at the beginning of your child, some people even said they will kill themselves, or they would say there's a high likelihood that they will commit suicide",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 Right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So the tools with courage is a habit,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We try to help parents learn to think past the emotional blackmail, because when you get into that emotional blackmail box, it's very hard to see outside of everything",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because you care about your kids,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You care about your kids,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we try to help parents go, that's the thing on defense, but go on offense",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And when you go on offense, it pushes you outside of that dark box",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So there are several ways that we try to help with that,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We would give parents questions to kind of, so that they think out of it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then they can fire back at these transgender activists, what we call child mutilation advocates",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" Encourage us to have them, we call them child mutilation advocates or CMA's",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we say, well, we do not parent using that standard with anything when it comes to children",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm 13, you don't let me run away with that 40 year old man",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm gonna kill myself,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" You don't let me get tattoo, I'm gonna kill myself",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" You don't let me drink alcohol, I'm gonna kill myself",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" If you don't let me see that boy, I'm gonna kill myself",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't let me go to that radio, or movie, I'm gonna kill myself",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We don't ever succumb to that,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But when it comes to this, we succumb to it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why? It's because you've been brainwashed, because that's obviously not true",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's usually not the kid saying it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's someone who's supposed to be a trusted figure,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, like the counselor, or sometimes the school principal, or the example like that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, so again, if it's a principal or someone who's trusted, we teach parents how to fire back at that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We would say something like, so if I don't call them by the right pronoun, they'll kill themselves",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So are you gonna say that when they do the breast binders? If I don't give them breast binders, they'll kill themselves",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" If they don't puberty blockers, it's a criminal surgery that I kill themselves",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" If I don't even have surgery, they're gonna kill themselves",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" The problem is when these parents get brainwashed because they believe, if we just call them by the right pronoun, they won't kill themselves, and then it'll be all be over",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're only good with it when you walk them slowly into it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 It's like a long con,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, you start to, it's just a pronoun, don't worry about it, just call them by a different name, and then it'll all be over",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, they're weaponizing their kindness",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And it starts with something very simple, like allowing porn not drawing that line",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By the time the child gets to surgery, there's nothing the parents can do about it, because they've already put the child through the system",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're already separated long ago,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The parental rights are gone, because they've already been deemed abusive and unsafe",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If they go against, if they go against it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they step in this, in the inevitable process of this",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right, right",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One of the tools that we put out is called the Safety and Inclusion Express,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you can download on encourageshappadot,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
"org, but it's called the Safety and Inclusion Express, and it takes the parents through each of the, what we call the train stop",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the pronouns is the ticket, is the stamping of the ticket that goes on, that gets the children on the train",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's no exit to this train,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" You can get on the train if you agree with it, if you don't, then you're outside, and then each stop along the way, you're getting further and further away as a parent",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And so the Safety and Inclusion Express talks about how if parents want to get ahead of this, the best chance of you winning this fight is at the pronoun level",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The problem today is that the puberty blockers and the hormone blocker, or their cross-hormal surgery drugs, and the surgeons are so horrific that parents are ignoring pronouns, thinking at least that's not drugs, that's not binding",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But once you get them on that pronoun ideology, the chances of them moving to the next, it's higher, and each step gets harder for the parent to pull them out",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They have something that maybe does need treatment, that does need support",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yes,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that thing is kind of pushed aside in favor of this being the solution,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Absolutely,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Instead of treating the underlining issue, they're moving them to this horrific cult",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
 And what we don't focus enough on is the addictiveness of social value,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Most of these kids, because they have certain issues, have already felt outcasted socially",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we all do,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, what among us haven't felt that way growing up? And then we learn where our niche are, where our strength and weaknesses are, and then we grow out of it, where all of us have uncomfortable, and girls in particular, right? Because the body image through social media really messes with girls' minds, right? Men we get it to, but not as badly as girls",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why the transgender cult affects girls more than boys,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So, a lot of these kids, especially autistic kids, they feel they don't feel socially accepted",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They feel kind of picked on,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They feel that they don't fit in anywhere,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" So then you get this group that comes along that says, if you join us, you have instant social value",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You are hurt,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You are seen,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're celebrated,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You get the enormous love bombs,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for those watching who don't know, love bomb is just this enormous pouring you're so brave, you're so stunning, you're so beautiful",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For most of these kids, especially on autistic scale, this is the first time they've gotten this almost celebrity-like status among their social group and their peers",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is very, very addictive",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It will be addictive to adults, fame",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For a little kid, there's no chance that they're not going to fall prey to that",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the endorphins, and it's like that gambler's high",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But once you say, I'm gay or I'm bi, you get that love bomb, then you have to move now and move forward to say, I'm trans or I'm binary",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when that love bomb ends, you got to move to the binders, because each step that you take, each more aggressive step you take, you decolt, rewards you with more of it",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" This is why if a parent, they have the best chance of stopping at the pronoun level to find out why your child wants to go towards that, because there's underlining issue why",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But once you let them in and they feel that instant shot of celebrity in fame, it is very difficult to get them off of it as well",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a lot of bullying,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of bullying,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Some of the detransitioners' stories, when they finally say, I made a mistake, the nasty messages and the outcast from the people that have love bomb them is really horrible",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's what occult does,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Occult loves you only if you succumb to all their rituals,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,HS
" And the moment you miss one ritual, they punish you",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, one of the very early tools that we created during the summer of 2008, during the summer of 2022, was called cult fiction",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For our time, it was our most downloaded tool",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what we did was we studied the eight steps that successful cults in the past have used,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you start going through the survivors or the people who come out of the cult, and you read some of their testimonies",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's a pattern on recruitment,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so there was eight things that these cults would do according to the members who are now out of the cult,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we matched it up to what is happening at schools through social emotional learning and how they're getting the kids into the cult,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we matched it up all eight steps, exactly what they're doing",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've just offered a lot of very disturbing realities,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How many parents are involved in what you do encourages a habit? How many people are you communicating with? How big a thing is this? How many parents know out of the, you know, the, I don't know how many parents are in America? Oh, this is a reality",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, certainly we reach parents all across the country, and we're very privileged to work with a lot of great organizations that reach a ton of parents, parents defending education, moms for liberty, moms for America",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know heritage is great work, but I would say that more parents do need to wake up to what's happening, but at the same time over the last year and a half, thousands and tens of thousands, the parents have woken up, which is why we have this pushback and this movement",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We've also done a lot in a very, very short time",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we're also up against people who are really well funded,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These people are not working with, you know, a $500,000 budget",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not working with a million dollar budget,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're working with hundreds of millions,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so it's very well coordinated,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's in every single school district,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as parents, if you think it's not in your school district, I assure you it is",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Even if it's not in the extreme, as let's say, you know, California",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's also in the private school system,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Definitely in the private school system,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Which is, you know, some people tell themselves, well, it won't be there, but it is",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I think it's really important for us to give parents call to actions things to do,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's kind of a bad habit, I think, for people in our space to talk about the problem, but not offer solutions",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think if there are two things, if there are two things, I would say every parent can do is this",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Get your children out of the data mining,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because that's the bloodline to a lot of this,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They use that data to justify and push more,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they're spending money on it,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you can really throw a wrench in this if you get your kids out of the data mining,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so, at CourageIsAhabit",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
"org, if you look under the tab or the button SCA, Social Emotional Learning, Optout, or SEL data mining, Optout, at the end of each of those tools is our Optout form",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, does that guarantee that they're not going to give your kids a survey? No",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A lot of these schools, depending on how extreme they are and how radical they are, they might just ignore you",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But at the point is, now you've got some leverage legally because you've already turned it in and now you've got them on record to ignoring",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So there's some things you can do, but you've got to start with that Optout form",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Then the second thing would be to going to the behind closed doors items,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's a form where you put your school on notice and the school counselors that they are not to meet with your child formally or informally without your consent,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because if you think about it, if you as a parent want to pick a dentist or a therapist or a pediatrician, what do you do? You don't just blindly close your eyes and pick one",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You research, you read reviews, you ask for referrals",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These mental health professionals, you don't know who they are",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've never met them,438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you've met them, you've met them for five seconds",438_American Thought Leaders_2023-01-26_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's taking place right now between the people of Hong Kong and the mainland communist Chinese dictatorship led by General Secretary Xi Jinping,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It has been 22 years since the July 1st, 1997, handover of Hong Kong from Britain to communist China",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The system worked moderately well and maintaining a balance of economic and personal freedom next to a totalitarian system,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, as the Hong Kong government working with Beijing proposed an extradition bill to send law breakers of Hong Kong to communist courts in China",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Millions of Hong Kong citizens flooded the streets in protest,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 The key test now is what General Secretary Xi Jinping is going to do about this direct confrontation between Hong Kong's people and Beijing's military and police power,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" On this episode, I'll explain why the protest are happening and why we as Americans should care about the outcome",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I really wanted to talk about what's going on in Hong Kong now because I think that it is the biggest test of the communist Chinese dictatorship since Tiananmen Square in 1989,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the reason I say that is that what you've been watching on television is an outpouring of people,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Remember, the Chinese communists have been perfecting visual identification systems, so you can assume that if you're in one of these demonstrations, the odds are pretty good the police are taking your picture",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if they decide to come back and crack down, you could suddenly find yourself in real trouble",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The dictatorship on the mainland can be very tough and has had people locked up,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is not fun and games,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a real act of courage,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what's fascinating in me is the scale that it's built to,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The fact that you and I are watching millions of people who are standing up and saying they don't want to go down a slippery path where the communist government, the dictatorship on the mainland, is able to have greater and greater control",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think this reflects on something very deep in the Chinese communist dictatorship style,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Its court system in the end is very political,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's important to remember that the mainland government is in fact defined by the communist party,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's about 90 million communist party members,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that they permeate everything,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" They permeate the courts, the police, the corporations, the universities, the people in Hong Kong who had spent a long time being governed by the British who have a totally different approach, very parallel to ours and that the rule of law matters, individual dignity matters",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The state has limits on its power,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All of those things had conditioned people in Hong Kong to a belief in their own legitimate authority and their own legitimate dignity,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 And they see all this being threatened,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's smart enough to understand that it's a slippery the immediate cause of the crisis was a proposed bill that would allow the Chinese communist government to extradite people from Hong Kong to the mainland,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now the excuse for it was that a local teenager was killed while she was vacationing with her boyfriend in Taiwan,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The boyfriend who's a Hong Kong admits to the murder, but authorities can't extradite him back to stand trial and they have to prosecute him for a lesser charge of money laundering",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the government comes in using that particular outrageous case as an excuse and says, you know, what we need to do is have an extradition law that in an orderly way will let us get rid of bad people",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Let us get rid of criminals, violent criminals, and it all sounds under surface plausible in the United States so well, if that's what they're doing, why is there this huge outrage? Why are these enormous demonstrations? And the reason is virtually nobody in Hong Kong trusts the dictatorship in Beijing",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" And they all assume that once you start down the slope, this year it might be only hard in criminals",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Next year it might be publishers and writers and public spokesperson,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The year after it might be people who belong to parties that are not communist,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so they see it as the beginning of the end of the freedom which has made Hong Kong so unique,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You and I have been watching history and we've been watching a moment in time where we don't know how it's going to end,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It could be anywhere from a permanent change in the power system with the people of Hong Kong having vastly more power or it could be the gradual coercion through a series of steps by Beijing or it could be that Beijing simply moves in and decides that it's going to do whatever it has to in order to be able to dominate,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the truth is we don't know which of these outcomes is going to happen next,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's why I thought it was useful to put in context how Hong Kong got to be there, what it's like, what the fights over, and what the options are in terms of the central government and what they're looking at",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And remember this, if you are the Chinese communist dictatorship and you're sitting in Beijing trying to run a country of a billion, 400 million people, you know the deal you've cut which is the people will give us the right to run a totalitarian state but in return we are going to give them prosperity",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it's fair to say that there's generally acceptance in communist China that the deal has been I have a better life but that's a life controlled by the Communist Party but it's better than chaos it's better than a disaster it's better than poverty,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 However there are three places where there are populations of Chinese descent that are both prosperous and free,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The one we're talking about today Hong Kong which has a unique relationship in that it is part of communist China but it is they say it's one country with two systems in the 22 years since the British turned over the city state to the communist that they've actually remained relatively more open, free, or more entrepreneurial and with greater rights",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The second of course is Taiwan which was occupied by the nationalists when they lost the civil war on the mainland and has grown steadily freer, steadily more open and steadily more distant from the mainland",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Taiwan has millions of people it's much bigger than Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It has millions of people now who are of Chinese descent but are living in freedom have a free press, have free elections and are also very very prosperous and the third of course is Singapore which is one of the most remarkable city states in the world enormously successful and which had for a very long time in Li Quan Yu one of the wisest leaders in modern history who really laid the basis for a remarkably prosperous and safe country",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So if you're sitting in Beijing and you're trying to make sure that the billion four million people you currently govern don't get crazy ideas you worry if they start seeing too much freedom in Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong and you worry the most about Hong Kong because it is basically right next to the mainland,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People go back and forth all of the time,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a great deal of news media publishing books and other things in Hong Kong which reach back into China and so there's a great sensitivity and they've found themselves I think caught and not certain what to do,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Next, how to discuss the history of Hong Kong including its 155 year British colonization and now 22 years of being under communist Chinese rule",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The struggle underway now between the people of Hong Kong and the economy of Chinese dictatorship of the mainland is fascinating in part because Hong Kong has been so amazingly successful,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is a tiny city state who has $61,000 income per capita",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It has a population of 7,400,000, one of the most heavily populated places in the world and it is absolutely an extraordinary achievement of the human spirit that with virtually no resources virtually no space that in fact they have built this remarkable trading finance and manufacturing and that it evolved as communist China evolved and became more open",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hong Kong had defined new ways of earning a living, new ways of being a competitor worldwide and they've actually done it",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's an astonishing place and it's a place of great diversity,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, about nine out of ten people in Hong Kong are Chinese",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're also Filipinos, they're Indonesians, they're Europeans",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The remarkable blend of people is illustrated in their religion,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 28% Buddhist or Taoist about 7% Protestant, about 5% Catholic, about 4% Muslim, about 1",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
"5% Hindu, tiny number of Sikhs and then people with no stated religion, about half the population and they feel that they're citizens of Hong Kong",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't think that they're in any way tied to the Chinese communist dictatorship,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" In fact, the University of Hong Kong did a study in 2016 and found that only 31% of Hong Kong residents are proud to be national citizens of China",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They don't identify their success, their freedom and their future with the Chinese communist dictatorship",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 They really see themselves as part of a larger world and as people who make a living by a remarkable level of entrepreneur behavior,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" And in fact, there have been a number of studies on the Hong Kong very low tax system in which they have really attracted entrepreneurs, attracted investments and by allowing people to keep the money they make, they have created a center of wealth",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's an estimate that there are more high value people in terms of income in Hong Kong than in any other single city in the world,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's how productive and that's how powerful it's been,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, this is also a historical anomaly",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hong Kong originally was just some islands and the British decided it was a great port and so part of the agreement that the British made with the Imperial Government back at the end of the Opium Wars in the 1840s, they were given rights to the island of Hong Kong",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Later on, they acquired rights to an area in the mainland called Calloon and for a very long period, the British ran the place, no real regard for the Chinese government, whether it was the nationalist Chinese or the communist Chinese or before that, the empire",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they ran it as a colony,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" I think it's important to remember this because there's a certain amount of unfairness in saying why can't they have free elections like they did in the British? No, that was a colony",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, as a colony they had the role of law",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 It was a colony that people generally felt was very fair,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was a colony that was very well policed but nonetheless was not a free country,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 It wasn't a place that had exercised a deep tradition of democracy,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This was a 99-year lease and after a long time the lease began to run out and by that time you had a much bigger, much more powerful communist China and you had Britain which had dropped dramatically in military power and dropped dramatically in relative economic rank",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so there was no possibility, no practical realistic possibility, that Britain could hold on to Hong Kong if the Chinese Communist wanted agreement",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so they had a long negotiation, I was actually a speaker of the house in Hong Kong during the negotiating period and the British worked very hard to get a general agreement from the Chinese Communist that they would, in fact, be willing to run a rule of law system very close to what the British had been doing and that they would gradually bring in some level of representative government",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The way the Chinese captured it and it was a pretty intelligent model was there would be one country but two systems,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So from the standpoint of Beijing, Hong Kong is Chinese but it's Chinese in a different way than the rest of China",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, part of the reason that Hong Kong was treated this way is that the dictatorship in Beijing was trying to send a signal to Taiwan that they could rejoin mainland China and then you would have one country and you'd have three systems and that required the Taiwan decided that they could trust Beijing to keep its word",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the British consistent bias in favor of occupying the system in a fair way with the rule of law, with a police force that had a long reputation for being incorruptible and extraordinarily honest and professional",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In that setting Hong Kong just transitioned from Great Britain to China and remained entrepreneurial, had a huge work ethic, people could rise rapidly in economic wealth and as China grew richer, a great deal that wealth came through Hong Kong in the form of trade or in the form of finances or insurance companies and the result was that not only did Hong Kong rise because of itself but Hong Kong also rose because of the general gradual rise of all of China",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So for a very long period, life has been exciting, it's been positive and yet there's been this continuous sense of being about what will happen and the fact is nobody knew how it would evolve",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Certainly after Tiananmen Square when the Chinese Communist decided they had to shoot people and run over them with tanks, there was a sense that there was a pretty rigid system politically and it wasn't going to evolve towards any kind of real freedom in the short run but that didn't particularly carry over to Hong in fact Beijing so recognized Hong Kong's ability to be independent that they were willing to have people come to Hong Kong where they could talk about Tiananmen at the very time that in the communist Chinese world they were erasing all the memories",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So if you looked at the history textbooks, if you looked at memoirs, if you looked at a variety of other things, Tiananmen Square never quite occurred in the historic patterns of communist China but there were people who were openly publicly talking about it in Hong Kong, the Beijing dictatorship wasn't particularly happy about it but they gained certain very large advantages by tolerating the way in which Hong Kong operated",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" First of all, Hong Kong is a generator of enormous wealth, much of which goes to China, the value of Chinese currency, the value of Chinese investments, the very fact that a lot of Chinese wealthy people put money into Hong Kong, all of these things led Beijing to be very careful, they didn't want to kill the goose that was laying the golden egg",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" At the same time, they also recognized that whatever the political, diplomatic, and public relations had been in dealing with Tiananmen Square, it would be enormously bigger if they did something to suppress dissent in Hong Kong itself",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think there was ever any serious thought about using the military in Hong Kong the way they had used the military in Beijing and there's no evidence at the moment at least that they are going to put that scale of people in there and I think they have a pretty good idea how horrible it would look on television and how rapidly the rest of the world would respond with enormous hostility if that's what they did,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you had a situation building where you have on the one front, the people of Hong Kong pretty aggressively and directly taking on the establishment and to understand that in part you have to recognize that that establishment was really rigged by the Chinese Communist",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
" There are about 1,200 people who elect the chief executive",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those people are almost overwhelmingly biased in favor of Beijing,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a general agreement that the amount of pressure that Beijing can bring to bear on the chief executive's overwhelming and in fact, lay them who's the current chief executive couldn't survive for a full day if Beijing wanted to people in Hong Kong know this so they know she's really Beijing's puppet running Hong Kong",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's not Hong Kong's choice running Hong Kong and that leads to a continuous frustration and a continuous sense of wanting to change it,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 Now starting at the end of the British period there was a growing democracy movement,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They had never had four democracy under the British but they thought now that they were changing over maybe the time had come to in fact have that kind of approach,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The tension between the evolution of Hong Kong as an increasingly free environment and the continual effort of the Chinese Communist to bring it under a socialist communist dictatorial system,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 I has been fascinated to watch,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In 1997 the British leave the Chinese flag has raised and the British flag comes down on July 1st 1997,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By 2003 there was an anti-subversion law prohibiting quote any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against the central people's or the theft of the state",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that is actually focused on making them tolerate mainland communist Chinese dictatorship saying that you can go to jail for doing things that the government and Beijing thinks are inappropriate but at the time they're still locked into the Hong Kong legal system while they tried to ban groups that there were unacceptable they could ban them in the mainland but they weren't doing a very good job of baning them in Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they kept looking for ways to change the attitude of people in Hong Kong who were very skeptical of the dictatorship and very much in favor of a more open society,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By 2012 the government and desperation announced the plan to require schoolchildren to take classes in Chinese patriotism by which of of course they meant the communist dictatorship's patriotism and there are huge mass student protests and they don't require it,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By 2014 there's a pro-democracy group which actually sets up an unofficial referendum setting up three different options of how they want to directly elect the head of the local government Beijing says no we're not going to have open nominations,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In fact the Chinese Communist state news agency reports that candidates would be chosen by a Chinese government committee before being put on the ballot,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're already narrowing down the range of choices so you can only pick a choice acceptable to Beijing,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When Beijing does reject the proposal for open nominations there are student boycotts and all through 2014 you have the police clashing with pro-democracy protesters hitting them with pepper spray shooting tear gas and up to 80,000 people gathered to protest",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In 2014 this was to consider a substantial protest 80,000 people",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've just seen two million people in the streets,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS

 The Chinese Communist chief negotiator who is now the chief executive officer Carrie Lam she's negotiated as long as she can and they're not going to negotiate anymore,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By mid December the leaders announced that the boycotts are over they've made their big push they failed and you could have said at that point that that was up to then the high watermark of the struggle for democracy and Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Even while the political tension was intense the economic integration continued to go on,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By September 2018 there's a high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are huge quantities of people going back and forth and you can actually clear Communist Chinese immigration inside the station in Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 However some of the opposition leaders starts in wait a second if you're going to let the Chinese Communist government clear immigration in the Hong Kong train station,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Are you an effect setting up a piece of territory that the Chinese Communist will claim is theirs,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so the tension is very prickly sense of what is it that Beijing is going to try to do next,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By September 2018 only had the open high-speed rail link but Hong Kong bans the Hong Kong national party which had advocated independence for the territory and they argued that it's a national security issue to have people advocating independence,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well again if you think about it this is a step away from the original vision that they would prove you could have two systems in one country because increasingly they're coercing people in Hong Kong to basically accept Chinese Communist definition of the two systems and that certainly sends a reminder to Taiwan that maybe you ought to be a little bit careful about how things are going on,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They continue however economically to work more and more in the direction of coming together while October 2018 China opens a bridge linking Hong Kong and Macau to the mainland and General Secretary Xi Jinping presides over the ceremony,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they're gradually having if you will golden threads that economically unite Hong Kong and China while they're also slowly trying to crowd out the kind of freedoms that have been integral to living in Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's what got us to the stage where you had these huge demonstrations,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You had Carrie Lam proposed something which clearly had been backed by Beijing and then she backed down and we have to presume that she had permission from Beijing to back down that they looked at a million people in decided that there's just two bigger crowd and that Hong Kong is too open to television and news media therefore they couldn't continue where they're going,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When they back down on the bill instead of people going home and saying great we won the next day there were twice as many people in the street, two million",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Remember this is in a country in which the entire population is about 7,400,000",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you're talking about almost 30% of the country turning out and if you take that same number for the US, you think about this number you'll be in rural South Staggering this",17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know of over 100 million Americans in the street,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,HS
 So on this very congested very small city state you had a clear demonstration of massive popularity on behalf of first repudiating the extradition bill and second having won that fight,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now they're saying okay since we got it back down let's also fire and they're demanding that Beijing allow her to step down and of course Beijing doesn't want to do them,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's why you're now in this very interesting period of a test of will between millions of people in Hong Kong and General Secretary Xi Jinping,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Next why we should all care as Americans about the outcome of the Hong Kong protest,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When Neville Chamberlain was contemplating what was happening in Czechoslovakia in 1938 and he's trying desperately to avoid war,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He described it as a distant country about which we know a little and of course the result of that appeasement policy was World War II,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He has a turned out that that distant country about which we know a little was in fact of the symbolic breaking point that led Adolf Hitler to believe that he could basically invade any place he wanted to and Britain and France would tolerate it,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well Hong Kong is in the same way a small city state seven million four hundred thousand people,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You could argue what does it matter to us and what it matters to us is really about the Chinese Communist dictatorship more than about Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hong Kong in a sense is like the story of the canary and the coal mine and the old days they would keep canaries the coal mine because they were very sensitive to gases and if the canaries began to get sick they knew that they had a danger of a gas explosion and they would evacuate the the coal mine,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well Hong Kong is the testing point for whether or not general secretary Xi Jinping is willing to allow freedom to evolve or whether in fact faced with the risk of a billion four hundred million people becoming inspired by Hong Kong,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He decides that he has to clamp down and make the dictatorship even tougher even more repressive and even more comprehensive,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that's why this is a very very important turning point and it will be very interesting at the G20 meeting when the president and Xi Jinping meet to see what's happened to the Chinese Communist wait and do nothing until after that meeting do they act in advance and also how do the people of Hong Kong evolve they've had a taste now that street power works pushing to get the chief executive fired she is Beijing's choice Beijing's not going to back down very easily and again if you think like the leader of a billion,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
four million people you don't necessarily want the idea that if enough people go in the street you're going to do what they tell you,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is a very delicate and I think very important time because it affects the largest country in the world it affects the whole question of whether China evolves in a direction that they become more capable of us working with them or whether in fact in the end they have to use whatever level of force and is needed in order to sustain the dictatorship and maintain the capacity to repress their own people,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think the next few months will be very important and I hope you get a feel about how remarkable Hong Kong is what level of courage it took for two million people almost one out of every three citizens of Hong Kong to go to the streets and the kind of historic moment when you might in fact see a real step in the direction of freedom or you might find out that once again repression is used to sustain the dictatorship,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it will have a big impact on our lives on how we relate to communist China and how the system evolves over the next 10 or 15 years,17956_Newt's World_2019-06-23_transcription.json,Non-HS

 He said there is no longer any continued fight over the election,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There must be a peaceful transition,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He released a statement last night,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I wanted to let you hear some of that right now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we can discuss what this all means,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Go for it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 America is and must always be a nation of law and order,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy to those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You do not represent our country,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And to those who broke the law, you will pay",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have just been through an intense election and the motions are high,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But now, temperatures must be cooled and calm restored",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We must get on with the business of America,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We do need to make sure that future elections don't have some of the questions around them that this one did,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We absolutely need to ensure that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But this election is over, friends",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You know what I know it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We don't need to get too deep into all of that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we have less than two weeks before the Joe Biden administration is going to start,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So now we have to deal with this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have to see this reality for what it is,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we have to prepare for what is coming,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm going to do all of that with you today,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But first I want to say that there is, and I will not let this go, a tremendous amount of hypocrisy from the media about what they saw on Capitol Hill and what they generally excuse or explain away or even encourage depending on who we're talking about and what specific right",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All riots are bad,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" We should be able to agree on this, right? Left, right",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everybody should be able to agree,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All riots are bad,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Breaking things, attacking people, trespassing, threatening and even assaulting law enforcement",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, Capitol Hill police officers dead",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They believe because he was hit over the head with a fire extinguisher,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's murder,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A woman went to this protest and she was shot in the neck and what looks like to me excessive force, which would make that an illegal shooting, not quite murder, but perhaps a criminal charge we shall see",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the Capitol Hill police officer who died was doing his job,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was doing his job,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We back the blue or not,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We do,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's not forget that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do we condemn riots or not? We do,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And I'm telling anybody right now who wants to get mad at me about this one or wants to pick a fight over this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I welcome it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's all remember who we are,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's remember what we stand for here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump is done,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not going to be president for the next four years,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are very real questions now about what the future of president Trump personally and politics will be,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think his statement last night was excellent,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think that he is representative of a broader movement of conservative populism, but we have to see where this all goes",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The next two weeks need to be a quieter process, a peaceful process as he has called for",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we also need to deal with this reality,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know it's uncomfortable,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People have been lied to here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have been misled,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And honestly, I'm there are some people who have been telling me the truth about what has been going on to the degree they could in the White House",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And there were others who were running around saying things just wait, just wait",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to have the evidence,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to give it to you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm telling and they were telling me this on a personal level,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They were telling me this off the record behind closed doors,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What do they have? Where is it? Nothing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They didn't change a darn thing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And now the left is more emboldened than it's ever been,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have the house,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have the Senate,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They have the presidency,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And right now, and I'm here with you getting ready for the fight that lays ahead because we are coming to grips with this one right now",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And and part of that means looking at everything honestly now with clear eyes, look at what has actually happened",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Capitol Hill police officer is dead,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A woman, a mother, a veteran is dead",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And a number of other people from injuries that I can't get specifics about how, but they're being placed as they're being reported on as injuries related to or deaths related to this protest",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're a handful of other people as well,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But certainly the Capitol Police officer and Ashley Babbitt, the woman who was shot in the neck, they are dead",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this whole unleashing of fury and rage in the Capitol, as I said immediately and many people are mad",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know, I'm like all these others, thousands and thousands of, of unfollows on Twitter and everything else",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm always going to tell you the truth,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is not a close call,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is not a hard one,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was a massive blunder and we need to rally back from this and come together,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This was, it was wrong and it was dumb",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's what we need to understand right now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was wrong and it was counterproductive on every level,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the people who are telling you otherwise in media are lying to you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The people who are telling you that there's still going to be some constitutional challenge or there's a crack in or there's or whatever, they are lying to you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Some of them have been lying to you all along,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Some of them have been lying to you now for six to eight weeks or so, telling you, oh, don't worry",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's definitely going to happen,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They knew better,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've been saying for how long now Joe Biden's almost certainly going to be the president,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The only, you know, the only reason I couldn't tell you a hundred percent",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was saying 99% because there were people around this White House,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There were people who are very connected into the Trump administration who were saying there's it's any, you're going to see something",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's coming,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's coming,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm not running the, I'm not running the recount efforts",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not the one going through the ballots,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not bringing the legal challenges,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I had to, you have to leave open the possibility, but I've been saying this for a while and people, including some point, I've listened to to me for a long time",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they know to trust me,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They know I tell them the truth,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They know the value of this show lies, not just in the knowledge that I have about an array of things, but also in the fact that I will always respect you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I don't pander to this audience,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't lie to this audience,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And unfortunately there are a lot of other people who do,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's why there's so much anger right now on top of all the other things, not only have we had a year of COVID-19 and lockdowns and just BLM riots and all the rest of it",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We've also had a year in the end, you're going to the election where there were people that we were counting on and people that we were trusting and they've let us down",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's understand that there are people that many of you listen to or watch or or trust when they speak in their professional capacity in some government role and they have let us down,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That has occurred,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We should we should be honest about it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We should be able to speak about it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And anyone who's telling you the truth, I can assure you is not the enemy",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So get that out of your head,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know this is this is a tough one,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I tweeted out Monday night, it's going to be a rough week folks, drop in",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I didn't know how rough it was going to be,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And yes, it's worth discussing the hypocrisy",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, we need to understand that the Democrat left is vicious and vindictive and taking this far beyond I'm saying that this was sedition and that people should spend decades in prison",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, if you hit a cop over the head with a fire extinguisher and he died, you got to go away",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You got to go away from murder,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what we're talking about now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is serious folks and you know that I'm right when I say that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If somebody, if somebody assaulted a law, I don't care what they think they're causing",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" If somebody assaults a law enforcement officer in the course of his duties or her duties and kills that officer, there must be, there must be severe penalty",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 There must be absolute accountability for that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Otherwise we've got nothing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Otherwise we're just, it's just mob versus mob out there on the streets",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do they like them? Does the left like the mob when it suits their purposes? Of course they do,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is it disgusting that they have no standards that they apply to this that are, that are equal? Is it, is it grotesque that they're hypocrites in ways that you almost wonder if it's just a commentary on their intelligence or just their, their character is so rotten that they don't know the difference, but this is where we are",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I wanted to bring you better news this week,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's for sure,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm as disappointed as many of you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm as disappointed as those of you who were expecting four more years,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Remember that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 2020 was a different story for us because of this pandemic and because the left finally felt like it was in a position to get vengeance on Trump and his supporters,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they're just getting started,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And it's going to look like we have a very bleak political future,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to feel that way,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We will come together,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And one of the biggest instigators of that will be the way that the left is now going to overplay its hand, pretend it has a mandate, ignore the will of 74 million voters and treat them like their subhuman and their scum",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And the media will, will talk down to them",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Joe Biden will give some completely boilerplate speeches about how, who wants to unify the country and bring the country together",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And you know what that's going to do? That's going to bring us all together,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to end up circling the wagons among conservatives because we're not going to have any choice friends,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's happening,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just a question of when,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I'm talking about shining lasers in the eyes of federal officers with the intention of blinding them,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'll tell you right now, if I thought somebody was trying to blind me and I had a sidearm, I would use it in the course of my duties, but that was all somehow very different",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 This is how this country was started,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is how this country was started by people lighting small businesses on fire and throwing rocks and bricks and bags of urine at police officers because of the history of racism in this country or something,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not even really sure why they do it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Why, why do this now? Why set up this, this dichotomy of law enforcement treatment of the Trump Capitol Hill protesters versus law enforcement treatment of BLM? Do they, do they really think what?

" What happens next? Where do you think we go? I mean, that's really, you know, the media, I think it'll be fasting to watch the transition from all out opposition to Trump to all out cheerleader squad for Biden",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, that's, that is obvious, right? So everybody's saying, what are they going to talk about now that Trump's not in office? They're going to talk about what a genius Joe Biden is and how amazing Kamala Harris is all day long, all the time",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what's going to happen,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think that's particularly complicated,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, you know, Joe Biden is to genius what the media cheerleaders are to hot cheerleaders",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The exact opposite,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's what I'm worried about,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Our, our ruling class is uniquely stupid and incompetent and greedy and unbelievably arrogant without any justification",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 This is a decision point where you can make good decisions that turn down the temperature and get us back to a civil society,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can make the stupidest possible decision and throw a can of gasoline on a fire that's already burning because you lit it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And I, unfortunately, I think they're going to do worse",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think they're going to attempt to oppress silence of disenfranchised the 75 million Americans who vote for Donald Trump,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've already seen it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Everything from Simon and Schuster, canceling Josh Hawley's contract to the promiscuous use of words like sedition and treason to the idea that they're going to break the filibuster and just do whatever they want",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, there are so many stupid choices they can make",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And sadly, we can count on our establishment to make the bad ones every time",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Let's just really be honest with this audience right now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There were people who were not telling the truth about what they had when it came to the crack in the results of the election getting turned in the opposite direction,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, there were frauds involved here",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think we have to look at that now and be honest about that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, look, there were a lot of charlatans leading good people on giving them also look, I went and worked for the president into that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I saw the fraud,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I saw the irregularities,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I saw the incompetence,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I am not a believer that this is some sort of squeaky clean election and all the Pollyanna, as we say it is, are lying to you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That being said, how do you address it? You address it through the procedures we have",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Unfortunately, procedures we have are not designed for the kind of shenanigans that we saw",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You can see very quickly, this was going to end with Joe Biden being an argument",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't make it right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't make it okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that was how it was going to end,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Instead, you had people refusing to accept the reality of things",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't mean there's a rehearsal meeting,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're giving it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, I am a military guy",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a lawyer,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I assess the situation as I see it so I can better deal with the facts,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now we have a bunch of people standing around who were praying for the crackin' on social media,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a few people, well, you know, Trump's now the new verb, the right where he wants them",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, he hasn't",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That hasn't happened,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And frankly, Trump's performance over the last few months is so far",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's made a lot of big errors and a big Trump supporter,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I got to tell you, I got to tell people the truth",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He has screwed some of this stuff up,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I got to say, in addition to that, we really, there is a lesson here",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's one that I've had a lot of frustration about over the years criticizing a politician in elected office from their own side in good faith,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Does not make you weak,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't make you a waffler,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It doesn't make you it's necessary for the best possible administration and the execution of the ideas and the policies that we, the people voted for there, there was, there was a on our side",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was a suppression,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you, if you said, I don't like this, you know, I'll tell you, I got this one",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I got furious pushback from people because I've been saying for years, nepotism in this white house is a, you can't do that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You cannot have your children as the most senior advisors in the White House determining who you see and who you talk to,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there are a lot of people that wanted more time in this White House than wanted more access and they wouldn't say a darn word about it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then people in the audience, some of them were saying to me, well, buck, those are the only people he can trust",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Really because I think he trusted my pants for four years,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think, I think my pants was loyal to him",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, he was",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he was treated shamefully the way that Trump created him was, it was often, I don't like saying that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, I am a Trump supporter",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think he was a great president overall,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we got it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you're absolutely right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you have to distinguish between the bad faith practices under the gold burrs who were simply mad because they were kicked out of power based on their own incompetence and failure to form over decades,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" With people like us who were like, hey, we like what you're doing",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He could have handled this election aftermath much better while still preserving the questions that are legitimate about the election, which need to be looked into",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 what he is now because of his actions,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" We, you know, the other side has been empowered to make any question of a massive shenanigans involved in the election",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are truths in us in the eyes of stupid people, but unfortunately a lot of people are stupid",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" You know, you said you were in",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think we need to,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm sorry,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have a little bit of delay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I don't mean to step on you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I just was going to say we have,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have Nevada,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You talked about you were in Nevada looking at these results,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I talked to Matt Schlapp,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's a friend,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was in Nevada as well,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He said he saw bad stuff,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I got people that I know are squared away and understand what's what they're telling me that there were clear problems,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's just looking at Nevada for a second,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, Sean Parnell is also a good friend",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He says there are clear problems in Pennsylvania,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why couldn't we get one? You know, all we needed if someone showed me a thousand double votes, let's say, right? And maybe there weren't even malicious, but just a thousand double votes meeting somebody, you know, they voted here and then they voted in the other state and they didn't know or I mean, you're supposed to know that, but you don't know what I'm saying",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like maybe it was just the problems, the irregularities the word I'm looking for, we'd expect",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why couldn't we have that in clear, clear as day obvious? This is what it is in a court",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why didn't that happen? There are a couple reasons,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" First of all, our judicial system is not designed and does not have the temperament to address election fraud after an election",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's start from the beginning,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We will not prepare the Democrats who went to all these venues, passed law, changed the rules essentially and not through the legislature",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Actually that was unconstitutional,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We didn't push back,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We didn't have our own campaign to ensure electoral fairness,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When I got to Nevada, there was one lawyer on the ground from the RNC",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One great guy,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was a good team,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We did some good work, but it just wasn't enough",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, as for the courts themselves, again, they're not designed to overturn elections",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And their by temperament, they don't want to win this",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We would have had to convince three judges to pick the winner of an election,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is that that's almost never going to happen,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's an almost never going to happen once,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Our judicial system, our entire system is designed to assume that our elections are, you know, a fair deal on the margins",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is, there may be a little bit of fraud",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not going to change anything,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So when you have a massive multiprodden assault, both by changing rules and by a media that performs as a propaganda arm, the system is simply not designed to do that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I had a fraud case thought, I would spend two or three years in December",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'd take a thousand depositions, a bunch of, a bunch of depositions",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'd have plenty of time to do it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We write motions back and forth,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You would work it up,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got weeks,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got weeks to do it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you've got this far from ground zero,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, you know, for that's hard to prove",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do you prove? Okay, you have a thousand double votes",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's great,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Who did they vote for? Well, obviously they vote for Biden",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, is it obvious? Can you tell me that for sure? You have no information",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You just know there were double votes,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It could just assume, you know, our systems not designed",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Our judicial system is not designed for the kind of electoral problems that we saw,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I mean, while you've got to address them and you've got to try and make your case, the procedural things including standing and timing, latches",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've all learned the word latches lately,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How do you just says my bar exam? But it's just not designed to handle,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I get it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I get it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's very frustrating,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, you know, you add all this together and I understand why there's so much anger out there about just the whole thing, the whole thing just sticks",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Anyway, I appreciate you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 He demands that his colleagues tell the truth about Trump and to Trump supporters who have been lied to consistently,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then I have always said from the very beginning that the lying is the biggest problem because look at where it has brought these people,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And one more thing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How is that going to happen? Because you have somebody like Matt Gates saying that it was an antiflucced people dressed as protesters,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is never going to get settled,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are the biggest liars,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have these people I guess have to be taken down,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the media on the right also has to be sanctioned,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Sanctions,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But she wants sanctions on Russia,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 She's in the media,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was a time I want to remind everybody of this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was a time not that long ago when people who made a living based on the legal and cultural protections of the First Amendment believed in the First Amendment,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was a time,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Now they view the First Amendment as an inconvenience,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They feel like they are in charge,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They get to dictate,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Let's just remember that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 95% of journalists opposed to him from day one,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He had a vast majority of federal bureaucrats across the entire civil service opposed to him from day one,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He never had the kind of institutional support that would be necessary to have a real authoritarian regime,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know who will have that kind of support based on what we're seeing? The Biden administration,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Has anybody really think that Joe Biden, who no one's even really clear on what he stands for other than just being in office for a really long time, is that anything that Joe Biden is going to stand to thwart the most destructive impulses of the left? Or is he just going to give a kind of a more palatable version of what they're doing so that he provides cover for their most aggressive and destructive actions? I think you and I both know that one, but they want sanctions",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They want to shut it down,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're coming after us folks,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're coming after those of us who make a living in conservative media,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 We are all girding our loins and preparing for what analytic bombs you plan to drop here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What is happening right now in America as you see it? It is a, it's, you know, this is what Reagan was talking about",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is mourning in America,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is a beautiful day because whenever you have the state and the ruling cast demonstrated weakness, this is a very, very healthy thing",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You could listen to corporate media all day long,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They will never be able to persuade you that a government which can be kind of taken over by someone from Burning Man who goes up to the speaker's desk and just drops his genital on her table and flexes for the cameras that this is an empire in its prime,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now you think that what we're seeing is a recognition of American decline because of the downfall of opinion around the elites,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is that fair? Government decline,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Government decline,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 America has helped the insofar as the government is weak,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I love, I hate this government because I love my country",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for a year now, these despicable, depraved degenerate class of people who should be in Gitmo as a compromise have been making it illegal to earn a living and to leave your home while they sip and laugh on champagne",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" So yes, anything that shows that the emperor has no clothes and emperor as a word I use very specifically is enormously useful because that demonstrate they do not have the will to back up their edicts",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What happens now could get very, very ugly",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But what we've been going through has been uglier still,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What do you think? I agree with you on the lockdowns and I think one part of the conversation that hasn't really gotten nearly enough attention in the last few days even was how many people that were in DC for the march, not the riot, but for the march were outraged about that we've been in a truly, people always overuse the term Orwellian and I know it, it becomes such a cliche and it's overused",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But when you can't go into an elevator without being told where to place your feet in literally place your feet in the elevator because there's little foot pads and if you don't do that, you're supposed to be a reckless or a bad person",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have entered a crazy town world of morons running every aspect of our lives while they don't actually do any of this stuff themselves,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" People are rightly very angry about this and no one can look at what's happening in California other places across the country and think that the trade off that these elites insisted on, we didn't even get a choice in this",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, don't worry, we'll keep you safe",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just let us tell you what you have to do,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let us make you do all these idiotic things all the time,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, mask up between bites didn't save us",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think people are recognizing this now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Two weeks to flatten the curve,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Remember? Yeah,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Two weeks is just going to be two weeks and then it's all going to go away,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I wouldn't call it a riot,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I'm playing fiction, I would do",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I want to draw the word is a riot,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Burning cars, fires, cars tipped over, people screaming",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The dishoni bottle in the speaker's office wasn't even knocked over,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was a tour,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A private side tour,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is the one time the government had a no knock raid and the only people who were, there was a capital hill",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was a capital hill police officer who was killed,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Apparently, hit over the head with it with an extinguisher",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And a girl was murdered, a veteran was murdered by the police for which I'm sure this she's going to have no consequences because they can kill with impunity",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I think there won't be consequences,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I got to tell you, I just just to just real quick, Mike, the, I've spoken to some people that I know in law enforcement and former law enforcement who are very much not, you wouldn't agree with them on use of force",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think generally, even they say, why was this woman shot of the neck? What's the justification for shooting? I mean, yeah, it was an unruly crowd",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Could you just open fire and shoot everybody who is at that door? If not, why not? I don't understand how this was a good shoot as they say in law enforcement",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Yeah, I mean, we're not going to get into the cops because that's going to be a whole other sidebar",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But here's the other thing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The left was told for a very long time that Donald Trump is the head vampire, like in a movie",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You destroy the head vampire, all the unrilling vampires, the solvent to dust and the sun rises and it's, you know, the dawn",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Joe Biden is not going to be able to stop this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Donald Trump was barely able to stop this for five seconds before,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They thought he was the river, but in fact, he was the dam because for a large segment of the population, tens of millions, he gave them hope that they would have some sort of representation in Washington and their voice would be heard",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now that that has been extinguished and now that they are being marginalized systemically by the corporate press and by the DC establishment, they are not going to be quiet and go home",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are going to get more and more angry,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They are very little to lose as their businesses are being destroyed,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And when, and historically the left has understand this or so this, when you marginalize a community and give them nothing to hope for, they're not going to just start playing part cheesy",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to get aggressive,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're going to get violent, especially young males and it's going to get very ugly, very soon",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And I mean, like, like Rosa Deloro, ugly",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Please explain Rosa Deloro,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What is that? Oh, she's the Congress of Connecticut, Google her",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She looks like she should be in Java's hype,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, so we're speaking to Michael Malice, who is the host of your welcome with with Michael Malice",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Mike, I also, I have a feeling and we're seeing the early stages of this, they're lying to us, right? We know that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a lot of line that goes on and I'm very angry with the people who are telling everyone, oh, don't worry",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, the crack in is coming",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're about we've got any moment now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to unleash and there were some big names that were far too willing to pretend that any second now they're going to overturn the results of the election,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was not happening,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We lost the, as soon as the press, as you say, the corporate press, which I actually think you're right in that terminology, as soon as the corporate press called it for Biden, it was effectively going to be over",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, barring some",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that should be because there's no will within the Republican party to fight them,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was the issue,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Republican party weren't going to go to bat for Trump because Mitch McConnell is perfectly happy working with Joe Biden as he has for decades,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So what would be what would be going to bat for Trump under the circumstances within the system? I know you're an anarchist and you're open about that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if we are going to work within the system, just take take that as a given for the purposes of our conversation",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What would you have liked to have seen them do? You would say that we, what did the Democrats do when the media for the last four years years of our Russia insist that the election is not certified, that they fight at every step of the way, have hearings, have crowds, you know, rile up the Republican base",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That would be what fighting, even if I agree with you that they lost",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what I'm saying is if they want to go to bat for Trump and from these people feel disenfranchised, this is what they should have done",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as an anarchist, I don't regard any vote or any election as legitimate anyway",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So yeah, it's absolutely would be disingenuous",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But just as disingenuous as democracy is inherently,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So can you explain that? I'm actually just curious,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I always find your philosophy interesting because you say things that you just don't hear from other people in the media who actually are out there and talk about these issues,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Democracy is problematic for you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I'm really asking, I'm actually just curious",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What do you mean by democracy? That's the same problem,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It should be strangled in the crib,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" The idea that I can't be governed by who I want, that I have to be governed by someone of whose views I despise who does not represent me or my culture is something so nonsensical that the only reason we accepted as a hypothetical is because we've been trained to the contrary since kindergarten",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I despise Donald Trump and I think he's a white supremacist and I think he's implementing fascism in America, why am I supposed to regard him as my president? Same with if I think Joe Biden is a tool of China and he's a corrupt swamp demon",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This guy doesn't speak for me,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why does it be because people who are my neighbors like him who cares? They don't get to choose my doctor,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't get to choose my lawyer,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't get to choose right here restaurant,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it makes no sense that they're going to determine under who's jurisdiction,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm going to fall under,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What could we replace? What could we replace that aspect of the system with? That's why you destroy that system because politics is something that is not defensible morally and that's where anarchism comes in,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no reason for the government to have a monopoly on security for the same reasons,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no reason for the government to have a monopoly on health care,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 So every argument against socialized health care is an argument against socialized security systems,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was also going to add that was just an injury,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just wanted to know Michael and that's interesting,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You won't hear from a lot of anarchists in the media my friends,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Michael is one of the few and I think it's,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's my design,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No chance he was also an anarchist but the left anarchist, he made the point that the way that people establish control is to allow healthy debate within a very delineated specific terms",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So if it goes between two and three and yes, there's infinite numbers between two and three, two point one, two point eight, whatever, but four and one are never on the table and never discussed as something to be regarded as realistic and then you can strictly maintain the future of the country",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a great deal,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That was going to say that brings you back to what I was going to ask you, which is I believe so I was early on in saying to people that the lockdowns are not going to go away with Biden",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They will actually and also all these Democrats in states like New York and California, they will double down and as they have more power, they'll want even more power on top of that because this suits their philosophy of who they are and what they should be able to do and tell people to do and they like the power people in power like even more of it",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It almost always the case and what we see with the social media companies and the suppression and open suppression campaign of wrong thing, tomorrow another term for more will, they're going to do more of this, not less now that they think that the corporate approved candidate is in office",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is not going to get better now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think this is going to get worse,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yes,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think we have a model to choose from in that is a prohibition,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Prohibition stopped when there was disapproval of it, but also stopped because people started getting violent",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" If you look at it's chart and this was horrible, the number of police officers who were killed went up and up and up and then prohibition ends and it goes back down again",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At some point, we already seen in Scotland, we saw in Canada, I don't know if this reached the mainstream desk, but you could see it on social media",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Police officers started raiding people's homes and I don't mean someone who's a drug dealer or you know, running some kind of cock-fighting",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean elderly people in their homes, they're knocking on the door and coming in",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At a certain point, they're going to do that to the wrong person and things are going to start popping off in a very, very bad way",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this is something that you would think people in power would understand, but since they're not the ones who are in danger, they have no problem putting police officers in harm's way",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's going to get very, very ugly",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's some very, I have some very smart friends, just very bright people who are good people and they're asking me questions expressing what they view is very real concerns like, I mean, they think they're going to, you mentioned, and I've seen the video in Canada, it's particularly horrific",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, they're sending in police to drag people out of private homes for the crime of being with their family members in a private home against the will of the state",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Apalling and if we had an honest media that wasn't a bunch of hacks for the Democrat party, they would make a much bigger deal of this",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I have people in this country asking me things like, do you think they're going to come after they're going to go and they're going to start with probably assault rifles, but they'll go down from there or whatever",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Send me automatic rifles that have the cosmetic features they define as assault rifles,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They're going to go house to house and take people's guns,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I say, I don't, I hope that doesn't happen",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think it's going to happen,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Can I tell them it won't happen? Oh, I mean, people need to real, this is the anarchist perspective",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The government will take as much power as it is able to get away with,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not going to be stopped by petitions or Facebook updates,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's going to stop when people, when the state and its enforces will realize if we continue doing this, we are going to suffer personal consequences for what we're doing",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that is the point where people are reaching already,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I was going to say that they're playing with fire, but they did all small summer and spring literally sat on their hands while cities burned and then told everyone there, this is the voice of the unheard and too bad",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You have insurance, even though your business you've built for 40 years has burned down in flames overnight",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Sorry, you're welcome with Michael Malice",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's welcome,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Thanks, fuck",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was a pleasure,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You're in a freedom, hot",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the Buck Sexton Show podcast,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it wasn't the guy giving me a bare hug,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That guy, I call him my hero because that guy picked me up was whispering and my ears telling me going, you're okay",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I got you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have your phone,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm going to get you out of here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These people are trying to kill you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 These people are trying to kill you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I like you here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm just him going, calm down",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't move,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These people are trying to kill you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 We have to get you out of here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have to get you out of here,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then he's just moving around with me,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And at this point, I can't see anything because my whole face is literally",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My whole face is burning like an immense sensation all in my face,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" My eyes feel like you're going to fall down my socket like I have pepper in my eyes, burning",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm trying over my eyes and I can't,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just shut closed and there's a gentleman just holding on to me,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I didn't even know who was holding on to me until I saw the pictures,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The gentleman was there to help,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I hope he's not in any danger and during that, I'm going to try to act fire at him because he had helped me or anything like that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or I truly hope not,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I hope he's okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for anyone who's seen the pictures, please, I hope you guys realize that he really was trying to help me",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Unfortunately, from what I'm seeing on social media, the man that that woman is talking about, this is a photo that was posted online",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The man that that woman was talking about who was putting her in a bear hug to protect her when she was in a very bad situation,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He has been fired from his job,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You might say, hold on a second",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why would he be fired if he was by her own admission, protecting her? Or rather by her own admission, protecting her? That's because a fellow named Tariq Neshid shared a photo of this big, this sort of large white guy with a red beard named Roy Ball, who's a sales representative",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is all online,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is already gone viral,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he worked at Toyota SoCal and this guy, Tariq Neshid, said that he pinned this woman's, this black woman's arms behind her while she was getting pepper sprayed",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he claimed that essentially he was holding her down while she was being pepper sprayed and abused,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She released a video saying, this guy was holding me and moving me away from this and defending me and protecting me",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you think that anyone on the left feels bad about this guy? No, because he's a Trump supporter",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 So they dawksed and lied about a Trump supporter who was doing a good thing that I'm not assuming this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was the video of her we just played for you,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Who was doing a good thing to protect a woman, a black woman who is present at the, at the protest who was getting pepper sprayed and was in duress and he held her and protected her and said, I've got you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's going to be okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the left wing online found out who he was, dawksed him, told his employer, his employer fired him and he's one of the good guys",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you think they care? Do you think the left feels sorry for him or feels bad? No, another Trump supporter scalp",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That's how they view it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is just a guy, folks",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is just a guy that got a photo taken of him that someone lied about,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't think the left is going to come for you too? No, you can only hope or you can prepare",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why is the vaccine rollout going so slowly? This was the most urgent project of government and private sector and science cooperation of the last year of recent decades,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And yet we're hearing absurd, absurd stories of delays of disposal of these vaccines when they can't find somebody who's approved to get them",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you have something that tens of millions of people want and they want it as soon as they can get it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The timing really matters, but we have a circumstance where we're only getting it to about 25% nationally of the people who should be getting it and we're being told that it's because they can't figure out the best way to do this at the state and local level",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that's not really what's happening,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are policies in place that are moronic and they're slowing this whole thing down,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that means that people are going to die who wouldn't have had to die because the government is so incompetent,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" The best example of this that I can point to right now is New York, New York state",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 New York versus Florida has become quite a comparison in recent weeks,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Florida with Governor Ron DeSantis who yes is a Republican has handling a lot of things very well,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" New York just has bone-headed policy, pile-the-top idiotic policy and they're even more you know, Cuomo in particular is even more aggressive about it as the results show up and we can see the numbers and it's not working",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not getting this to people fast enough,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why is that because they make decisions and they tell everybody, oh, I know what I'm doing",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Cuomo tells everybody this is what has to happen so that we can get the vaccine distributed in the most efficient manner to the most people that will have the most benefit,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if you really look at this, you say that's just not true",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In these hospitals in New York, you know what's happening? They're trying to get medical workers and first responders to get the vaccine and some of them don't want it",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You're not here a lot about that in the media, but this is true",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Some of them, oh my gosh, this is the virus that we've all been locked down and we can't see relatives and we can't, but there are people who are on the front lines against the virus who don't want the vaccine",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is a fact,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, what do we do about that? The Cuomo approach from what I understand from speaking to New York officials, the Cuomo approach is to try to convince, to have the, the health bureaucracy, try to convince more of those people to actually get the vaccination",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what happens in the meantime? You have people who want the vaccine, who are seniors who are at much higher risk than younger first responders, much higher risk and they're not getting it",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And some people who fall into that category, I would say it is likely to be hundreds, if not thousands of people who fall into that category are going to get COVID and they will die and it's because the government is not moving fast enough",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" This is, they distribute the vaccine",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is state and local,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's where we are,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The government is not moving fast enough,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now the Biden administration, then we have to start talking about it because it's, it's happening as you know",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Biden administration is coming in and they're saying that they want to maybe just get first doses to everybody and not slow it down for second doses,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, that seems to be a, a, a good idea, but the real idea is just broaden out, get it to everyone who wants it and is at risk as quickly as possible",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what they did in Florida,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They basically said, look, if you want this, show up at a hospitals and they'll be giving it to people there",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And yeah, sure they, they ran out, but that's because the hospitals approach is we just need to get needles in arms, needles in arms as many people as we can as fast as we can",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Who want it? The Cuomo approach is you're going to do this first responders,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You're going to do this, you know, 30 year old nurses, 35 year old doctors or whatever",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're going to take this fire,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, thank this vaccine or else we're going to hold it up",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to wait,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's, it's appalling, 25%",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Think about that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we were at 70 or 80% what the projections were, I'd say, all right, it's not great, but at least we're 25% vaccination",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for seniors, the data does show, I mean, the numbers really do support this",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For seniors, this is a very, a very intelligent decision to get this vaccine",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you're over 65, the people that matter most to me in the whole world who are of that age, I'm telling them, and they all agree",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They all want it because they know, yeah, there's a, there is a chance of this vaccine",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We'll have some side effects and some nasty stuff,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are some people that aren't going to want to take it,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's, that's their decision",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's fine,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if you're in your 70s and you want to live another, you know, 10, 15, 20 years, you want to get this vaccine",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that's my opinion on it",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that might say that",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But of course the, the medical community actually broadly takes that same approach, but it's the politicians who have come in and who have slowed this whole thing down",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the media is too busy playing politics with this to tell people the truth,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The mainstream media has vilified Florida governor Ron DeSantis, according to Fox News, here over coronavirus vaccine distribution issues in Florida",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" While New York governor Andrew Cuomo, as large as they received a pass for his state's problems and people are starting to figure this out, the media research center says the difference in the media coverage of Florida governor DeSantis and New York governor Cuomo is journalistic malpractice",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, absolutely is because it's essential to the Democrat mind as California is having the most cases, the most, the most deaths it has ever had from COVID",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's essential to the Democrat mind to find any excuse or any reason for them to believe that they have done a better job with this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've handled this so much better than the Republicans because we've been led to believe by the media that it's Trump and people not wearing masks that are the reason for these spikes,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, why is it spiking so much in California? Anyone who says it's because of the Republicans in California who don't agree with these men, it's as a moron and is lying to you",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not what's happening,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a Republican,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm in New York City and I have no choice,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I wear a mask everywhere all the time,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, not outside, but and all the buildings I go to and everything else",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I think it's so interesting,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" People say to me, fine, do what you do what you're saying",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't don't wear a mask,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, you're putting people at risk",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I was saying, no, no, I have to wear a mask",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have to wear a mask,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're forcing me to,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're using threats to make me do this thing,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm compliance and it makes me angry that I when I say that I don't want to have to comply with this stuff,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have enough on my own to overturn this,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't have enough that I could actually make them stop the madness,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All I can do is point,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm trying to get them to realize,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, think about it this way",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We had said in all time record for COVID for COVID deaths, right? And 4000 coronavirus deaths in one day",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That just happened that was reported today,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So mask mandates and lockdowns are such highly effective policies that were somehow still setting horrific records for COVID deaths with the highest mask compliance we've ever had nationwide,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And with the strictest lockdowns in states like California, do they have an explanation for this? Do they have any way of making sense of this force? No, no, they do not or they tell you things that you just know is not true",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They just know it's not going to happen,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so or rather, it's not provable based on the facts",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, and this is very frustrating for a lot of us because we sit around and say, I thought this was all supposed to be based on the data",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think this was going to be so clear, right? Trust me, if they had instituted their, their full on lockdown, stay at home orders in California and within within two weeks, cases drop 20%",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all you'd hear about,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Instead cases skyrocket,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, hold on, I thought we were doing, we're taking this action",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you know, this is almost like saying, you know, if somebody had a really high fever, and they were running, you know, running really high fever and they were at risk of dying from organ failure of the hospital",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we kept giving them, you know, their fevers 102 and then we gave them something for the fever and then their fevers 103 and then we gave them something else and the fevers 104 and they're saying, Oh, no, but if it wasn't for this, if it wasn't for what we're doing, the person would already have a, you know, a fever that would go 110, which obviously you'd be dead at that point",31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's not working,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not even to say it's not working,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's so obvious because it should at least show some benefit when you take this kind of of an intervention,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It should at least show some relatively immediate decline,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We have to accept that,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 There's always voter fraud,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There was not enough proof of the fraud because of the way the Democrats change the system in advance of the election to be able to convince a court to overturn the results in even one state,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's where we are right now,31778_The Buck Sexton Show_08-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I said it six months ago during the BLM riots, and it was true then, and it's just as true today",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is about the lockdowns,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are other long simmering causes to the political protests and to the riots,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are simmering resentments,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are simmering infringements of rights,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are simmering views of the country that do not make people like it very much,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the most immediate cause is the lockdowns,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You cannot lock people away from their jobs, throw them at a work, lock them away from their families, from their kids, from their loved ones, lock them away from just regular socialization",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 We saw this within two months of the lockdowns because of the BLM riots,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And at the time, I didn't excuse the BLM riots far from it, but I said, I think the reason why they're torching every single city in the country right now is might have something to do with the fact that you've upended society and locked them all in for a couple of months, two, three months unprecedented",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" Why are they only storming the capital now? Well, it's because of Trump",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 What do you mean it's because of Trump? Because he's saying there was election fraud,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, a lot of people think there was election fraud",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We have safeguards and elections for a reason,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Democrats used to defend them,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Barack Obama said he had worries about mail-in voting,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You don't get to do that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is unacceptable,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And people are absolutely justified in their outrage over that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is an outrage,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I know it's unbelievable in this news cycle that so many things are happening that the big news that they certify Joe Biden is the president elect,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's like the 10th story,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's not even the most important story, but they did, they ended up doing them",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Joint session was there to certify the vote because there were many irregularities in this election,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Some representatives objected to certification and they opened up to bait,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 As is absolutely constitutional,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now I understand the arguments against objecting to the certification,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I do,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think there is a perfectly legitimate argument to vote for the certification to vote against the objections,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think people are turncoats if they do that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Likewise, I think there is a perfectly legitimate argument for objecting to this certification",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We are in uncharted territory here, folks",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Everybody's just trying to grapple along and some legislators came out there courageously, I think, and said we are going to take a stand",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We know it's not probably going to affect the outcome of the election, but we want to go on the record in a legal and constitutional way to say this election madness is absolutely unacceptable",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you had a member of Congress stand up and object to the certification of Arizona,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Are there any objections to counting the certificate of vote of the state of Arizona that the teller has verified appears to be regular and form and authentic? The event I Paul goes on from Arizona,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What purpose does the gentleman from Arizona rise? I rise, both from myself and 60 of my colleagues to object to the accounting of the electoral ballots from Arizona",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is the objection in writing and signed by a senator? Yes it is,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And objection presented in writing and signed by both a representative and a senator complies with the law,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Chapter one of title three of the United States code,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The clerk will record the objection,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Excellent,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is what we wanted,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is what politics is about prudence,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in certain ways, the Republicans here were out, outmatched",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was going to be basically impossible through any legal measure to overturn the apparent results of the election,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, you can go on the record",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can set precedent,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can put other people on the record,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is what Congressmen Gosar did,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's what Ted Cruz did, who stood up and he said he does have the signature of a senator",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Absolutely courageous stuff,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Absolutely in accordance with the law, great American tradition",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think I do wish that there were more spines around among people to stand up on these sorts of things,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I understand the arguments against it too,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uncharted territory, but at least at this point, everybody, I think playing fairly, everybody playing in good faith, everybody playing according to the rule of law and following the constitutional process",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Still very unlikely to change the result, but there would be then at least two hours for debate",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you could air these sorts of arguments that we're making on this show that we've all been talking about for a long time,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then all hell broke loose,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Very important these days to make sure that your home is secure, to know who is out at the front door",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A great way to do that would be through ring so much happens at our front doors,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is one thing that definitely has not changed these days,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It has never been more important to be able to see who is there or what's happening,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is why it's the perfect time to upgrade your doorstep with the ring video doorbell,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" With ring, you can see and speak to whoever's at your door from anywhere right on your phone",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you will never miss a visitor, whether that's a neighbor or a nice, maybe it's your dinner or coming",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Maybe then you stay very, very quiet",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't move and everybody's okay,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" With motion detection, you will get notified",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" So people breaking through police lines, breaking through, breaking windows, going into the Capitol",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They find a pipe bomb at the Capitol,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They find a pipe bomb at the Republican National Committee headquarters,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Very interesting,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You would expect with all these right winners that the pipe bomb might be at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, but it wasn't",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was at the RNC,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just increases the confusion of the day,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Well, we had stormed into the chambers inside",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" A number of police and secret service were saying, get back, get down, get out of the way",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And as we kind of raced up to grab people and pull them back, they shot her in the neck",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she fell back on me and started saying she was fine,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's cool,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Very, very sad stuff",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm noticing a lot of people on social media are saying that this wasn't really Trump supporters,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was Antifa,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have no doubt that there were some Antifa people in there,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Then you saw other photos of people sitting in Nancy Pelosi's office, you know, shuffling around her papers, putting their foot on her desk",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All I guess sort of amusing, if it weren't so serious, if people weren't dying, if it one of the demonstrators wasn't killed because of this, watching the scene, I just, I was, it was a mixture of horror, but not even it would just sort of be amusement, be wilderness",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It was like a video game,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What did they think would happen at the, you get in, you get in, you get the, the pictures and policies office, was it just blowing off steam? Well, there are easier ways to blow off steam guys because do you think maybe, maybe people thought that because basically everyone who participated in the BLM riots got off the hook, didn't have to deal with any legal consequences",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They thought, well, same's going to be true for me",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Just going to face serious, serious legal consequences",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not going to help Trump's staying office,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 President Trump just came out and said there will be a peaceful transition,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was telling them throughout the whole ordeal,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's just so decadent,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know how else to put it,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Overall, like we're all kind of in this together",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That was terrific,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Biden comes out and says that he's calling on President Trump to address the mob and this is not who we are,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You've seen what happens,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know how you feel, but go home and go home at peace",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" People are very upset, of course, because President Trump says this is a fraudulent election",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And fair enough, I guess there's no evidence of that",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The very upending of the election system, the very upending of the way in which the election is conducted, the collapse of safeguards around election integrity",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" To me, that is enough to justify the concerns of the president and the concerns of his supporters, his voters, guys who voted for him, like me, like myself",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We've seen it, especially if you've ever worked on a campaign, if you've ever went local campaign or whatever, you know the focus that is put on ballot security and all that went out the window",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I just think the way that fraudulent election is being twisted by the mainstream media is they're saying it's all with Sidney Powell and Lynn Wooder talking about it,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Doesn't need to be that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Doesn't need to be that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm talking about much more granular stuff,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I guess much, much more sort of quotidian sort of aspects of the election",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How you vote, how you prove that you're the real voter, how voters get mail in ballots, even if they are going to get mail in ballots",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The overall message, very clear from beginning to end of that, of that video is go home, be peaceful and Twitter deleted the video, Twitter deleted the video and Twitter suspended the president of the United States",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look at, took his account away from him so that he can no longer communicate",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Twitter writes, quote, as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violence situation in Washington, DC unprecedented, they burned down the cities four months ago",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What do you mean unprecedented? Unprecedented, I guess because they were in the capital",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have required the removal of three real Donald Trump tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our civic integrity policy,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This means that the account of real Donald Trump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these tweets,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If the tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it remained locked during the certification vote for Joe Biden,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Future violations of the Twitter rules, including our civic integrity or violent threats, policies will result in permanent suspension of the real Donald Trump account",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Our public interest policy, which is guided our enforcement actions in this area for years, ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and or more severe",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Get ready for a clamp down on all of your accounts, friends, get ready because they'll just use, they'll say, well, if he's still allowed to post a link to any conservative opinion, well, that there's a real risk of harm",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Will continue to evaluate the situation a real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter, will keep the public informed, including a further escalation in our enforcement approaches necessary",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Further escalation, what are they going to do? They're going to go in and kidnap the president",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They already took away his account,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Very, you want to talk about this very scary situation",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's the idea that hipster Rasputin over there in Silicon Valley, Jack Dorsey, has the ability to silence the president of the United States, which he does because it's all one edifice",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's all, it's all the same liberal establishment, big tech and the mainstream news media and the newspapers and the cable channel",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's kind of all the same thing and they're all shutting out the duly elected president of the United States,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He is the duly elected president, at least for another 15 days or however long it is, right? He is the duly elected president",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is, should be very worrisome for all of us because it means that this will be used as an excuse to clamp down on all of our free speech and we can huff and puff all day long and say, look, BLM, look at what they did",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They killed all these people and they burned all these cities and you didn't do anything and you actually still allow the BLM account to be up there, but you're taking down the duly elected president",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't care,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't care,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to be an excuse and I don't think the tensions are going to go down at all,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that the left has no interest in bringing the temperature down,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think the left wants to keep the temperature up and up and up,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You saw this, by the way",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At Nancy Pelosi's home the other day, there was violence, vandalism, but it wasn't from conservatives who would appear",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was from the left,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You saw there was red paint there on a pig head on the ground and then you saw spray paint, it said, cancel, rent, we want everything with an anarchist symbol",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 This was all taken,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Never just going around the internet for a while,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Could be a hoax, I guess, who knows? So difficult these days to tell if things are hoaxes, but we've seen it similar sorts of attacks from the far left on the establishment left",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's not much of a reason for it because the far left in the establishment left have the same goals,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just they've got different timetables,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why AOC who's ostensibly the leader of the radical left in the house,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she's opposing Nancy Pelosi who's the leader of the establishment left,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, AOC just voted for Pelosi to be speaker",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So did the whole squad,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They did because they have the same goals,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They just have different timeframes,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 AOC wants it to be a little bit faster,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, you are seeing this kind of violence ramp up",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The media don't want to admit it, but Antifa is more than an idea",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Antifa is a real thing and Antifa has really been burning cities and attacking people and killing people,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" BLM, real thing, and they really do get violent",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if the, I don't know if the right wingers want to admit this or not, but it really was right wingers yesterday in the Capitol",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Didn't burn the place to the ground,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Didn't kill 30 people,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, that's good",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it is a violent tactic,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is an act of political violence to go in, smash windows, go break into people's offices",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That is a violent act,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Which means that we now have a normalized system of political violence,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is in a way, I think, becoming the norm",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We talked about this a little bit on the show in recent days, which is this is a very young country",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The way we know it's a young country is because last month the widow of a civil war veteran died, they said, civil war",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Man, she must have been sold",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, it was because the civil war veteran was 93 when he married her and she was 17",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So good on him,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Really, wow, man, that guy must have been a charmer",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We also know that three months ago, we were in a situation where the grandson of the 10th US president died",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Huh? How's that possible? Well, obviously the John Tyler, the 10th president was much older when he had his son and then same thing, his son",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then still, when you got the grand hit of the 10th president died, that's a young country",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you're going to hear a lot of demagogues on both sides of the aisle, a parat lagon about this upsetting of norms",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we've never seen this before,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And when I say demagogues, by the way, I think a lot of people think I'm referring to Donald Trump because he's got some of these characteristics",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm talking about guys like Mitt Romney too,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm talking about these preening moral cynics who one day go out and march with the people who torch cities and commit political violence,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And then the next day shake their heads and ring their hands,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've never seen anything like this,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump is so terrible,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm the dignified Mitt Romney,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But right now, it doesn't appear to be this way",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we've gone through periods like this before,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Happened in the 1960s, I was not alive in the 1960s was barely a glint my father's eye",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, they killed the president",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The president was assassinated in the 60s,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they killed his brother when he was running for president,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Then they killed the major civil rights leader,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 There was violence in the street,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There were domestic terror groups like the Weather Underground, radical left wing group that set off bombs that committed acts of domestic terror",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was not that long ago,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Was that 60 years ago? Before that, people, everyone at least remembers the 60s, I guess",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Before that, though, we went through periods in the 1920s when you had anarchists in the streets, communists in the street to setting off bombs, engaging in political violence",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The one sort of couple of the names that you might hear in school is Sako and Van Zettie is Italian guys who were committing political violence in the country,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there were other other sorts of attacks like this,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Happened before that too,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 1912, there was an attempted assassination of our president, President Teddy Roosevelt",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 1901, you had an assassination",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" In the 1860s, you had a presidential assassination",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Obviously, that presidential assassination was only at the end of apparently a very bad play, but also a five-year civil war",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 political violence and bloodshed for five years,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How many people, 700,000 Americans died, if you include the Confederate and the Union soldiers together? There has been political violence and there could be political violence again",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think we have just because we're so freaking decadent because we are so bored, because we are so frivolous as a matter of culture and society",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We convince ourselves that can't happen,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not a big deal,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know where it would come on,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's America,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That sort of stuff doesn't happen,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're a young country, a young country that's had a lot of political violence in its past",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Anything could happen,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I just, I wish that the people who stormed the Capitol for their own sake would have just thought through this a little bit and said, what's the end of this? Is the end of storming the Capitol that I'm going to throw a garbage can through the window and break in and then go into Pelosi's office and take some funny pictures, which I'll definitely post to Instagram later",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm going to live stream it to my account,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to be so hilarious and it's going to be so funny,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then at the end of it, what? I'm going to beat the level of the video game and then I'm going to be back home on my couch",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't know what other outcome they thought was going to happen unless they thought they were going to overthrow the government, which they, I guess they actually had a chance to do because they ran out all the, all the legislators, but they didn't want to do that",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Nobody, nobody seriously wanted to do that",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So what? It was, it was just also frivolous",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and now people's lives are going to be wrong",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One woman was killed,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Was it worth it? Do you think, I don't think it was worth it for her to die? She lived a great life",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Served her country, US Air Force veteran, patriotic American to throw it away for, to put, now you might say, well, she didn't think that the cops were in a shooter",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I guess I was surprised too",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And maybe after the way that the cops did not really go after the BLM rioters, maybe you think, okay, it's fine",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I got to tell you, I, I would not break into a federal government building thinking that I could do whatever I wanted, even as cops and were telling me, go away, go away, don't do this, don't do this",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Was it worth it? Was it for the people who were going to go to jail? Was it worth it? Trump doesn't think so,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Obviously not,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What Trump said was we need to have a big, peaceful rally, big, peaceful demonstration",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" I don't think it was irresponsible of him to call for a big, peaceful demonstration",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Conservatives are always much, much, much more peaceful than the left",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Just, just look at the last six months",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But that, I guess that could have sent a message",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Getting on the record in the legislative chambers, that at least goes on the record, sends a message",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I guess you send a bigger message when you drop pipe bombs at the Capitol or whatever,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You go ransacking through the Capitol,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" But what did you think? Now what if you say, well, look, they were allowed into the Capitol even",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Some of the cops were standing down just letting them in,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What was going to happen when you break into the speaker of the house's office and start ransacking her desk? All right,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's enough,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's enough of my rant,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's just, it's very, it's, it's very dispiriting because I think obviously 99% of the people who showed up for the rally yesterday in DC had the absolute best of intentions, absolute part in the right place",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" President Trump saying, be, be peaceful, be, and they were doing a great job",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then for some people to get carried away and to ruin their lives, it's very, very dispiriting",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it makes you wonder what, where's the future of the country going to go? We do have a little bit of insight into this in the Joe Biden picks",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So Joe Biden now, I guess, officially the president elect is coming out in naming his picks for me",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He had leaked a few of his picks for some cabinet positions and they're really bad,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're really radical people,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, his deputy chief of staff who was his campaign manager came out and said that Republicans are all a bunch of efforts, but we'll try to work with them anyway",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So people were not exactly looking forward to the Biden administration,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, yesterday he announced, or it was leaked, I guess he didn't officially announce but it was leaked that Joe Biden was going to pick Merrick Garland for Attorney General",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now there's a meme that after Merrick Garland didn't get chosen for the Supreme Court, you know, to replace Scalia",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These sort of just floated up to heaven and he's up there with Harambe and may he rest in peace and you know, praise be upon him and all that",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Merrick Garland is still a judge in DC and he had been floated a little earlier and people said, no, Biden's not going to pick him for AG because then you'd have a confirmation battle for the judge",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't want to lose a federal judge if the Republicans control the Senate,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, the minute, the minute that Democrats were declared the winners in those Senate races, all of a sudden that's not a big deal because they'll easily be able to confirm the Democratic judges and so Merrick Garland might be the attorney general",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I have to say, to just to give a little bit of political hope, everything is looking so bleak and conservatives are headed for just a world of pain, unfortunately",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the one little glimmer of hope here is I do think of all the people that Joe Biden could have picked for AG, they were all going to be absolutely terrible",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Garland may be one of the least bad people to pick,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the reason I say that is his career as a judge does not make him seem particularly radical,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This was actually the strategy for Obama to nominate him in when Antony and Scalia died in 2016,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He nominated Garland because he said, look, Garland is a relatively moderate guy",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Lots of conservatives have said nice things about Merrick Garland before,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So no big deal, right? You've got to confirm him and obviously the Republicans were not going to confirm Garland",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They were going to wait until the presidential election,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mitch McConnell held firm on that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then after the after the election, you know, you got the Republicans win, we nominate our judge, we replace Scalia",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So now Garland has become this kind of mythical figure on the left, even though it's ironic because I don't think he's like wearing the pink hat, you know, I don't think he's going around to biker bars with Antifa or something like that",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so in any case, if he were to be selected, they would be I guess better than the alternatives",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Times Comey came out the other day, said he as as now many Democrats are saying, Trump needs to be prosecuted",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump needs to go to jail,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They need to take away all his money,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They need to ruin his family,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" James Comey of all people came out and said, no, the former president should not be prosecuted",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And of course that what would he be prosecuted for? First of all, they'd have to invent some ridiculous charge",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Though they they do say that you can you can indict a ham sandwich,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That it would be that would be a further evolution of our descent into banana republic dictatorship,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we were to put our former presidents in orange jumpsuits, that would be the next stage of degradation",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 I hope it doesn't happen,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think even for people like who I think have pretty clearly committed crimes who are Democrats, I still think it is unsavory in this country for us to put former presidents",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can put other people other staffers and things like that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there is something unsavory about putting former presidents in orange jumpsuits,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I was pleased at least to see that some other people around Biden have said not a good idea to to do that,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have a very strange concept of justice in this country,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You hear the left, which is going on and on about how I mean the former vice president, I guess the future vice president, Kamala Harris was was posting fundraising links for bail for the BLM and the Antifa rioters over the summer, posting, posting fundraisers for springing them from the clank",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And yet we're hearing from Democrats now we got to arrest every right wing rioter who broke into the Capitol yesterday,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Obviously a little bit of a double standard here,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're told by the left it's very good to kill a million babies a year through abortion, but we need to let the worst killers in the world off the hook",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And you're going to hear this in the final days of what it would appear to be the final days of the Trump administration,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got a number of executions that Trump has sped up because hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there were people who have been languishing on death row for decades,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And finally they're going to get their just desserts and the left is very upset,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So the most recent one who's scheduled to be killed is Lisa Montgomery,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Lisa Montgomery is the so called room reader,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's facing the death penalty because she was convicted in 2007,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She befriended a pregnant woman online and posed as pregnant herself,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She then drove to this woman's house,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It pretended to be somebody else, but she got the information figured out where she was",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then strangled the pregnant woman, took the bait, cut the baby out of the mother and took the baby away",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it was finally then arrested,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is as gruesome horrific heinous crime as anybody can imagine,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you hear left wingers still saying and even some of the squishy right wing people saying, oh, you have to, it's a matter of justice",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got a letter off the hook,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think so,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think one of the big, big, big problems in this country is that our sense of justice has been totally skewed",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It has been perverted,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And the way it was perverted actually is by this new standard that was foisted on this, which you can call political correctness",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You can call it locism,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can call whatever there are different names that it goes,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But what what it represents is a new standard that replaces the old standard,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And according to this new standard, men can become women and babies are not really human and mass murderers and rapists and people like that need to get off the hook",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 But people who commit lesser crimes need to be thrown in prison and they throw away the key,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 That that's going to be a really tough one as well,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as long as we're living through the looking glass right now in this world where we're stuck in our homes, largely we can't go see our loved ones",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are losing civil rights,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" We are not permitted to go to church even even that, the basic consolation of life",51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're not going to be able to write the ship,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're all going to be in this distorted tense perspective,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Hope things get better,51353_The Michael Knowles Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Will Congress allow the US to default on its debt further destabilizing the US's position as a global economic leader? Well, we know that they passed a so-called bill, but did it really resolve debt?

 Right,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The most violent thing that happened was that this unarmed female Air Force veteran was shot to death by someone on the security team there,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Of course not,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is not these were protesters that went in,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 But what let's put this in this whole city's were burned over this summer,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Washington was in flame there,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The cities were taken over,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because this is relatively last serious than what we saw happen,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the media has never held responsibility for inciting some of this and giving a lot of promotional air time to all of those riots,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, holding them up his role models",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And we all know that that's a disaster,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you think this is going to escalate or deescalate? Well, I think what happens is when you tell half the country, don't believe your line eyes, you know, Fox News this morning, Brian Kilmeade Steve Ducey, we're attacking the president, blaming him for what took out place of the Capitol, blaming him for the loss in Georgia",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Both of them I would deny heartily,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Nobody at that rally yesterday ever incited anyone to do anything improperly or violent,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I said they were read the riot act by the owners of Fox News, who owns the post, of course",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they were told which way the wind blows and what they had to say,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that's what's going on here,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, they work for the Murdoch suit, apparently, hate Trump",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, I think it's one of the reasons Newsmax TV are ratings are way, way up there, like skyrocket or OMA, but almost by a factor of tense and selection day, people are watching us on their cable systems",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're on all the free OTT channels like Roku, Pluto, YouTube",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I think people are voting with their remote controls and they're going to podcasts like Michael Savage and they're going to get information that they're being denied,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Fox used to be really good,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just shocked by what they've done and how they've turned on Trump,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I don't know the ins and outs of that or what actually is going on in Rupert Murdoch's mind other than he's going back to what you just store in Fox News,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They work for him,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's the editor in chief in essence,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And when a boss tells you to do something, you do it or you're out the door because when I see which way they're going here, what did they suddenly become Democrats at Fox?

" I think as kids, I think there's a big division that's been reported that the kids will control the trust",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're running a lot of the media organizations right now,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think there is pro-Trump or conservative as the father has been,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so, and I think we're seeing that right now, I really doubt that Rupert Murdoch's ordering his reporters to go after Trump",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the truth is, again, he's 90",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And we've relied,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've allowed the country to only have one conservative news channel now for 20 years of very dangerous thing and they definitely want to go more left,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And everyone knows that and that's why your numbers are high,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's a fair conservative channel,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not like a nutcase right wing maniac channel,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's the reality, Chris",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, and I think you've been always fair",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, they'll do a lot of spin about you or me or I'm just like I spent half my day dealing with",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They'll say yesterday we were promoting NT for there,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a couple of media,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We were not promoting the NTSA,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We said that with Trump supporters going in the building,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now there have been some people in social media making this claim,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We keep saying there's no evidence of it,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you know, it's the smear game that they play",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then they want to put you on the defensive,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And these are guys,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Chris, you're a smart enough political operative to understand that there are a Jean Provaca tours in all crowds",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And I wouldn't be surprised if there was a real investigation done, especially that guy with the horns and a war paint who was seen at NT4L",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They had to have been some skateboard pod head on Tifa mixed in with the crowd who caused a little bit of the mayhem,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that's irrelevant,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The 99,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
9% of the crowd were Trump supporters,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They were riled up,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They did go over the top,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They should not have taken over the port,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They should not have bashed in windows,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And of course the security got who killed that poor woman should be prosecuted the full extent to the law,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 because he killed her,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was on arm,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that's a topic for another time,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I know your time is very short,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're speaking with Chris Ruddy CEO of Newsmax, not only the Newsmax website, which I have quoted for years ever since I was on radio now on the podcast, but your TV outlets, your TV show, rather, your TV outlet, Newsmax TV is phenomenal",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I have been on Newsmax TV many, many, many times",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I love Newsmax TV,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm not here looking for a job, but Chris, I love you, Newsmax TV outlet",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Where are you going from here? I think we should change the name to Savage Max TV,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stop it,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, you know, you know, I know that I'm not a competitor",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know that I know, but hey, Chris, you don't know I'm now a competitor to the Newsmax TV",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" John Voight's friend, Steve Paul started a new network called, I think, JCT Vig or something? JLTV",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was a Jewish channel network that they've had for years, which they're converting to news and they want me to be the anchor and I said, no, no, I'm not an anchor of anything",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we did our first show yesterday,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Savage's news on that channel was very funny,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, it's a good channel and I know those guys over there, I know Phil Blazer and Steven Paul now and JLTV is a terrific channel and, you know, it's great because it gives me a fair balance sense of news and it's coming from a Jewish channel",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Chris, where does Newsmax go from here? If could you disclose any of your future plans since you're growing so quickly? Well, we are growing",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, since election day four million people have downloaded the Newsmax app, which is on your iPhone and Android and it's free",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So what is amazing and people keep talking about our Nielsen ratings, which are really high and we're beating a lot of the, we're now the fourth rated cable news channel on Nielsen and in America",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we are number one when it comes to OTT because Fox doesn't stream for free nor doesn't it seem in them as NBC,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't watch what is OTT Chris,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What is OTT? OTT means over the top television and the way people get the video streaming now when they're not part of cable on on Roku or their boxes at all,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're smart phones,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's huge and it's now we think about 50% of all TV viewing takes place now when you get Netflix for instance, that's OTT",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why are you getting it on, you're getting it outside the cable system and it's, and that's the future and we're there",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're, we're the main place people are going for news OTT and I think Fox is in is, if you add like if we get a million viewers, we probably have another half million to a million more getting us on YouTube live and Roku and things like that and their, and their smart phones",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so news specs is already a very dominant force powerful force on on cable news and now OTT news,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I can invite some of the homeless people in to be a guest host,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We were there,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We were,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We were there for years and years and I do,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I just want to be upfront about that,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't blame you,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But you know, he's the problem, Chris",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Caddy in your listenership because the poor guy, 16 years, all of his death",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 He was never elected president,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The people have been awakened and all I can say to the other side is this, if you keep calling us names, if you keep calling us Nazis, who clocks clan members, white supremacists, what you saw yesterday is just the beginning of what's coming tomorrow",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Back off and understand that we are Americans as well, learn something, learn from America",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're not all seditious evil Americans,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And we're not all ashamed of what happened yesterday,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This has been a very trying time for all of us in America,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You keep putting people down,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to react,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Or as I've quoted before as Gertr to the great 19th century philosopher wrote, if you take a man as he is, you make him worse",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" If you take a man as he could be, you make him better",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You keep talking about us,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I include myself in that crowd,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not going to distance myself,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I wasn't there, but I understand what they were coming from",52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do I approve of them breaking through? No,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Should they have done it? No,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But a mob is a mob is a mob,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You can't keep putting people down over and over again until finally they will snap,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the beginning of a new America,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we the people have to live with Biden and the Harris,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And only God can save us from the leftist mobs that day unleashed on this nation,52386_The Michael Savage Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 You're in the Freedom Hot,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the Buck's Sex and Show podcast,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Get more from Buck by following him on social media at Buck's Sex and on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All of us are faced with two choices, both of which are lousy",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One choice is vote against the objection,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And tens of millions of Americans will see a vote against the objection as a statement that voter fraud doesn't matter isn't real and shouldn't be taken seriously,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And a great many of us don't believe that,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" On the other hand, most if not all of us believe we should not set aside the results of an election just because our candidate may not have prevailed",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so I endeavor to look for door number three, a third option",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And for that I look to history to the President of the 1876 election, the Hayes Tilden election where this Congress appointed an electoral commission to examine claims of voter fraud, five House members, five Senators, five Supreme Court justices, examine the evidence and render to judgment",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what I would urge of this body is that we do the same,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That we appointed electoral commission to conduct a 10-day emergency audit, consider the evidence and resolve the claims",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For those on the Democratic aisle who says, say, there is no evidence they've been rejected, then you should rest in comfort",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If that's the case, an electoral commission would reject those claims",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But for those who respect the voters simply telling the voters, go jump in a lake, the fact that you have deep concerns is of no moment to us that jeopardizes, I believe, the legitimacy of this and subsequent elections",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can handle the truth,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And ultimately the truth is what this is all about, getting to it, finding out what is real, what is not, what actually happened in this election",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is essential our entire system rests on the premise that we believe there is a good faith and there is a fairness in the operating procedures of this Republic,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Senator Ted Cruz there speaking well to that point,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And yet do we feel any better about it today than we did yesterday? No, of course, we feel most likely considerably worse",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why is that? Let's first start with why people were marching in DC yesterday,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's start on that issue because it's many things,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The media and the focus is on those who believe that this was a stolen election,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that is certainly a big part, perhaps a majority of all of the concern and anger out there on the streets",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what else was motivating this? Why do people feel the need to take time out of their lives in a very difficult year with a lot of stresses around us because of COVID and everything else? Why would hundreds of thousands of people gather together in DC to make their voices heard? We have been drifting as a nation toward a culture politically, socially, where there is no middle ground allowed",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no dissent allowed,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The rights of political minorities are increasingly trampled on,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And there is an incredibly powerful system, one that even goes beyond what you've seen and some of the other authoritarian regimes of history in that it is entirely capable of leveraging information technology, the global marketplace, wealth on his scale that human beings have never seen to brainwash, to control, to determine",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it feels like a rigged gate,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It feels as though what we do does not really change very much,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it feels as though we're not allowed to even raise that up anymore and talk about it publicly for fear of being ostracized by these social media companies that I know that we have to get used to this idea,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Social media is not something that kids use now just to say hi to each other and communicate,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Social media is a dominant force in the flow of information in this country and around the world,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is more powerful than the traditional media because it determines what traditional media you get to see,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Wokeness,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is another way of describing political orthodoxy of the left and wokeness is ever evolving because ultimately its true goal is not changing society so that everybody is equal,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Its true goal is just power and then it will figure out what it decides to do because it doesn't even know what it wants,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 Why does it feel like there is an inherent schizophrenia in the Democrat left's woke ideology because there is,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 There are multiple personalities at war with each other inside of the Democrat mind on this issue because you can never be sure that you're woken up,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It has to constantly evolve and seek out new targets,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's effectively a colonial project for the mind,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is dominating your consciousness,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's what it seeks to do and that it can entirely control you and then figure out how to create an entirely equal society and what would that even look like as we know societies that put the greatest emphasis on achieving absolute equality, achieve the exact opposite and history speaks very clearly on that",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" So people are upset because of all of these things and then also we have suffered through the single worst year in terms of our individual freedoms, in terms of government overreach, of my lifetime",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they use this idea that the government can protect you from COVID to justify all of it,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" They use the notion that if you only listen, you'll be saving lives, you'll be protecting people",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you're not willing to listen, if you want to dissent, you are putting people at risk",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Let's all understand this marching in DC,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am I was so pleased that people were overwhelmingly marching,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this whole thing about being a peaceful, marginal, let's let's set a different standard, a law abiding march",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 Now let's talk,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So why am I giving this preamble? Now let's talk about what happened at Capitol Hill because I had a lot of people, you know, I lost, you know, Twitter followers yesterday, not all of them obviously, but I like probably thousands of them and I had people that are writing to me saying, you know, what is the establishment done to get to me? Okay, just put aside everything else for a second, but put put aside that, you know, like so many others in my generation",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Let's just look at this tactically,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're having, we're having a hot wash here, friends",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" What was the point of people going inside the Capitol yesterday, breaking the law, breaking windows and, and engaging in that behavior? What was that for, for, and I'm saying put, put aside whether you think that this is called for or not for a second",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And I have been very clear that I think that this was, I've called it a blunder",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I call it a blunder on Tucker Carlson show last night with four million people watching,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But what was it going to accomplish? And I know it, I, it's we, we can't make people looking me there",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, and some are, some are going to turn off, they're going to turn off the radio, right? No, the Trump podcast",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am your friend,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are in this together,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I'm speaking to you with respect and honesty because this audience, the, the, the greatest honor of my, my life to date has been the people to listen to this show in the numbers that they do with the trust and the respect that they do now going on many years",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so I speak to you with that in mind,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And those of you who have met me in public, no, I, I light up",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I love when anybody from team buck comes up to me and says, Hey, are you bucks sex? Then I like your show or something",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It makes, every time it happens, it makes my day",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Every time it happens, it makes me feel like what I'm doing here is work well because invariably all, all the people that do listen to show that I meet in real life and that reach out to me and that I talk to and everything",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're such good people,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's that there's a fundamental decency and kindness and they're just solid,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're just solid Americans,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so that's how I view everybody listens to the show,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so that's why I also speak to the same way as I said, I would have there been some incident within my own family",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What was it going to accomplish to have the stormy capital Hill? It was going to do what? I mean, and for anybody who, I know a lot of you agree with me, by the way, and a lot of you feel like I'm, but there, there's, there's a contingent out there of people who are going to be listening right now and their approach will be, Oh, buck has gone soft or, Oh, I thought you supported this and, and I look out, I'll take all that heat and that's fine and, you know, all of you are more",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
than entitled to your opinions,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I'm going to, I'm speaking to those people now who disagree with me on this, but at least open to hearing my, my reasoning on it, or at least open to hearing why it is that I'm taking the position that I do",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What was it going to accomplish? So, so I can take a step back, what does BLM and what do Antifa think they accomplish by doing what they do? So we'll put a hold on even answering the question",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What does BLM and Antifa, what do they think they get out of, burning down stores, looting, rioting? And yes, I know they over the Kavanaugh hearing that, you know, flooded into the heart Senate building, uh, protesters, you know, went in there and huge numbers and this, this happened",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They took over the Capitol building in, uh, and was constant years ago, leftling protesters",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I know, but all that, why do they do that? They do it to intimidate people",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 They do it so that every day Americans are scared to oppose them,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is about fear,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is why they loot and burn down and destroy it,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And it's about exercising their own feelings of rage and, and it's about self, it's self gratification and intimidation",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's why they do it,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just going to say it,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not who we are,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not who we are,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And everyone can get to get mad at me and everything else,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, I would ask you this, would, would any of you ever think if I was with you at a march that I would say or that I would even in my own, go run up and, and smash a window and punch a police officer in the face because I'm upset about politics, that's what was happening yesterday",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So we know why BLM, we know why these, these groups do what they do and why it's wrong",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What was the purpose yesterday of going? And I, it wasn't an insurrection",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It wasn't a terrorist attack,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I understand all of that,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of course, and we'll talk about the media double standards",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What was it going to accomplish? The sad part of it is, you know what it did? You know, because you know, it didn't change",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not going to change the election,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's not going to change anything except it emboldens our worst, most dishonorable opposition",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It emboldens the left and we are going to be paying a price for this now on the battlefield of ideas for some time,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, I'm telling you the truth and you know that there is a lot of double standard out there about this and yes, we should address that and we will in a moment",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Everything things through the walls of our capital, our property, going inside the capital, sitting in a speaker poloses office, casually take pictures of themselves, have that played on Fox News, they know that they are not in jeopardy because the cops are taking selfies with them, walking them down the steps to make sure they're not hurt, taking care with their bodies, not like they treated Freddie Gray's body",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why Americans aren't afraid of the cops? Why Americans are never afraid of the cops, even when they're committing insurrection, even when they're engaged in attempting to occupy our capital to steal the votes of people who look like me, because in their minds, they own this country, they own that capital, they own the cops, the cops work for them, and people like me have no damn right to try to elect a president because we don't get to pick the president, they get to pick the president, they own the president, they own the White House, they own",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
this country,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Disgusting,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, you need to hear that though, disgusting",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Did she not have access, she works in a news organization, did she not have access to the internet? A woman was killed among the people entering capital shot in the neck and there's a video of it and it's graphic and I do not see the need for the use of lethal force under the circumstances",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't see it,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've talked to, I've talked to a friend's mind, a law enforcement, I'm saying, you know, what is there some, you know, barricaded public official exception or something? I, I, she wasn't an imminent threat to anybody",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He was killed shot in the neck through a door, but they still go with the preferred narrative about this",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have now we have to disassemble the lies of the left around what happened yesterday,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Where we were, what we were doing when we turned on the television and watched the events yesterday, it is searing in my view and I for one will never look at a maggot hat again without thinking of this day",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And if you are a decent American, put away your maggot hat, put away your Trump flag, remember what those symbols were used for on this day",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" As this is settled down there, buddy, it's not a 9-11 moment",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are 3,000 people died on 9-11",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" Good, good heavens",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This was, this was people making a bad decision to run on capital grounds and destroy property and someone lost her, one person lost her life as a result of what happened yesterday",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I'm, I'm still waiting to hear what the justify, I've seen the video",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The video to me does not look like a justified shooting at all,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I, there, this was a particular circumstance, you know, if you were, if you were barricaded in your home, and there was a mob outside coming through the door in the window, that's one thing",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" If you're in the halls of Congress, I, I'm open, I'm open to being told I'm wrong on this from what I see, not a justified shooting",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and think about this, if that person could be shot, could you open fire on all the, on all the riders? Would you open fire on all of them? Because the, the standard would seem to still be in place that any person that's smashing windows and going through doors, you can shoot them if you're capital, he'll police",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" So that, that needs to be looked at much more thoroughly than what we've seen so far in the public discourse around it",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But this is where I tell you about the tactic, the tactics part of all of this and the assessment that we have to do now of what, what, we, what was lost as a result of this for the movement, they, they are going to play this, they're going to exaggerate it and they're going to pretend that this is the only political violence we've seen in this country is that in raging? Yes, it is",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is it a lie? It absolutely is,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The answer is nothing,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I just want to know what, what would be for those, for those out there who think that this was a, in any way, understandable",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" No, can't, can't do it",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the left is now going to use this in everywhere,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to ram this down our throats for more authoritarianism,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and for what? Right, there was, there was no gain from it",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know people get mad at me,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm, I'm telling the truth",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this, if someone wanted to baby on this, we'll have to be at any person on this issue",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because it's important that we get this right,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We either have principles or we don't,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We either, and people are going to tell me, oh, we have to fight the way that they fight really? Do we want, I mean, and let's let's then, let's then take that",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's step further,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do we want a, a right wing antifa? Do we want a right wing group that goes around destroying stores, attacking people, the, the answers of course not",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" But if you were going to say that sometimes we just got to break into a building because there's, there's no options left or if you're going to tell me that, well, then where does that, when does that go away? When, when are we able to do that? And I, I have to say now, now we need to understand we need each other more than ever because the stuff that the left is going to be saying about this for a long time to come is they're going to leverage this one a lot",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I would, I wouldn't be surprised, you know, social media has already, you know, they've done this",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They have banned Trump from Twitter, the president of the United States, they have banned him from Twitter",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have banned him from Instagram and they have banned him from Facebook as of today,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they're going to keep the bans in place until the transition of power happens,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have media companies now openly and actively saying they are suppressing the sitting president of the United States until there's the transition of power,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" All right, that there's no, there's no need to do that",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no reason to do that at this point,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And I, I think the president, the president saying that there is, that there is election fraud is true",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The president saying that we have unanswered questions about the election fraud is completely fair and proper,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, but taking it to this point now where there's a belief that the, the election that we don't, we no longer have to respect the results of the system as they stand",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, now we're talking about rejection of the system wholesale",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And let's all be very clear about that,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if that's where you want to go, you're heading down a very dark and very dangerous path",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's not what we want,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Oh, I have the ducking while their multi off cocktails are flying past their heads",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's not fair,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's wrong,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the way we win is by convincing and showing enough of our fellow Americans that this is disgusting,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's disgraceful,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They support me,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're the reason I have a job,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's like a nothing but love and respect for them,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I, I tell people, even the people closest to me when I think that they've made a mistake",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I owe that to all you and I said to my family last night and they got blessed and they backed me up,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I said, guys, I've, I've got to be Prince of, I've got to be true to myself to this work, to the audience to be principal at this point",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And, and that means, uh, staring, staring into what, what is happening now and telling them what I, what I see happening",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't think that you would find a radio hose to a scene more things, more trends, big trends coming in, in recent months than I have, particularly when you look at lockdowns and masks and all these things",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, it's interesting",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I actually went on Michael Malice's show who is quite an interesting, quite an interesting guy",31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I wanted to show maybe almost exactly 12 months ago now,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I said that Democrats would refuse to certify the election,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was my prediction on his show,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And here we are with a lot of Republicans who don't want to certify the election,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I saw something,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just didn't see which side it would be coming from,31781_The Buck Sexton Show_07-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's a day that ends in why which means that President Trump is doing something to irritate the media, which means that in the words of the apparently immortal journalist, Carl Bernstein, whatever Trump is doing is worse than Watergate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not Deja vu,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is something far worse than occurred in Watergate,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We have both a criminal president of the United States, the Donald Trump and a subversive president of the United this is the ultimate smoking gun tape",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" It is the tape with the evidence of what this president is willing to do to undermine the electoral system and illegally, improperly, and the immorally try to instigate a coup in any other presidency",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This tape would be evidence enough to result in the impeachment of the president of the United States and really an immediate call by the members of Congress, including of his own party, that he resigned immediately",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we need that call because this of course is worse than Watergate, just like in September when Bob would or when Carl Bernstein rather said that President Trump downplaying COVID was worse than Watergate or 2019 when he said that President Trump's phone call with Ukraine was worse than Watergate or in 2017 when Bernstein said the Russia probe felt worse than Watergate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Most things I think are worse than Watergate,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" My favorite comment from yesterday's from Jeremy's rans who said didn't Kamala say she was Jewish to she's literally celebrating every holiday, pandering",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, of course she is and now she also is apparently stealing lines from Martin Luther King and anecdotes from Martin Luther King and pretending that that was her own childhood",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The issue with celebrating every holiday, of course, and you see this from so many liberals who say, oh, happy Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwan's, uh, some solstice, a festival, all these sort of things, the problem with celebrating every holiday is then you are celebrating",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No holidays, really what you're celebrating is a kind of liberal multiculturalism",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's the real religion you're celebrating because if you're celebrating Christmas, then you are not celebrating the pagan holiday of if you're celebrating Hanukkah, you're not celebrating Kwan'sa",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You got to, when you make one choice about religion, when you have one religious vision, that necessarily excludes the other visions, but pandering Kamala Harris doesn't, doesn't want to do that sort of thing because the real religion on the left is secular liberalism",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Not very, uh, not very good for our country does not make us feel very confident about the future, does not make us feel very secure in our beliefs",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Very often doesn't make us feel secure even in our own data in person, which is why you got to check out lifelock",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is important to understand how cybercrime and identity theft are affecting our lives,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can miss certain identity threats by just monitoring your credit,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Good thing, there's lifelock lifelock detects wide range of identity threats",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For instance, your social security number for sale on the dark web, if they detect your information has potentially been compromised, they will send you an alert",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We've been talking about them for a very long time,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Go over there, protect yourself today",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 CNN would save a lot of money on contributor fees,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If instead of paying coral Bernstein, whatever they've been paying him for 50 years, they or however long CNN's been around I guess 40 years, they just had a wind up doll and it looks like coral Bernstein and then they pull the tab and then when when they let go, it's at worst on Watergate because that is the only reason that he is employed by these networks",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not I'm not nearly making fun of coral Bernstein,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is actually the media strategy,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The only reason that guy has a job is so that every six months or a year they can trot him out on TV and his jaw, the role that has been scripted for him is for him to say that whatever non-troversive today is out there is worse than Watergate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In this case, we as president Trump had a phone call with Secretary of State of Georgia and said, there to be ballot security",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I look, there was tens of thousands of ballots that look very fraudulent to me and we're only down by whatever it is, 11,000 or 12,000",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So look into those ballots,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Otherwise, this election could be one through fraud on the part of Joe Biden and then they leaked the phone call and then they take one little two second clip out of it and then Bernstein goes on and says worse than Watergate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The reason I got a little flubbed up in the introduction,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I said, Woodward accidentally instead of Bernstein because those were the two journalists",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and Bernstein, who's the one they trot out more often, is sort of like the Ben Affleck to Bob Woodward's Matt Damon",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, Bob Woodward is the one who has at least some talent and Carl Bernstein just kind of kind of went along for the ride",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Beyond all of the nonsensical allegations of worse than Watergate that we hear from Bernstein every six months, think about some of the scandals on the left",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Watergate has been blown up into this massive, massive, the worst possible scandal ever",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It wasn't actually in the grand scope of presidential scandals,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It wasn't all that big a deal compared to say allegations that John Kennedy stuff the ballot boxes through the daily machine in Illinois in 1960 to steal that election, perhaps from Richard Nixon, LBJ famously stealing his Senate seat in 1948 in Texas",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That one went all the way up to the Supreme Court and the court simply wouldn't hear the case,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They didn't even rule on it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that is what landed in the vice presidency and then after Kennedy's assassination in the presidency,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How about Barack Obama spying on the Trump campaign in 2016? That seems worse than Watergate,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How about Hillary Clinton's campaign colluding with a foreign adversary, ironically colluding with Russia to put together the bogus steel dossier to try to subvert the Trump campaign? What about that? That's certainly worse than Watergate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Give me a break,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't want to hear it anymore,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't want to hear anymore from the left,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'll hear about how Nixon was the most corrupt president,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nixon was nothing compared to Barack Obama,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Nixon was, you think Nixon was dishonest? That guy's nothing compared to Joe Biden, who at least would appear to be about to ascend to the presidency",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nothing compared to Hillary Clinton,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Give me a break,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They do this also with McCarthy,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'll always hear about McCarthyism and this awful McCarthyism during the early 20th century when this awful senator pretended that there were communists working in the federal government,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There were communists working in the federal government,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" There was a communist to help found the United Nations, his name was Alger his, and he was a very high level employee at the State Department",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was at the DOJ before that,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He was a convicted communist,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I suppose it was after the statute of limitations that run it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's all book about this called witness, but Whitaker Chambers",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the book that turned Reagan from a liberal into a conservative,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For all of McCarthy's flaws, for all of Nixon's flaws, they were men with flaws like everybody else to posit them as the kind of supreme evil of political scandal",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's completely ridiculous,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's a way to distract from the legitimate democratic scandals,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, we've been hearing a a lot over the past few days about how Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and better dozen senators, along with a hundred to 150 Republican members of Congress are going to object to the certification of the electoral college results",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what this means is you had the vote on election day, then who knew there was a long process in some of these states where they just kept finding votes under a rock underneath the dresser, or lift up the couch cushions, they find some more votes",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then there were some questions about how these votes were counted, transparency, poll watchers in Pennsylvania, the violation of the state constitution pretty blatant",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so then it goes to the electoral college, the electoral college voted",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then finally, the electoral college votes are red before the House and the Senate",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" This has happened many times, Democrats have done it much more often than Republicans have even very recently",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And famously, we had this issue in 1876 and which a result in the compromise of 1877 more over",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're going to do it again,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you're telling me I've got to forget about what the Democrats are doing right now, present tense because it might set a bad precedent for the future, even though the Democrats are already doing it right now",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This reminds me of what what we always hear from the squishy Republicans on big tech censorship,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They say, we can't ever use the government to stop the left from censoring conservatives right now in the here and now because if we do that, then they might use it to censor us in the future",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I don't even remember his name,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And of course, he doesn't know the meaning of the word amen",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Amen does not have anything to do with the male or female,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We're all correcting him,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that's the wrong strategy,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that completely misunderstands what's happening,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Conservatives are getting this all wrong in the same way that they get political correctness wrong more generally,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

" That was the little, I guess I was in the 90s, people joked about that",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The let Tnex thing is being totally mainstreamed,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He or her, sir, being totally mainstreamed, the singular they, being totally mainstreamed",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Now you better say a man or a woman,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 Brahma is the name of the pagan deity from South Asia that is a foreign deity in the United States,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there's the establishment of a new standard,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this new standard is secular liberalism,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And the new standard is enforced by politically correct speech codes and politically correct behavior codes,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The way to actually fight back against this is to publicly say amen a lot and really believe it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I think they're now called WW because these new changing standards say you're not allowed to criticize being overweight,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're not allowed to suggest that's better to be a healthy weight than an unhealthy weight,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The left is always understood this,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The left is always understood that there are always limits to speech and behavior and conservatives in fighting against political correctness,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think we just believed our own abstractions a little too much, but this was true according to Thomas Jefferson",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" This is true according to John Milton, the greatest defender of free speech in the English language, Rhode area, Pajitica",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" If this left is tears tumblr is a tumblr, then it's not a frisbee",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I can't call it a frisbee,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I'm really permitted in society to call this thing a frisbee, then communication totally breaks down and we have no way of speaking to one another and our reasoned self government devolves into a bunch of grunts and violence and raw passion, appetite, and self interest",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Increasingly, that's the country we're getting",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's not just Cenk with all these kind of new silly racial standards,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's another one,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Three, three acts that were nominated for the 2021 Best Children's Album Grammy Award",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Didn't realize there was a Children's Album Grammy Award,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Three of them declined their nomination because they were white,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Kid you're not Alistair Mook, Dogon Flies, and the Okey Dokey brothers",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's like I'm reading something in the Babylon Bee,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These are all musicians, I guess",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They said that the lack of black nominees has them turning down their nominations,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mook, one of these guys, his album called Be a Pain was like a bat martin Luther King and Rosa Parks and Harvey Milk, who is an absolute derelict, but he's been turned into a sort of a gay civil rights leader, but he had a very shady life",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So his whole thing is about this kind of woke identity politics,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This guy said that to have a slate of all white nominees is really tone deaf,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He'd love to win a Grammy, but I don't want it like this where the playing field's not even",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What's your evidence that the playing field's not even? What's the better album? What album do you think is better that was made by some person of color? What is it? The mere fact that your white doesn't mean you're bad? I mean, this is actually, this new standard is why sort of white identitarian people were able to get a little bit of a foothold a number of years ago because there was this campaign that was going upwards and said it's okay to be white",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And it was obviously a troll and people reacted against it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They said, how dare you can't say that it's not okay to be white",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" What if people started tearing down posters that said it's okay to be Chinese or it's okay to be a Zambian or it's okay to be French or I don't know, they probably would do that",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's frankly, it is not okay to be French",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" But how did we, how do we devolve from sort of tolerance, justice, you know, being nice to people, that sort of thing to there's a new rigid caste system and white people shouldn't win Grammys",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" This actually is also at the heart of the amen thing because while conservatives are busy laughing about how the word men has nothing to do with the meaning of the word amen, the problem is not the etymology",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's the premise that men are bad, right? Because then if you just see men in anything, you should just take it out that the man is a bad word",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 It's not,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The idea that now there are these certain groups who are bad and we've got to remove them from society is a vicious evil unjust idea,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And you got to get rid of that,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Amen,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And the way that conservatives responded is they kind of giggled about and said, Oh, ha ha, have silly, have funny",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The actual response is no, no, you don't get to rewrite every single word and you don't get to redefined every single concept and you don't get to cascade whole swaths of the society half the population or a little less than half the population as evil and wrong",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't get to do that and we're not going to permit you to do that,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 So quiet down that this is a big problem of identity politics,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And the the practitioner of identity politics par excellence today is the presumptive future vice president, Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris doesn't believe a single thing",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" She wakes up in the morning, licks her index finger, puts it up in the air, figures out which way the wind is blowing",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So Harris tells the story to L magazine couple months ago,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Senator Harris started her life's working on,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And the adults caught up in the rapture of protest just kept on marching by the time they noticed little Kamala was gone and doubled back,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She was understandably upset,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My mother tells the story about how I'm fussing,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Harris says, she's like, baby, what do you want? And do you know what Kamala said? Fuydom",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fuydom,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She even mispronounced it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh my gosh, what a story, right? Never happened",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Never happened,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Just like Kamala smoking blunts listening to Tupac in college before Tupac's album came out, just like Kamala Harris celebrating quanza before quanza even existed",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This story also never happened,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And that little girl was Kamala Harris, except it wasn't",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It wasn't because Kamala Harris would have been one year old at that point,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as far as we can tell, she never hung out with Martin Luther King",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She just stole the story,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She will not really be called out for this,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Conservatives will laugh about it, will make fun of her",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We will point out the absurdity of it,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then she will likely become vice president,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And not, and the media won't mind won't be really in part of any of her biographies",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Kamala Harris never talks about her accomplishments in politics,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You'll notice she's never the one who goes out and says, Hey, you know, when I was a attorney general in California, man, I put so many young black eyes in jail",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 She doesn't talk about that,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But she does she there was some criticism of her actually for that on identitarian grounds,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But she doesn't really talk about anything she's done,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No laws, she's passed",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No particular cases she's worked on because that's that's not what she views to be her political value,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She views her political value to be the color of her skin and her sex,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
" And that's very pathetic, but it's what she trades on",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's why she prattles on about made up stories about quanza and made up stories about talking about freedom at protests ripping off Martin Luther King,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's lies lies lies,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And in the meantime, we're being told by the left that we can't listen to conservative officials, conservative politicians because they're the liars, not at the left",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's that is the lie goes back to Methusela goes back to imagining things that never were in saying why not,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now Jake Tapper has committed an offense that I absolutely cannot tolerate,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Jake Tapper is saying he will not have Kaylee McEnany on his show anymore,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is terrible,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm furious about this sort of thing because Kaylee McEnany makes all of our political hearts go pitter patter,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The reason he won't have a run, she lies",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, there are some people that are such, um, they're just so mendacious",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 And there was no value in that,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't view Kellyanne Conway the same way,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 she was the senior advisor to the president,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Uh, she was more of a filibuster and a subject changer",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I feel a subject changer,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what she would do,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And, and there is a, there is a, a risk in just like lumping everybody together",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a big difference between something like Kaylee McEnany who just like, this is what she does",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She tells lies all the time,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She can't acknowledge reality,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS

 Kamala Harris does,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, she just lies like air",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So does Joe Biden,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's why he had to drop out of the 1988 presidential race all those years ago, because he was already just, he just would lie like he breathes, right? He would, he would go out",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He would steal people's speeches,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He would make up,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He made up facts about his academic history that were completely bogus,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you think Jake Tapper's going to have Joe Biden on? Do you think he's going to have Kamala Harris on?

" And we're going to have this vote that crews and Hawley and other senators are leading tomorrow on certifying or not certifying the, the electoral college",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And some people are a little more excitable about this than others,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Probably the most outlandish claims have come from the lawyer Lin Wood,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Lin Wood has come out and said, Chief Justice John Roberts and other powerful individuals are caught up in a blackmail plot involving the rape and murder of children",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is all being run by the international intelligence agencies,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, the reason why this even is being brought up at all, the reason why anybody believes in this is because the intelligence agencies have lied to us for a very long time",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they have very little credibility,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 My interest here is not in sussing out whether or not the Chief Justice of the United States is a psychosexual sadist,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But what my interest here is, is more how these sort of theories come about because what the left is saying is that the right is so dishonest and the right has no care for the truth and all we do is listen to fake news that these sort of conspiracy theories crop up and that's really all, all of our fault",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The reason that Lin Wood can go out there and say that the Chief Justice of the United States is a child rapist and murderer and have any single person in the country believe him is because Jeffrey Epstein existed, I guess he doesn't exist anymore, is because if, if Lin Wood goes out and says there's an international cabal of extremely wealthy influential pedophiles and, and sort of rapists and all these sorts of things and that involves heads of industry and heads of state and even royalty and prime ministers and presidents, the reason he could say that",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Prince Andrew had to resign from his family over this,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So real, that's a real scandal, okay? And then Jeffrey Epstein gets a sweetheart deal when he finally gets pinched on this stuff and the sweetheart deal according to Alex Acosta then US attorney is because Epstein belonged to intelligence and because Epstein's associate had direct ties to foreign intelligence",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's the fault of these guys who abused their power went specifically when it comes to the 2016 election and trying to overthrow Trump,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the fault of Bill Clinton,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 People always tie Trump to to Jeffrey Epstein,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're remembering Trump kicked Epstein out of his club, right? When he studied was a shady character",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm not saying there was no association but very different kind of association than you saw with Bill Clinton,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's how,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And I don't look, maybe Lin Wood is a complete nutter might be sort of appears that way",51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's not the Conservatives fault,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the left's fault for doing this,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,HS
 And they do it not even just through these institutions,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They do it in the language itself,51355_The Michael Knowles Show_05-01-2021_transcription.json,Non-HS

" We went over 15 minutes, and it still didn't feel like we got to the bottom of everything",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think especially because he's so new on the political scene,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We want to further look into his ideas,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to be very clear at the beginning of his interview,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He has not said that there's anything off limits that we can't ask him, which I always think is, I just like to hear that",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Yeah,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Wonderful,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So obviously the first thing that we want to discuss is what's happened here in Nashville this week, another horrific shooting this time at an elementary school, three nine-year-olds that have been killed",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have found out that the shooter was transgendered,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" Obviously not every school shooter is transgendered, but it does bring into question a lot of your ideas",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

" We have the same number of guns in this country as we did in the mid-1970s, even in the early 1970s",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's changed is mental health conditions in this country that we need to have the courage to address directly,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I want to come back to the trans issue,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" I think the right answer here, though, the most important issue, we'll get to the trans element of this, but we've seen school shootings, as you said, from people who are not trans",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 I know this is difficult,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're a national,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're a parent of young kids,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a parent of young kids,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think it is in a front that we will protect banks in this country or shopping malls in this country or the thousands standing around, as I like to call them, the TSA in our airports in this country",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Put federal marshals on airplanes without protecting our kids,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Something I've said in this presidential campaign is I have committed to shut down the US Department of Education,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's $83 billion that flows through the US DOE,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That by the way, subsidizes these trans ideologies, these gender ideologies in our schools",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" That's a big part of why you see that in local schools, is the US government foists race and gender ideology upon these local schools",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, what I say is you could take a quarter of that, I'm in the math on this, Candice",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A quarter of that budget could put two to three armed security guards in every school, at least every public school in this country",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You tell me which is a better use of actually funds, protecting our kids physically to make sure something like this never happens again or foisting poison on them using the Department of Education to do it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Protecting children is actually one of the core planks of my entire platform,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a lot of different ways, I think, about psychologically protecting children",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think the top way we've got to do it is actually literally physically protecting the kids we send to our schools,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the number one takeaway from me from this tragedy,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I love that you pointed out the fact that the same number of guns that are present today were present in the 1970s, that we are on the brink of a mental illness epidemic",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I say this is in large part due to the fact that people don't even have the courage to call mental illness, mental illness",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just relate back to my childhood and growing up in school and learning about gender dysphoria,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" It was literally listed in the DSM-5 as a mental illness, a mental condition",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 Now you are not allowed to say that because the science has changed and it's actually not the mental condition and they say that now we need to affirm these people and that it is possible to pick your gender,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" How do you even address something like that? I think we have to address it with empathy, Candace",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If somebody is a kid at home who says that I'm in the wrong body and I'm of the wrong gender, different from my biological sex, that is a smoke signal",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are raising their hands begging for help and guidance because clearly something else has gone badly wrong in their lives,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think that the idea that the humane thing to do is to then affirm that gender, then engage with chemical intervention, potentially with physical or surgical intervention",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not humane,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 It is cruel,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think that what we need to do is wake up empathically to acknowledge that kids in their youth, in their adolescents go through tough times discovering who they are",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's this gender dysphoria epidemic and it is an epidemic in our country,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 It's just a symptom of a deeper loss of meaning and identity that we need to actually fix,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the role for adults,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the role for parents,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's the role for teachers to step up and say no, something is not okay there",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not that I'm villainizing you as a kid who's lost,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's that we can't even engage in being empathetic towards a kid, actually reaching out and figuring out what's going on at home, what's going on at school to be able to get to the bottom of it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I reject that,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a friend of mine even who was locked out of Twitter,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is a separate point,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not operating the way it was supposed to under Elon yet,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to work with Elon to actually fix this for even expressing ideas like this,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's fallen out of the overton window, what you can express publicly",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I think that, and this is part of my broader worldview even in my campaign, Candace, I think we can go further with the America First agenda, with the American revival if we do it from the stronger moral foundation",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so I think that's one of the things that I want to see restored is moral authority in our movement and hear the moral authority when it comes to dealing with kids is that every kid actually matters so much so that I'm not going to stop myself from as a parent or as a teacher from helping a kid who's effectively crying out for help, claiming that they're transgender, when in fact there's something else going wrong in their lives, no, we will stand on the right moral footing and help those kids rather than to fall prey",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
to this new orthodoxy,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is how we cut through this nonsense,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So well said,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I know I do hold a lot of contempt for the individuals that are adults that are pushing this and there's an element of this that I believe to be first and foremost, obviously a social contagion",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There were always individuals that had gender dysphoria, the sharp increase that we're seeing is I believe in large part due to the fact that when you go on a TikTok or you go on to Instagram, you see parents that are getting attention for affirming their children",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These parents like the attention that they're getting and so they push their children further and further into this dysphoria,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I had commented earlier this week on a show that maybe you had seen or not seen that was on TLC, I Am Jazz, where we all watch jazz as a young boy essentially transition",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's been eight seasons now,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Jazz has had four gender surgeries and is still depressed, has gained over 100 pounds and says that he still doesn't know who exactly he is",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So this brings me to my next question and speaking about social pandemic and social contagions, you had what was considered to be a controversial tweet",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Some people wanted you to further explain about how you would address social media,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I find myself agreeing with your take on the danger of social media for the youth,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Can you expound upon your ideas? Yeah, so this is part of my broader, as I said, it's a core element of my campaign to really protect the next generation of Americans, literally physically",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think that's something we can do in our schools, but also from the different psychological poison from the physical interventions through this gender transition epidemic in our country, through the gender and race ideologies that teach children to become victims",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" But I think as part of that, it's not just in our schools",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think the algorithmic amplification of that through social media makes a difference too,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So one core plank is that the same way we treat addictive cigarettes, okay, to say that you can't smoke an addictive cigarette by the age of 18 or in some cases 21 or addictive alcohol, we have to apply that same principle with respect to algorithmic exploitation of children as well to say at least by the age of 16, if you can't smoke an addictive cigarette by the age of 18, if you can't have an addictive drink of alcohol by the age of 21, it is completely inconsistent to say that we're going to feed you effectively",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
digital fentanyl by the age of 13 or 14,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I refuse to abide by that,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think that the objection we hear, the reason it's controversial even in our movement is that that's considered a restraint on liberty",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the argument that I hear,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I actually have strong libertarian instincts in my own bones,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, I used to call myself a libertarian a decade ago",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't anymore for reasons we can talk about,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a conservative today,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But here's the thing, even the most staunch libertarian would not claim falsely that adults are the same as children",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 They're not,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think for the same framework that we say that we treat children differently from adults, this is one of the areas where these algorithms are designed to prey on insecurities",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mark Zuckerberg was a year ahead of me at Harvard, okay, Facebook was founded the year that I, during my freshman year of college",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But actually the predecessor to Facebook was hot or not,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'll remember this,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

 What was his insight? His insight is you can prey on human insecurities to cause you to click on something faster that gives him a window into my soul that's deeper than I have into my own at a population wide level,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that was the backbone of building a multi trillion dollar industry,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Here's my view, if you're going to do that to adults, fine, it's the job of a society and a job of an individual to have enough conviction that doesn't lend yourself to exploitation",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's fair game as an adult and that's a separate debate we have to have in our society,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But kids have not yet formed that psychic fortitude,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can't have that expectation of kids,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So why on earth would we purposefully expose children, not yet fully formed free agents in the world to something that's going to poison them? And not just in the short run, but have long lasting effects on their sense of self confidence on their ability to think independently",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we're going to treat cigarettes and alcohol that way, it's totally inconsistent to treat addictive social media like TikTok differently when it's used by a 12 year old or 13 year old",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I refuse to stand by as a bystander reciting some slogan that we memorized in 1980 failing to recognize the real threats that we face today,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I would say Candace, that is part of my broader plank of really protecting our children in every way for the next generation of Americans to actually thrive",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Birch Gold will help you convert an existing IRA or a 401k into a tax-sheltered IRA and physical precious metals like gold and silver,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's time to start thinking about your investments and your future,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You need to consider diversifying into gold with birch gold,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Text Candace to 989898 to claim you're free and foked,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

 So text Candace to 989898,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I was not understanding people's arguments",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, you can't come for our social media",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We want to have freedom,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" It's like, it's the exact same argument that we make in terms of saying why children can't come to their parents and say, I don't want to be a boy or I don't want to be a girl",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They don't fully comprehend exactly the decisions that they're making and how it's going to impact the rest of our lives,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I thank God because I am an adult and I can understand the implications of social media that I did not have access to it just because it didn't exist while I was a young person coming up and we see these suicidal rates that are increasing because a child makes a mistake, says a bad tweet when they're 11 years old or a child is on Snapchat and something embarrassing gets circulated at school",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are seeing 11-year-olds commit suicide over Snapchat,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There does need to be a radical answer to this and I do think that children's brains simply need to be more developed,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And since you mentioned Snapchat, I was actually just sitting across the table from someone earlier today who actually, earlier this week, excuse me, who actually knows somebody, he showed me the picture of a 13-year-old kid, you bring up Snapchat, who actually thought he was buying Percocet via Snapchat",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of drugs are actually dealt two kids via Snapchat because of the disappearing feature of the message,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But actually that Percocet was tainted by fentanyl, which is a totally separate topic",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But again, there's a 13-year-old who died and that would be bad too if that was a 22-year-old Candace",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But there's something about a 13-year-old that makes him particularly vulnerable to that form of exploitation,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think that this idea of treating kids the same as adults in the realm of social media, when we would not adopt that same mentality in any other sphere of our lives, highlights the inconsistency",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think that whether it's school shootings, being a passerby and just saying that even though we could literally be applying excess budget that we're spending on thousands standing around TSA at the airports or $83 billion through the Department of Education to actually indoctrinate our kids when we can't protect them",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" To say that we have a regime that will somehow prevent a 20-year-old from having a sip of alcohol, but we're not actually addressing the real threats to our preteens and our early teens",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I refuse to stand by as a bystander when there are obvious solutions hiding in plain sight to protect the next generation,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 And I think we need leaders with courage that unshackle themselves from these prior orthodoxies we memorized four decades ago to actually deliver real solutions to the actual threats of 2023 because it's not 1980 anymore,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I just want to mention to people that are listening to this, not to forget the fact that a lot of these individuals that created these apps and you wealth these people in our society send their children to schools that do not have social media",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I worked for a few of these families coming up and it's incredible to see that they know that it's harmful,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They don't want their children exposed to it, but they're happy to make money off of your children being exposed to it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just super important to note,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to shift gears here,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We talked about one last note on that one last note on that, Ken, since you brought up that brilliant point, it's a great point",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know a lot about the Silicon Valley,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Same asymmetry with respect to China,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So China is fine with TikTok existing as it exists in the United States, but the version of TikTok that exists in China promotes math and engineering",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it's the same point you just made,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Silicon Valley versus the rest of America vis-a-vis China versus America as well, which is such a good point you put on",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Wanting the children to be addicted to math and science seems like a better deal than it existed to making meaningless videos on TikTok, the version at least that we have in America",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, let's get into foreign policy",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're talking about China,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We got tons of questions, a huge miss on my property",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I really didn't have time, guys",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I promise to ask you about your thoughts on Ukraine and Russia and the billions and seemingly endless billions of dollars that we are sending over to there,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'll be clear on a few different things here,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 First is I would not send another dollar to Ukraine,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 I think we've already we already have spent far more than we should have,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I would not have handled this the way that President Biden did, but I'm running to be President in January 2025",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I will tell you that I will not commit,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, I will commit not to spending more money in Ukraine, but we've got to go deeper than that to understand what actually put us in this position in the first place",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So a big part of what happened is the lack of energy security in the United States,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's the dirty little secret a lot of people don't know about Biden's spending on Ukraine,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" With one hand, he gives $110 billion and counting an aid to Ukraine, 40 billion of which was direct cash aid, 60 billion in kind in military contributions",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, with the other hand, this is the part people don't know Biden was the number one world leader who lobbied the EU against its ban on Russian oil imports",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why is that? It's because we ourselves shot our ability in the foot here at home to produce fossil fuels, including both oil and natural gas, which increases Europe's dependency on Russia",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So think about that with one hand, we're sending $110 billion to Ukraine, yet with the other, we're effectively lobbying the EU to take steps that would actually allow Putin to continue financing his war machine",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the senselessness in all of this is the idea that our own lack of self confidence at home,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think it is a lack of self confidence problem, a self loathing that causes us to actually take steps like we have in shooting our fossil fuel capabilities here at home",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's what puts us in a weaker position abroad,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 I also don't want to conflate my position with just saying I'm rooting for Vladimir Putin to win this war,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just think that this is a problem for Europe to deal with on its own terms,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So you want to talk about being the leader of the free world here,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not a commentator,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm running to actually run this country,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's get into the specifics,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what? The real problem is it's Germany,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" Germany is the issue because we have 40,000, some are tens of thousands",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" I think it's about 40,000 US troops stationed in Germany",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Germany is holding up Poland from sending fighter jets to actually help Ukraine because Germany has a say over one part that's needed in some of those fighter jets that they're able to use export controls to be that stops Poland from doing what Poland wanted to do to send fighter jets to Ukraine,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, I don't blame Poland for wanting to help Ukraine because Poland shares a border with Russia",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So the same reasons I stand for America first,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't criticize Poland for standing for Poland first,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, Poland's an ally of the United States",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So if you want to go and beyond just the usual anti-Ukraine funding talking points that have you'll hear from a lot of other candidates who recently came to that position because they deemed that was the popular thing to do before retreating from it when their donors tell them that's not the popular thing to do,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not a flag that waves in whatever direction the wind blows on a given day,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I also believe in being clear about where I stand,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's true that I will not give more money to Ukraine,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I know that's probably what your listeners want to hear from me,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just saying it because that's true to my actual views,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I also think the deeper problem is a fixing our energy independence problem here at home,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I would actually take steps to pressure Germany to say that, you know what, if you're going to get in the way of one of our allies protecting its own self interest, then why on earth are we stationing 40,000 troops in Germany and Germany's not going to love it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we say we're going to remove many of those troops who are stationed idle in Germany, which I think that there's no good reason for us to have that many troops in Germany in the first place, that's how I would actually lead to be able to just go beyond the talking points here to be able to actually advance American interests without spending American resources on fighting a pointless war from America's standpoint in Ukraine",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" My top foreign policy priorities are protecting our own border, not somebody else's border",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think it is legitimate to use our military to do it,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is controversial in our defense establishment,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It escapes reason as to why,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I'll just tell you, even many of the briefings I get, this is a very controversial topic in the defense establishment to use our own military to protect our own border",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I actually would go further,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think there's an opportunity to use our own military through targeted strikes, drone strikes, airstrikes, etc",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we devote intelligence resources of the kind we spent in places like Iraq and Syria through the NSA to take on ISIS, we could apply a fraction of that to actually end the fentanyl crisis south of the southern border in the failed Narcos state that is Mexico",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 That's a top priority,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that's a symptom of a deeper problem that we face, which is actually taking on China, which ought to be by and away our top foreign policy priority",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I have called and this will not be easy, Candice",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I will admit this to you,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There will be some sacrifice we may need to be willing to make to declare independence from China because I think it is impossible for us to succeed on the timescale of history if we're economically dependent on our arch enemy,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was never true of the Soviet Union in the last Cold War,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 We did not depend on them for the shoes on our feet or the phones in our pockets,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yet today, because we are, we stay silent",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If that were a Russian spy balloon, we would have shot it down and ratchet up sanctions immediately",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 We didn't do it to a Chinese spy balloon because we're scared,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If it was Russia sending actual fentanyl, not digital fentanyl in the form of TikTok, I mean, like actual fentanyl across our southern border, killing 100,000 plus Americans per year, including right here in my home state, Ohio, where it's a big problem",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" Would we be standing idly? No, we would not",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're standing idly by because it's China and we're scared of them,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 Why are we scared of them because we're dependent on them? And so I intend to lead this country in a way that doesn't take us to war with China,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 I think there's an opportunity because Xi Jinping did what autocrats do,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He shot himself in the foot last year to take his third term to hold on to an unprecedented third term last October,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 China is in a weak spot and part of my sense of urgency to run for president is I understand this Chinese problem deeply,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
" I've been an exchange student in China twice, including at the Harvard of China",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've done business in China,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I understand this problem deeply,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think China is in a vulnerable position where if we pull the economic rug out from under them now, declare independence now",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I can talk about how I would do that,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think we can defeat them economically now,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 So we will never have to militarily later,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think we get a radical reform of the CCP in response to that if we actually have the courage and conviction to deliver, that's going to take a real leader, likely an outsider to do it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a big part of why I'm in this race,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, let's actually focus on that because that makes me feel good that you say that you believe that China is in a vulnerable place",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't feel the same way,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm watching the buildup of the Spratly Islands, which is something that it's unbelievable that they were allowed to do and nobody spoke about it",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was just like, hey, we're going to build an island out here and we're going to say that we're going to control what goes on in this sea",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why do you feel that China is vulnerable at this moment? It's economically vulnerable,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Economically vulnerable,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think militarily, sadly, their naval capacity is ahead of where ours is, which does not bode well in the South China Sea if you play out the war games of Isabee, Taiwan",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's a separate dimension to this that nobody else is talking about that we can come back to, which is actually the role of India",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 India is willing to cut off the Indian Ocean,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's actually how China actually gets its energy supplies from the Middle East,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a big lever that nobody's talking about that I am focused on,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But back to the broader point about China's economic vulnerability, the zero COVID policy gutted at China's economy last year",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that the irony is Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy had about as much to do with COVID as the US climate called has to do with the climate,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Both are just forces for dominion and control on different sides of the Pacific, but Xi Jinping went further",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He also actually just read the news today,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Alibaba is now breaking itself up at behest of the Chinese government into six separate companies and Jack Ma is nowhere to be found,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's just an example of why he's actually scared the Chinese business community into submission,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that tames the inner animal that has actually the inner beast that has allowed China to grow at seven plus percent for most of the last couple of decades,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 That's attenuated over significantly over the last year,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I think they're in a vulnerable spot,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Xi, how do you know Xi Jinping is a vulnerable spot? The white sheet revolution, you know what I'm referring to there, which was last year Chinese protesting the zero COVID policies",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 The only way they could protest is they would get arrested if they said something so they all held up an empty white sheet,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 But he buckled to that,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that there's a vulnerability and he knows it,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so I think if the US shows up, so what I'm about to state is an extreme policy",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm going to be very honest,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's an extreme policy that I espouse,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I think if we show up and say that most US businesses, maybe even all US businesses are banned from doing business in China, from entering the Chinese market, unless and until we get this list of reforms from the CCP, no theft of intellectual property, no theft of data, no mercantilist practices where you force US companies like Airbnb to hand over data",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By the way, there's Chinese laws that then prevent them from disclosing that back in the US and these what you'd call mercantilist practices",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not capitalism,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's mercantilism,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,HS
 Then here's what I think we get,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Right now, China would say would call our bluff",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They'd say, you guys are so addicted to us",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't do it,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's like the Joker in the second Batman laughing, right? You need me is the line",5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's the way China looks at us,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You need us,5472_Candace Owens_2023-03-29_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I have no idea why that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Who yes, provided the incorrect answer for last week, but correctly predicted what was to come",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Good on you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we're going to talk about Vox a little bit more,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is something that I think people need to understand because the Vox ad pop clips started trending after,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's why you guys actually weren't on the show,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We just started live streaming and we were all asses and all those,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was trending for hours afterward,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Oh yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we saw this groundswell of people who are not conservative,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was not in the political echo chamber at all,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They started jumping it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And by the way, people start jumping in everyone from even conservatives attacking you at that point because everyone just wants to get in on the trend and have their opinion heard",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So don't believe everything you read both on the plus and the minus,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't a lot on the minus,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's be honest,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's probably true,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But here's something important that I think a lot of people don't realize,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They think this is a new, it's not",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Vox is a long history of specifically targeting competitors and more specifically individual creators,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let's look at some of the tactics that they've been using for a long time to get people deplatform,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I should say not people, the competition where it's an individual channel like you guys or like this channel or a big corporate channel",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't matter,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have no idea what kind of wars they have between vice,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Could be like West Side Story over there,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just in the show,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Only in Chelsea because we know that they wouldn't be in downtown,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 I don't know where it's at Sory takes place,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of Puerto Ricans down somewhere,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think they have an order,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They only have Cubans and Mexicans which are not allowed to say not at all,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let's start by realizing that this isn't just going to end with our platform or demonetizing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mazda is the guy at Vox for people who don't,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He is the gentleman in scholar Latino origin who happens to be attracted to members of the same sex and that's brave and beautiful,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He wants physical violence against voices he disagrees with,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's called for his followers to attack Trump supporters, milkshake them, mob them",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what is this considered borderline content because we never get these answers from YouTube,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Calling for physical assault and battery,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or you know what maybe that's on the line especially considering that not much later after these tweets Trump supporters were attacked in the exact way described,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Action meet reaction,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Exactly and people would be like oh it's just a milkshake you know grow a pair,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's assault by law if I think there's like a specific definition that was battery qualified as battery and then if you create like a scratch or something like that there may even be a salt charges like that's what if there's acid in it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have no idea,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Somebody's about to get thrown something,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have no idea what's in there,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can I rock it could be any kind of thing like so,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't want anybody throwing stuff at leftist,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No I don't want anybody throwing it at all,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Listen to all that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Listen to Gallagher,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's just part of the show,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What would you guys do if someone threw a milkshake at you? Oh they go to sleep a little while,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't want her in too bad,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My pop a couple of reeds,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A couple of things,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it'd be,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's just some of the real world,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's say this is fine to do the politicians by the way in Canada our prime ministers get pied that's an actual thing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well that's actually not only walk up with a Boston cream pie and push it in the face but rotate it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's like a cartoon like what is this always happen to me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It happens all the time,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no secret service in Canada,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But in real life if someone just whipped the milkshake at you you're not a politician you're not a public figure,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Would you kick the person's ass? A stranger whipped the milkshake at you or your wife? Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Probably not going to stop there,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What do you think? You got to protect yourself at that moment,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not going to be hot,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Go ahead,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I could tolerate it if it's me but if it's my wife oh you got to go to this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah you got it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those are coming off,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is my philosophy,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Any time you put someone in a situation where they even could fear for their life or they have you've now actually forfeited your right to live,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Remember the knockout game? Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know who you are,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know that you're playing a knockout game,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know that you're going to slap me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All I know is you're trying to fool wine me or someone holds someone hold you at knife point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I can't know that you really just want my wallet,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have to assume that because thousands of people ever year go all the way I have to assume that you're willing to use the knife,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have to assume that you're okay with me smacking my head in the concrete,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have to assume that you're willing to put acid in the milkshake,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Therefore now it's not ideal,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But if you do that and you put someone else in that scenario you forfeit your right to live,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Sorry,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Them's the brakes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now of course don't throw people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is that a collar violence? No,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't let anyone violently assault you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a call to defense,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 By the way Tweets are still up,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Tweets are still up right now,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's also tweeted also,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's fascinating people he dislikes on Twitter and it's kind of a joke,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We joke a lot but you're not exactly about assassinating people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's have Ben Shapiro in seven parody,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what? Okay strike that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We'll probably joke about assassinating people at some point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I want to have the past fair play,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fair point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fair point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Oh I thought you were about to say something there,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Fair point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is something else,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 If you look at the olympics back to you Stephen,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You look at the olympics,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You just something you know and you're bright part there and the poster is talking about,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Saul and ski that you know the rules for radicals,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He talked about accusing others of doing what it is that you are doing yourself exactly,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So Vox, Maza, Vox by proxy they encourage actual physical violence",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've called for actual targeted harassment campaigns,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But then they accuse other people of doing it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's important to note if he says look they're they're inciting violence,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No you actually have,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's verifiably proven,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You tried to coordinate mass flagging campaigns,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And by the way he's also claimed this is something that may specifically that I'm the perfect YouTube creator because of this divisive environment,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's kind of isn't that odd concern that YouTube gave a $20 million grant to Vox,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I want it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Did you know that? That's a lot of money,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why the compliment is 20 million dollars,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The perfect YouTube creator,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah but I ain't got no luck,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I do I mick you know,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I ain't got no 20 thousand 20 million dollar failed locker,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I can't imagine what I would do with 20 20 million dollars,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That'd be fun though,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Vox is talking about making all the ladders,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just their content is is cheap and it's easy,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We spent what you said they said we spent a month on these videos when it comes to copyright in research and interviews,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're talking in front of a JCPenney's catalog bed sheet,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 If it took you a month to do that and we refute it within the day,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean that's a telly that maybe you have too many people on staff and that's why they're walking out of your headquarters today,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Exactly that's about that's about the time it takes to rebut one of those videos,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 With actual sources by the way,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Exactly that's a time it takes us to go out there and find information that rebuts what you said,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And if you were any any good at your job you would rebut that right you're not,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The thing that we've done though is strongly discourage people from harassing other people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're not in the harassment game,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're in the telling you the truth game and sometimes we have to throw in a lot of comedy in there just to make it a little bit more palatable right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well sometimes people don't want to hear it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I do it on accident,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're just a bitter pill that follows the sweetie,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've never rallied this very very clear point that you've been accused of this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have never rallied anyone to go and harass,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They cannot prove in any way yourself other than me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Behind the scenes it happens all the time,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And by the way by the way we have we have real we said this at the outset we have bonafide black people in the studio is Stephen away supremacist and morning june,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Well you can't take nowhere I'm only about 54 percent black,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that that works 54,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's totally fun,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just made to cut,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Come on now,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're black,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Just by the pigment of your melanin,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Just barely,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stephen's awesome,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's no racist,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Check in the mail,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So deep platforming this is something I really want to talk about quite a bit,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is if there's a difference between someone getting deep platformed incidentally,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is again I keep saying his name Mazar for those who aren't familiar with he is the gentleman in scholar of Latino origin who happens to be attracted to members of the same text who works at boxes book beautiful brave beautiful Mazar this guy getting a long name,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Brave beautiful Latino get it came from medium matters now for those who don't know a lot of you are the political echo chambers and I know not everyone here is necessarily a policy wonk so a lot of you may not be familiar are you guys familiar with media matters,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a website that exclusively exists just to try and boycott sponsors of conservative shows,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all it's the only reason it exists,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah after this you guys I'll show you guys have to go check it out,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he said that the reason he went to medium matters his goal was to quote take down Fox news that's very important for you to know that's his background since being a box he's made video after video after video about Fox news which coincidentally is what spurred all this recent Fox news runs the media and we rebuttered it said well what about you I guess that's a harassment by your device,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Vox and this guy who is their attack dog who goes out they never engage in arguments,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They only try to get people deep platform,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Deep platforming is what they call in Quebec his raise own day,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This whole reason for being for humans like scalps,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Keep in context we've never once,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think anyone in this room has ever once tried to get anybody deep platform,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 On the flip side we just want to get past this bump in the road right now so we can go back to creating content,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maza,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Vox their ideal content is a story of successful deep platform,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 If only we could shut them up or take all of their power away,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 That is absolutely how you end up in a place like that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you say you can't critique, you can't have a different opinion",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can't rebut what we say,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" They say, well, free speech really isn't free if someone else has intimidated",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't think black people were intimidated when they couldn't vote? Look at all great notes here,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 So look at all great civil rights achievements in the United States,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They start with speech,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you stop the starting point, they can never bud",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's just remarkable to me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You do not help people in minority classes by stifling speech because eventually someone in my jaw, majority will choose which minority speech to stifle",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Exactly,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so this is the perfect thing because it's actually turned on him,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's already started to turn on him in his place,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So he's unleashed in animal and he's already saying you should be able to see, okay, maybe I don't want to walk down this road",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe I don't want to be the one deciding because tomorrow somebody else could decide,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, he's loving it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's about him,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's about Vox,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to make sure that it's about a billion dollar company and independent creators were always a target,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Not just myself,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's why you see people who are just historical channels now,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You should just cover issues that might be controversial and they're not even right wing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Independent creators as a whole always been the target because it's about you to try and change their entire business model,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so we're going to do this for a long time,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've made videos repeatedly trying to get Twitter and YouTube to change the designs and standards,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is something that's been going on for a long, they've been very open about it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And I think, you know, Vox just, it sucks it, it jumping into the arena of ideas and competing",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It can't just jump in and say, these are our ideas and we're going to back it up with facts and we're going to rub that every video that tries to rub out us and we're going to handle every argument",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to bring on people who disagree with us so that we can show you their argument and defeat it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By the way, of course, anyone from, anyone from Vox, anyone of their, well, welcome to",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" What they made the statement, Vox, they made it very clear that this is not about demonetization",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's about removing all voices from the platform that they deem to be harassing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, okay",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How do you measure that? What they don't like,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're clear about it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Whatever makes you feel uncomfortable, even though you do the same thing, but if it makes you feel uncomfortable and somebody does it to you",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" To me, it's frankly a marvel that you guys are still allowed to walk any digital landscape",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" That's crazy, right? Yeah",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Which one must work out? We came up load for the next two weeks,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why? They removed some videos from 2015,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They said it was harmful and dangerous,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What? Yeah, it was just fandill videos",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're just doing what you call fence football,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all we're doing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, really? It was a little sponsorship",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Sure,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there was more to it than that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, that was it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I reached out to my YouTube manager,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She doesn't say anything,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She just puts a link to create a support,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, okay",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, it's just like you're one of those MCN, like the network",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't have it in CNN,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, I think you found out",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We got dropped by ours,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So they come with us,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We'll protect you when this happens,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hey, this wouldn't buy",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I don't blame them,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Listen, most people are f**king",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I really don't,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a trend,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Honestly, the half-age alert Bill Richmond is like, why don't we just start our own MCN? I'm like, I guess",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Maybe it's something we can start up because these other spots, you're just going to play ball with YouTube",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And what's going to be really clear? Well, we'll sign, well, we're not going to sign you guys",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't think we have enough lawyers on retainer or enough white gabby,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We're not in the business of a talk about this quite a bit, making predictions or putting clickbait out there",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But yesterday we did release hours before it hit,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We had exclusive leaks that boxed the ad-pocalypse was going to be coming for you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It did,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Within the hour, countless people, I don't even know how many they were posting the lost monetization",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is it hundreds now? Everyone again, from education channels to just plain comedians like this channel",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Commentary channels, all kinds",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" We're like, yeah, I'm trying to do it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Then they call them,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Actually, got it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they're like, what happened to me? Surprise",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What are you thinking? And some people are like, what did you defend Alex Jones? What? We had him on the show",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We had him on the show for several extended news,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I agree with him on almost nothing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But that's, so I guess this is the problem is the infighting of people being so mature and wanting to get in on a trend and trying to just wedge in personal attacks or personal compliments",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of this stuff isn't accurate,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But at this point, it's really beyond politics",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These weren't right when they counsel,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Many of them weren't even political accounts at all,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I need you to understand something,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This isn't going to get better,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is going to get a lot worse,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to get a lot worse unless you get active,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But here's a silver lining,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think a lot of people may be are looking for a silver lining,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The backlash is far worse, far, far worse from YouTube creators",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Not conservative people, but people who understand the kind of ramifications that this could have for their channel",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And these are the people who create the content on YouTube,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These are the people who built YouTube,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right? This is something else that I think people need to keep in mind,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You guys have been partners for how long? $2,000",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And back then it was really unique,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because YouTube wasn't the only game in town,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or other videos,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 A YouTube partner,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But YouTube remember was the only one paying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" You're going, you needed us to build this platform",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then you want to toss us out and pull the rug out from under you guys when you've served your purpose,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the problem,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's squashing competition on a dis-ass business proposition,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I really have had a stroke,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We really appreciate it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the backlash is so much worse from people who built this entire business model,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are not enough Cobra Kai seasons in the world to make up for that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 A lot of times we just kind of sit back and don't say anything about it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And all you hear is from the LGBT community on this one,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Don't let them forget it because as you saw, they kind of, YouTube kind of caved a little bit both ways",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They ended up saying you did nothing wrong,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're the king of the gay towards,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS

 What? The biggest conservative channel in the history of YouTube? Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Why? Well, because he didn't violate any guidelines, but we got to give the piranhas something",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" You're like, really? I know",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm saying this is them just speaking,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Basically, it might be a might as well be Robert to hear us speaking to a mirror right here",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the truth is, with one of you can reach out",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I know because you don't get my legal counsel on any proper information,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I can see where this eventually ends up,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I think maybe that's Hell's Kitchen or out here,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have West Hollywood,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think a lot of what happens with you and the gays is you do have a little PTSD from living in Chelsea where there's a lot of parties,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We trade some emails,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's got a trip coming to the June coming to LA and June,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to work it out,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then next thing, you know, this guy and a Huffington Post journalist and media matters, the CEO president of media matters, all jump in to start the mob attacking the press guy of Mayor Pete so that he won't do my show",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then they just stop responding,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What was the reasoning? Well, I'm a scary dude",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was going to say like here's the one thing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If anything, the only valid criticism I would say of you is that you tend to be very nice with everybody",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like, I don't think I've ever seen you getting somebody's grill",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I would love to see that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Isn't it funny, Crowder, that we live in a time where everybody's always upset that everybody hates each other, right? Everyone's trying to destroy each other",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're more polarized than ever before,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, these are all the things people say, right",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Then I come around and I really, I have treated, you included",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I have treated every single one of my guests,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You act as though I should have been the exception to that rule,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But yes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what I thought about doing differently,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But truly, I have every single one of my guests exactly the same, whether I've had Bishop Barren in here from the Archdiocese in my own home where I lived with my husband",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he's obviously not for gay marriage,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 I treated him with the exact amount of respect that I've treated any of my lefty guests that I would treat any libertarian or any progressive with,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I treat everybody exactly the same,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's partly why I'm taking the hits right now because it's one thing to go after you because it's like you're saying I'm a conservative,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm using comedy to really throw it in their face,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Sure,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like they don't know what to do with me because if it was the back of a baseball card, they'd be like, wait a minute, this guy's supposed to be a lefty",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He acts nice,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He lives in LA,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 None of this adds up,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that's why a certain amount of hate is coming to me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But by the way, this box journalist, and again, I'm not even sure what his name is Carlos",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Gentlemen, Scott, Latino origin, same sex attraction",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Wonderful, beautiful, brave",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In his Twitter bio, it says that Tucker Carlson is a white supremacist",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, that seems pretty freaking directly hateful, directly potentially inciting violence, like to be a white supremacist face",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, it's not, but especially when you see that he didn't potentially incite, he said milkshake",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He said assault, commit battery against white supremacists",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And has identified people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, it's not left to the imagination",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's like, we wouldn't call it foreshadowing if this were an o-tore",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's like, oh, he's a violent guy",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So think about what this guy's doing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, we have three examples now",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So he's trying to stop people from talking to me as an interviewer, no matter how moderate I may be",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He's trying to literally get you booted off YouTube, and he's putting messaging out there as a journalist",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I've got air quotes going that Tucker Carlson is a white supremacist,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is why journalism is collapsing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This sucks on the YouTube front,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, they've been crushing my channel even worse than yours",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it's like, we just got to keep fighting, man",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What else can we do? Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know if I'm crushing your worse than ours,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do you ever think that maybe the criticism of a lot of the gensu that you are very articulate? You're very nice,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But sometimes you use expressions that would sound like a 1940s homophobe,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" See, those two good time boys with the hullabaloo",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 See? That's a little confusing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Eight for a criticism with you? No, it's a criticism",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You said hullabaloo,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The hullabaloo,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These kids with their hooten anis,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Just a little older than you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am 40,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll be 43 in a couple of weeks,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So really? You carry you well,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the one thing with being lighter,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Being overall, you're smaller than I am",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Heavy weights don't age well,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's a lot of torque on the joints,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, no, not aging well, everyone",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, everyone knows that I'm not aging well",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like even Dylan Radkins,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Taking you off YouTube,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the fact that you're aging horribly,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, exactly",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like a pod like from Dark Crystal,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Not quite as bad as Don Lemon, but he just didn't get the gee",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He didn't get the anti-aging daigings,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know what it is with Don Lemon,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You just, the luck of the draw",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me ask you this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Wait, can I just real quick, real quick though, because look, I have no problem with gage jokes",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, the idea that you can't make fun of a certain group of people, it doesn't mean about destroying one particular person over their identity",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But imagine if you say, OK, well, we can't make gage jokes anymore",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, first off, gay people are equal in America",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 No one's coming for you because you're gay,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 So if there were rights that gay people are not,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" You have to be a part of their gay guys, but yeah",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" All right, exactly",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that's a joke,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" See what you did there, see? See? I tell you where that's hateful",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, go ahead",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the point is that you make those jokes actually because you know gay people are equal,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" So the point would be if gay people didn't have certain rights and then you were constantly going after gay people, personally, I would have more of an issue with that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 I would defend you as a comedian,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I would always defend your right to free speech,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Obviously, the point is if you're going to come after jokes, just watch where this goes, OK, guys, box, you want to take down Crowder for gay jokes? You got 20 years of gay jokes on family guy",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Every freaking joke about Stewie, the baby, is about in being gay and every gay character that they put in that show",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the Simpsons had done it with Wayland Smithers,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you could do every friend, every other joke",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'd have to get rid of RuPaul's drag race,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" Well, now they don't like her or him either",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because yeah, I know",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because he used the word, a RuPaul used the word, Tranny",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they were like, I think, I know I've learned a bit about that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He didn't clearly didn't mean it, hopefully",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, let me ask you this",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What's your biggest issue with it? When people would say this to you as a, you know, you've identified more libertarian now",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What would you say to people who say, well, honestly, this is about YouTube",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They have the right to, for example, completely demonetize whoever they want",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" You shouldn't be trying to influence market forces, you know, or they can ban whoever they want",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What's your response to that? Well, the libertarian answer would be that you do try to influence market forces",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't ask that the government get involved,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, I think, look, this has pushed my libertarian side to its limits",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Because the amount of power and control of information and the way we communicate and all of those things, that YouTube and Facebook and Twitter have over us, I think there could be an argument that they should be considered a public good, the way, you know, border works and the electric company for playing monopoly would be considered, right? So I, there is an argument there",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm not really for it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the idea that the government should come in and regulate YouTube and Google, it's like, I live in California",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I pay my state taxes on a, on the California state website",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It looks like prodigy in 1993,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That might be a two-old of a, no, I know exactly the time",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then we moved on to Angel Fire, Angel Fire Geo Cities",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, I know",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So these people, the idea that the government can come in and somehow that's gonna make it fair, I don't love it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you, so this is where a libertarian to me, it's like you want competition",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, what I, the pushback I get on that, from people on the right is that this is a case where competition can never flourish because of the monopoly and amount of control",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And of course the counter argument to that is that, that when you make that exception once, you will always make that exception again and again",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And every time government comes in, they just make things worse and all of those things",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 So I don't know that I'm fully decided on this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Look, a guy who I know we both respect and his Prager, Prager, you sued Google over restricted videos",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not really the mode that I would wanna go in,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I can tell you this, I don't even know that I fully said this publicly yet, but I started a tech company just in the last couple months and we're working on some of these solutions",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you know, I've had unfortunate, it's like you, what we have problems and people reach out to us with solutions and we're gonna work on some of those things",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can you work on a solution of turning your phone off vibrate? You and Naomi Wolf,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's the game mafia, they are really not happy that I'm talking to you",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I can't believe that, you know what? Tell them they're all welcome to come on the show",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Here's the deal, they can come on the show, I'm not going to change my opinions and I'm not going to stop making gate chokes, black jokes, half Asian jokes, quarter black jokes, Canadian jokes, they're never going to stop",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, people just need to understand this and there's a big difference, by the way, that we were just talking with David Barton about this",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, freedom of speech, people say, well, where do you draw the line? And they always use this stupid example so you can't yell fire in a credit theater",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You can, if there's a fire, the line is very simple, you can't lie, you have a responsibility to tell the truth",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So things like libel, slander, those are actionable offenses",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You cannot use your freedom of speech to deliberately lie to harm somebody else,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And outside of that, that's it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That doesn't include nasty words or jokes that offend,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's deliberately lying to cause harm, physical or reputation wise to someone else",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Outside of that, close the books",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let me ask you this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What think of the argument that they're going to basically leave people like us with no choice other than to take legal action against specific people? So for example, you will find no videos of me slandering and blibbling people, right? Either verbally or written, you won't find that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But there are tons of people that every day call me a white supremacist, call me a Nazi",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, I grew up around Holocaust survivors, like try to imagine the level of insanity of this or the horrible things that they say about you",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 I don't know that I've ever seen you attack any specific person with any of that kind of vitriol,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need jokes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need jokes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know what happens to a society that can't joke violence? I mean, that's what happens",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You start killing each other,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Jokes are a way of illuminating a little bit of truth so that we can all sort of feel the same thing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So the idea, well, all right, we're not going to, you know, family guy actually is the right example because about a year ago, the producers said that they weren't going to do gay jokes anymore",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know if they've actually followed through with that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But it's like once you say, all right, we're not going to do gay jokes",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, are you going to do black jokes? Because you've been doing that for 20 years",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 You've been doing you jokes for 20 years,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've been doing musk jokes for 20 years and white people jokes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Once you start pinning everybody up and we're not going to make fun of these people, you're actually saying that group is the other and they deserve special treatment",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's not good for them or for you or for a functioning society in any way,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, I think you're correct",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Let me ask you, it's just a ballpark",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How affected has your channel been as a percentage of your videos when you say demonetized compared to maybe, let's say four or five years ago? Has been a significant uptick? Well, it's all over the place",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I don't know specifically, I just tweeted out this morning that our rev is off by about 66% since March",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" OK, so there you go",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So 66%,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So here's my issue is the dishonest business practice,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 YouTube courted someone like you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They said, we want you here",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to make you a part of our partner program,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Whatever you made, they made many, many, many fold more",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They made it off the backs of content creators,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 YouTube never created any content,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So my issue is with them saying, hey, Dave Rubin, we know at this point there could have been other options as they were coming up",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They said, we know there are other options",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We want to pay you to create content for our website,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We want YouTube to be your home,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And because of you doing that for your loyalty, we are going to split the revenue with you",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" OK, great",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when they grow big enough, they try to cut you off at the knees",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" To me, that's a dishonest business practice",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not about necessarily even corporate censorship,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If they're clear about the rules, no one is still entirely clear about whether we were completely demonetized and booted",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If it was due to a shirt, they couldn't give us an answer",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No one understands the rules,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think the simple version is following the law,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I mean, well, look, that's why perhaps legal action is going to be necessary",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it would suck for people like us to have to be involved in that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It would really, as I said, it would push me really the limits of what my belief in freedom and liberty is all about, but they may leave us with no choice",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But at the end of the day, look, we don't have to be on this platform",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we do do something where we want to get our message out there,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's other ways we could do it through podcasts and bit shoot and all sorts of other things,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think you've got to stay smart and figure out what business model works for you and the rest of it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the point is, this isn't that they're doing something across the board",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We know who they're, you're drinking the coffee in a gay way",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" No, I'm drinking you said business model",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" See, that was a little bit of a, that was a little",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was a little,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then, holy, oddly, oddly, I can't believe that you said that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How would you have, why would you throw that out of all? They don't, I've seen, you know, most gay people use straws",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Continue,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because they're a tiny people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I assume I don't know,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Frattered, you ever hear of a comedian known as Don Rickles from the old days? Yes",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, the Don Rickles used to go up in front of a crowd",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he talked about the Chinaman over there and the black guy over there, the Jew over there and the Wasp over there and the rest of it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And guess what everyone did? Everyone laughed and walked out of their feeling equal,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Imagine if he was like, there was one group I just wasn't going to touch",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That, that would actually, that would be twisted",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that would be bigotry,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, so these guys, the bigger issue, of course, is that we know they're coming after you, they're coming after me",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The line just keeps moving,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I'm not even going to go into the amount of crazy far left YouTube channels out there that say all sorts of evil stuff and go on and on against Christians and white men and all the, all the terrible stuff that they're doing all the time",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so you know those guys are going to be safe,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, yeah",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We got to figure out how to be smarter here,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, I appreciate and I do appreciate the kind words and support",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you know what? I would never make a joke about you being a lesbian because there's no truth to it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 You actually speak more clearly,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I wonder, you're, you and Andrew Clevan, you have like a natural broadcaster voice",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You talk here at his Dave Room,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, actually here's one thing",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Whenever I do, whenever I do, not impressions, whenever I reference, whatever",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, this is my Dave Rubin is more like this",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's very sort of a nonceated and when he talks, it's very almost labored in that he's very thoughtful in his approach",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Whenever I talk about somebody or I'm saying that somebody is made a statement, I invariably do an impression",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't even mean to,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I could not do an impression like this when talking about the Vox guy,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I couldn't,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've never done that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've done an impression of you inadvertently when I mentioned like, yeah, Dave Rubin and I were talking and I go into that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just a natural thing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've done this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was a kid,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But also we should note that this guy, his Twitter handle has the word gay in it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So he's putting it out there as if it's part of something,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then it's like, you can't say to you, well, you can't reference that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That very thing that you're making such a part of your identity,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know what I mean? And it's just such a small portion too,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the thing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I appreciate it because I know a lot of conservatives tried to, you know, they got scared at first",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then now it's not just conservatives,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everyone has jumped in,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Every original content creator because I know it's coming for them,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it really is one of those scenarios where you have to think less than this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe 2% of 2% of our content,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 2% of our content is a voxel bottle,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And 2% of that is making fun of the guy,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We actually provide resources and information we try to rebutt it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" OK, we do have to get going",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So on Twitter is at Rubin Report as well as on YouTube,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And Senior Rubin, thank you so much",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Please go back to the Angry Game Offia and let them know that just tell me you don't like me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Put it on me,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nice,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How did the whole? Oh, oh",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And he's here on the uh, he's here",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My club's east,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I got a lot of Scott,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Late night comedy salvation, South-East",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, so salvation",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We hear you might have a platform for us,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Ah, I'll point up here that you'll pay for it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, man",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Singing to a can,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're my little,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're my little,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Sir, we are a club",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, that's all except our congress",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Our company,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All except our,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

" So, but before we do any of that, I'm going to two things for you guys",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One is that it's important announcement,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's just like Dave Rubin,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 For a number of reasons,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like he's not smart,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not funny,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not tell,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not tell,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's not tell,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're pathetic,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're a loser,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And people should laugh at you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Unfortunately, the best way to deal with it is to",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, you have to ignore him",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here comes the big announcement,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the one final thing that I will say to just kind of solidify my point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Live on weekday,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Six to eight PM Easter,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't miss out,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 On the young turn,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stop playing games with your personal protection,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Try the Walther today,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You see what I did there with the stop playing games? Walther's happy about it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm totally fine,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm a lot of man,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's right,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You are an aquatic mammal,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 I couldn't really tell that you were a beaver,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Leaf,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Gosh, I really am off today",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hey, look at this",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can someone answer me this since his cultural appropriation? Can someone ask me why they would put that there? I was wearing it earlier,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I was like, what was this like? Because some guy who had rickets was self-conscious",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so everyone did it in solidarity,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, they did it together",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, no",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It looks great like that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hey, Tommy, I wish I had rickets",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're just saying that,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, look",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll show it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Look,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We both have rickets,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know what's the reason for it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I think Francine said it was like, it makes space in the pants when they're sitting and riding horses or something",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That makes, well, what did their chairs not have any arms? This is wildly inconvenient",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everything about today is distracting,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everything I'm wearing,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's that? Is itchy? We have some super videos coming up,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Also, we're going to be gone for a couple of weeks or three weeks and not the four",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're going to be actually here all the way through July 4th,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Every day, we have a special, an on-location special at an American History Museum, kind of taking some of the medical strategies",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have a change in my mind coming,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm around the 4th of July,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we have some super videos here in the Hopper, some new credit in front, some things that we can't necessarily talk about because we're working on them",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And maybe some phone calls that we're going to be making soon to some people who might have messed me up a little bit,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What would you say, Quarter Black Girl, I'm putting you on the spot, has been the most surprising this week",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What would you say is your main takeaway? I'm surprised that so many people got demonetized,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The YouTube just came out and just scorched Earth, everybody",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Doesn't matter who you are, what side you're on, you're gone",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It surprised a lot of people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It surprised me a lot of everybody kind of banded together,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" At least from, I woke up the next day and looked at all of my subscriptions, all the channels that I watched in there, all talking about it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Small channels, big channels, everybody's talking about it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I was like, oh, I got to do this",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because there's still a battle going on behind the scenes,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So again, the promo code will be good through the weekend",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 $30 off free speech for those who want to join my club,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And there's a lot, we're doing a lot more content behind the paywall",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We might even need to put all of our shows that have the socialism is for fake shirt, where I even wear a lot of it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They might need to be exclusively behind the paywall because it won't be allowed on YouTube anymore,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I wanted to talk about something here,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it's very appropriate in light of the current week,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think it's appropriate and maybe not the way that a lot of people think bullying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We've talked about, and usually you only hear about bullying when it involves some usually gay person who's in the nightly news because they were bullied in school",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By the way, I usually don't buy that",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You've got to be the stupidest person in the world to bully a gay or trans person in school,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" I bet you they would say, hey, Jimmy, what are you gay? Yeah, I'm sorry",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm sorry,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm sorry,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm sorry,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was a kid,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I called it all the time because I wasn't gay, but you know, I was a loser",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can just find my pictures in high school,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's pulling all the time,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm just talking about now,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A little bit,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I feel like I don't get with the respect in the office that I quite deserve,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you know what? That just stems the breaks,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No one wants to go have hot dogs with a man who signs the front of checks,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Hopefying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But we're talking about bullying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is because they've tried to accuse us of being bullies and more generally conservative as being bullies,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's the thing I would like to sort of posit,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The reason that bullying in high school is so unbearable or in the workplace, for example, is because it's chronic, it's systemic",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you have a bully in high school or if you have a boss or a supervisor who's a bully, you still have to go in the next day",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I believe me, I get it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I had days where I would just go to sleep and be like, oh, I don't want to wake up",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know that sounds terrible,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I was going, oh, I don't want to",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I just hate in my life going to school,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And a part of it was bullying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A part of it was just I wasn't cut out for public school as we had in Canada,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the real problem there is you have to face that bully every single There's no way to get away from it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a big defining factor for me in bullying,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, let's compare that to, for example, us doing a video or a rebuttal here, where maybe 2% of the video is us making lighter, us making fun of somebody in a way that they don't like the thing is, that's not chronic",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not systemic,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can shut it off,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can change the channel or online,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You can just click on the next suggested video, which is probably Turtle Humping Work Boot or Angry Cat or Training Makeup Tutorials",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trans-E Makeup Tutorials,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now we can't use any words,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're all being readjustly,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're all being readjustly actively,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can change the channel,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now compare that to say removing the ability for any one of a political persuasion to be able to make a living, including the 12 to 15 people here a lot of credit",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not myself,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is an entire team of people,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's more chronic? What's more systemic? Who's the bully? The person is a video that is never even addressed to you,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And this is all conservatives out there or the person who wants to make sure that they ruin everyone's life, who's been involved with that video for evermore, or anyone who might even cover that video, even non-political channels",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's see what's the ad-pocalypse,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" People who just happen to cover it, we want you gone",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 Some people were surprised at the apology video that we issued,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I am rough,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When you go back and you watch, you're like, oh, that was, yeah, maybe a couple of those, but they were actual jokes that have appeared in the show",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You shouldn't be surprised though,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why that's how you deal with bullies,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've seen a lot of conservatives,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, I'm the reason of all conservatives",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm, no, listen, you don't give in",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't, well, you have to push back from the very beginning",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right away,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You give up no ground unless you're wrong,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But if you know you're not wrong, you don't apologize",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's how we handle it,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you know what? A lot of people in the applies just to bullies,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I would say it applies to all high-pressure scenarios in life in general,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are some people who are naturally kind of what we refer to as game day players, right? Some people are born with it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
" Naturally, under pressure, they have another level",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Another switch,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My dad is that guy,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if you ever trained in a sport, you know some people was, they say, Tarzan in the gym, Jane on the field",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's some guys who are just unbelievable in training, but they can't put it together when it comes to game day",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then there's some guys who are kind of lackluster,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You wouldn't pick out of a lineup,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then when it comes time to perform, boom, they're on it",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Some people need pressure to perform,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They need to see themselves bleed before they get their head in the mix,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,HS
 And here's one thing I will say,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, I don't know that everyone on this team is a naturally born game day player",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No one here,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And a lot of cut-off's, will send your pressure",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's what, and I said this to everyone, because I know I could see that people were scared",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the office when I walked in,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's why the attack from Vox, big media, it couldn't have happened to a more capable group of people",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Not talking about myself, because how, just how much you see Vox, the picture about how behind the scenes, all the work they put in, it's not even close to what these people put in behind the scenes",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And all the work that you don't see that you don't know about, believe me",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you have someone on the front lines who you want fighting the bullsh** right now, if I could hand pick them, it would be the people who are in this room and the people who are in the green room watching",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We've had a lot, and I'll tell you this, we've had a lot of trial runs in those first couple of weeks at this company that don't work out",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's about a two week, about a month mark, because it's a pressure cooker",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Things like this week happen,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't happen in most workplaces,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If they stick around after that, they're here",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Usually for a very, very long time",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Not everyone is born as a game day player, okay? So let me be clear, because I know some people say, well that's not me",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Everyone can become one,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Just like not everyone is born with the backbone to stand up to bullies, everyone can grow one",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I've seen it happen,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I've seen people in my high school who would wilt to bullies, and then they decided to grow a spine never again",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was that guy at one point,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was the guy who walked away holding my jaw,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then at a certain point I said, okay, that's not going to happen again",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me ask you this,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is that something you'd like? Does that sound like a skill set that's valuable to you to be in the heat, to be in the pressure cooker, to be in the pocket with someone right in your face, right in your grill, and to feel totally capable? And by the way, notice I didn't say comfortable",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I said, capable",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No one here at this team, no one who has a skill set that I'm talking about",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No one's comfortable with being part of a concerted assault, for example, from a billion dollar media company",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No one, okay? It's distinctly uncomfortable",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, everyone here puts on a good face",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We laugh, we joke, but you know what? There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's distinctly scary,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But everyone here is rallied, okay? And they've handled it very capable, every single person",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And not everyone here was always that way,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How does that happen? It starts with being capable in the face of being uncomfortable,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the only way to get to that point is to get familiar with being uncomfortable,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as that happens, it just takes, it's like building up calcium deposits on your bones, right? You've seen boxers that do what their hands kick by, they do what their shins actually build it up",14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They just hit it with a little bit of a screwdriver,14850_Louder with Crowder_2019-06-07_transcription.json,Non-HS

 The conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our life our liberty and our property to fight for what matters in the way it matters at the time it matters if you want all of that and more well this is your one stop shop Daniel Hurwitz back here today Friday end of the week October 21st and really what sets us aside from other shows is we don't just commentate we don't just muse and engage in punditry we actually discuss policy outcomes where we,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
want the ship to head and that's why from now until November 8th we're gonna be discussing for the most part November 9th and onwards that is what matters November 9th and onwards what exactly are you gonna do with that election mandate I can't force people to do things they don't want to do but what I can do is give voice to the right strategies the right issues the right policies the righteous truth at any given time and that's what you expect of me so I'm not gonna really do much horse race for the next two and,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
a half weeks I do want to get on Robert Cahaly of Trafalgar maybe one time just to do a roundup of what's going on so we could learn about what he's seeing in the polling in order to again aim that towards policy outcomes but the the revolution you're looking for is not November 8th it's November 9th and what I mean by that is this do we finally change our focus I've all these Republicans I know that are so into elections oh my gosh yeah what's gonna happen November 8th and then they die November 9th they die,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
the next day like nothing ever comes of it that same intensity that you're constantly refreshing the RCP polls page every hour that needs to continue on the issues that matter in the states that matter the legislation that matters the executive policies that matter are you pressuring the Republicans in the right way let me give you a great example of how this can be done so we've been talking about obviously yesterday CDC votes to put the death shots on the childhood immunization schedule to quote Lara Logan who just got chucked from Newsmax another fake entity the world,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
leaders are dining on the blood of children pretty big deal death shot after everything we know about it this is what they're doing and for the first time it wasn't just me but many other conservatives were calling on the Republican governors to at least make a statement so you know what they actually felt the pressure and you could tell by the timing and tone of their statement it was like they had a gun against their head they were forced to follow Ron DeSantis is saying hey we're not gonna do that here or we already passed legislation,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
that precludes that fine so this is not an exhaustive list there could be more but from what I've seen so far as of midday on Friday Kevin's did a vocal homeless Spencer Cox of Utah Mike Parris in Missouri Kristina almost at the Kota Glen Yunken of Virginia Bill Lee of Tennessee Kivia of Alabama and Kim Reynolds of Iowa and actually Democrat Governor Jared Paulus of Colorado also said that they're not doing it there so that's more than any other time when we demanded statements and they never made a statement well pressure does work pressure does work,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
remember the name of the game is to pretend to be conservative but actually help the other side so the more we force scrutiny on them the more they're forced to either openly defy us and then we can more easily defeat them or they'll maybe be forced to go along with us focus on the issues in the people and the legislation the play calls we need to be making the play calls noticeably absent by the way are Greg Abbott and Brian Kemp again by the time you're hearing this it could be they changed but it's still something,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
that so that this has gone on this long and I've not seen a statement from them so that's glass half full so that success but still we're not demanding more from them here's the glass half empty part okay so we have death shots out here and we're not going to fully force them on children to get an education well dude we should be downright recommending against their existence not just saying we're not going to force you to get it at this point but again not one other state is recommending against even children getting the shot much,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
less adults much less taking it off the market much less bringing up Pfizer on fraud charges which by the way states can do a Florida lawyer Jeff Childers points out that friend of mine Florida has a deceptive and unfair trade practices act a lot of states have similar laws which allow lawsuits against companies that misled consumers about safety and efficacy of products now he says right now that law in Florida has a glaring exemption for pharma but that could be legislated away next session and it should be and you might think oh well you know how,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
did states get around the prep act the the what do you call it NCBIA yeah and that needs to be repealed at a federal level and we're gonna be talking about that and more with Marjorie Taylor Greene coming up soon but it's important to remember that it's not like it's a blank check that companies could literally mislead and lie and we caught them lying so yeah they're absolved from negligence it turns out people got damaged by their product but if they lied in their advertising and marketing that's a different story and we now have all the,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
evidence Grant Juries could bring this up we need to this this does need to happen Grant Juries state laws attorneys general pressure make the play call but yet every other Department of Health all these governors Kim Reynolds KK IV Billy Glenn Young King Christie know their departments of health are downright recommending the shots and pressuring and promoting them even on children to this day if there's such frauds that needs to change that's my point pick the top 50 most influential conservatives if they would jump on all these people make the play calls on this and other,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
issues we could have a very different election I want you to think about being on the other side of this election right now at least until now the polls don't really show a wave they show a traditional flipping of Congress that you would expect in the midterms where one party holds the White House especially when the opposition party is starting out just a few seats away from the House majority and already 5050 in the Senate actually would be downright historically bad if Republicans didn't flip both houses so that's nothing but you know polls are starting to,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
show a little bit more momentum and let's just say all the in all the undecideds break a hundred percent in their Republican direction which based on a number of factors is not outlandish to think that might happen and let's just say best case scenario they not only run the table in all of the contentious races but even somehow surprise us and a few senators and governors and maybe House races in blue states maybe they flip New York governor kinetic get governor and maybe even Sid Blumenthal gets flipped the Republican there whatever good she is Levy I,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
think her name is she supported Jeb Bush for president but okay some polls only show her back like three points against it bloomin thaw okay Connecticut Oregon maybe Patty Murray goes down Bennett in Colorado I don't think so but I'm just saying let just indulge me we wake up the other day I mean people are in cloud 9 oh my gosh so rather than spending the next week or two owning the lips owning the lips owning the ha ha ha look you lost Biden's administration is over with no it's not they're continuing to persecute us Steve,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
Bannon was just sentenced to four months in prison for literally being an adviser to a president and not cowtowing to a legislative subpoena on an underlying question where there's no accusation of a crime because of January six somehow if you supported the president's position on the election being stolen that's a crime again it's like literally saying that any Democrat that supported BLM is responsible for all the murders and and looting and beatings and arson that they committed and two billion in damage and therefore we could just bring up any executive official on charges or subpoena them,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
if you don't come we're gonna throw you in prison they never do that by the way criminalizing politics we can't wait another day now he is gonna be able to be out of jail pending his appeal but this is what they're doing we don't have the time we need action right now what are you gonna do exactly commensurate with the mandate these Republicans get is their responsibility to immediately act and immediately we're gonna talk a little bit with MTG and next week I'm gonna come out with a column outlining this just days after the election house,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
Republicans their conference holds a freshman orientation for the incoming members where they pick leadership where they pick a rules package for how the house is gonna run amazingly important and then the governors and the state legislative sessions beginning in January February the amount of things that cannon must be done the vote if that doesn't fact happen the voters will be saying Republicans please we won't relief do bold things on interposing the feds crushing the federal tyranny energy food medical freedom crime the border grooming autonomy from international treaties autonomy from China so many things and I'm gonna,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
try to come out with a list before January and that's what we're gonna do highlight the strategies the key players that need to be pressured the legislation we need state federal that's where our focus needs to be if it's there we could really have a revolution so to me this is a huge lesson that Republicans can be pressured if you're willing to do it if you're willing to stay focused I do want to get to our interview but we have a couple couple more things first our sponsor of MTG's interview today is America's only Christian conservative,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mobile provider look you know big business is gonna cancel people like MTG cancel Patriots we need to make the switch away from Verizon T-Mobile go to Patriot mobile which has plans that fit almost any budget they use the same carriers same phone line you don't have to change your number there's no excuse for not changing over same service except rather than supporting transhumanism they actually support the sanctity of life religious freedom and second amendments to go to Patriot mobile dot com slash CR or call 972 Patriot use offer code CR get free activation you know what,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS

elections are are such a band-aid it's such a comedic relief wow oh man this is great and when you solved nothing if you don't act there the FBI is still gonna round up our people Pfizer is still gonna push the death shots Republican health departments in Republican states are still gonna push the death that shots the border invasion will continue all this stuff will continue one of the things that Kevin McCarthy cleverly does and all Republicans do is they fight us on the issues that matter in the way they matter at the time they matter so,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
because they don't do what we say needs to be done at the time you have irrevocable damage then finally two years later or 20 years later they'll say yeah you know we've come to your position but then at that point you need to do much deeper surgery so in a legal immigration everyone talking about all Kevin McCarthy said we're done with comprehensive immigration reform aka amnesty we're only gonna do enforcement no amnesty so okay we should celebrate that for 20 years Republicans went and fought a border invasion by saying we're gonna give amnesty they joined the,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
Democrats now like okay we're no longer to push amnesty well that's too late we suffered executive amnesties worse than any legislative amnesty we could have ever imagined anything short of state deportations is worthless at this point so Republicans will pass standalone legislation to fund more border patrol which is meaningless it's not matter of funding it's a matter of kicking them out and stop inviting them and cutting off all the magnets will you put that in the budget bill will you prohibit funding for any release of any illegal alien with criminal penalties to any government official does,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,HS
that anything short of that and putting it in the budget bill or a must pass bill or the defense authorization bill national defense begins with border defense is worthless but that's what they do always a day late in the dollar short so it's like now it's okay to say yeah we shouldn't shut down the schools or don't force children to get the covid shots whoa no no do we say don't force anyone to get an abortion no we want a ban abortion no one's forced to get it and even the military is still forced and they're,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
not even promising to fight that and again this all ties back to the fact that Kevin McCarthy is not contesting Mitch McConnell's plan to pass an omnibus bill for the remainder of the fiscal year in the lame duck undercutting our ability to act swiftly at least within the first nine months on any issue any issue so this matters this certainly matters but like I said a big thing is the following Tuesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday selection day is Tuesday November 8th following week the freshmen come in this is when they vote who's going to be a speaker,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
majority leader majority whip committee chairman steering committee and they adopt the rules that matter and what I want to speak about with MTG coming up and this is this is really important what matters is we need to take the loincloth away from the GOP so what they like to do is perfectly evince the image of a conservative fighting for our grievances at a time while ensuring that they add the problems actually continue and they don't do it that's their that's their end goal and it always is so we need to undercut their strategies their rules the,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
way they run the house their leverage and let me give you one example we're going to talk about and the freedom caucus has made a list of demands for a rules package adoption and so far leadership has rebuffed it and has refused to respond to them and one of them is the majority of the majority rule okay again republicans are worthless I don't think at a federal level as much you can even do to me the governor should be doing this but there's a couple of things we could be doing both messaging wise building the case,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
for things then ultimately building the case for a budget bill in other words I am okay with hearings and standalone legislation if that's to build the case for ultimately putting it in the budget and fighting for it on a must pass bill um you need to decentralize control and you need to allow the prerogative of an individual members like MTG to make noise they don't want to be embarrassed they don't want to be pushed in front of the oncoming traffic so that's why they want to be very tightly in control of what they're doing so they,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
could pass this fluff stuff that doesn't do anything and won't even be signed into law anyway while ensuring that the leverage to actually do something is is written away and the and the first thing they're doing is actually ensuring even before republicans get in the door the budget is out the window classic example so what we want to do is force them not to do it one of them is the majority the majority rule a lot of people forget that trump was such a pathetic loser and i'm sorry some of you might get insulted but i,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
don't care almost every budget that he signed fun fact was supported by majority democrats minority republicans in the house okay he actually every and this was while they had the trifecta control well you're saying like daniel how do you have trifecta control but democrats run the budget very simple hope yes vote no hope yes vote no republicans really and leadership really wants it and most republicans want it they agree with it but they're scared of their base so they get around it by basically having every democrat vote for it and then like the old bull committee,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
chairs that are like suicide bombers they thumb their noses at that the base anyway they don't care anymore somehow they can't get defeated or maybe they're on their final years and they have them vote for it and everyone else including those that really don't care or down around the other side they're able to vote no so what that does is again it allows them to get their outcomes they want without getting punished we want to take that mechanism away and there's several ways but we'll talk about this more next week we'll talk about a little bit,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
a little bit with marjorie um but one thing is the majority of the majority rule makes it that the house leadership can only push a bill let's say a budget bill that is supported by a majority of the gop conference so what that means is here's why that's important let's say you have a budget deadline coming up and republican house passes a decent standalone budget bill to defund the things we want defunded let's say let's say they do that well the hours are going to tick down to the deadline for government funding and you'll have a,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
so-called government shutdown if you don't fund it and the senate's like well we're not passing your house bill the house should say we're not passing your bill and again and have endless speeches and media and events throughout the country highlighting the harm of their policies and what they're doing and and and willing to fund but at some point they're going to be like well we can't have a government shutdown this is why we need you to support us two years from now in the next election then we'll have the senate and the white house then we'll,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
be able to do it mind you they did have all three and did this anyway because they didn't have 60 votes in the senate and they never will but what else okay but then they have a problem on the one hand they want to get the democrat budget bill passed but on the other hand they're scared of the base yelling at them that you voted to fund tyranny you voted to fund fissery vote to fund the invasion you voted to fund the fbi tyranny so what do they do they get the democrats to vote for it,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
and and just a small number of republicans and the rest are free to go by ensuring that they can only push something that has the support of a majority of the conference it will force one of two things either they can't do it or a whole number of undocumented rhinos will now be documented and that at least helps us in the long run so that's a very important rule but i just want to open your mind to a number of immediately important things while everyone's going to be dancing in the end zone oh my gosh this,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,HS
is amazing we just crushed the democrats mcconnell in the senate is going to be giving the left everything they want in the lame duck and the house conference is going to be electing the cartheist speaker and screwing us on every position every committee chairman every rule that sets up the agenda for the house and i'm going to be the only one focusing on it how do i know because i've lived through this three other times literally did fun fact 2010 right probably in some respects um the biggest republican victory in a century almost a century maybe,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
80 years and guess what they responded to that mandate in the lame duck we were slaughtered slaughtered they passed the dream act out of the senate they passed repeal of doma repeal of don't ask don't tell and many other things december 2010 i'll never forget that they just took the wind out of it wait you mean the voters just said we want you so badly and you just respond by doing yes that's what they'll do i know it's unbelievable but they that's what they'll do they'll continue doing this and you need to understand that so we,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
need to focus on how to utilize and immediately utilize that electoral mandate so what is this formula to making the election mandate actually meaningful the truth is it's simple we know what it is there's going to be a couple of good figures inside of these respective legislative bodies and hopefully in a few cases executive bodies like governor that are willing to push the proper ideas in the case of congress it's going to be starting off with stand-alone legislation and hearings and remember you need the right people to be willing to push the right sort of stand-alone,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
legislation hearings but then it can't just end there we need immediate relief so the next step is you build a movement you build pressure and discovery behind it in the case of hearings and then you fight for two things number one that the governors that have trifectas in these red states implement were practically possible at a state level these ideas and then at a federal level to use the must-pass legislation including the budgets to fight this it's that simple anything less than that is straight bs okay we can't wait till 2025 to not have our people,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS

with with an army to do combat with a villain that just walked out with a bloody sword and just murdered your family and well what do you expect i don't know you expect them to pounce on the guy and you know trials and executions but instead you hear noise that hey you're stepping on my garden you just stepped on the tomato there and like what what do you just say they just killed your family and and that's what the the impression i'm getting from republicans if you heard my intro they're not really talking about any of,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
the aforementioned stuff if they do it's on a very superficial level it's kind of like the economy is bad inflation's high as if it's like a natural disaster not something that was done um orchestrated by some certain policies that they themselves supported how could we hold them accountable to actually fulfill the mandate without our base buying into the flowery rhetoric that they're using well isn't that the question and you know here if we look at the time on the call it's really 1159 and i think that's how every republican needs to look at it is if,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
we don't hold our government accountable if we don't pursue investigations and and force people to face consequences for the proof that we're able to show if we don't force the right leds legislation if we don't cut things in the budget like vaccine mandates like CRT in education like like the the trans movement that is preying on children if we if we aren't willing to do that and we don't take the responsibility responsibility to do it then when will we do it and because there is we can't wait any longer and i think how republican voters and,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
especially republican donors need to hold their republican um leaders accountable after after they're elected is they need to remind them very loudly you remind them with your checkbook and you remind them with phone calls emails and you go meet with them and in their offices and and remind everyone that this is a job that we're electing you to do and you have to do it there's no other choice and and so that comes two ways is it's encouragement and accountability and that's what republican voters need to take to republican leaders as we enter into the next,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
congress as we enter into 2023 so describe for our listeners you know you just went through this process you were a freshman member what happens that first week after the election that's so pivotal that the constituents need to know to direct their attention because because my concern is that it's kind of like dancing in the end zone let's just say it's a great victory everyone's going to be excited oh the Biden administration is over um you know and and we all pray for steve bannan today obviously it's very tough what he's gone through and it underscores,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
the sense of urgency um look i'm scared of the FBI arresting me for what i say but he's out there and he said look Biden administration is over in november aith and i'm like steve i wish you're from your lips to god's ears but the reality is you got to make the plays you got possession of the ball but you got to make the plays that in following week what are the pivotal choices that are made that people need to know about to call their incoming representative to direct their attention to those issues well as you,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
know nothing changes after november aith really the same people are still in place nothing really changes until january and even in january when when our new members of congress are sworn in when hopefully new republican governors like karae lake or dug macheriano or or others hopefully get sworn in um that just means the job begins it doesn't mean that anything any problem has been solved it doesn't mean that inflation goes down it doesn't mean the gas prices go down it doesn't mean that that our government is is not fighting russia in some war in ukraine it,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
doesn't mean the fentanyl stops killing people nothing changes honestly until we start doing the hard work to change it um and so people have to have those expectations and i totally agree with you um i am i stand with c bannon and i will i will continue standing up and speaking out for him uh just like i am the people that are still being held in jail for january six who's due process rights are being completely violated our government the reality is that that people have a hard time speaking the words the government has actually become,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
the tyrannical government yes that our founding fathers uh warned us about um but but here here's why you don't see a lot of people um just just completely recognizing that fact the middle class in this country is not really suffering yet but but the middle class will start suffering uh not too long from now and until unless we clean up these problems and we are far from it we really are not far from it and we you would see a vast change in the attitude of most americans um as soon as they're unable to heat their,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
homes as soon as they're unable to turn their lights on every single day as soon as they're unable to afford to go you know enjoy college football or nfl football or or whatever activity or hobby they love to do or vacations they like to take as soon as those wonderful luxuries are unaffordable you'll see you'll see a huge change in this country but we just aren't there yet people aren't suffering but it's not far from now and if republicans aren't willing and and don't have the courage to fix it then that that will soon become a,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
reality daniel and what we've seen happen to to see bannon and others um that could even become a more more terrifying reality and we just don't want to see those days come well we have pro-life activists that are being rounded up for for singing outside of abortion clinics um obviously they're an inch away from criminalizing our beliefs and just you know showing up and rounding us up it's something I could have never envisioned I literally have my wife uh you know I have her collect certain phone numbers to immediately call to get get the word out,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
if i'm rounded up and I never would have envisioned that I was always scared of islamic terrorists because of the work I did or maybe the cartels at the border um and now nothing scares me more than the fbi itself so this is something we can't wait with we can't wait another month with my concern is that they've already set almost an irrevocable path to passing an omnibus bill for the entire fiscal year that will undercut any real leverage to um have a funding fight over these fbi programs and prosecutions is there any way to pressure,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
kevin mccarthy i'm not i'm just gonna ask you straight up i don't understand he's the presumptive speaker in waiting this is his whole tour de force this is his body of government that he will lead with a simple majority unlike the senate the budget is his only leverage mcconnell wrote it away assuming he follows through and does an omnibus before christmas is it just me i have not heard mccarthy say a word about this and i don't under i don't understand it well i i mean we have to admit the first failure is in the senate,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mitch mcconnell what you you just acknowledged that and mitch mcconnell and the republicans in the senate there's so many things they could have stopped but they fully gave a green light to joe biden nancy plusy and the democrat sajenda which has been i mean that's unforgivable for what mitch mcconnell has done in the senate his failures are just you can't say enough of what a failure he is but but no actually what i think what you're going to see is you're going to see republicans in the house working very hard to stop this this budget being,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
passed again for another whole year the can just being kicked down the road i know i'll be a very loud voice speaking out against it but you're right we we have to we have to fight as hard as we can to to not allow that to get passed just you know rolled into another whole year because it just continues more insanity but actually i have heard kevin mccarthy and others say that we need to stop it so i'm hoping we see a big fight in the house but our problem in the house is until january when,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
we're sworn in with whatever size majority that we have and i feel confident we will have one uh we're still the minority and they can still the democrats nancy polosi has done an amazing job as much as i hate to say it of corralling her party together and passing their disastrous agenda so and you know we'll see what she's able to do with the lame duck speaker and and i don't know what she will be able to do but yeah no the pressure has to be on to do everything we can to stop that budget from,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
being just rolled into another year so isn't some of that pressure the week following the election is freshman orientation there's the conference meetings that adopt the rules and the leadership could you walk us through your your a member of the freedom caucus what the freedom caucus is proposing and why that will help ensure the mandate is more than just fluff well the freedom caucus has put together a rules package and the rules package uh it's it's really hard to explain and a very short answer but the rules package is designed to give legislative authority to every,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
member of congress and to allow for more amendments to be added and to build for you know true changes basically putting congress back into a functionality that it it was previous set up to so that is the rules package that the freedom caucus is working very hard to get passed and in communications with leadership about about getting that put into place uh when we vote on on that going into the next congress there's a lot of debate happening there now i think it's important to understand the next two years though we aren't going to be able,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
to pass sweeping legislation that joe biden or whoever's in the white house would sign into law um so that's where some of those rules really we wouldn't have as much um benefit we wouldn't benefit as much from them until we have a republican president in the white house so that is one thing important to acknowledge um and as much as everyone's going to have huge expectations of a republican controlled house we really are limited uh we can pass all the bills that we want to but if they don't go through the senate and they don't get,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
signed into law then there's literally not change our power is going to be in the budget and that's why what you the question you asked me before this was so important if that budget just gets rolled into another year nothing changes it just stays the same old thing and the only thing we can do is investigations and provide oversight uh and expose corruption so our hands are really tired and that'll just continue to frustrate the american people but i think it's important the conference needs to function properly um what i'm actually working on is i'm wanting,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
to see a more unified congress conference republican conference while i'm continuing to push very hard uh push my conference to the right um and to reflect the america first policies and values that so many of our voters want to see happen so i'm not interested in in taking like a um uh you know bringing war within our conference i don't want to see that happen i want to see our conference work card together and i want to do that using um using relationships and and leveraging what the american people want to see happen sure no i,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mean obviously historically how whatever issues we had with house leadership the senate leadership was ten times worse and it's always going to be that way but like you said you know the house can't pass anything without the senate but the senate can't pass anything without the house either so where it's new legislation the default is nothing then we have no leverage but where it's a budget bill and the default is okay then your your agency is getting no funding and you have a government shutdown that's really where the leverage is and i think that's where we,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
we talked about earlier the majority the majority rule i want to talk about another rule i thought was important that is being pushed by the freedom caucus our listeners need to know about is that so typically even the stand-alone bills the messaging bills that you know maybe you won't put in the budget bill maybe you'll wait off with but it's important to build support build messaging raise awareness as you well know it's only certain ones that will even get that status because there are certain things that are untouchable so you have promised to um and this,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
is very timely in the news to at least reform modify the prep act the ncvi a the blanket blanket immunity for all these vaccines and particularly the the new ones uh out now and in the pipeline that have caused so much so much damage is such injustice we not only need compensation liability we need the discovery uh through that judicial process this is really our only avenue um i i think we all know and you're trying to be diplomatic with leadership but naturally that is not a bill that will ever be brought to the floor and,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
typically in recent years it's really only bills that have leadership support that get brought to the floor um describe what you hope to do with an amendment process to at least trigger a vote on some of these bills that are wildly wildly popular with with the republican voters but not so much with the republican leaders or donors well actually the vaccine mandates repealing the vaccine mandate is something that i hear talked about widely in our conference but liability so that oh yeah no we need to take away their liability the vaccine manufacturers deserve no protection uh,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
because they have they've made billions of dollars um on the backs of the government forcing people to take the vaccines and now we see the cdc making it part of the vaccine schedule for children starting at six months of age which is unreal and absurd um and we'll see children and democrat states force to take these vaccines parents uh forcing their kids to get them uh based on the cdc's recommendation just so they can go to public education which the taxpayers pay for the parents pay for it so it's it's absurd but no what we have,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
to do is we have to push these amendments into place we have to push our leadership push our conference uh to support people in this because this has been it's been medical tyranny um it is is completely unscientific they talk about science this is the most unscientific uh supported vaccine that that's ever you know in history and countries like the uk many countries in europe they're not even forcing children to take the vaccine and they're taking away their vaccine mandate so i actually do have a lot of i i am going into this with confidence in,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
leadership in our conference of of working to repeal the mandates but i i do believe i'm one of those saying it we need to take away the liability protection of the vaccine manufacturers other other messaging bills it'll be hard to get a vote on but i'm but i'm working hard on it is a bill that i have pushed and let the movement on and that's the protect children's innocence act stopping the transgender um surgeries and and puberty blockers of kids under the age of 18 i mean this is you talk about medical tyranny this is um,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
it's basically experimentation medical experimentation on children and general mutilation and it's completely wrong and it's taking the rights away from parents in and democrat state that forces it to be an issue where we need to make it a federal law to make it a felony to do these surgeries on kids and and prescribe puberty blockers that one is a big one i have a border bill in place that would put a four-year moratorium on immigration and that absolutely should happen four-year moratorium on immigration so these are two very important bills you're you're talking about and i,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
want to again weave in process so our listeners understand the situation um you know i'll speak for you here those two bills are in my view dead on arrival with a leadership especially the second i mean second one i think everyone would agree is because they're all very for unlimited number you know you just slap the word legal in front of immigration and all types all numbers of all amounts coming from china and india you know selling out the american worker they're all for that at best they're against the illegal immigration um they'll never support that,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
but isn't it true that the freedom caucus has an idea to adopt as the rules package an idea that if 10 percent of the conference which would be let's say about 24 members sign on to um an amendment it would at least trigger a vote on it because without that the stuff would never get a vote well we have to well i'm not sure on that number exactly daniel to answer your question i i have to verify that before i don't i don't want to answer wrongly um but to adopt a rules package within our conference,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
but those are votes that have to take place in our conference so i'm i apologize i don't have that number sure sure yeah i mean i'm looking at the there's a there's a 50 page packet or so that was put out to freshen members and that's where that's where i'm getting it from yes right i haven't i'm sorry i haven't read through it yet but they did send it to me yesterday yeah no i mean i'll only nerves like me read through because i thought i thought it was pretty decent i really thought it was very,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mature it was uh because i lived through this a lot of us lived through this with the bainer congress and it really was trying to rectify some of the problems that we experienced where we have very popular ideas and even if you oppose them they they are important to the time they have a lot of support they do raise important questions and they need an airing and let's go back to the transgender thing you know one of my concerns again is what i've watched leadership do for the last 10 15 years is again they won't fight,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
on the budget and then even the stand alone they'll be very careful in what they do so i'm watching this parent parental rights bill it sounds great i mean who opposes that it really requires transparency they get notification of certain things they get to look over the curriculum yeah and you know what i mean it's it's it's good but there's no hard trigger like wait a minute there's no castrating people there's no um putting men in female bathrooms none of this this is not happening no funding of the federal government can go towards castrating people i,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mean i just saw the state departments funding in an Ecuador Fox News had an article on that i mean throughout the government there's all this funding i mean that's a pretty simple popular thing just no funding for that i'm not seeing that as a promise you know what i mean i'm seeing these kind of fluffy things so wouldn't it help to trigger some of these amendment votes to at least get an understanding of where we are in the conference oh i think so i i fully support that and i i think it's important to be able,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
to trigger votes like that that's why i was so dedicated to calling for recorded votes because i believe the american people need to see how every member of congress votes that's our job performance and so having the ability to trigger amendments and bringing them to the floor for a vote i i think it's exceedingly important and is also showing that yeah here we're willing to take a vote on this we're willing to work hard to try to pass it um here's who supported or here's who didn't and no i i i think that is a really,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
really good thing um i also i'm also one of those that believes in fighting it out to the point where if we shut down the government so what you know what i mean it shouldn't matter uh the the government is ruining most people's lives every day right now and and has been for a long time and so if we're battling on the floor of our budget issues or whatever it may be and we end up shutting down the government we'll find you know too bad we we shouldn't fund it if if it's if it shouldn't be,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
funded um you know like the department of education my goodness department of education has become so dangerous to children uh we should be fund the department of education because of you know different curriculums like CRT and bringing drag shows and the schools and grooming children and sexualizing children and and these teachers who who believe they should never be fired because they're members of some union and a union boss is saying they'll protect them forever because of their union dues but that's completely wrong and the government has lost its way and so is congress and so this,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
is why a rules package is extremely important but at the same time we have got to have the entire conference on page because if we go into and you know we have to look at this for maturity if we go into the next uh congress and or just just warring with our within our party and and unable to accomplish anything well that's not going to give the american people much confidence in us either so it has to be done in such a way where it's you know agreed upon and and mutual and i think we can,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
get there i'm not kidding you got to think about after this election i think it said that over 70 percent or 70 percent right now or after this election of of the republican conference has been elected since trump became it came into office so the republican conference is a lot different than the days of bainer and even paul ryan yeah yeah so it's changed a lot and people have these assumptions over a lot of republicans um in in congress right now that i wouldn't necessarily say or totally true i think there's been a shift to the,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
right that's a very important point i i want you to reiterate that to my audience because you know i'm always on the lookout for this and we've been very disappointed for many years but you're saying this as someone who's been very marginalized you're stripped of your committee assignments obviously it was under palosse leadership you're saying you don't feel and i really want you to answer this as directly as you can you don't feel like you are marginalized that you are like an outcast like there's no one like you in that conference you feel at home with,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
a lot of those individuals well i'm not saying i feel at home i feel at home with the people in my district because that's the best to do i feel at home with but what i'm saying is is i'm not so sure that we aren't going to see a republican conference do thing i think they are going to do more things that that people think they aren't going to do at least i'm hoping so and i'm going to be pushing very hard for that and the reason why is is there's a big change in the makeup,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the conference since the days of a banner speakership where the majority of the members have been elected post post 2016 and that's a big change right that's a big change in your views and ideology and understanding the america first agenda so i'm i guess i'm what i'm saying is i'm hopeful and i want and i'm working very hard within the conference but also on the outside with pressure to to hopefully help hold our conference accountable that we do the right thing for the american people and and that's what you know when i'm talking with my,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
freedom caucus colleague who i love very much i'm i'm saying you know let's let's get an agreement we can work it on the inside without necessarily having to use an insurgency from the outside but i think a lot is possible i really do i have i have a lot of faith and i think it's possible because they have no other choice if they don't do it then they don't deserve the votes sure you know republican votes again sure but as you noted it's very subtle politics is an art it's not a math people think it's a,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
math always to a team here you need 60 there you need the president signature there it's also an art and there are very subtle ways that you could look like you're fighting but then say look well you need to vote for us the next two elections when there really are things especially you know none of us expect them to come in for example and and start from 1776 and everything that was done on constitution all these government programs that maybe are popular and have a lot of constituencies abolish them done done done you know entitlement this,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
that no it's some of the new radical insane things the transgenderism the fbi rounding people up the the Pfizer fascism that should be very easy in one-off defund efforts you know catch and you know defund catch release you know i'm just saying my expectation i think oh i totally say it like i have i'm selling defund the fbi t-shirt or you know those are on my campaign site i'm all for those aggressive things um and i i wish that we would do those things i think we need to um but you know i i guess for,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
me i can't speak on behalf of others and i and i'm not going to be one of those that will say yes absolutely this is going to happen because it that's hard that's hard for me to promise i can't only control me i can't control everybody else but i think we absolutely have to work hard to make these things happen because the department of justice and the fbi has become the scariest thing in america now it's no longer like people are more afraid of the fbi than they are of of you know a criminal coming in,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
their house and and they shouldn't be that way like you said they're coming after pro-life um you know activist versus ignoring the people that were standing outside brat kavanagh's house you know they still have people january six rioters locked up but they don't have any antifa blm rioters um you know rotting away in jail and and being politically persecuted so i mean i think we absolutely have to hold our government accountable but you guys remember i will say this something to think about that that maybe gets missed just like our conference is made up of mostly,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
uh trump era republicans they also got treated pretty badly this past year by the law be uh where most of these republicans that i i don't take lobbyists donations so i didn't go through it but but most of my colleagues for the first time ever got denied donations from the lobbyists and the corporate tax because of objecting on january six or different reason that's great and oh yeah oh that was like oh i wish we wouldn't take any lobbyists money and corporate money me and matt gates i think were the only two that don't take any,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
that money but it changed perspective for a lot of republican members because for the first time they were treated pretty badly by the class in washington that usually supports everyone and they got rejected and they got treated bad and that includes kevin macarthy he was one of those also and so i think you know that has created a change in in the way a lot of members think and then then how many of these republican members that you know you might consider moderate or just quiet or or they're they're conservative but they're not big names got,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
called insurrectionists um and accused of horrible things because of january six and they never did anything wrong at all so that kind of treatment has has put a shift in a lot of these members thinking and i'm what i'm saying is i'm i really think that could play out to create a more conservative republican conference that maybe we haven't ordinarily seen that that is a really hopeful and fascinating point at the same time that i didn't think of you know you picture health care um part of the problem we've had the entire time with this pandemic,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
is that fizer and all these entities they really give to both sides and it's really very bipartisan and that's why you know you listen to republicans and they sound the same so you're saying that headed forward because they've almost forced them to pick sides um because of this corporate communism that's just gone so woke you can no longer straddle the fence anymore and even if they wanted to straddle it their side doesn't allow them and it's almost forcing them to be an insurgent against the system um whether they meant to be or not and so you're,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
saying that there is what to hope for and i think people need to hear that um they need to hear that there is hope and you know i'm here to point to the strategies that we could utilize i know you're definitely gonna um do that as well i want to end off with the january sixth thing because i think again that's important it speaks to lives in danger lives in the balance um so there are going to be a lot of hearings i mean republicans always like doing that because it doesn't necessarily have to force a,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
government shutdown or you know some sort of brinkmanship um what do you do you have confidence that we're going to get a full investigation into the origins of january six if you know what i mean both the origins meaning where in the world that came from what actually did happen on the day and then the post january six treatment do you think we're gonna get fair hearings on that is leadership interested in that i hope so i and i again i continually point to Nancy Pelosi everybody from president trump to others in the administration to sergeant,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
in arms to to uh you know many many of the different law enforcement and intel groups requested and and all agreed with president trump requesting the national guard to be there on january six and it was Nancy Pelosi that did not pursue it and she was in she's in charge of the capital she was in charge of the sergeant in arms and they rejected the national guard to be there on january six that cannot be said enough and to me it boils down to that one critical piece of information and why she rejected them and then,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
you know and then you can just line up think you know so many things after that about her documentary her daughter was filming that day and the son was there from europe you know oh yeah the son's there for europe and then you know you've got like all the reports of the doors just being held open um but the real negligence there whether it was purposeful or not and it's hard to say it wasn't purposeful um but we you know of course such a speculation is that why did Nancy Pelosi turn away the national guard and,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mayor mary ill bowser by the way turned away the national guard for dc and there and all the intelligence reports were there saying that there was going to be violence and that started in late december they had those intelligence reports uh so i certainly think that that alone needs to be addressed and i believe she she should be held accountable if she was willing to impeach president trump on january 11th of 2021 literally five days after the riot on january six um it is it is severe negligence and irresponsibility to ignore the speaker of the house,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
refusing to have the national guard there on january six i think she should be held accountable the same way they went after trump exactly she we know she should be held accountable the question is did someone tell her to reject it and why and does that have something to do with the right type of people that seem to be around and how deep that runs but you're right that seems to flow from that original question is why did they um stop any help from coming before i really appreciate your perspective i think you give a very,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
mature full balance perspective we've learned a lot um how could people help out with your reelection effort well just as i said i don't take any donations from lobbyists or corporate packs and that's how most members uh taken a lot of donations i only rely on small dollar donations and my democrat opponent has raised i think close to fourteen million dollars against me in my reelection so if anyone is willing to donate at mtg for america dot com mtg for america dot com i greatly greatly appreciate it so that's a wonderful way to support me in,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS

issues i can't believe the time has already gone the week is over i had so much more to get to but it was worth it to hear another perspective you know if nothing else everyone accuses her of being some wild-eyed dummy i mean all the smarts at conservatives look you know she's very tempered she's very measured very thoughtful um she didn't take some of my bake you know she doesn't want to swing that hard at leadership and i understand from where she's coming from um i get it and and i think you know where's other members,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
coming in if i didn't see that willingness to fight i wouldn't trust them with statements like that with her you know she will bring up a liability bill to take away liability and all you know four-year moratorium on illegal immigration uh no i mean legal immigration all immigration so it's not like she's toned down but she's like look let's let's see how we can work with them two interesting points and i'm not going to say she's wrong on them um number one the house conference is different um most these people are reared more into the generation,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
of the fbi rounding people up rather than the iraq and afghanistan wars and the most important thing we can do is fight uh you know some tribal warfare in syria or something and number two um it's interesting that because of the wokeness whether they originally were like us or not the the corporations treat them as such so they didn't take money from them so that is an interesting point that i haven't thought a lot about so there is some optimism but at the same time like i said there's a lot of accountability measures i will talk,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
a little bit more about some of the freedom caucus ideas that need to be adopted um you know again i mean how much they're willing to fight for it in the freedom caucus i understand i understand what they're doing and you know with her say speaking about some of the limitations it just underscores the need to focus on the states which we will in fact i'm going to focus on that more than i focus on congress uh in the coming months because there there's no excuse you got the house you got the senate you got the,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
governorship super majorities what are you doing and we're going to have a list of demands there's no excuse but again they do have the budget these issues the that the democrats are pushing and things that they've done are extremely unpopular they should be able to win a budget prengvmanship and as far as stand-alone legislation let's push a rule that any congressman that gets 10 percent that's about 24 members support it sign on sign a petition it gets an amendment vote so in other words they want to have a vote on ending mandates awesome fine now that,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
needs to be put in the budget otherwise it won't go anywhere but even as a stand-alone they will not allow a vote on um you know ending liability naturally they don't want to vote like that well let's force that vote let's allow the vote and see who votes against it so we can know where they stand the transgenderism they'll have some sort of parental rights thing are they going to end all transgender oriented funding within the federal government i'm not seeing them promise that much less deliver let's allow an amendment vote on that and see where,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
they stand like she said with immigration you know they'll have a pretty good standalone illegal anti-legal immigration bill that i think we could all get behind at least in the house now the senate won't pass it a will they pass it in the budget b will they push the states to start adopting it and see even as a stand-alone we need to amendments to that that because we've had so much out of control legal and illegal immigration boxing out the american worker attenuating the american culture not a similar ball degrees of immigration we are we are,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,HS
at least 10 to 20 years beyond what anyone in past generations would have unanimously agreed we needed a cool-off period as we've always had historically after massive waves and here we had wave after wave after wave after wave after wave with no end in sight um i can tell you republicans do not want that vote okay they want this like neat messaging um pro-illegal pro-legal immigration anti-illegal immigration okay but that's a stupid thing it's like saying on pro-vaccine well what type and what circumstance what's the data you know what what's what's the safety and efficacy same,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS
thing here so these are important um the rules package you need to hold your member accountable are they going to support the freedom caucus um freedom caucus style rules are they going to join the freedom caucus believe me i think a lot of people in the freedom caucus are a waste of time and and a bunch of you know just messaging machines that don't want to really fight where it matters but at least but if you're not even willing to join the freedom caucus that tells me a lot about where you stand unless of course you're,6351_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2022-10-21_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You understand the problem with that,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We are headed to inflation,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" It's only 6% right used to be, we'd want two, two and a half percent, 6%",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's like good news,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But again, it's just that the rate of increase slowed a little bit",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But it's a record high baseline, just like gas prices are like $3",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
40 for March,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is before we head into the Memorial Day surge,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's high,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, but the fact that it wasn't quite as high as before, that's the new baseline, the new normal",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

3%,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is almost every month for two years,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I think it's a 23rd or 24th consecutive month with real annual earnings down while core inflation numbers are way up,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the only reason why it was dragged down is because the used cars weren't sane,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So that kind of went down a little bit,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 This is when it looked like we're headed towards the era of raising interest rates,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Republicans are like belly-aking,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, it's the raising interest rates, the problem",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not the raising interest rates is the problem,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, it's the fact that they were artificially made so low, so that raising them would then become a problem",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But again, Republicans are missing the point, hearing a lot of that from them",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that's where we are,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there's no sense of direction on the need to say the Federal Reserve cannot temper with the market,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" That's how like COVID is repudiated, just like the bank bailouts are repudiated",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the policies continue,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because all we have is commentary without direction,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Your mental illness through that,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 So the point is most of these people will be able to assert that they're suicidal,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it basically guts the bill,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So even this where we were kind of actualizing a degree of success,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" So man, I mean, it's just off to the races",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Where's our version of that? Well, you know, we've only gotten, we only have one governor",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's really where I want to head next,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So folks, why is it that we only have one governor we, we speak of? Again, you look all over the country",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" People think, Oh, maybe it's Greg Abbott",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, it's awful",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, awful zero leadership on any issue",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You go to Oklahoma,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And again, we have the governor that not just released the most criminals of any governor in American history, but he's pushing drivers licenses for illegals now of all times",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, Tennessee's doing some good stuff",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, you know, the legislature has gotten a lot better there",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The speakers are decent guy,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've had him on,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the governor, I mean, he's opposing the state sovereignty bill that we talked about that is really the best interposition bill that I've seen written, gives the people, the counties, the legislature and the governor, all say in constitutional interpretation to push back against unconstitutional federal, federal edicts, I can't find anywhere where there's a good governor",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And like we said, there is zero policy direction",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, well, Daniel, we don't like policy",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We, you know, we just like politics as an end to itself",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it's all about elections,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But then when it comes to elections, if there is no resolve, even when they realize like, yeah, you know, we've kind of been eaten by our lunch has been eaten by Mitch McConnell",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yes, this is pretty bad",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need to change it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Where is the impetus to change things? We talked about how there are so many deep red states that had a gubernatorial elections,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have failed to get a single new good governor across the finish line last year,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And again, states where the Democrats were not a problem",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nothing,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even now, there's no impetus to look forward",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you know, in a couple of months, there are actually primaries, three deep red states, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" As I noted before, we had on a really good candidate from Kentucky",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And she had to drop out because she didn't get enough support,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So we'll be stuck with a Mitch McConnell guy,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Louisiana, maybe hopefully we'll get a little bit better",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Landry is okay,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then there's Mississippi,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That is a state that we should hear about as the leader in everything that's good, fiscal, social, everything",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But instead, it's like most of these other states where there's a handful of conservatives in the legislature, the executive officials are terrible, as may as well be a blue state, but they are holding statewide elections, legislative elections this year",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What are we going to do about that? So with us today is a very special guest that hasn't been on for a long time,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think someone who embodies everything we're talking about and the lack of of movement towards him in those other elections is the embodiment of what we're talking about,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're talking about Chris McDaniel,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's the man who challenged that Cochrane before it was cool in 2014,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And he won the first round and really won the second round because there were problems, irregularities in that election",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And no one cared,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All these people that are Johnny come lately is Oh, McConnell's terrible, but really won't tell you what they'll do even prospectively now",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But when it actually mattered, there was no one there",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I had few people to work with to build momentum,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he really almost did it by himself anyway,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All right,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, maybe we'll learn our lesson",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You come to 2018,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We had another Senate seat up,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And there was this woman Cindy Hyde Smith, who was a longtime Democrat, became a Republican later",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Trump comes in and preemptively endorses her,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She was, you know, picked for the seed",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he endorsed her against Chris McDaniel,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So two times he stood up for us when it could have mattered,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And guess what? The cavalry were didn't didn't come in,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 And this is where we are today,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All these people complaining about it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was it was apparent to anyone who's who's has their eyes open that Mitch McConnell and his minions were a problem in 2014,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Certainly 2018,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Nothing,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even now, there's really no movement",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's nobody focusing on this place,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now, I thought he'd be bitter about it going through those two efforts and coming up short",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you know what? He's back for more,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this time he recognizes that the state government is really where it's at,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Chris is challenging the incumbent lieutenant governor,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Lieutenant governor has a lot of power in the state of Mississippi,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So almost kind of like like the governor and many other states really controls the legislative agenda is Chris McDaniel himself who is still in the state senate,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He is the conservative leader of not too many conservatives in that chamber,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So he is here today to discuss why Mississippi is not read, why these states aren't read and what is it going to take to make them read? Hey, Chris, it's been way too long, but really an honor to bring you back here at CR podcast today",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, thank you so much",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really good to be back,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Thank you,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All righty,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So so why is it that you haven't given up? I mean, if I'd be in your position, I'd be done with this",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'd say the party's broken,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The state's broken,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The country certainly broken,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What exactly do you hope to accomplish with this bid for lieutenant governor? You know, it's not really I never have been in my character to give up",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I was born to fight,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I was born to try to make a difference, particularly in this country that we all love so much",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think one of the motivating factors there are my two sons and also just the idea of how quickly things have declined, how strange the country appears now from just 20 years or 30 years ago",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So there's a lot of motivating factors as to why I'm running a lot of motivated factors as to why I never quit,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In this particular instance, I've come to the conclusion that Washington again is incorrigible and perhaps Washington cannot and will never fix itself",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But to your point earlier, if we find strong state leaders and we use these states to push back against the federal apparatus, to push back despite and all the bureaucracy of DC, we can find a way to rebalance this system",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's what we're trying to do,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Florida has been making some inroads,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Texas has made inroads, but no one else seems to be speaking out",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If the states begin to reassert their sovereignty under the 10th amendment and begin to rebalance the system, I still believe we can save this country",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now here's the issue,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do you interpose with a rotten vessel? So in other words, the problem is the red states aren't ready",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
" You go to a state like Mississippi, the state institutions, the universities as may as well be like California, the hospitals with the COVID fascism and the way things went down with that, the mandates, the treatment as may as well be like the blue states",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, you always have these anecdotes at all, you know, this crazy thing happened in California, maybe didn't happen in Mississippi, but you know, they had all the policies in place",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, all the agencies, the Department of Health Department of Education, I'm not seeing them root out the leftist woke culture and reflect the values of the majority of the people like DeSantis is trying to do with the departments in Florida",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you know, Delber Hoseman and your governor there, Tate Reeves, you know, they're regarded as kind of reform minded conservative governors and national conservative media",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They seem to miss this,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 How do we change that? Strong leadership,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's going to take a very strong, assertive action on the part of someone in government to change it",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think now is the moment to utilize this environment that we've got,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People are angry,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Everywhere I go, I hear the same thing",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's basically what you just alluded to,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People sense it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They won't change,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They just don't know where to begin,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
" If you give them an example of courage, I believe they'll follow",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what that looks like is the ability to begin to root out these universities and this woke culture in our schools,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's probably the first stop along the way,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Secondly, the elimination of the income tax would be a great idea",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But as we look at this as a whole, it's actually very simple",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Reassert conservative philosophy across the spectrum,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Stop playing defense every year,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Get proactive and reform things while we still have a chance,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 I'll give you an example,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In this state, super majority legislators, right? And both chambers are Republican",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's nothing we couldn't pass if we just found the courage,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So why not take this opportunity to really move the needle right now? Move it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If we do that, I think you'll see others join us",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I really do,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Obviously, we've been talking about for a long time since we've less spoken, we've been talking about medical freedom",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you literally have this medical experimentation regime, something we could have never envisioned even a few years ago, where the government would willfully poison the bodies of people",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even after everything comes out, there's still no policy change",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no impetus for policy change outside of Florida,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no change at all,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mississippi Department of Health is still promoting these death shots,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When we wouldn't have them promote Planned Parenthood, right? I mean, and these things are killing people",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do we change the medical culture in Mississippi, which I look from the Department of Health through the private institutions and hospitals, I don't see a difference between them in California",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a great point,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It starts in Mississippi, strangely enough, in a very basic component of childhood vaccinations",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We don't even have the exceptions that most states have, particularly a religious exemption from the vaccines",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Think about this,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Only three states in the entire country do not have some sort of exemption for childhood vaccines,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mississippi, of all states, is one of those three",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's mind-boggling,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Consider it as conservative as we're supposed to be,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" My position would be if a parent has a religious objection, and it's founded, and it sincerely he'll believe, I believe the state has no business telling that parent how to raise a child",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In that sense, Mississippi is still way behind, but it just takes a couple of major changes",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Daniel, I'm telling you, if you were to see how people follow courage, you can see how change can be effectuated in a state like ours",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I always argue, if we're going to save this country, it's going to be these deep red states that have to push back",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Calvary isn't coming to save us from New York or California,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to be the deep red states that realign themselves and push back to get federal apparatus,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that's the answer to saving this player,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So you have 36 Republicans in your chamber, but let's just say you could count the conservatives on your hands, on your two hands in single digits",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How in the world do we change that in one election? Here's how oddly enough, and I'm not saying this about every single individual in the chamber, but politicians in general, they gravitate toward power",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Their ego controls a lot of how they conduct themselves,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
" So if they think they can get powerful committees, if they think they can get bills moved through, if they think they can get favors, whatever the case may be, they'll gravitate toward the powers that be",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I firmly believe that the chamber will go to the right if the lieutenant governor is a conservative,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People will govern from the right if he is a conservative,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the reason for that is it's a disproportionately powerful office,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 People don't realize this,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Mississippi, the most powerful position we have in state government is the lieutenant governor",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So if you have a strong conservative there, I think the body turns conservative, and that's how you start to change",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So that's why you're trying to say, and I guess this is really what we've been struggling for so long, is that we're trying to change the legislatures",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's tough because it's one by one,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I know my friends in Texas have been working on this for 15 years, and it really has not gone anywhere",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The common denominators, we haven't had an executive",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We haven't had a governor in Tull, Florida that has made a difference",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" All the Republican governors are more in the mold of Mitch McConnell, or sometimes Susan Collins",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Really, I mean, much worse than that",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you're saying that in Mississippi, it's really the lieutenant governor that kind of leads the legislature",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" He is the power to assign bills, the power to assign committees",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Even the governor's appointments have to come to the Senate for confirmation,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this LG sits basically from a power standpoint at the very top of our structure,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the office is very influential because of that,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So yes, I think Florida, the scientists take a swing state and turn it into a solid red state because he led by courage and conviction, not by consensus",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then all of a sudden, the politicians in the Capitol, since the wind changed, they since the momentum",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And now they all are moving to the right, all trying to stay under the fact that there's an umbrella, if you will",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the same principle here,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Strong leaders here would create a strong effect,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And not only among the people, but among the folks inside the Capitol",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that's how you change it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So how do you win an election like this, when you saw last time in 2018, you go up against an incumbent and she was a week in coming because she was chosen? It's tough",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It really is,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, you and I have known each other for about almost a decade now",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you came the closest really in 2014, but it's tough",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We rarely knock off sitting incumbents without a full blown scandal,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If it's just ideology, it just doesn't land for some reason",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm shocked that you weren't deterred by that experience,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm impressed by it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But how do you see yourself? What is this? In June, July, when's the primary? It's going to be August the very first point of August, August the 8th, August, they say a little bit more time",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do you see yourself building the support to knock off a singing coming? Well, thankfully, we already have a pretty broad-based amount of support in the state",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have an incredible amount of volunteers that the newspapers have already indicated that we are that the leader of the conservative movement in the state,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I don't know if that's right or wrong, but we do have this incredible following",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They basically broke our party down into three parties,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We have moderates, which the current lieutenant governor is the president of",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You have establishment, Tate Reeves, he's the president, so to speak, of the leader of those, and then the conservatives",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's where I am,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So how many mighty, thankfully, from the other two races, a lot of wonderful volunteers from the other two races? It's what puts us in a very winnable position",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Also, as we expose the lieutenant governor, the president of the LG, for the record that he has, we see his numbers begin to bleed away",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll give you one of those facts,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 16 Democrats in this chamber,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's all we've got,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 16 Democrats,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He appointed 13 of those 16 to be powerful chairman,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Did you know that? 13 of the 16,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why on earth would we be empowering Democrats to do anything in this environment? We won't,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 We won't,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Everyone talks about Texas in the fight there, but I didn't know about Mississippi",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're saying you got you have Democrat chairman,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 13 of the 16th, it's only 16 Democrats in the Senate, 13th chairman",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a higher percentage than Republicans are chairman,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Okay,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So this is who he is,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" By the way, this is the same guy",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're going to love this back when we first elected our first Republican governor in more than a century,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 His name was Kirk Ford,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm Dobert Hoseman back to the Democrat Ray Mabus,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You may know that name Ray Mabus,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That was Obama's secretary of the Navy,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But he backed Ray Mabus over Kirk Ford,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I so this is an old school Democrat that's been doing this for years,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And once we expose that, people see it and they begin to run from it",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So the data shows that he is vulnerable,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it shows we have a great chance to go in,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm excited about it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is there evidence that people are finally focusing on the legislature? So in other words, you have legislative elections alongside the executive positions, the statewide offices as well",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is there any chance that we have irons in the fire to increase the numbers in the legislature? Yeah, I think so",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think so,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, from the standpoint of Mississippi, we already have more Republicans than we can take a stick at so this thing",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's supermatorically in both chambers,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The key is to have those Republicans actually govern as Republicans,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What happens in these single party states? A lot of Democrats just switch their party label and they continue to govern like old school Democrats,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Once we acquire this position, we can push the body to the right",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Exposing those old Democrats that now happen to help ours by their names,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If they don't become conservative, if they don't push to the right, then they need to be challenged and go home in the next primary, but they have to be exposed first",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the idea,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The key here is to make sure that we don't govern out of a sense of loyalty to a man,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We govern out of a sense of loyalty to our platform as Republicans and as conservatives,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And as long as we do that, we'll see a litmus test of that",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Did you vote like a Republican or not? And if you don't, you don't need to be in this party",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just a simple,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We need fighters,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 We don't need people to come up here and sell us out,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 And I think we can make that happen,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yep,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, this is the story across the nation, Mississippi embodies that we've taken a tour of a lot of these states and it's very stealth",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 A lot of people aren't focused on it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's the problem,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the minute you shine that light on it, it's a different ball game",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Obviously, when Glenn Beck got involved in this bill in South Dakota with banning cryptocurrency is definition of money, he got Christie Gnome to veto it",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They want good press from conservative media, but we got to stay focused",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's what we're trying to do here,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" My big concern is this, what I've found in a lot of these states, the reason why red states aren't red is because the way our government is set up and the tax structure is set up and the printing of the money, the money and the power flows from from the federal government",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So these states are strat for cash and they will not do anything that will really, we need to be independent of the of the feds",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, this is the new 1776",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, they're much worse than anything King George did",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But instead, they so badly want the federal funds",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 We had this a lot with even something so immoral as the clot shop mandates and mass mandates and hospitals,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, well, we can't jeopardize the CMS mandate, the CMS funding, right? Anything that will run and even before they even threatened to cut off funding and often they really won't, but they won't even butt up against it",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's what I'm finding a lot of the United States,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They become such slippers for the federal government,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do we break that vicious cycle of dependency? That's that that's really the what is the trillion dollar question, right? You know, it's crazy",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mississippi recognizes inherently it's sovereignty,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's people recognize that sovereignty under the constitutional framework that we have,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And yet you're right, the federal money has a way of controlling things",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the feds, of course, they step back and they say, we still can say no to this cash, but we we depend on it so heavily",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've got to find ways to free ourselves,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've got to find ways to be more self sufficient,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 One of the best ways we could do that is to create an environment for economic growth,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The more private funds we have, the more jobs we've got, the less likely it is that we would depend on so much federal monies coming down into our state, which by the way, can absolutely hinder economic growth",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's one thing we've got to find a way to do is become more self sufficient,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we can do that by a better environment,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, here's the other thing that's awful to talk about",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's even terrible to contemplate,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to happen eventually one way or the other,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, you think about the federal government being $31 trillion in debt with absolutely no end in sight",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Then you tack on the unfunded liabilities or the promises that have been made into the future,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's going to end eventually,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We better begin to prepare ourselves for something else besides just depending on federal dollars because if not always going to be there, that's just a mathematical certainty of it",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, no, it's it's definitely not",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's definitely not,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The other issue I have is if you're Lieutenant Governor, so your purview is going to be more in the legislative branch than the executive branch",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The problem I'm finding in these red states is that the legislators are very part-time,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a lightning quick session and then done,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Except the governance is not done,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, the executive agencies are doing their thing all 365 days a year and there's no oversight",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How do you strengthen our ability to engage in oversight and audit every policy funding and action of an executive agency to make sure it comports with the state's values and is not I mean, because everywhere you go with these tiny red states, you'll find the promotion of green energy and global warming",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You'll find the promotion of the anti-biblical agenda, all that encompasses",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You'll find the promotion of the biomedical security state and the entire vaccine agenda, which has really been repudiated the last few years",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't find, like I said, aside from a couple issues, maybe abortion being one of them, guns another, you don't really find that reflected in the culture of the executive agencies",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is that something you feel you can leverage or is that something that you need a new governor for? I think we can leverage and I think I can work with Governor Reeves to make that happen,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" From a legislative perspective, we need an environment that calls for deregulation",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
" In other words, no more control of these bureaucrats over our day-to-day lives and affairs",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 You've seen this in Congress,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It seems that the legislative branch has advocated its responsibility to these agencies and others to just run the place while we're away,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not effective government by the people,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These are unelected bureaucrats and they have to be held accountable,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are various things we can do here to do there,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can create a committee to make sure that new regulations can't be promulgated or passed without legislative approval,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We can begin to deregulate some of those places and force them to clean up their own houses, so to speak",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
" I think once they understand the oversight is there, most of these agency heads will move the right direction or they perhaps could pure lose in their position",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that would be a mode of an in-factor law,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" What do you do with Mississippi schools? You look at a lot of the public schools and it's not like what people like myself from Maryland would think, man, Mississippi values",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't get the impression that's what's going on in your public schools,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So both on the value side and the academic side, how do you fix it or do you not and just evacuate from it? From the school standpoint, I think that's a very complicated question because we have some really outstanding conservative teachers",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My wife is a teacher and I can tell you from that perspective they do a great job,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The problem seems to be administration and that's where most of the dirty conduct begins,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The teachers in Mississippi, for example, they're not going to get involved in this gender ideology or this woke concept, but if it's forced upon them, body administration, higher up from Jackson, that's when things become problematic",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,HS
 So it has to be controlled from that point down,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We still have good teachers and good schools,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Something else I'd like to see,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Something else I'd like to see,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 More freedom of choice when it comes to these schools,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There's no justification for trapping a child in a failing field district, none whatsoever",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" No, definitely, definitely",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Final question I was just interested that there were signs in recent elections that black voters in rural areas are moving over moving away from the Democrat party,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you see that? Do you see an opportunity there in Mississippi for a change with the right kind of non-country club Republican message? Yeah, absolutely",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, the message we talked about in 14 was alone that same thing",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we talked about fiscal discipline and we talked about social conservatism,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you might recall, Daniel, that last night that we so-called lost the race, we won 59% of the Republican party that night",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was the Democrat crossover vote that defeated us,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So does that message work? Yes,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If it delivered properly, it does work, for sure",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That's how you can have a state where the values are in one direction,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And see, the thing about Mississippi is it's even more conservative values than the electoral patterns show because it's 40% black",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 There's no reason for it,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about it? That's the question,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We never focus on issues, the legislation, the primaries that matter",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" My point is look at what he did in Florida, which was formerly a swing state",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It didn't have to be that way,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Trump screwed us endorsing against Chris McDaniel,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" It's like, dude, that was your only good endorsement you ever made",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And again, it regrets it because he's running against him",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all personal,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not like you could point to anything he didn't Florida that you disagree,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Although it's not true,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" I mean, look, Tucker is better than the rest, but it would be a big help if Tucker would have on people like Chris McDaniel",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" But no, we don't",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me just end with this thought,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And, you know, Trump and DeSantis both opposed",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That's that dichotomy,6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So even when we come to a revelation, you pull the primary voters, yeah, the vaccine's bad, yeah, the biomedical security state's bad, lockdowns are horrible",6265_Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz_2023-03-14_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Here's the basic gist of the story,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let me just give you the first paragraph,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The United States is stepping up digital incursions into Russia's electric power grid in a warning to President Putin in a demonstration of how the Trump administration is using new authorities to deploy cyber tools more aggressively current and former government officials say,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now this is the problem with it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They say it's current and former officials,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so it's the unnamed sources,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In interviews over the past three months, the officials described the previously unreported deployment of American computer code inside Russia's grid and other targets as classified companion to a more publicly discussed action directed at Moscow's disinformation and hacking units around the 2018 midterm elections",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Advocates for the more aggressive strategy say it's long overdue after years of public warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI that Russia has inserted malware that could sabotage American power plants oil and gas pipelines or water supplies in any future conflict within the United States,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Okay, this to me is good news",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This to me is something that we have been talking to you forever about,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have been begging someone in the government to pay attention to this,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The Putin says that we are already in World War III,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He made this announcement to a group of Western reporters probably about four years ago and he said the governments of the West just don't understand it yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the next war is going to be all ones and zeros,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And so there's not going to be necessarily bombs falling from the sky with us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They will shut off the electric grid,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now imagine if you fry our electric grid, the chaos that would ensue just in a week",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" But if you could find a way like an EMP to destroy us, 95% of all Americans die within the first year if you just keep our electricity off",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" Let me say that again, if Russia could find a way to keep our electricity off, 95% of the US population dies within the first 12 months",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Now that is quite a statement,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's much more powerful than any nuclear weapon,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And all you have to do is just lob a few ones and zeros over our way,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Russia has already said that this is the way we will fight World War III,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't know if we're going to fight World War III,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 I hope we don't,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the only thing that kept the world in balance was mutually assured destruction,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Now this does not work in cases like Iran,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mutually assured destruction does not matter to them,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" Because they are trying to, and now this is very controversial to say, and I know a lot in the media will disagree with this, but all you have to do is read their words and take people at their word",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When they say they're going to kill you, you should take them at their word",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 It's the reason why in 99 I saw Osama bin Laden as a threat and said that he would blow up buildings and there would be body and blood and buildings in the streets of man,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" The next decade, or I said the next 10 years, and it would have Osama bin Laden's name on it",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was called crazy at the time, but it was not a prediction",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was looking at his words and saying, this is what he says he's going to do",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's believe him and prepare,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We didn't,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Same thing with, same thing with ISIS and the caliphate",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 We didn't take them seriously,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have to take Iran seriously,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" They believe that if they can cause chaos by shutting down or destroying America and Israel, they will hasten the return of the promised one",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" Think of it as, you know, bringing, think of it as a group of crayons",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A group of crazy Christians who are like, you know what, I'm tired of waiting for the second coming",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I'm just going to make sure that I help cause Armageddon,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 That's what the Iranians believe,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are compelled to do,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let's take them seriously,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The reason why they won't care about this is because they are cave dwellers and I don't mean that as literal as, as it sounds",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What I mean is their system is not as advanced as ours,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When's the last time you use cash? Think of that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When's the last time you said, I got to go to the bank and get cash",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When's the last time you filled up your tank and went inside and gave cash to the guy or to the woman I'm so sorry for making that awful stereotype,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We rely on a system that replenishes our, our supermarket shelves",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 12 times a day,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are deliveries coming to the average supermarket 10 to 12 times a day,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You cancel that for three days and our supermarket shelves are empty,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You cut our electricity off and we have no cash,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You cut our electricity off,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You cut our, our communications out",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can't communicate with one another,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have no idea what's going on,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We can't call 911,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The world falls into chaos,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The people who are living, you know, more like the 1970s even don't have as much to lose",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Those in Afghanistan that really have spotty electricity, they don't care at all",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Russia is the probably one of the only ones that we can keep at bay with mutually assured destruction,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" China probably doesn't care as much, although it is their cities are so controlled now by electronics",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 They are probably starting to care more and more,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the mass population of China won't see a difference if the modern world goes away,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Advocates of the more aggressive strategy says it's long overdue, quoting the New York Times, after years of public warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but it also can carry significant risk of escalating the daily digital cold war between Washington and Moscow",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Guys, we're not starting this",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're not hacking into their elections,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They hacked into ours,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The administration declined to describe specific actions it was taking under the new authorities,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now listen to this, which were granted separately by the White House and Congress last year to the United States Cyber Command, the arm of the Pentagon that runs the military's offensive and defensive offensive and defensive operations in the online world",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So write this down,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have to do a show on Cyber Command,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But in a public appearance Tuesday, President Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton said the United States States was now taking a broader view of potential digital targets as part of his effort to say to Russia, or anyone else quoting that is engaged in cyber operations against us, you will pay a price and, quote, Power Grids have been a low-intensity battleground for years",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Since 2012, current and former officials say the United States has put reconnaissance probes into the control systems of the Russian electric grid",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But now the American strategy has shifted more towards offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside Russian systems at a depth and with an aggressiveness that has never been tried before",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It has intended partly as a warning and partly to be poised as a direct cyber strike if a major conflict broke out between Moscow and Russia,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The commander said that it's time to defend forward,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They don't fear us, he said, to the Senate a year ago during his confirmation hearings",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But finding a way to calibrate those responses so they deter attacks without inciting dangerous escalation has been the source of constant debate,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Mr,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Trump issued new authorities to cyber command last summer in a still classified document known as the National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, giving General Nakasan far more leeway to conduct offensive online operations without receiving presidential approval",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So when people said, well, the President probably didn't know about it",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It could be, could be because he gave this far-reaching authority to cyber command last summer",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The action inside the Russian electric grid appears to have been conducted under a little-known new legal authorities,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Listen to the way this is slipped in to the military authorization bill passed by Congress last summer,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is why we don't do those big omnibus,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The measure approved the routine conduct of clandestine military activity in cyberspace to deter, safeguard, or defend against attacks or malicious cyber activities against the United States",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now I'm wondering if that gives them the authority to do that in country or only out of the country,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Under these laws, these actions can now be authorized by the defense secretary without presidential approval",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is bad,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is really bad,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't keep giving power to different authorities,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't know when we're going to get that, but nobody in Washington seems to get it yet",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 More on this and what it means and what you can do about it coming up in just a second,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" First, let me tell you about relief factor",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you are in pain, millions of Americans have changed their quality of life for the better",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 I have met with members of this audience who have real debilitating pain and their stories really before they started taking relief factor are heartbreaking,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I know what it's like to live in real pain,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've told me stories of how they were hopeless because their lives cascaded into a fog of heavy pain medications,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The worst,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And it led to terrible choices, terrible consequences",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Most of the release factor's clients are people who just can't enjoy taking a walk or playing golf or just playing with their kids or grandkids,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the results are the same,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 70% of the people who take relief factor get their life back,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" 70% of the people who just try the three week quick start, take it day after day, month after month",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In my case, it started to come up on two years",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Relief factor,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It works,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Help control the inflammation in your body,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Help control the pain with relief factor,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you want to drug free a natural way to ease your pain and get your life back, go to relieffactor",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 That's relieffactor,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Station ID,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I just want to give you a couple of other things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Both Nexon and Mr,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Bolton threw a spokesman to client answer questions about the incursions into Russia's grid,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Officials of the National Security Council also declined a comment, but said that they had no national security concerns about the details of the New York Times reporting about the targeting of the rushing grid",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Perhaps an indication that some of the intrusions were intended to be noticed by the Russians,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Of course they were,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Of course they were,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Do you really do you honestly think that we are that we're better off by making sure that the Russians don't know anything? If so, why did the Russians release the tape of the hyper speed missile? Happen two weeks ago",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you see it, it's like a bullet coming out of a gun",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is not like a missile coming out of the ground,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's unbelievable,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Why did they want the world to see that? They wanted to see what we wanted they wanted us to see what they were doing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 As a warning,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So some of this stuff is a warning,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now so far there's nothing in this article that is surprising,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I wouldn't be surprised if the president trying to keep his negotiation power is doing two things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" One, playing the innocent, I don't know anything about that",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I had no idea about that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He signed it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He knows about it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But this gives him some possible credibility when sitting down at the table with Moscow,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Of I, you know what, Vlad",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Little out of control there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'll talk to him,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but that may be what he was doing there",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Also the president is fighting for his life on an election,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm sure Stu will get into the election results that we have seen now the polling numbers not too good for the president,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he's got to win,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he knows that the press is doing everything they can to destroy him,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Personally, I think that this is good",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If I were the president, I would have come out and said, you know what, damn right",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 we're doing that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" These guys meddled in our elections, but the press has already set a trap up for him on that",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They meddled with our elections,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They've already said we're in World War 3,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We don't want to be in World War 3, but we will be prepared",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And we know that they have already done these things to us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so yes, our cyber command is up and running",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I feel pretty good about that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And Americans should sleep well because we are protecting this country,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're doing everything we can,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the one thing I have control over is cyberspace,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so we are working to protect this country,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now I'd like to get to work and protect this country from our southern border and what's happening there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 There's disease that is starting to run out of control,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We could fix this quickly,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Get the Democrats to sit down at the table,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that would have been a good way for him to handle this,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's Monday and I want to talk to you about some things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this is all going to be taken out of context,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is all going to be made into conspiracy theories, etc",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

" And I just decided, you know, last week, I'm just going to do it",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I want to make it really clear,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What I talked about here at the beginning of the show was what's happening with Russia and the United States in cyber ops,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they are looking for ways to be able basically to shut our power off and we're looking for a way to shut their power off in God forbid a nuclear, I mean, sorry, a cyber war",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Putin has already said World War three would be fought with ones and zeros,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He says we're already in World War three,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're already trying to make us doubt our elections by hacking in,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We know that they did this in Chicago,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We know people have penetrated our power grid,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Are we doing anything about it? New York Times came out and said, yes, we are",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The president was upset about this, but I don't think he should be",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think this is a sign of real strength,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm glad to know we're doing cyber operations, but there is another way for things to be destroyed",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And that is political correctness,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And we're already seeing this happening with the silencing of voices and it's getting worse and worse and worse,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I want you to know that it's not like any other time before,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If somebody said something and, you know, Hitler wanted to, you know, make sure that they weren't heard from again, all you had to do was hide their books or hide their printed speeches or whatever",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now you don't have any books,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't have any printed speeches,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Most people have everything digital,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So when you want to ban Stephen Crowder, if they wanted to ban Stephen Crowder, all of his stuff is up on YouTube",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They own the rights to it by putting things on YouTube and by putting things on Facebook if it's first run, they own the rights",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So everything that you've ever put on Facebook or YouTube or any of these things, you don't own anymore",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so if they want to erase you, it's gone",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Think about all of your pictures that you have,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have a most likely downloaded on a computer,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If that God forbid, we are hit by some cyber weapon, all of that history is gone",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So what are you going to do? We need to preserve things because there are two fronts that we're fighting on,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" One is an insane cyber attack, which I hope will never happen",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I don't, I wish I could say I don't think it will, but I don't know anymore",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But an insane global cyber attack, which would affect all of us in the world in a horrible way and millions, hundreds of millions of people would die",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The second is just 1984 or Brave New World, where things just start to disappear",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You don't actually own the movies that you buy from, you know, iTunes",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They have those movies, they have those songs, and they have rights to those songs, and they have to renew those rights",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If, for instance, and this is going to happen, Disney says, we're going to start our own service",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so, you know what? You can't buy any Disney things over at iTunes",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You have to buy them from us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" When those rights expire, those titles that were Disney marvel, they will just disappear from your catalog",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You paid for them, you bought them, but you don't own them",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's actually a rental system,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So if you want to destroy somebody, and they become politically incorrect, you just erase them",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So what does that mean for books? What does that mean for movies? What does that mean for songs? What does that mean for anything or anybody that is deemed politically incorrect? I think we need to save them, preserve them",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think we need to hold them in non-digital form, because I think you could lose everything quickly",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even if it's just political in nature, look at what's happening in Great Britain",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's becoming illegal to say the truth,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 It's becoming illegal to even joke,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You can't now do what was the story today from Great Britain, where you can't have any kind of dangerous stereotypes",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I love that, because I never defined that",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Dangerous stereotypes in any advertising,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, I think six months lead time for these companies to figure out how to avoid all their dangerous stereotypes",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they talk about how it's like, you can show a man working hard in a construction field",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's okay,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But it's not okay to then say, well, he doesn't know what he's doing around the house",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And my first thing that I'm like, well, this is what they're protecting men",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it looks like they're not incompetent,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, what that means is that only women know what they're doing around the house, and that's why it's bad",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Because women can't be shown to only be capable of doing these household chores,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And I don't know what year it was,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We used to do these things on patents too all the time,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 These old timey 1940s ads where it really was sexist,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, the hardcore sexism",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Really, though, the only time you see that now, I mean, guys are constantly portraying people",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, guys are constantly portrayed in these ads as being completely incompetent boobs that don't know how to do dangerous",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" All right, that's not dangerous",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not dangerous,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not a dangerous,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's not a dangerous stereotype,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I mean, you can't like they showed another example of, you can't say that a woman is a bad driver",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" If you show a woman driving poorly, that means that you're perpetuating that negative stereotype",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And that would be wrong and is banned now,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, first of all, you have a moment of, wow, you know, this first amendment thing was a good idea",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm kind of glad we kept it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I thought the exact same thing when I read it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's not the same thing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Boy, are we lucky we have the first and second and all all of the amendments",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because that could have taken it away quickly,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" See, only things stopping this from being the United States, right? I mean, like culturally, we are completely there",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They would be absolutely out here banning every bit of hate speech,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And many of these companies are doing it anyway,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They can't do it through the government right now,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I mean, this is complete reality for us",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the only thing protecting it is the first amendment,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And even that is, you know, as, you know, the guest guest sketchy, yes, at this point",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, sketchy",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then there's also the, the, just the simple truths of life",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" For instance, Pat, there's a new, my little pony series that's coming up",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, this week, a couple of new characters are going to be introduced to the My Little Pony Discovery Family Channel",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And there are going to be a new lesbian couple,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And to avoid any ambiguity whatsoever, the writer of the cartoon came out and said, because he didn't want anybody to be confused, he tweeted out, they are lesbians",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" Diversity and representation are important for kids, for so many reasons",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's my first priority on everything I work on,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 My Little Pony has always been about friendship and accepting people or ponies that are different from you,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it just felt like something important to do,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How about, how about not presenting? Well, let's, let's present zero characters based on sexuality for children",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How about that? Are any of the My Little Pony's heterosexual? No, because they've never talked about any kind of sex going on",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 As far as I know on my little ponies,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So why is this important? And the fact is, it isn't",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, it's important not to let our kids be kids",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Can you not just leave that to us? And we'll explain that when the time comes,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" No, and we'll talk to them",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Welcome to the Glenn Beck program,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Glad you're here,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is Monday,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There were some breaking news about the poll numbers this weekend that don't look good for the president and the president fired his pollsters,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And again it doesn't look good but the good thing is is we have one of I believe the leading guys on polls,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 His name is Stuber here and he lives polls,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He eats drinks statistics,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He loves it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he has been historically very very accurate in the way he reads polls and the polls that we should pay attention to and not pay attention to,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I wanted to get his read on what is really happening with the polls and is the president in as much trouble as the press would have you believe,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We do that in one minute,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yes,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Is the Glenn Beck program? Okay,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So people ask me all the time what can I do what can I do what can I do to help save the republic and their frustration is is understandable,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We all feel this way what can I do besides vote I'm so sick,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I guess I'm going to vote but what else can we do? Well in 2013 a group of conservatives these are military guys they got really fed up watching their cell phone bill going to the left and this started in California and now all of them,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 All of them are doing this they're they're funding Planned Parenthood every time you pay your cell phone bill,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Your money some of it is going to Planned Parenthood some of it's going to LaRaza it's going to things that you fight against every day,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Since 2015 this one group started by military guys it's called Patriot mobile and since 2015 they have quietly raised over two million dollars to support the Constitution and the values that we believe in all while,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Giving the people who use Patriot mobile a better deal so you're going to pay less money you're going to have the same service because they're on the same towers everybody uses the same towers now,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so they're on the same towers so you have the same great service you're going to save money and your money is not going to leftist ideas,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it's really easy to switch over I urge you to switch over right now this is one of those things we always say we're going to boycott X Y and Z and there's never a good alternative for us to boycott,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You can say I'm not going to watch a marvel movie or a Disney movie ever again you're going to because there's nobody making movies like that that are good that you can just replace him with,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Patriot mobile is the first to stake out this claim I think to where they can say this is as good if not better because it's going to save you money,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right now you get a free month of service when you switch over and they'll make it really easy to Patriot mobile dot com use the promo code back and and save promo code back a free month of service at Patriot mobile dot com,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I want to bring Stu right into the Glenn Beck program and I don't want to really get into the politics unless you think they're important to do about the Trump firing of the pollsters,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because politics is politics I really want to stick to the facts how bad are the polls for president Trump at this point they show him really trailing everybody including Elizabeth Warren are we to believe these polls,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean I know I would say right now you have to put a their legitimate internal polls and there's some external ones when you're talking about with Elizabeth Warren and stuff are largely external there's a lot that show him losing but that it's a it's way too early to take anything serious out of these polls I mean it's important for the campaign to understand where they where they are,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And kind of be able to plan for the future you know he's hasn't even officially really started running for president yet he's not tested any of his new messaging he's done none of these things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think kind of one of the important things you're seeing in the media is people basically saying Donald Trump is firing his pollsters because they showed him losing as if like he's you know he if they would show when he would have loved it right exactly and that's not what this was look you know they were internal polls,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The internal polls we shouldn't know about them right there's supposed to be hidden yes he was losing a lot of these states in these internal polls initially Trump kind of said those polls don't exist,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Then his campaign confirmed that they do but they were from March so they're outdated already anyway but beyond that like,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The issue here is that they shouldn't be out in the public there's supposed to be things used for internal internal use right so the reason why these people are getting fired is because they believe the links the leaks came from these pollsters,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They believe these people went out there took these polls realize that the Trump administration was never going to let them out and decided to leak them out,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's a huge problem if that's true you you have to be able to trust your team,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so now there's another theory out there he really can't trust anybody I mean I feel bad for the president in some ways he cannot trust a single person,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No I mean that was it interesting in that with Sarah Huckabee Sanders leaving that was one of the people you know she hasn't been doing a lot of press conferences however she's yeah become a pretty,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Central adviser to him and one of the few people that he believed he could trust I mean Bill O'Reilly as you pointed out said nobody he can trust nobody he trusts literally zero people maybe outside of it's certainly outside of family,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Maybe some of his family he trusts but that's about it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the issue here with these these polls is that this is not you know there are some things you can learn from polls this early you can usually find indications as to what's possible but we know in 18 months anything can happen here there's no reason to panic from these numbers at this point,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think he could win,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think it's not hyperbole you know better than I do on this stuff and I'm always I'm always wrong when it comes to politics and predictions,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But I think it's it's so open he could win by a landslide I mean a Reagan style landslide he could lose by a landslide it's that open,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think all those things are certainly in play I mean you go back to you know George H,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 W,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Bush at this time was incredibly popular president and one of losing his reelection,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We've seen you know Clinton did not look good at this time in you know in nineteen one ninety two and came back or nineteen ninety six and came back in one,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So these things change all the time it's way too far out I mean with the one thing I think you can look at with some interest at this point when it comes to,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Polling is more on the democratic side it's interesting to see number one,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Who performs best against the president like a lot of these polls will show every one of these people beating the president I think we all know that that's not I mean that's not reality,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it is interesting I think the the minute he stages a minute he steps on a stage with Elizabeth Warren she's done,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Elizabeth Warren thing is fascinating because it's as if the Democrats learned to nothing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's like take Hillary Clinton and then pop with you know give her filler with like really leftist policies so you'll not only loser because of the style and her incompetence on the campaign which also lose a lot of people in the middle because they think she's too much of a socialist,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Where you know Hillary at least tried to hide that Elizabeth Warren loves it so you take that it's like I can't believe they're falling for that one again if they put Elizabeth Warren,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I I saw the numbers of Elizabeth Warren beating Trump and I thought to myself oh please Democrats please show she is run specifically designed in a factory to lose to Donald Trump,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah if she can be if she could be Donald Trump literally any Democrat can beat Donald Trump right now which is who knows who knows how this country goes we have no idea,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But if you look at that and you say which candidate is performing best against a Donald Trump and you see Joe Biden is usually number one and all these recent polls that have come out publicly he's beating Trump by the most,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean people who are still have large amounts of Democrats and America especially who have no idea who they are I mean people that have no idea who Pete Buttigieg is yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean can he can he compete,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean he in one of these polls he's shown beating Donald Trump too although it's closer but a lot of this has to do with you know the American people have no idea who these people even are yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're about to have these first debates once you get through the first and second round of these debates you'll start to get a little bit of an idea where this race is but as of right now even Biden's lead which looks insurmountable to a little bit of a little bit of an idea where this race is but as of right now even Biden's lead which looks insurmountable to a lot of people is absolutely a real possibility of disintegrating,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So way too early to tell and I think the media's take on this which is just trying to say oh Donald Trump is is shallow and he doesn't want to see people losing so he's firing himself,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Look these polls leaked not once but twice that's that's completely unacceptable from your team it's this early why not switch him out that's a completely rational thing to do,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I saw clip earlier today on the blaze of a cause you court as and she was on I don't know meet the press or something and she was just horrible she was just horrible on it and I thought you know she she doesn't work in the old style media she just doesn't work,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 She's she's never good at it and if that's all she had she'd be nowhere,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 However she is a new generation and that is really really good online Donald Trump is not your typical politician,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And for anybody including me who said the guy's not going to win the guy won't be able to win it's because we were putting him into the mold of what America really wanted before,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well he's not that guy he's he's not a typical politician where I think Joe Biden is and Joe Biden's strength will be in the upper end of the Democratic party they'll look for that traditional guy who is just rock solid,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's steady blah blah blah blah even though he's not they'll believe he's he looks presidential America's not looking for that anymore,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's just not,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Otherwise Donald Donald Trump would not be president,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They are looking for somebody who who who who really understands what we're facing today or at least represents that I will tell you if I were if I were if I were if I were King of the political media and I was on Donald Trump side,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I would be saying to Donald Trump and his allies all of the people who are the 501c3s all of the people who are working for the president's reelection but are not connected to him,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They should really just concentrate on what the hell has happened to America,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 They should be doing all of the stuff about you know gay bathroom are we not gay bathrooms transitional bathrooms,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 All the things that have made people uncomfortable the silencing of voices the the crazy political correctness that's going on I would concentrate on the left and how crazy it has become and and and show the future,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Using their own words behind the scenes and show this is not who you are this is this is what you want and then Ronald then Donald Trump should be doing what Ronald Reagan did and that is it's morning in America it's a new day in America,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But remember I'm the first guy I'm the first guy that had a a homosexual on the republican stand,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Talking and speaking out about this I don't have a problem with a homosexuality I don't have a problem with gay marriage it's up to you,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And there is a reasonable path but even that wasn't reasonable enough because that's not where we're headed and him just doing a very positive morning in America show who we really can be not in the past show who we can be that our future is right here all we have to do is grab onto it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that would be effective because you have to remind people that things have gone crazy things have really gone crazy,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that there is somebody out there and it should be his vision of of a positive American future,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think that would win,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now whether he does that or not I have I have no idea I know he will go after the press and the press will go after him and maybe that's winning strategy this time around as well I I don't know,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Did you know that there's a black market for frequent flyer miles,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 At least a half dozen online markets have listing creative by criminals who have stolen frequent flyer miles and they're trying to resell them,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's really hard to you know detect the crime since people don't check their accounts that often so the theft may go undetected for weeks or even months,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are so many ways that cyber criminals are trying to take what yours personal information is exposed someone can use it to commit identity theft,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 So so still how right or wrong were the polls last time because nobody thought that Donald Trump was going to win,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 No I mean you know just not pay attention to those polls or were they wrong,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think there's a little bit of both in there and that it one of the big lessons that everyone took from 2016 is never look at another poll again because they're always wrong and really reality that's not fair at all,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The national polls predicted the results with the with I think they missed by about a little over as a point 1,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
1 or 1,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
2 points,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That is that doesn't sound right because we obviously know the result wasn't right but remember polls don't look at the electoral college polls look at the national popular vote which they predicted pretty accurately honestly,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There are a few state polls that were wrong and was enough to throw the election to to Donald Trump and you know that's the electoral college and obviously very important,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But the result the polls overall for 2016 were actually really solid when it comes to the nationwide one and honestly the bigger lesson to learn and this is a lesson that I certainly learned in the primary,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In the primary was in the primary like remember Donald Trump led all the polls people forget because at the very end everyone thought Hillary Clinton was going to win and Donald Trump won,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Well the remember the polls also existed for the primary and the primary said over and over again for months despite all the fundamentals despite all the things that said the opposite that Donald Trump should win the primary and is leading the primary and he did and he did,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So in reality like looking at these polls and completely dismissing them is probably a little bit foolish,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 However again a lot can change in the presidential election you know remember it was only a few weeks before the election happened when you have you know the access Hollywood tape coming out and polls are swinging towards Hillary Clinton with these large margins and he was able to,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we'll away at that and come all the way back to almost even in the popular vote right towards the end he hasn't started any,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know messaging here the idea that because here's some of the results he's down by 17 in Virginia state he's probably not going to win anyway he's down by 15 in Maine a 14 in Minnesota,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And one minute Minnesota in 2016 Michigan he's down by 13 in these internal polls again they're from March even the pollster who took them says at this point they're misleading he's losing into to Biden and North Carolina by eight he's losing in Iowa by seven in Ohio by one and you know these results are not good and obviously he would be destroyed if these were real but they're not real and that is a really important also it is also the unnamed Democrat,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's by the next thing this in this particular one of its Biden though Biden I think stands in for the the unnamed Democrat in a lot of ways because he's kind of the guy he hasn't really campaigned yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's a guy that people know but they know them largely because for him being vice president which as we all know in most cases is just a role,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's it's the backup quarterback role right people kind of predict that this person came in he'd be great but they never actually see him doing anything if you're a Democrat they've never seen him actually in acting these policies and when he's tried to come out and propose things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's really had a lot of trouble so far I mean the high demand is the big one where he reversed himself a multi decade stance against public funding for abortion,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And he's come out and and now reverse that stance a few times over the past few weeks,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's a stance that is actually largely popular among the American people even people who are pro choice generally speaking,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 can get behind the idea are it let's not put we know it's controversial let's not put public funding behind it it's only a slight majority of Democratic voters who support overturning the high demand,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I mean it's one of those issues that if he's wavering on something that that's a simple one to be quote unquote centrist about and he's already waving on those,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean what this campaign so do to him over a long period of time he may look just as socialist as any of the others,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So I just and maybe it's just me I just think that when America if the campaign is run right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When America says alright I've got the chaos of the Trump administration you never know how to predict it you know,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm tired of the fighting back and forth however,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 When I look at who he's fighting against he's fighting against the press and most Americans don't trust the press,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 so he's right on that one and he's also if they run things properly when you look at things like abortion and you look at,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Really pretty much everything,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He's in step with the American people they are wildly out of step and when it comes down to it they may say right now you know what I don't like all the chaos and all the bickering back and forth,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But when it comes down to it if the economy is doing well,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He will they will look and say you know what I got a job things are going pretty well,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think this is stable I don't like these things and you know there's a chance that they do enact those things I'm just going to go with this one let's not change horses,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think as long as the economy yeah huge risk for for Democrats in nominating someone like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders especially who's outwardly telling you they want to change the fabric of our society,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right at least Biden's attempting to hide that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And if you have someone who says basically okay here's a stable guy we already saw Biden in there again this is not my analysis I'm saying Democratic voter or a centrist voter even who says I don't like the chaos of Trump,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Biden he was around I remember that you start remembering these things more fondly than they were there's plenty of k-lock k-hust in the above administration but people will forget a lot of that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they'll say all right well he's not going to be a revolutionary you don't get that from Elizabeth Warren you don't get that from Bernie Sanders I don't think you're going to get that from Kamala Harris or many of these others and at that point you're saying well I have something good am I going to flush it completely down the toilet and try something different,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Or am I going to stick with what's going on right now which has aspects I don't like but the economy's good there's a lot of good things I think he's got a good case there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You're listening to Glenn Beck,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I think about flushing things down the toilet if you are using public Wi-Fi you do you know you do an online search,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Even in your own home and then you're fed a bunch of ads that are for that I mean you might think that's convenient,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But companies are monitoring you they're monitoring your voice they're monitoring your online searches your activity all the time and I think it's personal infringement myself I don't like it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it can be relentless and I know there's some upsides to it but the downside is really really bad,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's even worse when cyber criminals invade your phone your desktop your tablet to steal your private information steal your identity,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 There's an easy way to build a fortress around you and it really takes a couple of steps I mean you really have to have people who are watching for your identity and a secure VPN a virtual private network,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Two big stories I think that were happening this weekend at least they caught my eye was one the poll numbers and we just addressed those and the second big story was the the New York Times quote scandal of what they came out and talked about with Russia and I hit that earlier on first thing on the hour one of this broadcast you can listen to it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm also hit it from a different angle coming up here in about 25 minutes so standby for that but what we what we get from the news of the day really is the that America is changing the world is changing and and there are digital players that are in bed with the new world,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That are in bed with the left and this idea that America was never great America is a problem and the free market is a problem and that's a problem to us because we're living every day with technology that is is really remarkable,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Take a moment and just think about how remarkable our lives are right now nobody has ever had it as easy as we have it right now we have access to everything,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's remarkable even the poorest among us in this country you can share your voice you can be your own publisher you can print a book and write a book and print it and you don't need anybody on the in between you can be,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Do you have no boss think of this at the same time,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And this kind of goes back to what we were talking about with the cyber warfare between Russia and the United States voices can be silenced everything can be gone a single key stroke a tweak to even an algorithm,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you're behind a digital wall or America is silenced you don't have to worry about book burning anymore digital erasing is far more effective to make sure the only the popular or the politically correct speech is heard,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I'm growing more and more concerned and it's it's funny,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 If you read my book the overton window or the eye of mollock is I think a better even a better novel,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You'll see that we put in there at that time the founders keepers and these were people because the founders words were you know being destroyed that they they memorize they became Benjamin Franklin they became the keeper,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" of Thomas Jefferson and almost like people take the karan or the or the the old testament I'm trying to think of the I can't think of it now the Jewish people call the old testament, but the way they memorize those things pardon me",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah the Torah thank you the way they memorize the Torah that is because there was no you couldn't count on on paper you couldn't count on anything you had to make sure that it was told in an oral tradition now we're not at that point,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 However we might be at that point if we don't take and preserve some of the things that we have for instance I could be erased digitally you could never find a video of mine with a simple tweak of an algorithm,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You could lose all the books if they were digital that I've ever written you no one would know in ten years that I even existed,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the world we're living in now now it's not so important when you do it to Glenn back but if you do it to Thomas Jefferson if you do it to,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Really mark Twain Mark Twain is already being erased in our schools isn't he important,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I didn't they really kind of do this to Thomas Jefferson and we talked about this a while ago the first draft,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know you look at yes basically they made him out to be this slave owning you know I this guy with this hardcore desire for slavery when you read his first draft you realize the guy couldn't stand slavery he hated it he's he attempted to stop it it was one of his main points of reasoning to declare independence from Great Britain,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 As he outlined in giant letters in his own handwriting and yet that gets a race to the point that now all people think about this guy is was a slave owner and all the rest of his work is diminished because of it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean that it's a here is a great example imagine that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In a much quicker fashion you see what they're doing with like groups like these like hardcore extreme you know let's say you know neo not season and and things you see the tactics they use against them which obviously are these groups are horrific,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you see what they do against them and then you see that they do the same thing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Up the line where someone like Alex Jones who might be the next step there is now gone from all the social media once last time you've heard anybody even talk about Alex Jones other than just referencing him being banned I mean what the heck is he talking about anymore was a new conspiracy I have no idea,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 In fact he's got a new problem going on that I have long talked about,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I don't know I don't know anything about I'm not defending I'm I'm not dismissing but I am also not jumping on the bandwagon,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Apparently child porn was found on his company servers and he's offered a million dollars for anybody that can prove that it was planted there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He said it was it was planted it was sent to us and it was planted,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But that that'll destroy him if that would if that would be and I think they do that in a heartbeat to people somebody and not only government or anything else I just mean individuals hacking in and placing stuff on your computer and your hard drives,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then you think you have a defeat you think you could defend against that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 There's no way there's there's no way there's no way it's just like trying to defend a 30 year old me too claim right there's no way to defend yourself,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And like you know you're just done the next step for for Alex Jones is probably what the next step was against these white supremacist organizations and such where instead of okay we've kicked him off of social media he still has his website I'm sure he's still making plenty of money off of his website well now you go after the ISP you go after the the company's hosting it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I mean eventually you can get to a point where they'll take everything away you know from the beginning and that that line will move,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Okay so here's what here's what I want to ask you to do and we're going to do this over over several days it might take weeks to do this because I want to talk to people that I really respect and get there they're looking this to,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to start putting a collection together about of the library that needs to be preserved and a library that we that we all should have at least parts of it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know for instance we should all have the Geneva Bible and I you know you should have the King James Bible but also the Geneva Bible because that's the one that led us into freedom,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And David Barton has a good version of this it's the Patriots Bible where it explains it in today's language,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But you need to have a Geneva Bible or a Patriots Bible from David Barton you need to have a King James version because who knows how those things are changed or if they're just outlawed,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Wealth of nations along with moral sentiments if we are looking at a bunch of people who say that capitalism is bad and they're not,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Again you don't own your library if it is on Kindle,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 So we need to look at the things that are really about America about the truths of America,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 About the truth that are so easily being lost right now I think coming apart by Charles Murray is a really important book because it shows what was happening to us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You know all those controversial things that nobody wanted to talk about that shows the original divine divide,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 It's a quick pop up museum about the history with Abraham Lincoln and slaves and racism,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What is racism? Is that an American problem? What is slavery? Is that an American problem? What are these things? How do they start? What does it mean? Are they done? And it is very powerful and quite honestly quite controversial I think because it tells the truth and I have a feeling we're going to get a lot of push back on it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Obviously saying they're going to run,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have it all over Congress,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We also maybe have the most explicit example in the Deborah Ciney city council,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now one of the things you hear from Democratic socialists is all we want is Norway,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 All we want is Sweden,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 This is this is all we want,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" Well, that's that's absolutely not true Sweden, Norway",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 We just are going to have to have higher taxes,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 We still keep the free market the way it is,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" In fact, we should reduce some of the regulation because Sweden and Norway are way ahead of us on less regulation",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So businesses can make more money, but people make more money and that's we get the taxes and we take that money and we have a big safety net",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's the message of Norway and Denmark,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Not what Democratic socialists are saying,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Like it's easy to be able to live off essentially the work of other countries who have a freer market,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then of course there's other there's other more, you know, day to day pragmatic things",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like for example, you know, the day average new home in the United States is 2600 square feet, the average residents in Norway is something like 780",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 If it was a country and they had to live within their own means and they had to live with the consequences of what they wanted to do without dragging the rest of the country in with them,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is a very large country, huge population, very diverse, not everybody wants to go that way",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 You have to do what Norway is doing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They have to live within their own means or go out a business,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So there's a lot of trade offs there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" However, most of the most of the people who say they're democratic socialists, when you're talking about people who are philosophically advocating that viewpoint as we've seen from Jacobin and, you know, the piece we've talked about several times in Fox where they talk about basically what we're looking to do is overthrow capitalism",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They'll eventually admit it if you kind of actually go after them,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 I don't believe that our current economic system actually works,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So, capitalism by design is extractive and in order to generate profit in a capitalist system something has to be exploited",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's land labor or resources,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I think that we're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I believe in community ownership of land labor resources and distribution of those resources,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And so, whatever that morphs into I think is what will serve community the best",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 And because he's coming into his own,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's good,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all good stuff,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it's hard,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They're $5 Liberty Goldcoins from the US,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

" As we were building the railroad, this is the money that they used",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

" Just listen to it, even in bits and pieces over the week if you can",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We had James Lindsay and Peter Bagozian,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And these are the two scientists that are trying to take on the educational system and trying to uproot it and say, what are you doing? Shake it back awake and show how off track it really is",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they have just become pariahs and they know it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 And we had a fascinating conversation,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I want to just play a couple of things,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Bagozian is a, is a big atheist",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I, I wondered how we were going to be able to sit down and have a real conversation",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And if this would come up and if it did, how it would be handled, I want you to listen to this",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Here's Lindsay and Bagozian on religion,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The only reason people believe in the new religion is because they stop believing in the old, right? Nietzsche",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" It's kind of, I was thinking about Game of Thrones, but yeah",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now I have been to God to know about you,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And so Jim and I have written extensively about how there's a new religion,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And then this new religion is, it's, I don't know if it's a religion or a worldview or a cult, we're still almost a religion",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 It is a faith tradition or not tradition really,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is a faith system for certain, the social justice is a faith system at this point",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But they won't admit it because they don't have to because their canon looks like knowledge,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They aren't pointing to scripture, they're pointing to",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So it is their scripture,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It is, it is, it is",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It is,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" We have the parallels that you can speak to privilege being original sin, political cocho, yes",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Being blasphemy,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Privilege also being depravity,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You totally and makes it so that you can't do anything, but in, in, in, in, in the in the religious sense or Calvinist sense, it's that you are depraved in the sense that you seek to sin",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And here it's your privilege, so you seek to maintain your privilege",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a perfect parallel concept,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And they go all the way down,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Wokeness is being born again,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you can just go down the list,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Have we written this yet? Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I wrote it just before Christmas,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Erio magazine Helen Pluck roses are third contributed to an erio magazine,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's given 10,000 words",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So enjoy your time,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Oh, I will",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a solid memory,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I think so part of this is, you know, we host to the James de Moravana Importance at University",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it was going to be James de Morav myself,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we invited the women studies department on stage,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They said, no, two days later, a James and Helen Pluck Rose and I did an event at Portland State",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we invited the women studies again,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 Nothing,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We have consistently invited people to have conversations with us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And it's incredibly difficult when you want to have a conversation with us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's why it's, it's so interesting to me that the people on the right have been so welcoming to us",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, I've never lied to anybody",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, I'm an atheist, you know, I'm a liberal",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, never lied to anybody, but you've never lied to anybody about what you believe",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I've been totally taken aback by how welcoming people are because you, because part perhaps you have bought into the narrative that the right and some on the right are this way are a progressive right are a big government, big control",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, that there are those Christians who are like, my way and how I good we can get everybody baptized or whatever",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" There are, there is that sliver, but the right generally the strength still is this constitutional",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't hate my neighbor,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I don't mind,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And we, I want to work together",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 We're here because we see this vision that people can do something great with their life,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That's different than mine,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" That's, that's, that's a small group of people, but I think it's actually getting bigger because it's, it's in the American DNA",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Um, Lindsey, James Lindsay and Peter Beghosen on, on a broker of conversation",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Listen,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I says with total sincerity that you are a sincere broker of conversation,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I appreciate you having us on, even though you know, we have differences of opinion",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's fantastic,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, I mean, you don't understand how I'll tell you, I mean, you're thinking a big deal out of this",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Is this not happening? Because nobody, not in our lives",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Not in our lives,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, since we've come out with belong quote, whatever our side should be, aren't inviting us on their shows",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're not talking to us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're keeping two left wing outlets and talked over there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They're keeping derision on us,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like, you know, so when we did the atheist thing, everyone was like, oh, you know, you guys are just liberals or whatever",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Well, they were right",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But now that we've done this and that we've attacked kind of our own tribe or our own side,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the reason is, even though I share a lot of those impulses, that doesn't mean you get to make stuff up",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 That doesn't mean you get to pretend that something is knowledge,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Like, we really need to have something we can count on, something we can go to, something we can point to, and then we can squabble over public policy",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But we need to have things that we can point to and say, hey, you know what? We know this",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This has been, we've come about this, the integrity of this process is intact",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 You don't have to worry about it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The process needs to be defended,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, the process needs to be defended",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's the other thing that we've lost,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So I really do appreciate you inviting us on, you having a sincere and honest conversation with us",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And that's exactly what we need,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And we're not having it,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So can I tell you something? Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I feel exactly the same way,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is an amazing conversation because you realize how much we really have in common,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And let me play these last two clips for you,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Here they are, James Lindsay and Peter Bagozi and on idea laundering",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Postmodernism, right, is what our friend Brett Weinstein calls idea laundering",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So they have this idea, like they have this moral urge",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And they don't know how to discharge this urge, they don't know what to do",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So they get a bunch of other people who have this urge together, who have some kind of deep moral feeling about something and they write a journal",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Are they publisher journal? And then they idea launder,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They start publishing their, my think they're insane ideas, but they start publishing these ideas and journals",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And then those journals inform public policy,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So in some senses, how do you know the trigger warnings? How do you know say space? How do you know microaggressions? Well, they point to the journal artist",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Do you know that observing or training men like you train dogs will prevent rape culture? Push it through a journal now,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Now it's knowledge knowledge,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You have, you have the same thing",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is how they distorted history,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
" We have, for instance, George Washington, all of the stories written by the guys at the time in the, that knew him were next to him",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Those have all been erased,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And new professors come in with new studies,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's their opinion and they start quoting the next book quotes that guy and the next book quotes the two guys and then all of sudden it's done,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And what you're probably looking at there is coming out of what they call critical race theory and critical race theories openly historically revisionist,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What's it supposed to do? It's supposed to show that the white power has always been trying to maintain itself,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So somehow, no matter what happened, like the civil rights successes, for example, that was white people trying to make themselves look good by giving black people rights",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS

 Here's the last cut,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's really interesting because I spent a lot of time with conservatives because I live in the South,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" A lot of my friends are conservatives and libertarian conservatives, classical liberals at heart with conservative views",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I am actually encouraged by what I'm seeing there,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Again, and again, I hear the same thing",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I don't know what the reasons are,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Maybe it's just because Trump's in power and all of this, but I do know that I keep hearing again and again, I'm tired of all the fighting",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I'm tired of it being, you know, daggers against daggers",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I'm tired of it being that I can't be your friend because our politics,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Right,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Let's go back to what Jefferson said where matters of religion politics and philosophy,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Don't separate friends,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And I hear this so consistently from conservatives that I do have hope that there is at least a sea change going on,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I do think that because I did not experience that living as a liberal in the South for the last decade,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is new to see this as the main voice that I'm trying to have a conversation with people who has a different view without being called a racist or a bigot or a homophobe,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 What I see is people reaching across the table with an open hand,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Some people on the other side are going to slap it, but other people are going to take it",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And the more people who take that hand, whether it's a liberal reaching to a conservative or there's a conservative reach to a liberal, the more people who take that hand, the the fastest problem gets there",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And you've probably find you have far more in common,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 One is far more in common if they're conservative with a liberal,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And part of the reason is I think it was telling Jim, I think last night at dinner, it's really weird",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

 They suck,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They suck in comparison to an ex chair,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS

com,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 So let me go over the top three stories today that I think were really important that we covered today,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The New York Times article on Russia and US cyberware warfare,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It kicked up a lot of dust this weekend,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 President Trump said that it was a treasonous article,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I actually think this is a good article for President Trump,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's the toughest stance on Russia yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's been something that I've been wondering, are we doing anything about Russia for the next election? Are we doing anything? Are we watching? Are we competing in what Putin says is World War III, Fight of Ones and Zeros? According to this article, we are and the president knows about it because he signed in some new latitude for the general in charge of cyber warfare",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The second article that was out this weekend, the second big talking point was that the president's poll numbers are falling apart and he's fired people because he doesn't like bad poll numbers",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Not true,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 He fired people because they released confidential poll numbers,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They did it not once, but twice",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 They should have been fired,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" The second thing that you need to know, the poll numbers are old and they're unreliable",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 The president hasn't even started his campaign yet,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's something that he needs to kick off with a real positive vision for the American future and he needs to execute on that vision,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 I actually hope that the polls convince the Democrats that Elizabeth Warren is the woman to run against President Trump,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because I think she's a disaster,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" She is perhaps the only candidate, perhaps, perhaps because this is saying quite a bit",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Perhaps the only candidate that could possibly ever show up that's worse than Hillary Clinton, but we'll wait to see",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Hopefully, oh, please, Democrats, whatever you do, don't run Elizabeth Warren",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And the third article we never really got to and I think it's important if we can squeeze some of it in now,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Bitcoin is up to $9,000 and this is important because it's quietly happening this time",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is institutional money,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So this isn't the people who are like, I'm going to get rich",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" This is institutional money, which changes things dramatically in the positive for Bitcoin",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Yeah,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" They're all reporting on cryptocurrency has been horrible and they, you know, all you hear is, okay, it went up to 19, 20,000",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" How many long it was at 19,000? One day",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Yeah, there was a huge peak",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It was over 18,000 for three days and 17,000 for five days",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But the fact is, if you bought cryptocurrency in any month, other than the peak month, I think it's now, I looking back at it, 24 of 26 months since the boom started, you're currently up",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" So yes, if you bought the absolute peak, you're down",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But I mean, it would be difficult to do that",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It was only at the absolute peak for one day,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" If you bought a Friday, 20, any time in the 24 to 20 out of the 26 other months since the boom started, you're actually up right now",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And you know, the media is not talking about it anymore",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It doesn't have any of the hype,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's all negative headlines yet here we are,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And I don't know if anyone remembers the time that the tulip, you know, boom happened and then it lost all of its value and then regained half of its value a year and a half later",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 Because I don't remember the part in the story that did so to happen,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" You know, look, there's a lot of reasons why people who absolutely adore big government do not want cryptocurrency to succeed",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" And that is part of this, I think",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" But you know, look, other people, maybe somebody, if you got hyped up by somebody and you bought at the peak, you felt burned by it",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 But it would have been hard to do,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" I mean, when looking at it, I mean, cryptocurrency has been around for a long time unless you selected one of the, you know, couple of months that was at the absolute hype peak, you're actually up currently",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 And nobody's telling you that,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 It's a different story,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" It's 9,000 and I think what is very positive is that no one is telling this story",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is institutional lending or buying and this is what we said would happen,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,HS
 They would drive the market down and then they quietly get into it and they'd get rich,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
" Now really, it might be the time to get into it because it's institutional money",45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
 This is the Glennbeck Program,45338_The Glenn Beck Program_2019-06-17_transcription.json,Non-HS
