    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today it is January 6th, so you know that lawmakers are going crazy. The media is going crazy and luckily I have just the pair to get into all of the analysis of what is going on on the anniversary of America's darkest day. We've got a lot coming up and it all starts right now. Hey, welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. I'm trying really hard not to smile today because it's a very solemn day, as I mentioned. Very sad, very dark. I'm not surprised we're alive. I was told that this was just, I thought the world was going to end last January 6th because democracy almost ended. Yes. I didn't think we would make it this far. I know. You know, Sarah, me and Elijah were actually talking about the PTSD that we both have experienced because we were there at the Capitol that day. And you know that picture of that little old grandma who's waving the flag in the Capitol. Yes. How dare she? By the way. It haunts us every single time we close our eyes. Like we could barely sleep. I can't believe you're talking bringing this up. I'm sorry. I've asked you so nicely. I'm not sure if it's drama on your show or anything. But as you know, that picture is a really a deep, hard thing. I mean, I've seen, oh, kind of pictures that kind of put you off. The Twin Towers exploding with a plane crashing into them. But that's just 9-11. And then you see the grandma standing there with the flag. And I think I didn't know Americans could stoop this low. And it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it rocks my life every day. I went to a Pearl Harbor exhibit and I said, I asked the woman at the front. I really did. I said, have you seen that picture of the grandma inside the Capitol? It pales in comparison to this. Can you hear me now? Terrifying, truly terrifying. Like Sarah, we, we had to really cry it out before we got in the show because it's just taking us so much courage to be here today. I don't know how Brian Stolter does it to be quite honest with you. He goes on air. He wasn't there at the Capitol that day. But he saw videos of what happened via the lost a piece of himself that day. He had to go through it with the rest of us. It was a lot. It was a lot. So thanks for having us on on such a tough day for all of us. Well, I'm just, I'm hoping you guys make it through without sobbing and curling up into the fetal position on the floor. But that would make for good ratings. So I don't know. Obviously joined by the slightly offensive crew Elijah Shafer and Savannah Hernandez. And you guys, as you mentioned, we're both there on January 6th, America's Darkest Day, America's Darkest Day. When Luke Skywalker just came in with the rockets and got it right into the thermal conductors and blew up. Yeah. You know, I think I went back today to see if they had rebuilt the Capitol after that after they burned it to the ground. It's just published. It's just dust. Yeah. It's bad. Why nothing's getting done. Yeah. I know. Apparently they did rebuild it. Apparently after it completely was burned to the ground of the worst terrorist. They used the Lego set as an example. Yeah. Yeah. Right. They had lucky that we had one of those up. They picked one of those up. It means it's kind of crazy that they just stare at terroristic items at Walmart, you know, that you could use to stage an insurrection Lego set. But they do. It's very hard. So I want I do I really. I know. I'm really. Super serious. Interested in getting your take on the president and the vice president's speeches today. Obviously Democrats doing all they can to draw as much drama and attention to this day because what else are they going to do? Run on their own policies. We have a president? Well, that's what they say. You hear the president said. I'm like, when did we have? I think we haven't had one of those in a while. We have a hologram. Yeah. I think we have a hologram. So let me I'm just going to play. Obviously, both of them gave speeches. They were both just as obnoxious as you would expect. And so let's play just kind of a montage of Joe Biden in his speech today. Watch. We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. And here's the truth. The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle because he sees his own interest is more important than his country's interest than America's interest. He's still talking about Trump and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation and I'll allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy. We will make sure the will of the people that's heard that the battle prevails not violence, that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred. I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not dividing. To me, the true patriots with more than 150 Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box. The election workers have protected the integrity of the vote and the heroes are defendant this capital. You can't love your country only when you win. Wiking police is back in style. You can't obey the law only when it's convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies. And so at this moment, we must decide what kind of nation are we going to be? Tell us. Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed rule of the people? Huh, I don't know. It felt a lot like Joe Biden was describing Black Lives Matter, Antifa. People will do what they do. Nancy Pelosi said, I'm going to say this. Nancy Pelosi condones political violence. She just does. And on top of that, the poor man has just no charisma. I don't know what they injected him with. Maybe an happy pen or something like that to get him to just perk up. I saw the strings. It was like I saw the hands of the puppet master above him. Did you like when he said, I will stand in that breach. I'm like sweetheart, you're going to bet at 6 p.m. tonight. You're not standing in any. Yeah, you're standing the breach. And also it was like, you spread a web of lies with the 2020 election, sir. Is anyone going to tell him? No, I'm for one. And genuinely in shock and awe that Joe Biden said exactly what we all expected him to say. I really am. And Joe Biden trying to unite America. You know, he's been promising that for a while now. Still waiting for it to happen. We feel more divided than ever. But maybe that's not a bad thing. Yeah, he's like, it's supposed to be to unite. I'm like, I keep hearing about this uniting thing, but I also keep hearing you trying to like eliminate unvaccinated people from society by like not allowing them to feed their families and basically starve to death. That doesn't really feel very uniting. That's just like a, you don't look at that part there. That it's very inconvenient for the Biden administration. So go away. But then like, but what about like calling anyone who attended the Trump rally on January 6, like violent. Can I just say this right now? What happened on January 6 was not in insurrection. It was not terrorism. It was not a domestic worst thing with ever seen since now. Look at the screen. Please don't look at the screen. Why did you just trigger PTS DC? I would specifically ask not to see that. I'm done. I'm walking off. It's too much. Oh, no, no, no, it's just too much. You know, Sarah, it's so difficult for me to wrangle in Elijah every single day on our show. I'm over it. I'm over it. Help him deal with him. He counted to 10. That's a therapist told him. I took my moment of silence there. I sucked it in. I just, I felt good. I was left. I did. I you know, like we also experienced BLM riots together. And you know, you've gotten punched in the face and Philly. We've been through a couple of hairy situations and I would definitely say at January 6 was the worst. Well, it was. And here's the point though is like, is like, I knew, I knew it was going to be remembered as the worst because here's the point. There was no difference between January 6 riot and any of the major riots that I'd seen except for the fact there was less damage and less violence. Okay. So there were lots of riots. Now, people have to understand this is a political rally with so many thousands of people that there was just a single front line where violence was happening. This wasn't like a, this was a, this was kind of like a push forward. But at one point, you know, the violence did stop. And I want to remind people that the people who instigated the violence, like Ray Epps and these individuals who I was, I was even reminded today of the footage that we recorded here at Blaze was the first footage of violence that was released to him, to the world. So you're welcome to all the Democrats on the January 6 committee for getting you guys your, your number one intro into those violent group. And I was looking at my wording on it. From a year ago today, it still says there's two individuals that seem to have instigated the violence and those, that individual who's who instigated it, the main one, he's still not in jail. The one who instigated the insurrection, the one who, who, who, you know, created and made the Death Star blow up, that guy. Well, for some reason the FBI has no interest in him. And if people aren't familiar with Ray Epps, if they haven't been following at your show or anything, it is interesting that I knew from the moment the violence started that this man was suspicious, it's an ear later. And the FBI says, well, whatever. Yeah, let's, let's go ahead and play some of that, uh, Ray Epps watch. In fact, tomorrow, I don't even like to say it because I'll be arrested. We need, we need to go. I'll say it. We need to go in. Let's go. I'm going to put it out. I'm probably going to go to jail tomorrow. We need to go into the Capitol. Into the Capitol. I thought it was like, anyone's I like. Well, it's a big, the last guy, late string. He's going to this one. Okay. You would have original footage of like this more of this guy, you know. Yeah. No, Thomas Massey tweeted this out. Okay. So obviously, yeah, we can make it instigated that instigated the violence, but he's not in jail. No, he's not. He's not a ranch. Really free, free from any investigation. Yeah. Why would that be Elijah? I've brought him up to the FBI and they're like, oh, we're not, it's not an interest person of interest. So, but he instigated the violence. I've talked to professional prosecutors and everyone. I mean, I let's just say I've not had a fun year with the federal government after this event. It's been pretty shitty actually. Oops, but it has been. It's not been good. There's another way to describe it. And it's funny that the people that you see that really were instigating the violence, which is the key factor here, like people that are grammars that are, you know, picketing illegally, like that's a, that's a cope that's made up, but it's like the real crimes that people, the only people that should be getting prosecuted here are people who intentionally destroyed property and people who intentionally hurt people, not just police officers, even each other, if you knock someone out, you may disagree with them at any event. But why is it the one who started everything not in, why is he not the first person to go to prison? Probably because he's involved in this. Yeah, do we know what he does for a living? Do we? He has some past ties to an interesting institution that's also, you know, potentially a part of our government. Yeah, you know, did you also see the article that came out today where that second instigator, his name was kind of just erased once they started arresting January 6th instigators and people who were there at the Capitol. And so we just, we don't know who he is. We really don't know. Yeah, that was a noopsy. No, it's funny because I get calls from prosecutors from like from the federal government and from different agencies and defense attorneys and stuff like that all the time because of like the footage is like a key, you know, can we admit this into evidence? blah blah blah. So like you look at it and there's certain people on that front line that they have no interest in talking to you about. Right. It's just, it's just an interesting thing. Like I just like, hey, would like, do you want to help identify this person have more footage? No. No, we, we're not. It's okay. We already know who that is. Yeah, it's okay. He's sitting right there. That's not special agent. That's right. I know why. He's cool. No, but that's something that's whole thing has been very suspicious. I thought I've not, I can't say the level of like I've not been, you know, providing any new information to the government. I feel like they're misusing the information. I feel like they're, they're using it to politically target people. Obviously, everything I've done is public and you can see it. So there's nothing new I can provide on information. But I can tell you that like if we're going to get to the bottom of this, right, like if we're going to try to understand why this happened and who instigated this and who, you know, incited a crowd to violence. Well, we have some of their names already. And since the government's not interested in them, it makes me wonder to what extent the government, if they knew that there was, there was a, they already knew about a plan to invade them, the capital. Maybe it was their plan. That's why they knew about it. I don't know. But they already understood they were in chat rooms of people that were going to do this. They denied access and orders and won't even clarify who denied or who, what was going on, you know, requests for more National Guard. They riot police that were supposed to be out front. Every crowd control, even when we've had small stop the steals and they're just like guarding the people that know this, the capital police are just guarding the Scotus building or they're just guarding any building. They're always in full riot gear even if there's no riot. They were not. They didn't give them the equipment that they needed to handle a crowd. Why were they not given equipment? So like, that's what's crazy. They want to get hit in the head. Why weren't they all in full riot gear? I've gone to every other rally in DC even if there's like 60 people and they're full on the shields and batons and ready and these people just were just, you know, chilling in a baseball cap going, getting, you know, rocks and stuff thrown back at them and you're going, yeah. Well, why did you equip your cops? Like, I mean, just going to ask all these questions. It seems like they wanted cops to get hurt. That's what I'm going to say is like they wanted them to get hurt. They wanted this to be bad. And that's, it was, it was absolutely a honeypot. It was, it was intentionally meant. And the only thing that the Democrats are probably sad about is that not a lot of people died, not more people died and that not more damage was done. They wanted this, they wanted to coup take it back over. I know this for a fact. Like they, they wanted to use this to fully fight back against Trump's associates and fully take everyone out. I mean, they tried with this, but it was too shaky. Well, even, and I want to get after the break, I want to get to what Kamala said because I found that to be particularly egregious. You guys alluded to it earlier, but now that you say that really quickly, before we go to break, I do want to bring up Casey Hunt's tweet because she is a reporter who she with NBC. She said last night, this is kind of alluding to what you're saying, Elijah, tomorrow is going to be a tough one for those of us who were there or had loved ones in the building, thinking of all of you and finding strength, knowing I'm not alone in this. Thank God for the USCP, DC, MPD, and every person who fought to keep us safe that day. You're welcome. I mean, like, I'll just take credit. All of these were lying. Like, what is it's going to be a tough one for those of us who had like, are you related to Ashley Babbitt? Like, I think it's dog was, you know, in DC that day, it's just it's a really hard day for me, actually. I follow IOC and I saw her live stream from so. Yeah, it's just like, they're trying so hard. Oh, yeah, here's the AOC beam, they interacted because they wanted to date me. Yeah, that actually she did. They were actually pants that day. We wanted to date AOC. Well, remember, she said like, I was just really scared that they were like, someone was going to come in and rape me. That's what, that's what, nobody said that. Nobody said that. You made it up. Yeah. I just lied. Yeah. All right, so we've got more to come, obviously, but first we want to thank our sponsor, Masterworks. So I have some really fun news for you guys. It turns out women are better investors than men. Yeah, that's right. All right, women investors, according to market research, outperform their male counterparts. I don't make the facts. I'm just here to tell them to you and here are the facts. Women are more likely to put their money into resilient alternative assets. So I'm not talking like, dogecoin. I'm talking about alternative assets like artwork. Okay, that's right. You wouldn't think about it probably, but art, blue chip contemporary art has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995. Usually it's like the bajillionaires, maybe Elon Musk who can afford another Picasso for their fancy spaceship or whatever. But Masterworks is changing all of that. They are the startup democratizing the art market. So you can invest in paintings from icons like Monet, Banksy, Warhol. You don't have to be a millionaire to do this. You can diversify your portfolio by investing in blue chip artwork at an affordable entry point. You got to get started today. All right, my audience gets priority access to their latest offerings. If you go to masterworks.art slash news, this is really, really easy. You guys affordable for every American. My producer actually owns a stake in one as well. It's very, very easy. You got to go do that. It's masterworks.art slash news. They're important disclaimers at masterworks.io slash disclaimer. All right, I want to get to what Kamala Harris said in her speech today. I know you guys alluded to it earlier, but I do think it is important to highlight how dramatic and how disingenuous these people really are. So Kamala Harris, as you guys mentioned, compared the what happened at the Capitol on January 6 to 9 11 and Pearl Harbor, which is just like the most insane thing I've ever heard in my life. Let's watch Kamala. On January 6, we all saw what our nation would look like. If the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy practices in the mirror are successful. 100% right. The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos. What was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it by we, the people, all the people here in this very building, a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair elections. Let's be clear. We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate and the American people must also do something more. We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defense of our democracy. That was not the right clip. But I do think it is very, yeah, I do think it is interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have it, but I do want to get your take on the voting rights issue because they keep bringing this up. COVID-19, January 6, voting rights, it's just everything. We should be injecting voting rights into our bodies. I think maybe that's what you get into. People should vote with vaccines and people who have more vaccines get stronger votes. That says if you're boosted, your vote counts as three votes. We've never done this one before. If you're unvaccinated, then you're only one third of a vote. I see. But then you get the two thirds vote. If you have double-boosted. Honestly, if you're unvaccinated, you should just be thoroughly ejected from America. I thought they were just deported in the firing squad. But I do find it interesting they keep injecting this vote. We saw the bill that they tried to pass what was at HR1 and how insane it was. They keep talking about how voting rights are under assault, which we know that if they are, it would be the other side who should be complaining. Let me go to, I think we have the correct clip here really quickly. Let's listen. Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them, where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault. Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory. December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001, and January 6, 2021. So it's like you're playing a game of which one of these is not like the other. I know the answer to this one. Do you feel like? I know, but I feel like, I don't know. Any reasonable Democrat, do you think here's that and goes like, yeah, that's really true. I mean, I just feel like the reason why. It's a good question if they could put the vote on it. What it is is like, I don't know if we were talking about this in today's show, but the fact that the only people that were sitting in front of Pelosi's like address on January 6 that were Republican was like Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney and somebody else, his people. It shows you there's no Republicans there. This is a partisan move to right history. And this will be remembered as worse than I'd 11. Our kids will think, you know, just like people think, call it right in house, killed black people. And they think that, you know, 50,000 unarmed black men are shot by police every year. It's it's all about confusion and disillusionment. We've become a giant bank with mass immigration people just with no culture, nothing to center on. They've taken away our unifying religion. They've taken away our values. They've replaced the entire American culture and who we were as a people and just turn us into some weird, you know, free marketplace where America's an idea and once America has an idea, then you can infiltrate with your made up ideas. Once we stop being a people and we aren't united on anything, you can just say whatever you want and people will believe it as long as they can still buy their lattes. Like they just people are so disconnected and don't care about their country anymore and the truth that we this is what this is how bad we've fallen that these people realize they can just lie with only half the support of the country less than that. Less than half the country supports this entire thing. It's totally partisan, but it'll still work. It's going to work. So we're so like what happens to the country then like or just so what our kids are because your kids will know that anybody that's why that will use this in the future. You're related for every you're related to insurrection. You're an insurrectionist. You're an insurrectionist and like that shows you that as if you have there's any pushback, they will amplify it. So if there's a real coup or a real insurrection or a real pushback to take back the country, they're letting you know we're going to blow your brains out. Right. You're going to not we're not going to kill your families. I mean, well, everyone has been afraid to protest that has been conservative. They're free to use their free speech now because they're like, is this a fed setup? I don't know. I'm afraid to even go out and sorry that I cut you off. No, no, no, no, I was just going to say or they they'll use it as an excuse the next time they go and burn down, you know, federal courthouse buildings again and just say like, well, we did you guys set the precedent. And can I say as if it was the right who was doing that point out as well to aside from today being the one year anniversary of January 6 because first off, where's our one year anniversary of all the BLM riots? Where's that? One of the biggest takeaways of this, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden coming up in front of our entire country and grandstanding pretending that this is such a huge horrific event that happened is one, apparently a politician's only care about things in this, you know, riots and destructive activities when it's at their their door front because they didn't act this way at all with BLM. They allowed them to ravage our country, destroy property, destroy small businesses, attack people in the street. I personally watched grandparents get beat up for wearing MAGA hats and flying MAGA flags in Washington, DC and going out and support Donald Trump. So all this serves to show us is that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not care about the American people unless again, you know, the violence and destruction is right in front of them. And then also outside of today being January 6, look at our economy right now. Look at the fact that Joe Biden abandoned Americans in Afghanistan. Look at all the other things that Joe Biden has done to our country. And this is what they're going to spend time and energy on. It's pathetic. Well, yeah, because I mean, what's Joe Biden going to do? Be like, look at all the crappy things that I just done to you guys. Instead, it's much easier for him to blame it on, I guess, you know, or orange man bad. All right, we're let's switch gears when we get back. But first, we want to think our sponsor built bar. So I have, I don't know if you guys have you, have you tried the puffs? No, okay. Oh, you got to try the puffs. So that's Ruby chocolate, I believe, which is like a little bit of a berry flavor. This is lemon dipped cheesecake. If you prefer that one, this is caramel almond delight. But I know what I'll get to enjoy all of them. So I'm like, I don't care which ones you guys have. But these are the most amazing snack that you really need in your life, especially if you've just made a New Year's resolution to lose weight because bill bars going to keep you on track. They're a protein bar. They've got up to 18 grams of protein, they're 180 calories or less, only four to five grams of sugar, four to five net carbs. So you were eating something that is good for you. It's going to keep you on track, not expand your waistline, but it tastes like you're eating a candy bar. It tastes like you're cheating on your diet. They've got a ton of different flavors. They've got the puffs that we were just discussing. They're like a much lighter texture. And then they've got the regular bars as well. They're all delicious. I've never eaten something from built that I have disliked. In fact, I probably like them too much because my pantry is full of their boxes. You got to go over to built.com. Use promo code news15. You'll say 15% off of your order. That is a news 15 over at built.com. Okay, let's completely switch gears here because I feel like people are probably the January 6th as it's done. We've heard about it. We've heard the media fawn all over it. We've heard the Democrats call for a moment of silence in the Senate on the Senate floor. And it's just all very weird. So I want to get to something that is equally as weird but completely different. This is basically the America that the left wants. Is that fair? This is the America that the left wants for everyone. Now this is America at this point. Well, that's fair. That is fair. So this is America. So we were talking about this over the break and I was like, you guys were talking about the story and I was like, oh yeah, my producer sent me the screenshot just of the headline that he sent me. And I was like, this keeps getting weird. Like, this is more uncomfortable. The more I read this, it just keeps getting worse. Transman and Satanic Minister gives birth after one night stand with fellow gay dating app user giving birth felt like one of the most masculine things I have done. Can you hear me that headline? I know. I know. Did I just break you? A little bit. One more just one more time. Transman and Satanic Minister gives birth after one night stand with fellow gay dating app user. Great. So the Antichrist is here. I'm going to start the reaction. Well, again, of course, my personal favorite having given birth twice now, giving birth felt like one of the most masculine things I have done. No, actually, it did not feel masculine at all. This is the wrong word. It's like, right, with the moment that you have a baby going through your birth canal and doing things that I'm not going to describe on television. How do you feel? You don't really feel masculine in that moment. You actually feel like you wish that you were masculine and you have to deal with this crap. It's actually kind of scary because we were reading this story and it was really hard to break down what was going on. We were confused. We were like, I need a flow chart, right? First of all, they said that this part of these people met on Grindr, which we were under the oppression was a gay dating app. Yes, for gay men. That's not gay because that's a woman. So I was confused. It's clearly a pregnant, right? This clearly doesn't have the character. I want to know was this gay man. He didn't get to experience what he was doing. Yeah, we were saying, is this kind of catfishing or like, or like, what is the point of this? And then also, it's just weird too because this is that whole idea of like people invading other people's spaces, like, you know, with like women and men going into their other spaces. And I'm just wondering, like, it's like, it doesn't happen on accident. Like, did you, were you thinking you were going to be meeting a ruler and you ended up with a bull type of thing? And then like, what do you react in that moment? Was this prearranged? And the end of all this, how would you feel as a man if you were gay and probably one of the things is that you're not going to get anyone pregnant? And then obviously you have a kid with a man that's kind of like, what kind of a complicated thing. So I just, it's a strange thing. I'm like, is that legal? Like, what if, I don't know, all this is very confusing to me. And that's when I read these stories, we find that each other, we're like, I don't think it's supposed to make sense. I think this doesn't make sense. Well, the actual writer of this article was even confused because the writer of the article said that, yeah, the person was taking male hormone, hormone blockers, but it was supposed to be female hormone blockers. And male hormone blockers just stop them from being coming pregnant. He could even figure out, he couldn't even keep track with the information. Yeah, and we were like, need a flow chart. Yeah. I'm telling you, for all these stories, you need a freaking flow chart. So he was on testosterone and, and, and, and, which is, makes it rare to get pregnant, but still can. And what's crazy is we found another apologist for this, who's explaining that regardless of getting pregnant, that that is still the boy's father. So it is the boy's father because they say they're a man. And so you must respect, you don't, you don't tell pregnant men, which is, I'm, I'm using the word. And the nurses call you a mother, then the nurses are big. This is our biggest. Yeah. The nurses can't, can't be maternal care. I'll be paternal care. And, and we, and then by the way, this apologist had like the most budget we've ever seen in my life and bad lipstick job. It was bad. It was bad. But I'm saying like, they come out and this little lecture, I was like, someone that looks like you. I'm not sure I'll be petty. I'm not taking advice from you on how to live my life appropriately. That is, yeah, I just, I've moved your audience in so on core with some of this stuff, but it's gotten weird. It's gotten very weird. It's not, it's not, it's not feel masculine when he's pushing a baby out of his baby. The point is I was wondering why I'm not a real man. And it's because I haven't had a baby of my own. It makes sense. It all makes sense finally. Guys, I just, I mean, it really, she's my child. Yes. It really is like very depressing. Like, I think people wonder why sometimes we are like as dark as we are. And it's like, well, when you live in this world, so that's called melanin. Not that kind of dark. True. When you live in this world and you read these kind of ridiculous stories, you just have tight, you tend to just be really dark and. Are we living through South Park? Was South Park really just somebody from the future coming back in time being like, this is not actually a joke. This is, this is real. Apparently, apparently. All right. You know what? Let's go ahead. I think we're having some tech issues. So let's go ahead and go to break a little early here. But first we want to think our sponsor, Tommy John. So 2022 needs to be the year that you get yourself some nice loungewear throw out your old sagging loungewear. Okay. And give your butt the upgraded deserves and lounge like a queen or a king with new Tommy John loungewear. So Tommy John is, I mean, look, I used to hear people talk about Tommy John before I actually tried it. And I was like, you guys are kind of making this up. Like, have you ever tried Tommy John Elijah? Literally wearing Tommy John. Are you? Like, how's the lawn? You think that people are making it up when they go on and on about like how comfortable and soft they are until you like hold it and and wear it. Now I don't have male parts. So I don't know. Because you're still mad because you're madly that you can give birth. Right. Right. But I'm not one of those men that the pregnant men that gave birth. No, but one of the woman. They want stuff too though. They do. And that's what I wear a lot of good stuff. Thank you. And that's my point is like, I was just like, yeah, that's cool. Like men need comfortable underwear. And then I got a bunch of their loungewear. They've got loungewear. They've got bras. They've got women's underwear too. But like the loungewear is literally the most comfortable thing you will ever put on your body. I'm not even exaggerating. You've got to try it. Like I said, it makes it like it's a completely different feel when I get home and I change into my loungewear. And then finally I can I can handle my children. That's that's just the thing I'm saying. All right. You get 20% off your first order right now at TommyJohn.com slash Y. That is TommyJohn.com Y for 20% off. You got to go see the site for details. Representative Eric Swalwell can join the likes of AOC because you know, he keeps talking about how Republicans are prolonging COVID-19 and causing vacations to be canceled. And you know, because they don't listen to all of the rules. He was actually just caught maskless indoors while visiting. Of course, Florida, because that is where they all go to go. And they're like, well, technically we're not breaking the rules because these are the rules in Florida. But they criticize Florida and they criticize Rhonda Santas all the time. Yet here they are. Eric Swalwell tweeted out, they got me maskless juggling a baby and a coffee while meeting with a Congolese queen. Pulets are pleased. So he's obviously very sorry, except he's not at all. Like, is the left ever going to actually hold these people to the same standard that they hold us? The point is to not have that's the mockery. It's the intentional showing that we are under rules there or not. Like they love it. They love to to flow. They'll put on like masks just for photos and take them off while they're on the yeah. They don't care. It's all it is is optics. And when the don't you think it's coming back to bite them a little bit? I don't think it's changing anything. I think because their base still believes everything that they say their base is still wearing face masks and getting boosters. Yeah, there are a lot of them that I feel like I don't mean this is just I was just talking about being cynical. And I just maybe there's just a little bit of like optimism left in me or at least I want it to be true that like there's a certain group of left leaning Americans who are just like, guys, like I've been playing along with this for a really long time, but I see what you're doing and I just really tired of this. It's not though because here's here's what it does trip me out a little bit too. And I'm not going to out anybody that I know because like on this topic, but I've spoken to a lot of people from a lot of different countries on this and the common thing I've seen is that it's to a lot of people it has grown their anti-government sentiments, but it hasn't propelled them to any action. So it's like they'll be angry at the government because their friend is losing their job for not being boosted, but then they'll go get as many boosters as they're needed while being angry. And that's it's the it's the angry at what's happening, but not having the bravery to actually stand up against it, not having the willpower to to stand up for what you believe. And most Americans just want to watch the ball game and be you know, men need to be aggressive and we should be you know, trying to take our country back, but then they you know, satiate men with you know, caring about sports games and beer and things that really don't matter. Everyone's on the hookup culture, getting their their issues out, people are addicted to pornography, you know, when they so they're not having children and we're all just docile drug addicted, alcohol addicted, TV, Facebook, browsing people and quite frankly, they know that they've they've gotten us in such a dull place in society that like they don't they really can do whatever they want. And the only reason why they haven't really been able to is because our court system still kind of work in the United States and then the guns and that's basically it. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I feel like we are truly living in two separate Americas. You have the America with the people who are still adhering to COVID rules, think Dr. Fauci is God who see these politicians going to Florida maskless, not adhering to any of the rules or guidelines that they're pushing on all of us, but still for some reason feel the need to adhere to what the authority is saying because they have been manipulated with all of this propaganda, you have that America and then you have the other America where you have people who are like, you know, I'm going to be free, I'm going to do what I want, I'm going to make my own medical decisions and I'm not going to allow the government to dictate what I can and cannot do. And those are the two separate Americas. And at this point, like Elijah said, people have not been spurred to action. And they're only a subset of the population that will be the other side. I really feel like is far past saving at this point. Yeah, I want to I want to bring in on that note, Whoopi Goldberg, who she's not sorry, I'm not bringing her in. She didn't agree to come. But she so she just got COVID herself. Oh, no, no, no, she boosted triple triple vaxxed and the app boosted. They're not calling vaccinated anymore. They're just calling it boosted to mix. They're already trying to make sure that we know there's a difference between people who are vaccinated, people who are boosted. That's right. Because if you have to is now changed. Yeah, I just want to make sure to do you know if you only have two vaccinations, you're not fully vaccinated. Yes, psych, you only thought that was what you were going to do to get out of it. But she said, she said that, you know, she was obviously shocked. But she said, again, boosted, as you said, she said, this is what America will be facing unless everyone gets vaccinated. Yeah, I'm pretty sure one of the he's like running for Marin for something. And he was like, I just got COVID after getting my booster. This is a reminder that everyone needs to get vaccinated. And it's like, listen to what you're saying, my guy. They did they all do it. And I'm like, but I look, Elijah, you are somewhat of like a science guy, right? You have a you have a science background. Elijah, you know, I just think someone can you have someone I dabble. Can you can you please tell me because I as I get told oftentimes when I try to speak about the subject, I am not a scientist. I am not a doctor. I'm not a professor. I'm not a researcher. Right. But he's the healthiest among all of us. The way that vaccines are explained to me, personally, is that it is supposed to work in your personal immune system. So why does everyone else have to get vaccinated in order for a vaccine to work for you? Well, there's really not a there's really not a real reason for that. The thing is we've changed the definition of vaccines. And so, you know, a previous inoculation, this idea of giving some tangential, you know, a portion of a virus or bacteria or anything else like that into the body introducing it to help people to develop a resistance, right? So you know, your immune system recognizes it. You start developing the correct cells in your immune system. That is a traditional like inoculation, maybe a little different than some vaccines. We've seen the development of like a lot of interesting vaccines, like with tetanus needing three shots. People don't know that usually you do need three. But that's about like an infection, right? A tetini. That's like talking about bacteria. Well, and it's a bloodborne. And there's a reason about it. What we've never had though is this indefinite needing of shots. And there's a reason why, right? We call the common cold amacron now. And we've never had a vaccine for the common cold because it mutates so aggressively that it's been thought that vaccinating against the cold would not only be too costly based on the symptoms, but it would also require too much continual development. And it would be it wouldn't outweigh the cost. People wouldn't be getting the cold vaccine. And so and they say that well, we'd have to get new ones every year, like the flu vaccine, which often gets it very wrong and doesn't offer much protection. These are highly mutated degenerative viruses. So with this trying to vaccinate against COVID, we'll be a losing battle for the rest of our lives. And they always say, well, if you're vaccinated, you have mild symptoms. Most people I know that are unvaccinated had mild symptoms. And people that are vaccinated, I see I've seen I've personally no difference in my life against people. Maybe it's with a certain age group, maybe above 80 or something. I don't know. But I'm just saying like this is not this is a vaccine now because we've just said it is. If I just said this table's a chair, but by definition, and past history, this would never have gone. This look at the trials, so I don't release them for like 50 years. What they there's a major cover up happening here. It's very dangerous. What they're doing there, I can't be careful here, but there a lot of the problems you're seeing develop, there's going to be a lot more of them and the mutative rate of this virus is going to continue to skyrocket because we're going to continue to vaccinate people. But instead, we're going to make the virus smarter and make it more contagious. It's almost like we should have had some long term studies before we don't have that before we released it on to the public. Also, I'm sure you guys have seen the transition that many politicians have made now that we're in an election year of well, COVID is something we're just going to have to live. I saw a headline of Joe Biden who's now shifting surprisingly, and saying that this is just a virus we're going to have to live with. There's nothing that can be done. We have a Chicago Mayor, Lori Lightfoot saying that kids need to get back to school. We have, you know, the mayor of New York City. Finally, that's rich. Yeah, saying, saying as well, like we need to reopen our economy. Well, election year is here and all of a sudden, these politicians just want to reopen for the greater good, of course. Yeah. Well, it's also weird because I thought that the virus could be shut down. Because you might say being a reasonable person, you might say one man cannot be responsible for the transmission of a respiratory virus, but they would have told you much differently that one man is in fact responsible for not just the transmission, but also like everyone dying from it. Yeah, it's absolutely true. The thing is about the virus is, um, has always been about creating a globalized police state. That's all. It's always been, it's been, it's been in the UN agenda. It's been the role economic forum. It's just they've, they've brought back in 2009, people were talking about using vaccines in order to create a worldwide police state. They've been talking about it for a long time. And, you know, obviously that's not happening now. It just so happens to be a massive compulsory rollout of vaccines and a police state developing coincidentally at the same time. The introduction of microchips as well. They were conspiracy theorists. You conspiracy. Okay, Alex Jones. We got to take a break. We'll be back. All right, so I'm told that we have a new, uh, I want to say segment, but it's really, it's a very special award that we are giving out, um, to certain people who earn it here in 2022. It's called Idiots of 2022. And I would like to congratulate the winners, the first ever winners of Blaise TV's Idiots of 2022, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris themselves. So congratulations to the two of them. They were so idiotic that they like made the first segment. Yeah, pretty good. Good job. Good job. I mean, look, it, the bar is very high, low. I don't know whatever you call it. It's low and you made it even lower. Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever the Democrats are involved.
