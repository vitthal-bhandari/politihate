    "text": " We are stronger economically than we have been in history. Wow! Show continues and I'm here to tell you all about it. I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report. It's March 14th, 2023. I've got a fresh short haircut. We're livestreaming on Rumble YouTube and locals. Before we do anything else today, yesterday we did our special 3PM show yesterday because I was at that Diversity, Equity and Inclusion event up in West Palm with Governor DeSantis. So we did a delayed show and during the show I referenced Yolanda Vega. And several of you did not know who Yolanda Vega was, but Yolanda Vega was a huge television star if you lived in the Tri-State area in the 80s, 90s and even in the last 20 years apparently I'm told she just retired last year. She was the lottery woman and people were going, Dave, who is this Yolanda Vega? And why do you say it like that? We put together a little compilation of Yolanda Vega's best moments. Enjoy. Welcome. Yes, I am Yolanda Vega. Thank you everyone for the New York Lottery. I'm Yolanda Vega. Welcome to the New York Millennium Millions Drawing Being Health Live in Took-N-Cerve. All you know are the different KPMG. I'm Yolanda Vega. Now, here's tonight's number of the first four. Good evening, I'm Yolanda Vega. All is good evening, I'm Yolanda Vega. Oh man, I'll have what she's having. What a life Yolanda. I hope you enjoy retirement. Little known fact about Yolanda Vega. She was the most controversial woman in America from the 80s well into the mid-2000s. That's how good we used to have it. It was before all this woke BS. A woman like that would be controversial. Anyway, if you want to join us for the post-game show, as always, join us at rubinreport.locals.com. And real quick speaking of locals, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but Scott Adams, you guys know Scott Adams. He's been on the show many times and he's a great thinker and author and creator of the Dilbert comic. He got into some hot water over some comments that he said that were completely misconstrued. I'm not even going to get into the details of that. But Dilbert, which has been in virtually every newspaper in America as a comic strip for the last, I don't know, three decades at least, something like that, it basically has been absolutely canceled everywhere and he's moving the entire thing to locals. So not only did we get Crowder last week on Rumble, we've got Scott on locals and we got Russell Brand and we really are building those pipes and I'm feeling good about that. I'm also feeling good and this is what the show is about today. About the crop of Republicans who are starting to get into the mix, there's going to be some tussling, there's going to be some back and forth, but we are going to see a really solid, interesting and politically diverse group of people going for that Republican nomination. Of course, that will be to the backdrop of all of the insanity that we're dealing with right now, whether it's the woke stuff or this craziness now with bank bailouts or where the economy is going to be in a year, etc., etc. But people are starting to get involved, they're starting to announce that they're going to get into the fray and there are a couple of people who we suspect will announce who haven't quite gotten in yet. But all of the energy seems to be focused on one guy who has not gotten in yet. He happens to be the guy I was with yesterday morning, the governor of the Free State of Florida, Ron DeSantis and we're going to contrast a bunch of the political positions of some of the other people run and obviously you got Trump, now you have Vivek Ramaswami, you have Nikki Haley, a couple other people, it sounds like Pence is about to jump in and we're going to compare and contrast some of their views and really talk about who can actually bring new voters in because that's what it's about, right? Like the Republicans did not win last time. Trump says it was fixed, but whether it was fixed or not, we sort of know what he can do. The question is who can actually bring in new people and get us to this new political realignment that I think is just staring us in the face and actually could get us out of all of this madness. That is the plan today and before we get to it, let me talk to you about balance of nature real quick. You know, nothing is more fundamental than the fact that fruits and vegetables are good for you. Did you know that? But eating all the fruits and vegetables you need can be time consuming and expensive. That's why I take balance of nature. It gives me a foundation of nutrition and the positive effects of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in just a few seconds. See my hundreds of thousands of people take balance of nature every day, get 35% off your first preferred order when you use discount code Dave. That's 35% off your first preferred order when you use discount code Dave. And now back to me, that was a short one. All right. So when we talk about these crossover people, what you guys know I'm always focused on is the decent lives because there are decent lives. They're not in the Democrat party that's in Washington DC. They're all lunatic progressives or scared of their own shadow or will fold quicker than a wet paper bag types. But you're aunt who thinks that these are the Democrats of 1986, right? Like there are these people who maybe can move. A lot of them seem to have this aversion to Trump no matter what, right? Like I could maybe vote for a Republican, but I can't vote for Trump. Now I may think that's unjust and I gladly voted for Trump and there's a situation in which I might vote for him again, depending on how it all shakes out. But the group of people who I think are most likely to move are the disaffected lives, right? That's probably many of you guys and many of you I think have probably shifted accordingly, right? Everyone in the room that I'm in right now is a first time Republican registered voter here in the Free State of Florida. Well, one of those people, I talk about him every now and again, is Bill Maher and Bill as much as I try to push and pull and prod every time he takes two steps forward, he unfortunately seems to take three steps backwards. Here he is on real time a couple of days ago talking about DeSantis and I think he is just missing the freaking point. Disagree with that. First of all, everything I hear about DeSantis is that he's dull. He doesn't have any charisma. But also, I think liberals, they make a real effort not to understand the Trump voter. And it's like, oh, DeSantis is going to be great because it's Trumpism without Trump. And I think they're like, why would we want a tribute band when the actual band is still playing? Bill, Bill, I'm going to keep working on you and I'm going to text you after the show and say, you know, this isn't going after you personally. I just want to get you there. But a couple things. First off, this thing about DeSantis being dull, I've hung out with him a bunch and been to events with him and had to drink with him multiple times and smoke cigars with him. I don't even like smoking cigars. He's totally a decent guy. He's a fun guy. He's a cool dude. He's a normal human being. That's the weird thing of him being involved in politics, right? He's got a couple of kids. He's got a wonderful wife. He's a decent guy. He's a policy wonk for sure. And is he the most television game show ready president we've ever had? Probably not. But we had that with Trump and I don't think you guys like Trump that often. And more importantly than any of that, look what the guy gets done. He took away Disney's special privileges. He did the quote unquote, don't say gay thing. I actually said the word gay to him yesterday. He did not attack me, punch me or have his goons. Remove me. He's got a child mutilation, genital mutilation out of our entire state like they're going to take away people's doctors licenses on this stuff. He's not going to force people to be masked. We were the first to fight mandates on all the vaccine nonsense. We have family first tax relief right here. We have a huge, huge budget surplus. We had a absolutely massive basically category five storm crush southwest Florida and we have rebuilt faster than would be completely imaginable. So Mar is wrong. He's wrong about his character. He's wrong about the presentation. But he's right in that the Trump without Trump argument is shallow in some sense. It is. I think what most people on the right are beginning to realize is actually the opposite of that. That DeSantis is Trump, meaning he has some of the same ideas except he's much more of a threat because he can get things done. And unfortunately, that's why Mar fears him. Mar, I suspect because Mar does not want to and the last libs, many of them, the public ones, the last thing they want to do is at the end go, all right, but I do have to vote for Republicans. So they'd rather, they'd rather than nominee be Trump. That is what you're going to see over the next year. You're going to see MSNBC even pushing Trump in a weird way because they know that if it's Trump, then it's very easy to be like the Republicans are all nuts. I didn't vote for Donald Trump last time. Donald Trump is evil. He's orange, hiller, blah, blah, blah, where DeSantis, it's going to be much more nuanced. DeSantis, all DeSantis is going to have to do basically is get up on the debate stage all the time and be like, look how many people moved into our state and look how many people left California. We set every record related to tourism. We have all time low crime, all time low unemployment, blah, blah, blah. He doesn't have to get involved in all of that stuff and he doesn't have to be a game show host. The policy positions in many ways are a sharper version of Trump stuff, but they're getting executed and they're incredibly popular at the moment. This is all to the backdrop of the guy has not announced. I tried in my own very subtle way yesterday when we were sitting down to get a little hint, but I did not get it. You can see everybody, whether it's MSNBC or Trump, is attacking DeSantis right now. That tells you where the energy is. Here is a video. Trump put this up yesterday, going after DeSantis. Again, I like Trump. I want to interview him again. I like the kids, but listen to this and tell me the nicknames and the nonsensical argument he's making here. Does any of this make any sense to you? Do you think this is Trump at his best? For those of you that didn't notice, Florida was doing great long before Ron DeSantis got there. People are fleeing from New York to Florida and other places because of high taxes and out of control crime. It's really bad. Not because of the governor. Thank you, Mr. President, for doing that. But it's not because of the governor. Florida was doing fantastically. You had a governor named Rick Scott who did a very good job. Even Charlie Christ, the Democrat, did a good job, and he had very good numbers. Sunshine and ocean are very alluring. It's not too hard to work with those factors. So just remember, Florida was doing really well long before Ron DeSantis got there. There's so much here. I'm so tired of this nonsense. It's like, let me just say, first off, Trump, again, I like you. I like you. So if you want to really do this, you just have to level up. But this is just a whole load of nonsense. First off, Ron DeSantis. Do you know what's sanctus means in Latin? It means holy. So I think you failed with that one. Trump and sanctimonious didn't work. And okay, the nickname thing, it's just not going to work because the guys get and stuff done. It works when you can sort of needle people on these things. It's just not working on that front. He's talking about Charlie Christ there. Charlie Christ just lost by 20 points in the biggest political destruction, certainly in modern times in Florida, but really almost across the country, like blown away. Charlie Christ was also a Republican. Trump is referencing him as governor. He was governor. He was like 15 years ago. He was a Republican at the time. So Trump is suddenly into rhinos or Democrats because Charlie Christ became a Democrat. Also, Ron DeSantis, he did do something right, which is why all the people are moving here. And we still get 1,200 people a day. And AOC and Eric Swalwell and Don Lamon are vacationing in Florida while they spend all day long on TV bashing Florida. So it's just very, very bizarre. And I just don't think it works. If you want to beat the guy, you have to say, these are why my policies are better. But I think one of the things that Trump is coming up against is the fact that DeSantis is actually at the state level doing many of the things that Trump either said he was going to do or promised to do and just hasn't been able to do really because he's not in office right now. So here's, is this, we're going with Trump first? Yeah. So here is Trump calling for the immediate defunding of critical race theory, all the trans stuff and sexualization in schools. Does this sound kind of familiar? Was there some guy in a rather warm state having something to do with alligators who did a little bit of that? Take a look. I will immediately sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school that's pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity. And any other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children, their children. Okay. So first off the good part, that's great to hear. And he is a candidate and you want as many good candidates pushing the right ideas. So cutting funding for schools that are promoting racial essentialism that are pushing sexuality and all this other nonsense on kids. Great. So he's going after DeSantis relentlessly now, the guy who is literally doing it here in Florida. He has been the tip of the spear on this stuff. Also, you know, Trump could have campaigned on these type of things from 2015 to 2020, right? He could have, he could have now granted him a leash on the 2015 thing because it was sort of early on in the wokeness and everyone was kind of figuring it out. But he, what really wasn't running on it in the last campaign, DeSantis saw it very clearly and saw also really how it was connected to so many of the broader issues in society. And he has gone out of his way now with a Republican super majority in Florida to get rid of all of this stuff. When Trump's saying we want to get the racial stuff out of the schools, what he's talking about is DeSantis getting rid of the African American AP studies course, as you guys know about that they stuck woke gender theory in, right? So there you go. But if you don't believe me, Dave, what are you talking about really? You play a video of DeSantis saying he's done those things and will continue to do those things? Okay, fine. Here you go. Sir, not private institutions. They're public institutions and we have the right who are elected and who are putting people in positions to make sure that those institutions are serving a mission that is consistent with the state's best interests. And so as this has become a problem, I asked to get more information about it. We got them reporting how much money they're spending on it. We introduced legislation to remedy that and we will be the first state in these United States to wipe out DEI in our public university. Yeah, and we're actually going to do it. You want to throw up the image? I took this picture yesterday. This is at the event that DeSantis held. This was a huge digital event, really cool studio that they have over there in West Palm. And you can see some of the academics around him. He has thought leaders and academics. He goes around the guy. He has a couple of notes in front of him, but he really does a fine job of posting a two-hour event. They skyped in a bunch of people, including Chris Rufo, who you guys know. And they go through how, literally how they are going to ban diversity, equity, inclusion in our schools and our institutions here. So Trump is right. Of course, what Trump said is right. Trump says he wants to do it by executive action. Now I don't love executive actions, whether they come from Republicans or Democrats. If an executive order, if they are going to exist, I'm actually okay with the president doing it to make sure that children aren't, you know, sexualized by their teachers and the rest of that stuff. But the point is we are doing it in the functional way here. That's why I've been saying for months when the machine really moves on DeSantis. And you've seen the articles on this already. What they're going to say is he's Trump with the calculator. He's Hitler with the calculator, right? Because Trump was Hitler, but this guy, he can do it because he's actually, he actually studies the stuff and he knows exactly what's going on. I'll tell you, we did this little sit down with the governor for about 20 minutes. There were about five of us, just an off the record, sit down. So it was off the record. I can't tell you anything that was said, not that it was really anything that shouldn't be said publicly. But one of the things that always impresses me about him is you asked this guy about a random city somewhere or district, school district, somewhere in Florida. He knows virtually everyone on the school boards and the superintendents. Like he really knows his stuff. He is a student of this. He's a policy wonk, as I said. That's the thing that Bill Maher is going, oh, he's kind of stiff and he's not television ready, something like that. And it's like, well, maybe we're ready for that. Maybe with the group of people that we have in front of us and Biden with dementia and the endless clown car of diversity hires that this administration has put out there to lie about everything. Who we kind of want a guy who maybe isn't the life of the party, and I'm not even saying he isn't. He's a totally cool dude, basically. But maybe we want someone that's just competent. Anyway, here is Trump announcing that he will defund any school that mandates vaccines or masks, which I'm fairly certain we've also done here in the state of Florida. I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate from kindergarten to college. All right, well, that's great. Again, this is good Trump. This is great. That's what we all want. It's fantastic. You know, unfortunately, I suppose maybe he could have done more or not given Fauci the leash that he gave or whatever, but we don't need to play Monday morning quarterback on that. But here's Governor DeSantis in October of 22 in the midst of the cleanup of Hurricane Ian talking about how we were going to make vaccine mandates and masks and everything, all the other nonsense related to this illegal right here in Florida. I also just want to say before I leave that, you know, there's been a lot of questions to our office about the CDC potentially adding COVID vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule. And I know a lot of parents are concerned about that because if that's on the immunization schedule, the fear is that schools could potentially mandate your child to get a COVID shot, even if that's not something that you want to do. So I just want to let everyone be clear, you know, as long as I'm around and all as long as I'm kicking and screaming, there will be no COVID shot mandates for your kids. That is your decision. To be clear in that speech that he was giving right there, we had already done that here in Florida. He was reiterating what had been done in Florida. So again, Trump is repeating a lot of the things that DeSantis has done. That's just fine, right? I wouldn't mind if you have 10 candidates, right? And everybody's looking at the guy who's actually doing all the stuff. Boy, that guy's doing a heck of a job over there. I do want to run for president too. And maybe I think I'm better for this reason, that reason, the other reason I'm a better debater on this on that. I have a different idea on this. But if everyone starts emulating all of the good stuff, that is good. That is how you get an actually, I would say dense collection of candidates that it will be worth listening to. Just try to go back to the last set of Democrats that we had up there and you're listening to Pete Buttigieg and Eric Swalwell and Elizabeth Warren, it was such a thin group of not smart people up there. And we had to pretend that any of these people were going to be president and then the DNC just did their little trick and then they just pushed Biden out there, everyone cuts their deals. Pete says, Hey, can I be transportation secretary? If I drop out, they're like, you got it, man. I mean, that's what that is what they do. That politics is a dirty game. It just is what it is. Here's more from Desantis here. He is calling out Trump's White House after they lost it basically when he was opening up Florida during the pandemic. Yeah, that happened. The White House test was hammering me for like the first like really like three months because they wanted me to be clamping down harder. And she was so I was like, Deborah, just tell me when an American history monitor has this been done and what were the results? Because like I kind of feel like we're flying blind here and we may be doing things that are going to be damaging. And as she said, she's like, you know, it's kind of our own science experiment that we're doing in real time. And that didn't sit well with me. I mean, you're a citizen of a republic. You're not a guinea pig. And so I think that that there's a whole bunch of other things I talk about in the book. You remember the George Floyd riots, the demiologists because people were saying, you've been telling people to stay in your home in like in Florida. They were killing us because even in those early days, you know, when we were following federal guidelines loosely, but we were finding some, we were playing golf. I mean, the villages, they're setting record for golf. People are boating all the stuff. They were so mad at Florida for doing that. People on the beach, all this stuff. That was their position. You are killing people if you leave your house. So then all these people are like thousands of people are protesting this public health, this public health, a clan of people. They are sick. I'm sorry. Is that guy not friendly enough for you? Is he not a good enough communicator for you or whatever else you might be thinking? Like, actually, that's the type of person I would want in the office, someone who can actually communicate the ideas clearly and cogently and competently and stand up for the right things. What a great line. Citizen of a republic, not a guinea pig. Now the Deborah he's referring to there, obviously, is Deborah Birx, who Trump let in charge of a lot of this. And in essence, they were saying, we don't know what the hell we're doing. Just follow our guidelines. So look, to Trump's credit, he did at times go out of his way to say to the states, do what you think is best, right? And that's what federalism is all about. That's what limited government's all about. That's what the president is supposed to do. But as DeSantis is laying out there, then they had, you know, the agents, basically Birx and Fauci, you know, very upset and Trump ultimately very upset that Florida was opening up too quickly. There's also that video. We've played it a couple of times where Trump was angry that Georgia was opening up quickly. So these are just facts. And the reason I'm showing them to you is I think there's a competency level here that needs to be really seen. I think you guys see it, but it needs to be seen more so because he's getting things done. Back in the day, Republicans did not get anything done. You may remember this video from a couple of weeks ago. This is on CNBC. This is Mike Pence, former VP Mike Pence, going after DeSantis because he beat Disney. He apparently doesn't think that the government should do anything to take away special privileges and special rights and tax exemption. He just wants the government to kind of do nothing, which sort of sounds a little more dare I say, rhino-ish, the guy who was picked by Trump to be the VP. So we fully support what Florida did about protecting kids under the third grade. But I have concerns about the follow-on. Look, Disney stepped into the fray. They lost. But then the idea of getting attacked. And taxing authority. That was beyond the scope of what I, as a conservative, limited government Republican, would be prepared to do. Interesting. This is why people don't like Republicans. Don't you get that, Pence? Don't you get that? Going after their tax authority? Where does it say that Disney, a giant corporation that makes cartoons, should have their own tax authority? It doesn't say it anywhere until Florida gave it to them, you know, 50, 60 years ago, whatever it is, all DeSantis did was take it away. He took it away so every organization and company and corporation will play by the same rules and have the same tax rules and everything else. For some reason, SeaWorld and GatorWorld, they had to play by the rules everyone else had to play by. Disney didn't. And then Pence looks at evening out the playing field, equality, right? Making it equal for everybody. Pence sees that doing that as a use of government that is too big for him. I'm a limited government Republican. So I want to get the government out of the way so we can privilege certain companies and punish other companies. It actually makes no sense, but that's what the Republicans have been selling you for a long time. What do I always say? You don't have to be a Democrat. You can't be a Democrat. Wait, what do I always say? You don't have to be a Republican, but you can't be a Democrat. My argument on that is I'm not telling you the Republicans are all amazing. They certainly aren't and they will usually value, but maybe you get a once in a generation type guy with the right ideas who can get this stuff out. And then it starts exposing the frauds. And I would say in this case, Pence, I will interview Pence, I hope. I will treat him with respect and everything else. And I will ask him about just that. How can you say your limited government, if what you mean by that is you are going to allow for certain government privileges for certain organizations? And just to be clear on all of this stuff, whether you agree with the Santas on all of this, whether you think Trump would do all this stuff more effectively, the simple truth is Trump lost the last election and the Santas destroyed his opponent here in Florida. If you remember, in 2018, the Santas won by 30,000 votes. Andrew Gillum was the Democrat at the time. It turned out that the guy was a meth addict, caught at an orgy just a few weeks, I think, or maybe two months after the election. And the Santas only won by 30,000 votes in 2018. Now, you can give Trump some credit for that. Trump did back to Santas. So again, I'm not here sitting here to bash Trump as if he doesn't do anything good. That's not what I'm doing at all, actually. I'll give Trump credit for helping the Santas get over the line. But the policy, the point is that after winning by 30,000 votes in 2018, then we get this insane COVID lunacy, the lockdowns, all of the stuff. And then what happens? Florida becomes the freest state in the union and probably the freest place literally in the entire world. And you know what happens? He goes from winning by 30,000 votes to $1.5 million votes, 1.5 million votes. Mathematically, he basically 50xed his popularity. That is pretty freaking powerful as is this new ad that I thought really just nailed it. We find ourselves in Florida on the front lines in the battle for freedom. Together, we have made Florida the nation's most desired destination and we have produced historic results. But now's not the time to rest on our laurels. We have the opportunity and indeed the responsibility to swing for the fences so that we can ensure Florida remains number one. Don't worry about the chattering class. Ignore all the background noise. Keep the compass set to true north. We will stand strong. We will hold the line. We won't back down. I can promise you this. You ain't seen nothing yet. Thank you all. God bless you. America that you want to live in? Isn't that the America we used to live in? I am truly not trying to sit here and do a DeSantis commercial. But sometimes when you get a guy who's doing it right, who gets the messaging, who understands what the issues are, who has the pedigree as a lawyer and from the Navy and has surrounded himself with the right people, maybe this is the chance to get out of the thing. I think that might be what this really is all about this next election. Is this the last chance we have to get out of the lunacy? And maybe you can make the argument that Trump is the best guy to get us out of the lunacy. I'm fairly certain you can make the argument that DeSantis is the best guy to get us out of the lunacy. And someone will obviously try to make the argument that Nikki Haley is the best person or Vivek. I'm actually going to sit down with Nikki Haley. We're doing that later this week, right? We're doing that tomorrow. I'm going to sit down with Nikki Haley and we will talk about all of these issues. I'm going to try to sit down in person with all of the candidates. And again, treat them all equally, not hiding my opinions. The funny thing about mainstream media, Chuck Todd pretends he has no opinions yet. It's obvious. Or et cetera, et cetera. I will try to do these interviews in a far more honest way. Again, I am not a journalist. I am just some guy with some thoughts and you watch me express those thoughts and I'll sit down with these people and then you'll make up your mind and it's all good. And if at the end of the day you watching this right now come to a different conclusion than me. Okay, we're good. Freedom is pretty sweet. So what is the mainstream media focused on right now? Well, they are focused on taking out DeSantis. It is very obvious. Note, you say, well, who's the threat? Who's the threat? Why is no one going after Trump anymore? Because they don't view him as the threat. Trump used DeSantis as the threat. So Trump's going after DeSantis and everyone on the left is going after DeSantis and even the sliver of same lefties that shouldn't be going after DeSantis like more. They're going after him. But on the televised mental institution known as MSNBC, Joy Reed. And as you guys know, Joy Reed is a very well paid racist crazy person. Here she is completely lying. So this is a complete lie. They talked to you about misinformation and disinformation. They want us to be banned, silenced and visibility filtered and the rest of it. Here's Joy Reed completely falsely claiming that Republicans want to prevent black history and the existence of gays. What does it say about our society that for one of our two major political parties, the salient issue for them is stopping students from learning black history and from even discussing the existence of gay people. They have decided that is the most important issue in the country more than the economy, more than anything else. It's stopping kids from learning those two things. All right. So that's Abraham Kennedy. We don't even need to listen to his nonsensical answer. But she knows she's lying and what you must understand is that MSNBC and the executives there and anyone that puts her on television, they know she's lying too. So you have to know that they put her on television to lie. If anyone at MSNBC had a shred of journalistic integrity, they would sit her down and say, actually, Joy, you joyless Joy, Joy, it turns out they're not trying to stop anyone from learning black history in Florida. It's actually mandated by the state. Repeating myself, it's like, you guys know one AP class that had something to do with genderqueer studies that was going to be incorporated into African American history. That's what this was about and that he doesn't want the existence of gay people to be known. You know, it was funny yesterday. So I'm sitting again, we're having this little six of us or so, five of us and the governor sitting there and we're all getting to ask him questions and we're talking. I started asking him a couple questions and he full on didn't see me. He raised my existence. I was like, go, go, can you see me over here? Dude, it's so silly. It's just so absolutely ridiculous. He actually asked me how the kids are doing. So that's where we're at with these people. They are just completely, absolutely ridiculous. And speaking of completely, absolutely ridiculous on the major league channel that NBC owns because MSNBC is the JV league for the crazy people and the lunatics and the people who have been caught doing bad things, they throw them over there. The major channel is NBC and Chuck Todd hosts Meet the Press. Meet the Press used to be great. Tim Russert was just absolutely wonderful back in the day. For those of you that remember him, Chuck Todd is a partisan hack. Who's, who's, who's just terrible. Anyway, here he is accusing DeSantis of politicization because we're going to spend a day, a year in Florida schools teaching about communism and I guess he's all about communism. Weird. Huh. I don't know if DeSantis is going to be talking to swing voters. Here's like one of the things he said in Vegas yesterday. Take a listen to this. We're also the first state in the country to establish every November 10th, the day in our schools is earmarked to teach our students at all grade levels about the evils of communist regimes throughout history. We're going to tell the truth about Marxism and Leninism. I mean, you know, China, it's sort of like, look, being a Floridian, I sort of know what he's trying to play there and all of that. But I would tell him, I went to Florida public schools. We were taught this, it was called history. It just seems like a weird politicizing, you know, he's going out of his way to politicize something. First off, if Chuck Todd is a Floridian, leave, I mean it, Ananavaro, leave. Why do you people live here? Why do you vacation here? If it is so evil, they're coming after the gains and they're coming after the blacks. Why would you live in such a place other than you know that everything you say is a complete life? Why also why? If this makes literally no sense, why would you be upset that it would be mandated that we would learn that young people would learn that communism and Marxism and socialism are bad unless you're a communist or a Marxist or a socialist? We did a little research here, according to the introduction of the black book of communism. The number of people killed by communist governments is almost a hundred million people, about 94 million people. These statistics include victims whose deaths were through executions, man-made hunger, famine, war, deportations and forced labor. So for some reason, Chuck Todd is upset that people in Florida will know about that. That is quite curious. But let's continue with the lies because the entire machine is focused on DeSantis and lying about every single thing that is happening down here in Florida. So diversity hire Corinne Jean-Pierre, she is our first black lesbian press secretary, she is completely unqualified, she makes Jen Psaki look talented, which that is a talent in and of itself. Here she is lying about what DeSantis is doing with kids and parents. Shocker, I know videotape. Oh, can you respond to Governor on the sandals in Iowa today? You said Florida is where world goes to die. So here's what I have to say. When Republicans, extreme Republicans, these MAGA Republicans, don't agree with an issue or with policy. They don't bring forth something that's going to either have a good faith conversation. They go to this conversation of woke. But that is not actually policy. What that turns into is hate. What it turns into is despicable policy. And it's just not the way we're going to move forward. This is not protecting freedoms. This is not having a good faith conversation on how we can move the country forward. This is about attacking, we're talking about attacking young kids and their parents because of how they view themselves. Hacking young kids and their parents. No one, it's simply not happening. You Corinne Jean-Pierre could come to Florida. You probably vacation on Miami Beach like the rest of the Democrats. And no one will care about you or your lesbian wife. They might point at you and go, my God, that's Corinne Jean-Pierre. She's a pretty terrible press secretary, but nobody's going to stop you from going anywhere because you're black or because you're a lesbian. It's just utter nonsense. And that she dares says that she's the one that wants to have good faith. The Democrats, yes, the Democrats want to have good faith conversations. And that when you say, woke, it doesn't translate into good policy. Yes, it does. We're doing it right here. That's why even liberals, Bananas, California liberals are moving to Florida 1200 a day. And is it not Corinne Jean-Pierre, the Biden Department of Justice that was trying to treat parents as domestic terrorists when they got upset that random school teachers were talking to their kids about sexuality and gender and their genitals? Yeah, that's what the Biden administration was doing. Even at the Biden administration that forced parents and kids to take a fake vaccine and get booster shots and put on masks and kick them out of schools and everything else. And now we are seeing all the results of that, whether it is vaccine injuries or whether it is delayed speech with kids or social problems or anxiety or whatever else. Yeah, I think you know, I'm right, Corinne Jean-Pierre. I'm just trying to have a good faith argument with you. But it continues. It continues. Joe Biden and Joe Biden has no idea what he's saying. He is not in charge of this operation. He is completely inept. He is the perfect vessel. That's what I would call Joe Biden at this point. He is a vessel for this stupidity and this backwards Marxist lunacy because he doesn't know what he's doing. And he's been in government forever. And his wife has a special place in hell because she is abusing this man and refuses, remember the video the other day, we would never have a cognitive test. We would never do that. Like she is, this is elderly abuse with this guy. But here's Biden calling out Florida. He doesn't like Florida either because we are going to stop doctors from giving young children sex hormone blockers and we're not going to chop off their genitals. In the old days, most of us were against genital mutilation. Here we are in modern times. Enjoy. A transgender kid is a really harder thing. What's going on in Florida is, as my mother would say, close to sinful. I mean, it's just terrible what they're doing. It's not like a kid wakes up one morning and says, you know, I decided I want to become a man or I want to become a woman or I want to change. I mean, what are they thinking about here? They're human beings. They love, they have feelings, they have inclinations that are, I mean, it's just to me is, I don't know, it's cruel. And the way we do it is we make sure we pass legislation like we passed on same sex marriage. You mess with that, you're breaking the law and you're going to be held accountable. Yeah, sorry, old buffoon. We have something called federalism and the states are allowed to make whatever laws they don't like. And then if the citizens don't like those laws, they can leave the states. But you don't get to make some sort of law that's going to override the state when it comes to genital mutilation. Biden also, he looks horrible like this thing is just breaking down right in front of us and he simply has no idea what he's talking about. You know, when he says that it all, this is what they do with everything. It all kind of sounds right. Kids don't just wake up and say, I feel like a man today or I feel like a girl or whatever. That does sort of sound right, except it's wrong because we know there is a social contagion element to this thing, right? We know this for a fact when they're staring all day long at sex change operations and boys who are girls and girls or who are boys and boys with boobs and chicks with dicks and all of the stuff, right? And they do see that all day long on TikTok. We know now there's a social contagion element to it. Abigail Schreier wrote, what was Abigail Schreier's book? It's a fantastic book, irreversible damage. Thank you. She wrote a fantastic book about this. We should have her on again. That young girls in particular are susceptible to the social contagion portion of this, meaning they start seeing these videos and then they go, you know, I'm not the girliest girl ever. And actually I like blue more than I like pink. I must be a boy. Or what they do, the other social contagion element of this is they will take a feminine boy, you know, I don't even like that phrase, but a boy who maybe isn't into just cars and transformers and war or whatever. Yeah, maybe he likes art or something else. And now they will basically say to him, you are actually a girl. So it's odd because they're the ones who are actually more into gender stereotypes. But the guy has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. By the way, the interviewer there was Cal Penn, who I guess was a comedian at one time, give me his number. What was his movie? He did Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, right? Somehow he's interviewing Joe Biden. I don't know how that happened. But here he is asking Biden about climate change. Listen to the way he phrases this question. And what do I always say? You scratch a progressive, you find an authoritarian. You obviously understand the existential threat that young people feel when it comes to climate. Sure. You balance that with the immediate concerns of babysitting Congress or getting 51 or 60 votes on some of this. Well, look, I've been relatively successful in working across the aisle. There is a mega Republican portion of the party. It makes up about a third of the Republican party. But there's a lot of people in the Republican party who are traditional conservative Republicans that you can deal with. But these gentle women from the state of Georgia and the mountains up there and others, gates and anyway. That's very diplomatic. I would have used different language. But there's an existential question that the Republican party is going to have to face. And it's going to determine what's happened in the next couple of years. But my focus is just stay focused, focused on the things that matter. We've got to deal with the climate. We've got some of the things that matter. What have they done to that man's forehead? What is going on up here that they have lifted him so many times he's starting to not look human, but they all right, they all end up this way. Pelosi ends up this way. They all end up this way for some reason. Okay, fine. Let's put that aside for a second. The existential threat young people face about climate. Do you guys know any you guys are relatively young in your 20s? Are your friends freaking out over climate? Everyone everyone okay? You're out to dinner. People are talking about other things and oh my God, the climate. Again, if you think for one second that Joe Biden or the Democrats or any human on earth can stop the climate from doing whatever the hell it wants to do, I'd like to have your head examined. We should study you. It's just not a thing. I am not worried about climate change. We can try to have green energy for all sorts of purposes because we want cleaner air and we want cleaner water. That's an interesting thing to do. If you think this government can bring you that, but even the way he phrases the question, I mean, what a heck this kid is, right? This cow pen. It's like the existential, you people have created a situation where young people were locked in their houses, where they were forced on TikTok all day, where they put masks on their faces, where they were told that if they're white, they're bad and if they're boys, they're mean and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And now kids have some anxiety and you're also like AOC telling us that the earth is going to end in seven years, but that was about two years ago. And if you think the earth is going to end in five years again, it's like, man, we got to look at you people and see what's what. So these people are, they're just, it's all just endless buffoonery. You guys see it and you must in your own way increase that visibility for more people. It's all just ridiculous, but what's not ridiculous? Actually, there's a guy over there on Fox News who's doing some fine work and the system doesn't seem to like him either. And of course I'm talking about Tucker Carlson. The system has really been trying to destroy him. We played the video yesterday where Eric Swalwell basically wants to use the power of the government to force Fox to fire him and make sure that our troops overseas can't even watch Fox. I mean, these people are completely out of control. Please show me where this is happening on the other side. Please, I'll gladly cover it, but it ain't. It just ain't. One of the good things that Tucker did was he sent out a letter to many of the people that he believes are going to run for president, whether it was Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswami, et cetera, et cetera. He sent out a letter asking what their policy on Ukraine would be. He wants to, and this is what I mean about a good crop of people who might have slightly different opinions or wildly different opinions when it comes to all sorts of things, Ukraine being one of them. We seem to endlessly be going into this war. Here are the Democrats that used to be anti-war. They've all been silenced. Why isn't AOC picketing every day? Where's Ilhan Omar out there against the war? Because the Democrats have become the party of power, the party of war. So Tucker sent out this letter to a bunch of the 2B potential candidates asking them their policies, a questionnaire on Ukraine. I want to read a couple of the responses because I think this shows a nice political diversity. Here's former president Donald Trump answering the Ukraine questionnaire. Take inflation and numerous other self-inflicted wounds and mistakes made over the past two years, Russia would definitely have not raided and attacked Ukraine if I was your president. In fact, for our four years, they didn't attack nor did they have any intention of doing so as long as I was in charge. That's a completely, you can come back to me for a second, that is a completely true and clear and cogent answer by Trump. Ukraine, what did they do? Russia invaded Ukraine under Barack Obama before Trump. We all know that. Nothing happened under Trump. We had no wars. He was trying to scale back things. This is a major place where Trump can get some credit and show, hey, I did the right things. As you know, they took Crimea under Obama. Is what it is. Okay. Let's go to Mike Pence. Here he is answering the Ukraine questionnaire. I'm sorry. Next one, Connor. Oh, sorry. It's right. Sorry. I go back to the previous one. Yeah, there we go. Former VP Mike Pence answers our Ukraine questionnaire. Is opposing Russia in Ukraine a vital American national strategic interest? That's the question. And here's Pence's answer. When the United States supports Ukraine in their fight against Putin, we follow the Reagan doctrine and we support those who fight our enemies on their shores so we will not have to fight them ourselves. There is no room for Putin apologists in the Republican party. Now, this is super interesting and this shows you why Tucker is doing good work. That is a huge, huge policy difference between Trump and Pence. Now you can agree with either one of them. You can disagree with either one of them. But now we have some information. Trump is saying, and this is what he did by leading through strength. And I've wrote about this in Don't Burn This Book. I believe in a strong military so that we don't have to use it, right? Trump led by strength so nobody knew what Trump was going to do. So Russia, they took Crimea under Obama. Maybe they wanted this invasion under Trump, but they were like, boy, that guy's kind of nuts. Like, what? He's going to drop a nuke on us? Like, we don't want that. So they didn't do anything. Now, Pence is taking a different approach. Pence is trying to connect his approach to Reagan and basically saying by strong alliances, we will stop the bad guys from encroaching. That might be true. It might be. But we know that the thing that Trump did work. So okay, this is great. Now we have some contrasting views on foreign policy within the Republican presidential candidates. This is pretty good. Here's Vivek Ramaswami on this. And Vivek is obviously not known for his foreign policy stuff. He's known mostly for financial markets and VCs and funding and ESG and a bunch more. Here we go. Is opposing Russia and Ukraine a vital American national strategic interest? And Vivek says, no, it is not vital. Rather, this is a stark reminder of what is a vital American national strategic interest? National energy independence. This war is a symptom of America's lack of self-sufficiency. So this is also interesting. Vivek is answering this saying this is not vital, but we have to be able to make sure that we are energy independent. So we are not reliant on countries like Russia when they do these crazy things. Okay. So this is all good guys. How seeing diverse political thought amongst these people. Here is South Dakota Governor Kirste Nome. She says, the primary external threat to the United States is communist China. Our opposition to Russia has heightened this threat for a number of reasons. Okay. So that's interesting too. She doesn't fully comment on what's going on with Ukraine. I'm sure she has her reasons. But she's aiming this more at China. And we do have a massive China problem that seemingly is going to get worse over the next couple of years. And just to be clear, a couple GOP presidential hopefuls did not respond. That includes Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, Asa Hutchinson, Ambassador John Bolton, and Governor Chris Sununu. So this is good stuff. But I missed one guy there, didn't I? I missed that Ron DeSantis. And this is one of the things that people are trying to hit DeSantis on. Oh, you've been governor of Florida. You can handle the beaches and the sunshine and all that stuff. But what is your foreign policy chops? What are your foreign policy beliefs? Well, here Tucker, I'm going to let Tucker do it himself. He read Governor DeSantis' full statement on Ukraine with some commentary. Take a look. And then maybe the most newsworthy response that we received was from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has well-known views on many topics, of course. But until tonight, no one could really say with precision where he stood on the war in Ukraine, which is arguably the most important topic in the world. And now we know. DeSantis is adamantly opposed to the position that most Republicans in Washington have taken on Ukraine. DeSantis is not a neo-con. Who knew? Quote, While the US has many vital national interests to Santos' rights, securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them. Without question, he writes, peace should be the objective. The US should not provide assistance that could require the deployment of American troops or enable Ukraine to engage in offensive operations beyond its borders. F-16s and long-range missiles should therefore be off the table. These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States into the conflict and drawing us closer to a hot war between the world's two largest nuclear powers. That risk is unacceptable. DeSantis goes on to oppose the policy of regime change in Moscow, which is very popular in Washington. And he points out that the Biden administration has created an alliance between Russia and China, and that's a disaster for the United States. So that's DeSantis' position, clarified. So before we get to the nitty gritty on DeSantis' position, what's most interesting about this is, you have to understand, Tucker Carlson is mostly an isolationist. I don't want to speak exactly for him, but he's more along the lines of we should be caring about Americans. We should be caring about the heartland. We should be funding things so that people in America can prosper the most. That's really, I would say, Tucker's reason for being a public figure. That is what he cares about. That's what he's written about and talks about all the time. And what he's in essence saying, the reason he read that one the way he did is, hey, this guy is not a neo-con. He doesn't want to get us in these crazy wars. What I also liked about DeSantis' commentary there, it was the most detailed. Do not give them certain weapons that could go on the offense. What have I been saying this entire time throughout the Ukraine war? Every week we give them more money, we give them more weapons, and you can see guys like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, well, this will help just turn the tide of the war. This will do it. It's like, no, it's not. Oh, we gave them four more tanks. They got a couple more planes, a little more cash that we don't know what they're doing with. None of this has ended the war. It has elongated the war. It has gotten us into a protracted conflict that nobody knows how it's going to end except the crazy guy on the other side of the world does have the biggest bomb. And he has quite a few of them. And that is a problem. So DeSantis is trying to give a somewhat measured answer there. Now you might like Trump's just sort of like completely blanket. I was thought of as crazy, so they weren't going to do anything under me, and that might be the best policy. But I think what you see here is some political diversity of thought, and that is good. And by the way, whether you like Trump or DeSantis or Nikki Haley or Vivek or whoever you like, or whether you like none of those people, the fact that this is happening now, this is really good because it's going to make the media not know what to do about it. The Democrats clearly are going to be the party of war. This Democrat machine, the Biden machine, the money laundering that's going on in Ukraine and all that stuff, it cannot stop itself. So they're the party of war. So whoever ends up doing this on the Republican side will be more anti-war. And that I think ultimately is a good thing. So now let's get this thing full circle to where we started with the show. We started with Bill Maher, right? And Bill Maher basically was saying, well, DeSantis is just going to be a retread of Trump and who wants that retread? The thing is, he has done the things that have caused the place where he governs to flourish. And you may remember this, we've played it a couple times, but I thought it was worth bearing repeating on today's show, which I will send to Bill myself. Even Bill has admitted, I got him to admit it. I can put a little feather in my cap on this one. Even Bill Maher has admitted that there is a way he himself would move to the scary red state of Florida. And it's because of the lunacy of California and big government and Gavin Newsom and Democrat policies. If California says, I have to take shots and DeSantis says, I don't. Hello, Florida. That's what I'll say about DeSantis. He's a good dude. He's a good dude. He really is. He doesn't care whether you smoke weed and he doesn't care who you marry. He doesn't. But to sound like the voiceover in a movie that's coming out soon, shit just got real. But like for me personally, really, shit just got real with that. And that's in my mind. I left this place because of it. And I don't want to leave this place. It would be very hard. I'm 66 years old. I know I look 40. Look amazing. It seems thicker than it was a couple years ago. But it's not easy for anyone. I'm playing that clip again is because it sounds like Mars is going to go the other way. So trust me, in Mars' mind, he wants Trump to be the nominee because it will make it very easy for him to say, I'm still the liberal and the Republicans are all bananas. DeSantis really complicates this for a lot of people. That's why the machine is going nuts because the good liberals realize that freedom actually really matters. Classical liberalism. I used to talk about it quite often. Is the most freedom based ideology that there is? And if you are a classical liberal, meaning you believe in old school individual rights, you believe in laissez-faire economics, you believe that people should make choices for themselves and associate with the people who they want to associate with, and you believe in limited government and all of those notions, well then in essence you are a moderate Republican right now. I believe that is what most of us are. So DeSantis is the threat to the people on the fringes because he's the one that can bring this stuff together. I sense it could be a Reagan 1984 kind of situation, but we shall see. I enjoyed today's program. You will all have lunch and then be sent off to live your lives. That's what we shall do today.
