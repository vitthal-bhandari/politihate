All right, folks, welcome back from the commercial break. As promised, a very special guest joining us from the great state of South Carolina is Congressman Ralph Norman, member of the House Freedom Caucus, doing a lot of amazing things on immigration on budget on the economy. So glad you're welcome to the show. Congressman, welcome. Well, my pleasure to be with John. Thank you. You are have been such an important voice in Congress in raising the concerns about the Biden economic agenda and the social agenda that's underlying that economic agenda. Tell us as you look right now, supply chain shortages, a huge surge in inflation, are we heading into a perfect storm of economic danger? We're going off the cliff. You know, we had Steve Moyen, who's an economist with Freedom Works speak to us today. And we just simply have got to draw a line with with the spending with, you know, this country, 28 trillion, and I would argue, when you had Social Security, Medicare, any of the transportation funds, we're probably in the 50s to 60s because they're all going bankrupt at a certain time that we don't really know about. But no, this is a this is a day time to to stop spending. It is every time to cut government. It's now and we're heading headlong into a socialistic government run country, which we just can't do. So now's the time to stop it. And you know, it's it's who would have thought eight months nine months ago, John, we would have been facing what this administration is doing. I mean, it's not one thing. It's I don't I can't think of anything the man has done that's not harming this country in a big way. So the good news is I think people are waking up to it. I think people are going to get active because it's up to us to ring the bell as far as the downside if we don't. Yeah. And I know you've been a big advocate of activating the grassroots. You see what parents have done at the school board level, literally initiating extraordinary change in school districts where education bureaucrats were imposing curriculum that the parents didn't even know about. Is that the model that you feel Republicans need to pursue to block the big bills that are going through now the reconciliation bill and the infrastructure bill? Well, we've got to get Republicans. There's no Republicans should vote for any of these bills. Why help Democrats bankrupt our country and Republicans ought to be united on this and then to that end, we will work. Now, politicians respond to constituents back home. In in a lot of cases you have with politicians, they react to keeping their job. And I'm trying to tell at least in my district, and I think not just in the fifth district in South Carolina, but all of the country people asking why? Yeah. Why are we letting 177,000 people come across the border? Why in the reconciliation bill are they wanting to legalize 8 million e-legales coming in this country? You know, why are they leaving Americans in Afghanistan and the list goes on and on? So I'm saying, you know, you play the cards you dealt. And in the case of we the people the to write for people in South Carolina to write a letter to Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer, you you waste in your time, your ink in the pen. So what can you do? You get active at the school board level, because that's 50% of our budget that taxes go to in South Carolina's public education. You go to the school boards, you ask questions, where is the budget now? Where was the where was the COVID money used? How are you going to deal with the influx of e-legal immigrants who were rather 100,000 that come to South Carolina or more? They're going to be the people who are going to be desperate. They don't speak the language. They got their behind from a education stamp. How are you going to deal with that? And so that's kind of the fact that we're taking all along with writing our individual senators and congressmen in our district to get active and let the feelings be known, because it's important for all of us to know the sentiment. And with the one thing that I think that's ignited people, John, are the gas pump. Yes. Everybody knows that you can talk deficit all you want. You can talk trillions in the future all you want. When they're paying 40 and 50% more for gas along with food, along with I mean every item with inflation that's that's it, their pocketbook, it gets their attention. It's just amazing. It's absolutely stunning to to see people go to the pumps and they were paying a buck 80 buck 90 in January. Now they're paying three, four. I just filled up at a place for 20 their day like 420. It's like double what I was paying a few months ago. It really does impact. And you know, people who have good jobs and have a little cushion, they can absorb this. But the working class, this is really forcing people to make personal decisions and write more food. Do I pay the tuition? Do I pay the heating bill? Do I put car gas in my car? Are you beginning to see the very people that Joe Biden says he stands for feeling the pinch here? Absolutely. They don't trust his words. I mean, the limited time that he has been in office and the limited amount of press conferences that he's had, they don't trust him because it's just words. I mean, where he's he delivered other than bad things? How is he? I mean, to tell people that he's going to pass a $5 trillion package of spending with no offsets that they don't allow amendments on the floor or in the rules committee. And this is not bipartisan. It's everything opposite that he says American people know it. And the other thing they realize is we are buying gas from OPEC, having to get their approval of countries that don't like us applying all how dumb is that? We were energy independent. You were just a few months ago. Just a few months ago. And yeah, they're feeling the severity of it. And nothing makes sense. Nothing. I mean, it's just a there scratching their head. But while they may not know the details, they know that all of a sudden the gas pump is 50% more. The price of any type of food is up 15, 20, 25%. And the thoughts of having Thanksgiving and paying what it looks like a 25 to 30% increase in turkeys. If we can get them, no, that's got their attention. Yeah, I bet it does. It's pretty scary. Now, one of the key things in the Freedom Caucus, of course, is you've been a member for a long time, has been an increasingly important voice in the conservative movement, sort of a compass center. But it only works when the leadership of the party is in lockstep and everyone is moving. How on the issue of fighting the Biden agenda, where does Kevin McCarthy and the leadership stand and what sort of synergies or lack of synergies are there with the great block of lawmakers you represent with Freedom Caucus? Well, Freedom Caucus is going to play a big role and who gets bigger? One, two, and Steve Moore, I guess, highlighted and put them portents that we can talk all we want about midterms. It's now or never as far as spending because some of these things are going to be embedded in the government that's going to be hard to unwind. Kind of like the immigration. I mean, if the 1.9 million anticipated being in the country as of December, how do you get them out? I mean, what are you going to do? Try to find them and bring them back and look at the cost of that. So Freedom Caucus is going to play a role and we're going to ask as in any business you have a plan and we're going to ask what the plan is from leadership to not allow Republicans to further the Democrat agenda of big spending and we'll only have to pick off four or five or three or four Democrats that from what I understand are not in agreement and is the reason we haven't voted on the bill yet. Do they going to put some smokescreens up that they got agreement? But I don't think they do or they would have put it on the floor. Well, this just happened a minute ago. Senator Joe Manchin just came out and said he's not that comfortable with the billionaires tax like it was reported a couple of days ago. So they keep the sand is keep shifting under the Democrats for he doesn't it? It does and it's up to us to make sure we don't accomplish an agenda that's going bankrupt the country and that the billionaires tax and they've always pitted one group of another. The billionaires tax is based on tax and unrealized gain which is unrealized but it's making people come out of pocket when the gain hasn't been made yet. And what about losses? What about that? And it's just insane what they're doing. But it's typical of a big government socialist party that is now the Democratic Party and their their policies show that they want to put everybody under government. They want to make the private free enterprise what has made this country great go away. And that's where the Freedom Caucus comes in. We're not putting up with it. And we're going to use our voices to stop it and to put the pressure where we may and whoever's not willing to do that then we do what we can do to to affect change and meaningful change. Power for the sake of power is no good if you don't know how to use it. Yeah, such a good point. And you know you see the difference between when Republicans had all of the chambers and the presidency in 2017 and how the Democrats are doing it. They're pushing through a lot more in a quicker time frame. A lot of lessons I think were learned in that time frame. You had a bill you and Senator Cruz I think have put together a really important new bill that's getting a lot of attention establishing new ports of entry for these illegal migrants that are coming into the country. The Stop the Surge Act and I'm I look at the new ports of Martha's Vineyard Nantucket Block Island Greenwich. Those sound like pretty hoity-toity Democrat areas. What's the idea behind the bill? First of all, you know, look at the surge that's come across the border now. It's averaging 177,000. It is a thumb in the nose at the Mexican authorities. They're using the QR code to register to the caravans to get into this country. Not that the majority of them, we don't know who they are or how they're coming. We just know they're breaking the the line of the police that are there and the drug cartels with thumb in the nose doing the same thing. So we thought and Senator Cruz being from Texas which there are over 40 counties that are pretty much disaster counties and declared a disaster by Abbott. I think it's 47. So what we decided the best thing to do is to have new ports of entry and you know, Biden is shipping these in the middle of night to municipalities, cities, we don't know anything about. So what we were establishing is I think it's 12 to send the, to put them on the bus, is to send them to, you know, Palo Alto, California to send them to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Nantucket in Massachusetts, Governor's Island in New York, Scarzdale, New York, North hero from these are all prosperous areas that you see, you know, million dollar houses, let's send them there and let's let them exercise what they claim to be compassionate on illegals. And rather than not knowing where they're, where they're being shipped to, that's not an answer. Look at the strain is going to put on the police departments, the first responders, hospital schools. And we're going to highlight this because this administration has no right to do this to Americans. And so let's ship them to those areas that can afford to find out what it's about with these illegals and deal with them. Yeah, seems like a very common sensing and a lot of people are talking about that in the last couple of days. Very important stuff. Just real quickly, when you look at critical race theory and what it is done in America's community, the activation of parents, you've got recalls of school boards, you've got parents joining running the doo school boards, you've got people really trying to have a conversation about what's being taught in our schools that we might not have known. How energizing a movement is this for conservatives or just everyday Americans? Well, look at what's happening in Virginia in the governor's race. That's the number one issue when Terry McCollum said basically parents had no say so in what a child is taught. Now, and think about that. How stupid is that? I mean, letting the government to even make that comment, the government can raise a child better than parents. I can't fathom. And so it's galvanizing. It has that race. You'll see who comes out there. And I think it's probably not going to bode well for McCollum, who is really a political hack, who has just been through the, has played the game for a long period of time to the detriment of the country. But no, I'm asking, you know, there's no more important thing a parent can do than to make sure we know what the child is being taught. And critical race theory that the color of your skin is basically if you're a white person, it's you've got inherent racism is wrong. We ought to be, we've got China to contend with. We've got to make sure our children learn things that'll have them compete in the competitive market that's made this country great. And it's not critical race theory. And instead of letting the left on this and be loud, people are now running for office for school board for city council on county council. And how great are that? That's we the people getting involved. And that's we the people taking ownership at the local level, because again, for them to write a letter to Nancy Pelosi from South Carolina, you might as well, you're wasting time and energy. But now school boards, you know, asking the tough questions of of all the officials that take our tax money, it's our money. They work for us, we don't work for them. And that's pretty much what I'm telling people to tell them. And then if they don't abide by if they continue to ignore the voter, put them out of office and run run people that will answer to the people. That's our system is set up. Such an important thing to get back to. I think we've moved so far away from appreciating the system that worked for us for 240 years. You have been people say, there's no bipartisanship in in Congress, but you've always reached reached across the aisle. And earlier this month, you introduced legislation with Rokana to get rid of some of the lifetime benefits and perks that members of Congress have. I think it's called the scrapped act. If I remember correctly, talk about how people have two very different political philosophies can come together and do something that I think most of the American public would appreciate. How does that happen? Well, I give credit to Rokana as he and I vote completely opposite on most of the issues, but on this issue, it's a perfect example of coming together and saying if something is inherently right or if something is inherently wrong. And the question we're putting in our bill, it is not right for a member of Congress when he dies to get a stipend based on your salary of $174,000. In other words, now what exists if a Congressman dies, his survivors, per his will, get a check by $174,000. Why is that right? Why is it right for a Congressman when he retires to get take advantage of the health coverage? Why is it right for them to take advantage of a pension? However big or small, or to use the gym and to use the parking passes and to use a building that they're not paying anything for in the private sector, it would never be allowed. I mean, once you retire, or you're out, and it lets you negotiate something, but this is an automatic benefit that shouldn't be for members of Congress. There's 535 of us, and I've had a lot of people say, well, Norman, that's not going to pass. Well, if we never put it up, we'll never know. And this is such common sense. People resent this type of perk that never should have been there in the first place. It's been buried for a long time. And I'm anxious to let's air it out and let's see what happens on it, because I don't know how you justify this if you're a member of Congress. I really don't. And I've been big on term limits. I think that's a huge thing that is not right to stay for 20 or more years, and it's not right to milk the taxpayers of these benefits, which your everyday American would never have access to. Yeah, such an important point. And I think it is very populous. And by partisan, it's a really remarkable thing in the environment we find ourselves in. Last question, you've been an important voice on passports and the frustration a lot of people have, and particularly during the COVID era of not being able to get passports. Well, that's backlog is still going on, and you're fighting for your constituents today, the State Department announced it has a new US passport with a new gender designation that is neither male nor female. It's called X. Just your thoughts on the fact that they took time to do that while there's a gigantic backlog of passports for everyday Americans. Any reaction to that? That's the most idiotic thing to even attempt with all the crisis that we're facing in this country. As we talked about inflation, Americans dying in Afghanistan gas through the roof, illegal is coming across the border. And then to take the time to even put that on a passport, when we're forcing vaccinations on Americans and not on the 8 million they want in the country, not even requiring a mass or a vaccination or any type of fiscal, it's ridiculous. But there is a there is just two different worldviews that now are in Congress that you can't fathom. And this is one of the things that I could not fathom that they're doing. And I heard about it just a little bit ago, and it's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. And it shows a lack of as a disconnect that Biden has, but he's got unelected bureaucrats running America. That's who it is. And AOC and the socialist, the big government socialist running it. It's up to us to call attention to it and call it for what it is. There's no middle ground on this. And once Americans get the full story, I think they will take it out and put people in office that that will do opposite what this administration is doing. Yeah, so very the next election is going to be so momentous. Congressman, thank you so much for the time we covered a lot of ground. I think our listeners really feel much smarter than when they started the conversation. Thanks again for your time today. My pleasure. Thank you, John, as well. All right, folks, we're gonna take a quick commercial break. When we come back, we'll wrap things up for the day. All right, folks, welcome back. What an interview, a lot to chew on with Congressman Norman's incredible insights, a lot of important ideas. And you see him, he doesn't just talk, he introduces bills, he tries to create solutions, he reaches across the aisle when it comes to congressional perks that he's trying to scale back for former members of Congress. We'd like to introduce you to different members. And I think that conversation opened my eyes on a lot of different fronts. Really great, important news all around. All right, we're gonna be back tomorrow with some great reporting, some great news. I'm gonna have some news for you soon. Personally, about me that I think you'll be excited about tomorrow.
