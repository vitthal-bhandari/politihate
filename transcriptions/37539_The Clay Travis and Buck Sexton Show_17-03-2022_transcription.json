    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show podcast. Oh, welcome back in Thursday edition. Clay Travis, bucks, Xt and show, St. Patrick's day. Also the NCAA tournament underway. A lot of you are going to probably have a few adult beverages during the course of today. Some of you might already be doing so while watching some of the games. I bet our guests now who is one of the great writers at outkick dot com Joe Kinsey will probably be having a few beers. What's your beer of choice on St. Patrick's day, Joe? No, I'm just a Guinness guy. Love Guinness. Give me a Guinness on draft. A lot of head on it. Clay and I'll fuck those down all night. Careful with the word choice there. All right. Let's dive into. I got it. We got a woke bracket that is up at outkick that you have done an incredible job on. We're going to get to that in a moment. But first you're writing this morning on the situation with the transgender pen swimmer who had a three second win in the 500. This story still not being covered very much in the world of sports because it proves that a biological man who decides to become a woman has a substantial competitive advantage, at least based on the results so far. I believe the pen transgender swimmers biological male won by three seconds in the 500 prelams. What can you tell us about the latest on this story and where it's headed? Well, Clay, we have Leah Thomas, the transgender pen swimmer, as you said, with a four swim, a four or he he swam a four thirty three eighty two. And that would, yes, it was three seconds faster than the next, the next qualifier, Erica Sullivan. So we have a we have a situation that is now the fastest time in the 500 freestyle in the nation this season, even faster than Brooke 40, who is Pat 40, sports illustrator, and writer faster than his daughter who won Clay. She won a silver medal at the Olympics in August for the four by two hundred freestyle team for the United States. So not only is Leah Thomas dominating the swimming, Leah Thomas is beating Olympic silver medalist clay. That is where we're at. We're headed into the finals tonight at six p.m. And Leah Thomas, if it stands as it stands now, it's going to be a question if she breaks he he he breaks the pool record and wins the national title. That's that's all it's what is that number? What is the pool record? Like how close is it to be in broken? The pool record is four thirty eighty one. We're talking three seconds. This was the qualifier, you know, this wasn't this wasn't leave it all on the leave it all on the pool. So three seconds could could come down tonight. I mean, we could be talking about a new pool record for the NCAA championship. So so just to be very clear, Joe, I don't follow swimming in general, me and C double a level. So when you say pool record, is it is it then possible that tonight and I think six Eastern, they have the 500 freestyle national championship, right? Tonight, you could have a transgender female hold the all time record for the NCAA for the 500 meter freestyle swim, right? I mean, so it's not is it possible that it wouldn't just be this year. It would be number one all time. So Leah Thomas would have to be Katie LeDeque, you know, the most decorated women's female swimming champion of all time who has a four twenty four. That is the NCAA record. Leah Thomas would have to be a four twenty four oh six. So is it possible? Well, she just Leah Thomas just swam the fastest time in the nation. And it could it could fall tonight. We could see we could see an all time record and a pool record and a national championship. So yeah, I don't think it's out of the question. And what are the what are some of the other women? I mean, one of the things that I know you and Outkick and Clay and I have been talking about here as you guys have been covering the story is that there's this fear of women who are actually biological women who are swimming against Leah Thomas and they they understand this is biochemically unfair and kind of outrageous to them. But they're worried about speaking out. I mean, are there more people that are coming forward right now, you think? Or are they willing to speak to the press more about this? Are they going to wait until Leah Thomas becomes perhaps the national champion? And then there'll be more outcry. How do you see that playing out? Well, we know that Brooke 40 who is entering the finals in the sixth place position. We know through her father who released a statement in January who said I'm perfectly fine with this. Whatever happens happens. Well, here's what happens. You are an Olympic champion who is now going to lose as it stands right now. Brooke 40 will lose a national championship to a guy. And Pat 40, the sports illustrator writer, he is on record saying that he understands this is an unfair playing field here. But they're so far down the woke, you know, they've jumped in so deep in the woke world that they can't now speak out about it because then they're going to lose their street cred buck. You know, they're in this tough situation now where Pat 40 has to watch his daughter lose to prove a point. And now Pat 40 is saying this is all political politically driven. These are political people that are that are making this a problem. Well, Pat, your daughter is about to lose. You know, you know, you know what the problem and you're unwilling to speak out about it. So, you know what, you almost deserve to lose, right? So what's crazy too, is this pin transgender swimmer says that the plan is to become a member of the 2024 women's Olympic team. So this story for people out there who are saying, okay, well, I don't really care that much and some of you may not care that much about a biological man dominating women swimming in college. It's a possibility that in a couple of years, this pin transgender swimmer could be taking away an Olympic position from a biological woman and competing as a woman at the Olympics. I mean, this is, this is full on in swoke insanity, right? I mean, there's no other way to describe this. Clay, as long as these numbers continue, Leopomis will be an Olympic swimmer for the United States swimming team. This is not, this is not some far-fetched reality. This, this is, this is what's going to happen if these times maintain, you know, if Leopomis maintains these times, Leopomis will be on the Olympic team and the Olympic, Leopomis will take a biological female spot on the Olympic team. We're speaking to Joe Kinsey of outkick.com. He's got a story up on Leopomis smashing the records, the times of biological females in the NCAA swimming championship preliminary rounds at Joe, to the point about the Olympics. One thing Clay and I have been talking about is how once this starts to be, you know, look, NCAA swimming is obviously no money in it or I don't know. Maybe you can sell your identity or not identity. You don't even mean that's already a different thing. You can sell your image and likeness. That's what I was trying to think of. But in general, there's no money in swimming. But when you get to gold medals and when you get to Olympic medalists, I've seen assessments that say that that's worth seven figures to people in terms of endorsements and speaking engagements, et cetera. So how does the international Olympic Committee treat this situation? I mean, do we know what the, what are the rules about someone like Leah Thomas, the transgender swimmer competing for actual medals at an actual Olympics? Well, Buck, they've, they've been rewriting the legislation and they've, they've, they've got pages and pages of you got to, you got to go through this process and you got to prove this and you got to go before the doctors and, but let's face it, Buck, everything that they've written this year as far as legislation is none of it is going to stop Leah Thomas from competing for a spot on that team. None of it Buck because Leah Thomas came out a week or two ago and said, listen, I am going to go back and go get a law degree or something like that, I guess, and I am going to train for the Olympics. And this is not going to stop Leah Thomas. There's nothing that the US Olympic team that has put forward to stop a transgender swimmer from competing in the London games. And that is where this is headed. We are seeing the early stages of what is setting up for one of the most insane stories in Olympic history. You mentioned, and I want to get to this because I think people will love it. The amount of American sports media that is woke is like, what do you think, Joe? You've been doing this for a long time. Ninety five percent. If you were analyzing as people in sports media, what percentage of them do you think voted by no over Trump? Oh my God, it's easily into the 90s. And I would have to say into the mid 90s. Well, we have very few instances where we know of blue checkmarks that are in the woke world. I'm one of the few, right? I'm one of the few who's actually come out and said I was willing to vote for. Well, the reason why I bring this up with you, Joe, is because you mentioned Pat 40 who writes now, I believe that sports illustrated. His daughter is an Olympian, which is an incredible accomplishment. She may lose her chance to win an NCAA championship to a guy. And Pat 40 is in some way defending this. And he is a part you've done. This is the second year in a row where we have a woke sports media bracket challenge for people out there who like to do bracket voting and have fun with it. You've got 20 different woke sports media members last year. Jamel Hill, who memorably called the president a white supremacist and got to keep working at ESPN. She won. So she's been, uh, we've pulled her out of the ranks, but this is pretty entertaining. 20 different people all competing for the title of outkicks woke bracket challenge winner. Clay, this, this has become my calling card. You know, the readers requested it. They want the bracket. They want the woke off our challenge. Uh, listen, we had trouble coming up with number one feeds. There were so many people that could have been a number one seed in this bracket. We have Rex Chapman, your buddy. He's, you know, he's one of the craziest. Buck, you even know these guys. We got listen to the one seeds. Rex Chapman, who is insufferable on social media. Uh, we've got Keith Olberman, who, you pointed at you, texted me this morning. Is trying to steal somebody else's show at MSNBC. Yep. He's a true lunatic. Uh, Darren Ravel, who covers sports media and business and has turned into an insane man over COVID. He wears like 40 different masks a day. And then we've got Mina Kimes, uh, who is, uh, who is gotten to a woke battle. So people love this. I mean, you even Buck, I think we'll enjoy it. So we have odds makers putting up lines, breaking down the matchup. And then we just let everybody vote for it and people flood in like crazy to read. Joe's breakdown. Yeah. Clay, the thing about the woke challenges is we have competitors that I think love the woke challenge and they're trying to win it. Clay, they really want to win this. Yeah. Keith Olberman, he went nuts this week. He wants to win this. Clay, this, this is what it's all about. They want to prove how woke they are. And this is one of the ways they do it. There's no such thing as to woke to the world. That's what you have to remember. They, they can always be crazier. And it sounds like gentlemen, they're going to try to prove it. Yeah. So go check it out. Joe, we appreciate the time, uh, out kick.com. People can go check out the Woke bracket. They can follow you at Joe Kinsey, exp. I'll tweet out your handle if people are enjoying it and they can stay a pro. Hey, as well, Joe, appreciate the time. Enjoy the games and enjoy St. Patrick's day, bud. See you guys. All right.

But they came down a couple of pennies in the last few days. So we got that going for us, which is nice. They got to figure out though, the Democrats have to come up with some way, some explanation for this. That is not a reflection of their poor decision making, their green new deal, Marxist lunacy and just other incompetence on display from the Biden regime. So what do they do? Oh, it's the big bad oil companies and also, oh, by the way, the meat companies are to blame for inflation. I think the primary cause of this bout of price increases starts with COVID and the fact that we have supply chain kinks and that people rapidly shifted the demand curve so that demand for services went down and demand for goods went up. So those two have forced prices up. That's part one. But what has also happened is that now that we live in America where there's a lot more concentration in certain industries, look at the oil industry, look at meat industry, look at groceries generally, that what's happened is these companies have said, you know, we'll pass along costs. But while we're at it and everyone's talking about rising costs, let's just add an extra big dollar of cost increases to expand our profits. I want everyone to hear that. Just as a reminder, Elizabeth Warren, supposed to be one of the more intellectual members of the, you know, far left of the Democrat party. I think she would fail an econ 101 class, not even at the college. I think at the high school level, I don't think she would pass because she doesn't understand and beyond just her lack of conceptual understanding, Clay, like when the gas companies are blaming big oil, gas stations, great report on Fox News actually this morning, most gas stations are owned by independent proprietors. They're just passing on the price of what the gas costs. Well, and lots of gas stations make no money off of gas. This is like just not understanding basic economics in the same way that movie theaters make most of their money off of the concessions. They don't make that much money off of the actual film itself because they have to share so much of the revenue. So many gas stations because they have to be competitive and look how often is the price of a gas station across the street from each other within a penny or two? It's not very often you see one gas station charging 20 cents more than another one that you can see the sign for. That's why, by the way, they have the signs. Oftentimes the margins on gas stations come not from the gas itself, but from the things that people buy inside of the convenience stores when they go to buy gas, right? So one of the big challenges that the Democratic Party has, and then they trust me, they got a bunch now. They don't have very many people anymore, Buck, with substantial voices in the party that are involved in business that understand what making a payroll requires that understand the difference between a profit and a loss and what that means to the business. The Democrat Party is now effectively ruled by the Oberlin women and gender studies faculty lounge and the results are not good. Not good. Not at all. Pain is one of the great disablers. I'm not saying anything that people living with pain every day don't already know. What they may not know is that relief factor could be the solution to their problems. Created by doctors and perfected over 15 years of scientific research, relief factor was made for you with four key ingredients.

Welcome back in clay Travis, Buck Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through the Thursday edition of the program. Serious story out there that I don't think is going to get very much attention, although arguably given what happened with George Floyd, it should. And this is a tough story. And many of you may not have heard about it at all, but it comes from Los Angeles reading from the Daily Mail. They have the video up. It is a difficult watch. Buck, you sent this to me earlier today so that I could watch it in prep for the show. And I'm just going to give you a rough outline of the story here. A 38 year old man named Edward Bronstein died on March 31st of 2020, a little over two months before the George Floyd incident. A footage of his death was just released by by the police department in Los Angeles yesterday after his family sued so that they could see the video surrounding his death. This 38 year old man, by the way, father of two was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving and they were trying to give, get, take blood from him to determine whether or not he was drunk. And he was forced on to a mat in the police station garage. He was handcuffed five LA police officers then kneeled on his back while they put the needle into extract blood. His family says that he had an incredible fear of needles. He screams, I can't breathe 11 times before eventually going silent. This is a really hard tape to watch. But you and I from the moment the George Floyd video went public, we are first of all defenders of police in general. We need more police. We need as talented of people as possible, willing to take on the job of police, but sometimes police like people who have every sort of profession under the sun behave in ways that may well be illegal. And when that occurs, there need to be charges that are brought. What is devastating about watching this video is this man, 38 year old, again, Edward Bronstein, he's a white guy. Same thing happens to him that happened to George Floyd. And this was over two years ago. The tape is just now coming out. When we talk about larger police issues, I think oftentimes when race is made the primary focus, it misses the larger story. But you look at the data from the Washington Post, 75% of people who are killed by police every year are white, Asian or Hispanic. I think that data stuns people, stuns people when they hear that 75% of people who are killed by police are white, Asian and Hispanic. And so what will be interesting is as this lawsuit progresses and given the fact that this video is now out and the man is saying basically the same exact thing that George Floyd said, will a white man being knelt on by five different police officers in Los Angeles? Will this be a story at all? Will there be any marches? Will there be any discussion about this in the larger cultural sphere? The law enforcement agency involved here was California Highway Patrol. And they were the ones that then fought the release of this tape. And we honestly, we could play just the audio for you. It's, it's bone chilling. I mean, it's, it's horrifying. This guy, uh, Bronstein now, now deceased is into the guys, a father and there's a photo on the daily mail. You see his little daughter. He is screaming for his life and screaming. I can't breathe 11 times exact 11 times. The exact same thing that George Floyd was screaming. Now the video of George Floyd was taken by bystanders that got out there sooner. I understand that there are some differences here in the situation. I'd also say that, uh, in this case, you'll have to look at the specifics of Bronstein is, is essentially, uh, he, he's already handcuffed, hands behind his back, handcuffed. He's on his knees on a mat. This is over a DUI issue. Uh, he poses no threat to one of the officers around him. And right when they go to grab him, he says he'll comply for the blood test. They say too late, too late. We're, we're doing it this way. And they have, I think four officers kneel on him and he's screaming. I, and you can, he's an absolute hysterics and he's screaming. I can't breathe and he dies right there. He dies on the video and it's absolutely horrific. Now, Clay and I thought this is a story you should know about because first of all, the narrative immediately with George Floyd, it wasn't so much that it was a case of police brutality. It's that it was a case of racist police brutality. That was, that was assumed right away. And when you actually understand more about cases across the country, Clay mentioned the Washington Post numbers, which you find is that yeah, there are going to be, there are cops who cross the line. There are cops who do bad things, but law enforcement in general in America is actually not racist. Yes. And the left and the Democrats and the progressives run with this narrative at the first opportunity. And they don't ever stop to look at the facts. I mean, here you see that this police restraint of a shoulder on the back or the neck in some circumstances clearly can be fatal for people. And it wasn't just something that happened to George Floyd. It happened to this individual Bronstein before the George Floyd incident, just to be clear. And then Clay on top of it, we have the part of this will not be, this will not result in marches. This will not be BLM, a national phenomenon that we all have to talk about and have a long conversation about police violence or anything else because it doesn't fit the racial component. And it doesn't have that narrative heft from the left. They will, they will not care about this story. They will not compare, they care about police violence in this case. Five officers involved, no charges brought against any of the officers so far. The LA County coroner's office ruled that this man, Bronstein died, quote, as a result of acute methamphetamine intoxication during restraint by law enforcement. Very similar to the argument that the police officers put forward in the George Floyd case, which was Floyd was under the influence of drugs. And that was what caused his death, not the actions of the police officers. That was the defense. So in this situation, the five officers not charged and the LA County coroner's determination that the drugs called that caused the death, not the police officers actions, has been accepted without any argument to the contrary. Now maybe with the video out reminder, this happened before George Floyd happened in March of 2020. And Buck, it's interesting to think about how different, how different George Floyd situation might have been covered if this Bronstein video had been public at the time because one of the primary arguments, you remember this, of Black Lives Matter, was this would never have happened to a white guy. They say they say it all the time, all the time. And it is not true. Not true. That's one of the only pieces I ever had go viral when I worked at the hill.com was about a shooting in Arizona. And there's another horrific video of a guy who's clearly he did nothing. He did nothing wrong, nothing illegal. He was in hysterics because someone had called almost an accidental swatting, had called law enforcement onto the scene. He had a BB gun, totally legal for him to have. Someone thought it was a rifle and police, two of them with long gone, see him in the hallway and are shouting commands at him. And just, I mean, if you see the, they just, one of the officers just light, just start shooting this guy. I mean, it's, because he can't, he didn't comply quickly. And he's on his knees. And he's like, Oh, you're saying he was saying, cross your legs. Now crawl and the kid goes to pull up his pants, pull up his shorts. Yeah. And he's got two guns trained on him and one of the officers just, they did bring murder charges. But the, the, I think the jury got it wrong. The jury found that the officer was not guilty of murder in that case. But these things do happen is the point and it happens to people regardless of race, ethnicity or background. But that's not the narrative the left ever wants to tell. And most of you will never hear about this story. The Edward Braun seems to, or my prediction, maybe this will turn into a big story. I bet that most of you will not hear a single word about this story in mainstream media at all because it challenges the narrative that this was a race based murder, which is what was said about George Floyd. And it remains to be seen what's going to happen to these California highway patrol officers and also whether there will be any sort of consequences as a result of these actions. But we just wanted to share it with you because it's a larger picture of what goes on in a day to day basis. And by the way, I'm not sure there's any show that supports police officers more. And Buck, if you talk to police officers, nobody hates a crooked cop or a bad cop more than a good cop because they paint all police officers in a bad life, makes their jobs harder, puts them at greater risk, strains, relations with the community. Cops do hate dirty cops. And one thing for anyone who says, Oh, book, that's not true. Well, I worked at the NYPD intelligence division. No, one of the interest statistics was over 90% of internal affairs complaints come from other cops. It's a great set. Michael and deli's the inventor of my pillow and his team.

You definitely want to stick around for it. We have Senator Rand Paul on his bill to eliminate Fauci's position. It turns out clay found Fauci, by the way, just told me about this. He is not as it turns out lost under the seat of a New York City taxi cab with some gum wrappers and old coffee lids. He is back in the media and we will discuss this in just a few moments with Senator Rand Paul as well as everything going on with COVID. We keep telling. I know people go, Oh, but it's not over folks. It's not. We'll tell you what it's done. We'll throw a party in here. We'll drink some tequila and burn a pile of stupid masks, but that's coming up. And then we have former Attorney General Bill Barr on. He's making a very strong case that the debacle of the Biden regime in Afghanistan kicked the door wide open for Putin to go into Ukraine. That's the case he'll make. We'll talk about that as well as election integrity issues. But right now also wanted to want to bring to your attention that jet blue American and Southwest pilots are suing the CDC to try to get rid of the federal transportation mask mandate. Ten commercial airline pilots argue the CDC issued an order without providing public notice or soliciting comment. Pilots are asking the court to vacate worldwide the federal transportation mask mandate, calling the move illegal and unconstitutional exercise of executive authority clay. This is they're essentially challenging it on procedural grounds. Yeah, which I don't know whether this is likely to work or not. You know, where is the case going to be? You know, which judge is going to hear it? But I love that they're trying because it should just be reminded everybody of the abject stupidity of Fauciism and the CDC and the cowardice of Democrats who I think play at some level now. It's there are the people that are still terrified walking around with three masks on and then some embarrassing and I feel sorry that they're, you know, emotionally. So compromised as a result of COVID. I also think there's a degree of spite that they're Democrats that it doesn't matter that we were right this whole time. They're like, yeah, we're going to make you do it anyway. Well, and to our point earlier, this is this a the mandate originally went into effect on the TSA's mask mandate. February 1st, 2021, according to this and was set to expire on May 11th of 2021. It has continued over and over and over again. And what I have found is there are a lot of flight attendants who disagree with this. Obviously these 10 different pilots from JetBlue, American and Southwest disagree with this. And they hate the mandate oftentimes as much as many of their flyers do. What I noticed flying back from Florida yesterday, I'm about to hop on a flight to go to Las Vegas. So we'll see how exactly things go on that trip. I'm glad that Las Vegas is back open for business because the last time I was in Las Vegas, they had re instituted a mask mandate too. But I noticed inside the airport, almost nobody was wearing their mask. And so here's what I would encourage everybody who listens to Clay and Buck to do. Pull your if you want to do one of those ridiculous things or you have the mask kind of strapped around your ears, pull it down below your mouth. Do it where you're basically not wearing it. Obviously you can go buy a drink, walk around and be sipping on that. That allows you to to be out of the mix. But the number of people that I saw walking around in the airport in Florida, not even bothering to wear a mask at all with no employees following around, hectoring them saying you have to put a mask on. You got to make sure that you're wearing it was encouraging and on the airport, on the airplane itself. And I fly Southwest almost everywhere. It feels as if the Southwest airline attendants by and large are done with being the police in charge of making sure people are wearing their mask. I've been saying this for a long time. The people that are charged with enforcing this idiocy should nullify it by just not enforcing it. It's very straightforward and pretty. It's all but that's not the spirit of the what? Not the spirit of the federal bureaucracies, executive orders that were supposed to obey on the whims of a bunch of bureaucrats. It's absurd. And they don't they don't enforce immigration law in this country on the Biden regime. But all of a sudden you're supposed to say the law is the law when it comes to masks. Absolutely not. So that's why I'll tell you, I mean, for a while, no, I've really the people that the people that have been their mask shammers and the mask enforcers. They're kind of the worst, Clay. They're kind of the worst. I'm just saying, you don't you don't have to do it. You don't have to be a part of the madness for anybody out there. I know 99.9% of our audience would never do that. But for anybody listening, don't be a mask, Shamer. Well, there's no doubt. And plus honestly, it makes their job a lot harder. I mean, if you're a flight attendant and you're in charge of managing the flight in general and getting drinks out and I'd Southwest has got alcohol back, which I felt like was a big sign of normal. See, I'm not sure how many other airlines have re instituted beer and wine and liquor on their flights. But when the alcohol came back, it feels like things are very much more back to normalcy. And given the fact that people are sitting there, sipping their drinks or doing whatever, eating whatever devices they might have that they brought on, it feels like a lot of flight attendants personally, based on what I'm seeing. And have just said, I'm over this. I'm not going to be policing whether or not people are wearing their mask accurately. And they are taking a stand for freedom while passing out peanuts and delicious. Hey, not not peanuts anymore. Because a peanut allergies, but now they're a medley of snacks. They know, can I just say there's a little bit of gluten discrimination that goes on here. Because now on these planes, I was good with the peanuts. But now they're always handing out pretzels and crackers. Are they trying to, are they trying to knock off the bucks through here? I need a, I need a GF option, folks. Unfair. You're going to be done for, I guess, because I don't think peanuts are ever coming back. I think they're gone forever. I used to like some of those peanuts. They are pretty calorie dense, but with, you know, when they're salted, I got to say I'm a fan, although I like to the honestly, I like into scarves. So I'm kind of a pistachio guy, Clay. We're going to also have a scooter with a not very masculine. Have you seen the price of gas, Clay? Do you wear it with the, with the scarf on?"
