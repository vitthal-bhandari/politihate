    "text": " Welcome back to Keep It. Jesus has risen this week. And now I'm not talking about the actual Jesus. I'm talking about the real housewives in New York or back. Oh, is that what you were talking about? I mean. I'm just very excited about this week. Before we get into the news, I just want to say for our fans who listen and love Bravo, we're excited. This season is going to be unbelievable. It's going to be amazing. There's the funeral, Bobby's funeral with Bethany and Jill making their, they're confronting each other. They went on some insane trip where they all like got stuck on a boat, something crazy. Like it's. Lou Ann was arrested. Lou Ann was arrested. In Palm Beach. Goes to rehab. Oh my God. I understand the concept of Bethany and I support what I understand of that. She's sort of like if, like, if Julie Bowen were even whipped smarter and was quippier. Did I get it? You totally got it, Lewis. Okay, good. All right. But on a serious note, this week we will be talking about Stacey Dash's campaign going down in flame. I wish I was dead. We'll talk about Grindr selling their users as HIV statuses to third parties. And then we're going to dive into the Roseanne reboot America's favorite television show. But before we get to that, it's April and March Madness is over and no care. What a month it's been for us. Okay. Here's the thing. March Madness. I don't know who started it, but there was this trend that emerged of people doing brackets for different things that they loved. So they would do like Mariah Carey albums and the best Madonna single and things like that. And it was cute. However, none of you seem to understand how a damn bracket works because it's not just randomly throwing names in. The ranking is an integral part of a bracket because you had these matchups of like Mariah's best two songs in the first round. And clearly I get it because I'm guessing someone who would take the time to make like a Lady Gaga single bracket is not a frequent March Madness viewer. What a social scientist you are. But it was driving me crazy because it's guys the first that you have to rank them in order of like best to worst or you know number you know the highest single sold and the least singles or single sold. And then you match them up accordingly. So the first round should be in theory the quote unquote best one or the highest selling one with the lowest one. You can't ask people to decide between like heartbreaker and honey in the first round. It's madness. That's really stupid. The most egregious example I saw of that was a RuPaul's Drag Race bracket where just in the first bracket it was Alaska who was like the best drag queen the show has ever had versus Adore another best queen the show has ever had. And the next one down is like queens who have bad puns for names like you know Penny Treshen versus Vivian Penne. I will say that I took a lot of time and effort into my Janet Jackson one that I made. It's the only one I made. Oh duh. And I seeded it properly. Yes. Because it matters because it's not a bracket if the seating doesn't make any sense. Wait what one years it wasn't if? No it was not you want. The pleasure principal. The pleasure principal that's a good one. Yes beautiful. I also I think control should be top five too. It established who she was. That's beautiful. And the bigness of her shoulder pads and hair. We're talking about March Madness brackets because none of us really want to talk about Stacey Dash this week but luckily it may be the last time. Dash is out of the race in California's 44th congressional district. And a statement that she released exclusively to Cosmo. Cosmo's first political exclusive I'm sure ever. And her statement to Zappos. She said at this point I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process participating in the rigors of campaigning and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and well-being of my family. Girl you didn't raise any money. Yeah. That's why you're asking me out please. Holding office would be detrimental to the health of my family. You know this what happens when you run. You didn't realize that when you decided to run. It just hit you. It's almost like this was an impetuous thing she did to maybe get a little bit of traction for her shall we say faltering career and it didn't work out. I don't know this is my wild guess. She's never done anything like this before. What does she think she was going to get out of this like last long enough to release a book about five weeks on the campaign trial. She wants the role of the principal in the clueless TV reboot and we don't even have that yet so good try. Stacey you know I'm really happy I mean obviously mainly because I was worried I might like develop a drinking problem if I had to sit and sit through an entire can you imagine a Stacey Dash campaign like months of this. No because it's like first of all she also kept yammering on about how she wanted to defeat quote unquote plantation politics and I really did not. Yes that's the term that she and these other light and lovelies like to say about. Democrat the fact that they just keep taking what the Democrat party serves to them like they're on a plantation. Oh girl that analogy doesn't even quite work. GOP stands for grand Omarosa party and she is an active member. I'm like from the free at last Jesus. I know right. I forgot about that. Yeah she's gone too. There's also this idea that she brings up about the quote unquote bitterness of politics you know and it's weird for her to voice that but it feels like something that is you know going to be a hurdle for real candidates. Well you contributed to the bitterness and politics girl so it's also a little rich coming from her where you worked at an organization that just spews idiocy and lies and bigotry and you were on air for years saying things that made all of this more bitter and drove people apart. So I find her now getting upset about the bitterness of politics quite rich. Also I mean do you think one thing that leads to the bitterness is naked opportunism like she has exhibited for years and years being like the one black woman ever on Fox News and taking that slot you know because they wouldn't they wouldn't refuse to let her on air for that reason you know. And not just that but the fact that she was always wasn't just like a person who I dislike Obama on Fox News which is fine you know I'm pretty sure that exists somewhere in some black people. I'm surprised she hasn't landed on like a housewives-y type situation that does seem sort of right for her. No because you know what though I feel like that'd be a hard sell to the group because she would be on a black show and because they still kind of grouped them all together and I don't see any of those black women being like oh yeah cool we'll record with this woman. But if they let anybody you know darker than a paper bag on the OC then maybe she could join that show. They're all Trump supporters. That's true that is true. Graham. What's next for Stacy is she joining Omarosa on a reality job? I'm a vacation like Nicole and Paris like a road trip the simple life actual simple though. Can we produce that? I want her to be like 8th build on a VH1 show again I do miss that for her. Girl no no get to step in 9th build. No 13th build. Dolly grip on a VH1 show. On a pop TV show. Oh yeah don't just pop TV they do good work with Big Brother After Dark. I love pop TV shits Greek Arizona. That's true that's true. All right some other network. All right yeah I am worried though because now you're right like she doesn't have a job I assume and she's such like that. She got kicked off of Fox News after Trump won. They just wanted her there while Obama was president so that she could spew her you know like pseudo-racism. And she needs attention like the rest of us need oxygen so it's like she must have there's going to be something else right that she's going to be doing and that's the only thing that worries me like what other way is she going to find to ruin my day. I never know what she's up to you know she's had me blocked for like three years. Congratulations. Thank you. You got your three year chip yeah. I have another fun blocky that I'll bring up later in the show. Oh yeah. I can probably guess it's nothing. Oh okay. When we come back. Cara's favorite topic. Grindr. This week BuzzFeed reported that the gay hookup at Grindr which has more than 3.6 million daily active users across the world has been providing its users HIV status to third parties. Two companies optimize and localistic which help optimize the apps and give them information about their users now have access to not only people's HIV statuses but also their GPS data their phone ID and email and people are reasonably upset about it. I feel like I'm going to walk outside and just like a bunch of gay agents will be tracking my every move like like I'm on damages. But there's also the question isn't sharing your data just sort of like part of the internet now. It feels unfortunate in that like that's sensitive information that's being shared but like a lot of us are probably sharing sensitive information and we don't even realize it on a regular basis like I feel like I keep coming across these threads where they're like Facebook literally knows every phone call you've had in the past three years. And it's one of those things that I think we all kind of know in the back of our mind but to think about it too much just gets super depressing and because then it's like I can't even I don't I can't even do anything. And also we never just thought there'd be new stories just confirming it. You know what I mean? We thought we could basically avoid that. This grinder story is something I'm still kind of wrapping my head around. I think maybe it's important to point out it's not like they're selling it to advertisers or something like Way Orwellian but what is occurring is just one of those things that feels unseemly. Right because they're technically admitting that it's taking our information putting it in like this database and passing it over somewhere which means that the information is collected somewhere and that it could reasonably be hacked I suppose. It's right. You know the the transfer of it from party to party means that it could be hacked but also this is information that unfortunately like people are willingly submitting you know it's not like they're stealing it from your doctor. It's not a requirement right to sign up for the app. No. Okay but also it is actually you know sometimes you know to get to free drinks at the app you have to sign up and I felt forced. Really? I'm kidding. No but like the profile on grinder I mean filling out as much information as you can is just helpful for being on the app it's part of being social it's one of those things you thought you could do in a benign sort of way. I mean the list of things you can contribute is crazy. It's like it starts with body and ethnicity and height and I think by the end it's like Candace Bergen has five M's how many do you think she should have? I said three. The fact that they would sell that information to a third party is disgusting. Does this have shades of the whole Facebook drama or is this like being overwhelmed? I think we everyone is giving our information away all the time and it's just now like Lewis said like it's being confirmed in a really obvious way and I'm not sure you know people are deleting their Facebooks and I'm kind of it but weirdly to me at least I'm like it feels like the damage is done like there's so many things that I have given my information to and I would there's so many apps and parties and websites like the idea of going back and deleting all of that it's just there's it's not possible. Yeah right. I'm in it. That's yeah that's where I live. Yeah. This is my condo. I can't imagine doing anything else within the next like 30 years that's like oh let me get rid of Facebook so I can't find out this. Yeah I mean you they know my phone number. They've had me since college. They've been free. They know everything. Can I tell you something though if it came down to everybody deleted Grindr or something? That would be hard for me. I really do love Grindr. Wouldn't it be like it would be hard for me. I do a lot of good work there. I think there's something valuable about it. I mean it's a system that tells you where all the available and horny gay people are in the area. I'm sorry that's crucial information both to my well-being and the community at large I find you know is my former co-worker who winked at me sometimes 4,000 feet away he is and I feel good about it. Listen there's also a question that this is what you have to do on dating apps too. Yeah that's what- Are we like we you sort of have to give everything because we're now in a point where people want to know not just Facebook or like the apps in general like or a third party it's the party that you want to talk to wants to know everything about the person that they're talking to before you even meet. That's why it feels like the Grindr story because people on Tinder you know like straight people on Tinder are giving away tons of information and so for this it's like this is information that maybe on another app you're not giving but everyone's information is still being shared anyway and so it feels like like this story of oh my gosh this is like something that's in particular very sensitive when there's other sense of information that's being given away it's just that's not what Tinder is asking people. So it's sort of everyone should be like oh my god if you know Grindr is doing this but they're doing it on a okay qubit also people it's just not something that they're necessarily thinking about. Well the pretense of okay qubit is love. Which I find stupid. I will say I think Grindr in general has done a lot to dis-digmatize HIV which is you know I think with something all gay people are thinking about constantly so the fact that there's this breach or this news story it is it does feel like a slap in the face to that kind of progress though. Well is it like a setback particularly for Grindr because it's been positioning itself such as this pro LGBTQ company you know they launched an online magazine called Into which is you know hired a lot of LGBTQ writers you know and it covers not just gay men but you know gay women and trans issues and HIV issues you know so it's really been trying to shift its image from being oh you know this is a place where you know you can find somebody to fuck it Gelsons to oh this is an app that also can inform me about queer people around the world and how we interact with each other and this breach has just sort of made people be like oh that's what the app is for and now I don't trust it. Now I'm thinking about a version of Supermarket Sweep where you have to go into a Gelsons and then find a place to fuck and have nobody find you and you have like two minutes and then you get five thousand dollars and it airs on the PAX network. Hosted by Stacey. That's right yeah. When we're back ABC's reboot of the classic 90s sitcom Roseanne. Roseanne is back on the air and the ratings are massive. They are so good that Donald Trump himself called Roseanne to congratulate her on the ratings because that's all he cares about. How many widows, army widows, do you think haven't received a call from that man and Roseanne got a phone call. There are like shooting victims who have not received like their families from the many mass shootings we've had over the last few months who I guarantee have not received calls from that man and this bitch gets a phone call. I do find him inconsiderate. I do have to say. The wizards are excited. Even some liberals are very excited because they are frothing at the mouth all the time over anything that they can say quote unquote covers both sides of the aisle and that's what people are claiming that the Roseanne reboot does. It is bringing the family back and it's in the present and it's still dealing with being a struggling working class family in America only this time Roseanne is a Trump voter. I think that's why everyone loves it. You know the thing for me just aside from whatever she's saying about Trump and sort of painting the Hillary versus Trump thing in such a reductive simplistic way the thing that makes me most irritated is the fact that it's continuing to enforce the idea that working class white people are one the ones that propelled Trump to the White House and that the average working class person looks like this like by 2032 our working class will be majority minority and so you already like this is not representative really of where the working class population is headed. It's not representative of Trump voters. Trump voters were people you had a lot of highly educated people people with college degrees you had wealthy people like Hillary won a larger percentage of the vote of people making less than $30,000 a year. So again it's this like it's the same just like those dumb New York Times features on like these steel workers and wherever and oh they thought Trump would help him out. It's like that's not who put him in office. Right. Stop living in this like Norman Rockwell portrait but I like a working class person looks like I think you're at this show sort of reemphasizes that this is what real people look like and it's like well that's a mysteriously white representation of reality. Yes. Particularly because ABC has called this their quote unquote heartland strategy and been sure what the president of Disney and ABC's TV group in an interview said that the whole team looked at each other after Trump won and said there's a lot about this country we need to learn more about here on the coasts and then apparently they began asking themselves which audiences they weren't serving well and they decided to go you know for their heartland strategy which means they looked around when Trump won and were like oh we need to appeal to white people more. Right. Who voted to Trump. Also more people voted for Hillary Clinton just like numbers wise more people in this country voted for Hillary Clinton so one is continued idea that you have to like he's the president this is whoever one wanted is just not true and then the other side of it is the fact that there are so many shows about like working class white people are like Kevin James has been on television for like 50 years playing the same person like there are so many sitcoms that appealed to this demographic that have been on the air forever and so the idea that like the heartland doesn't have its content. Like CBS doesn't exist. I fear what this means for our relationship with Jeff Foxworthy which I feel will intensify in those few years but I'm excited for what it means about a relationship with Brett Butler because God I'm sorry. I think ABC started looking around being like our most popular shows are Shonda Rhimes shows and Blackish and Fresh Off The Boat and they were like people were starting to remember us for this you know instead of. Which is horrible. I know right. I think it speaks also to I think people outside of Hollywood or at least there's something I thought before I started working in Hollywood. It's like these are the people creating the culture but Hollywood is so reactive. The people who are making a lot of the decisions you know for as much as we're talking about how diversity and television is growing the people making the decisions really look the same as they've always looked and it's a company you know they're trying to turn a profit so you understand why they would be risk averse but when you're talking about something creative I think we forget how we don't think of risk averse in creativity necessarily is going hand in hand and so with all of these reboots with the Roseanne thing it's like of course that was going to do well and they're not thinking like how do we move the conversation forward you know how do we reimagine the idea of television and the stories that we're telling it's a lot of it is just a bottom line thing and there's just not that kind of concern or vision from the people who get to decide what goes on television. Do you know what I think about with reboots a lot is I think the reason a lot of this stuff is rebooted is people actually just don't like learning new names I think I think when new TV shows new movies come out they are in it feels like homework to have to get into it I think about this a lot weirdly when I was in college I was talking to Cara about this earlier I was an RA and we had movies at the front desk you could rent out. I could not imagine that. It was a scam I did it for the money anyway just know that but at the front desk this girl came up one time and she got a movie and she goes oh I've seen this it was like Sex and the City of the movie or something she's like I've got it I've seen this seven times and I'm like oh interesting she goes yeah I only rent movies I've seen before I was like what that is I was like first of all how I mean let's take that back to the beginning when did you actually start watching new movies then but man people love stuff they're already familiar with that's just the truth of it I think also I just want to say about Roseanne being popular I think she is somebody who since her show went off the air and her talk show went off the air which I thought was kind of good at the time. She didn't talk show. Yeah she was pretty good yeah she was like kind of suited for that right. It was a better version of the Caroline Ray show. There will be no dissing of Caroline Ray here my favorite upper right square on Hollywood squares no but I think people don't realize that Roseanne is a ten on the lunatic fringe spectrum it's like saying oh Andrew Cunan is a little unhinged I mean it's like no there's something so crazy about where she went as in it's a departure from where she was when she was on the show now she's like full P to gate full Islam equals Naziism just things that don't make any sense like 4chan. She's the one who blocked me by the way. Oh she did. She blocked me one a year ago. Well you worked for Jezebel of course. No you know why she blocked me because she tweeted one day like I got hot sauce in my bag and I was like girl please don't you be out here quoting Beyonce like you care about black people or like anything and then she blocked me. No she's the kind of person five years ago. That's fair should we put be in her men's dress? Yeah I deserved it. I mean I get it why do you look and then when you find out that she's a lunatic you're like oh okay. Well that's the thing too that she used to always be sort of a controversial like pushing the edge comedian. Yeah the national anthem singing etc yeah. Yeah where she quote unquote sang I'm saying quote unquote a lot today I don't know what's going on. You're a journalist honey. I'm a girl Friday. She did the national anthem where she was grabbing her crotch and just basically being a bizmo but not as a bizmo as that you know kneeler Colin Kaepernick. That's much less disrespectful to the anthem. She used to be that kind of person but now a lot of people are talking about reboot aside should we even be supporting this show because if we're not going to support the Woody Allen's and the Harvey Weinstein's of the world like should we be supporting someone who pushes pizza gate and is pretending Hillary Clinton you know was running a pedophilia ring. Someone who denigrates feminist and trans people and people who are Islamic basically anyone who is the same person she hates. Right no I think people associate her with someone like this is the first name that came to mind Dennis Miller who became a little bit of a Republican die hard but she is well beyond that like well like personally targeting people again you talked about Twitter she's the kind of person you don't want in your Twitter mentions because she's the people who follow her are super you know obsessively fringy and weird she's unhinged in that way. It makes sense that like Trump called her to congratulate her because he re-tweets like memes of crazy fringe people whenever they post a photo of like CNN getting killed or like someone throwing Hillary Clinton off of a building you know and Roseanne is exactly like that kind of person to him when you watch her Twitter feed just like what she tweets during the day it's lunacy. It will be interesting to see because you know everyone at ABC you know I'm sure they're obviously thrilled with the ratings but you know they know what she's doing is unacceptable and so it will be interesting to see if there is any pullback of you know where they're like you can't keep doing this because she is coming out the gates so hot and insane and you wonder if it's just going to get worse and the show gets more popular and she gets crazier that's actually a problem for ABC so I wonder how I wonder if she's just really feeling herself because you know she's sort of like fuck you to all the haters and the show is doing well and and all of that. Maybe she does have hot sauce in her bag. You know I doubt it but. God I would watch a documentary about all the other cast members in that show texting each other about whether or not they should do it. I don't want to know. Laurie you're telling me Laurie Mackeff and Sarah Gilbert are sitting there like no this is completely normal what has happened to our one time friend Roseanne who again has had some sort of like schism like break since the show. I guess my final thought on this is do we see this 90s nostalgia ending like anytime soon and do we see it veering towards non white shows. Right I I'm not a big I don't really like reboots. I don't like remakes. I don't really love sequels like I've never partly because I feel like it keeps new writers and new voices and new ideas from getting any space in culture. It's just the same people it's you know the writers who came back for Roseanne those weren't like young up and coming fresh voices those were the same people who had been doing this forever but if we're going to keep doing it can we get a living single reboot please. Oh you know I would actually like a crossover here we go are you ready. First of all Jackie from 227 of course Sandra. Well she's the best. Just a little bit of a. You're right. Okay. Jackie Jasmine guy from a different world. We know who Jasmine guy is. And I want and I want a Karen Parsons from the Fresh Pencil Bling. Those three characters should have a show. I want those they they live together. They're all like fifty one characters like they're she's playing Whitley. Yes. Yes. It's Whitley Hillary and Sandra. Okay. This should fill you with. I would take a sister sister reboot. Oh yeah no if that's happening isn't it. Wasn't it allegedly being set up with Tia and Tamara and the secret fourth third and fourth one. I don't I take a smart guy reboot to be honest like just give me give me a little color. I'd even take like reboots of those also rans that were on you. Oh maybe like an Eve reboot. Yes. Oh yes. You were with sparks. Yeah I do. By the way I just heard this on gangsta 11 for the first time in a while yesterday featuring Elisa Keys. That song is good y'all. I think that is a good point to take a break. Now that we've discussed Roseanne and the show's relationship to the modern Trump supporter. We wanted to talk to on a Marie Cox. Host of the podcast with friends like these. With friends like these is back with season two and Anna is kicking things off with a two-part audio doc on CPAC. The conservative political action conference to learn about the future of the conservative movement. So we were just talking about Roseanne on the show and how that relates to the modern Trump supporter and I know that you went to the conservative political action conference this year and I wanted to know did you learn anything about new young conservatives in the Trump era that you were surprised to find out? I don't know how much they reflect the Roseanne demographic except in their Trump support. In order to go to CPAC you have to have some comfort in your life. I don't think it's a thing that while it's cheap for students to do you do have to be at college so there's already some privilege happening right? I don't think these are necessarily working class people. And that's the thing too. We were talking so much about the fact that the show depicts the working class Trump voter and it continues to push that media narrative that this is who voted for Trump and this is who the Republican Party is at large and yet you see the people who as he said had the privilege to go to the CPAC and you look at the people who really are sort of keeping men like Trump in power it tends to not be that heartland. That's right. That we think. Yeah it's not the heartland it's actually like coastal elites and it's rich white people you know. And actually I don't know if you saw but there was this week a Pew released a study that went back and redid the exit polls and re-examine exit polling from 2016 and it turns out that all the exit polls radically underestimated how many working class white people voted for Democrats. Working class white people are actually the largest percentage of the Democratic electorate. It's 33% of Democrats and Democratic leaders are white people with college degrees. That actually out numbers how many of their demographic is people of color without college degrees which is only 28% and it's more than the number of white people with college degrees which is 26%. So you know what working class white people are voting and leaning demographic and I think that that just it's just like people just don't believe that they have this image in their mind that the classic Trump supporter is an ignorant poor white person and it's not. They may be ignorant but they're not poor. Which makes sense because you know the Roseanne reboot was presenting her you know as a Trump supporter I feel like in name only you know she she's otherwise this very progressive liberal person who cares about her health care who cares about her grandson who's gender fluid you know the ideals and everything that's presented in the show are really just someone who's struggling to get by in the middle of America you know which I feel like a lot of people can relate to and I feel like people are overestimating the audience that came in droves to watch it what their political leanings are. Oh I definitely think they are and I also think that it's somewhat insulting to think that someone who's struggling in America as so many people are would necessarily gravitate to Trump and stay there. You know I can understand the narrative that did happen which is there are a lot of working class white people who were frustrated with the way things are rightly so and who maybe stayed home or maybe voted for Trump out of frustration but I think that to think that they are all part of that 35% who's going to be with Trump you know even when he rips off the mask to reveal he's a lizard person I don't know if that's necessarily true. I think this whole Roseanne thing I mean she's obviously for one like just personally crazy right. Yes she is she is super super villain in a Bond movie off her rocker. Yeah pizza gate QAnon all that bullshit. So there's her but let's just bracket that off. I feel like the whole thing that this show presented is actually like this comforting kind of narrative that a lot of liberal media elites have already bought into you know that they want to believe and then basically for ratings you know basically to like hey what if it was a Trump's voter who also loved her gender fluid grants you know does that blow your mind. Right because you then get conservatives who can be like look we're not all awful or you can get conservatives who are upset about that depiction and then you also get liberal people who are like well that's not a Trump supporter to me or people who can be like oh look we're seeing both sides of the aisle you know and I feel like that's just what this whole media narrative has been since the election you know the New York Times is writing these heartland stories I feel like not because anyone actually believes it you know they're writing it because they know that hate shares are still shares. I mean I think it's definitely like sort of just liberal media elite bait which everyone has taken. The Roseanne show was almost designed in a lab to be catnip for trend stories and for media elites to talk about and for people to you know buzz about at the water cooler even though I'm not sure how well it reflects real life and meanwhile like there are this like crop of shows about people of color that are gaining traction and that have real critical things to say and also are just interesting shows that we haven't seen before you know shows like Atlanta and I wonder why we're not talking more about that especially since like that's the audience and that's the section of America that's like growing and that is going to be more and more powerful as you know the decades roll on and going to be more and more part of popular culture whereas Roseanne is literally a throwback. Yeah and you know it's also the idea that the politics that are presented in Roseanne aren't really that wild and you know pushing the envelope as people think they are because if ABC was really interested in doing that they would have aired the blackish episode that had a debate on you know kneeling during the anthem you know they're not really interested in sparking political conversation in America they're interested in those nostalgia views. Right in a weird way I feel like Roseanne is the equivalent of the Atlantic hiring Kevin Williamson. Like I know that Kevin Williamson is like a highbrow theater critic who hates Trump's season ways like he's like the mirror image Roseanne but it's the same like kind of like craving you know push for publicity and also fake ideological diversity right like real ideological diversity would be things like having that blackish episode on kneeling like real ideological you know diversity would be having more democratic socialist columnists you know in mainstream newspapers because that's also a segment of the population that's growing. Roseanne again I can't get over how it's like not just a throwback and it's a reboot but like that way of looking at American politics is a throwback. You know the lenses that are used on that show are not the lenses that most people are using anymore. I want to thank you so much for stopping on the show. Well thank you for having me any any time my friend anytime. That was Onamari Cox host of What Friends Like These her show comes out every Friday and she currently has a two-part series on the conservative political action conference. And there are some great interviews from past episodes you should check out like her combo with former white supremacist Christian Piccolini an interview with Ijiyama Oluo about her book so you want to talk about race and obviously the episodes I'm on. We'll be right back with Keep It. And now it's time for our favorite segment of the week. Keep it. I'm gonna start with Louis for once this week. Okay this is strange. There's going to be an Elton John Grammy tribute concert coming up since he's retiring. Obviously Lady Gaga is performing your song because there's not a year in human history where she doesn't cover that so she'll be doing that. I was told that Lady Gaga was covering your song by a friend by the way and I thought he met she was covering the Rita Orison called your song and you wept. I was very disappointed when I found out it was the Elton John song. Right. I feel like she's sung it 70 times already. No I think most of the time she's just speaking the lyrics to your song at this point but I've seen snippets from this concert coming up and there's a mysterious duet between Sean Mendez and SZA on an old jam called Don't Go Break in My Heart. Let me say something about Sean Mendez who gets a lot of credit in the gay community for being adorbs. He has both kind of an effeminate voice and a gritty voice so that like questioning teens and adults who are sure are both into him. So he's got a lot of credit. This is a truly gay song and in the snippet I saw he sort of does his like giggly kind of perky singing. It is not gay enough. If you're going to cover this song you got to be Brady Bunch, Level Amped, Perky, Cokey basically and so I'm not interested in this laid back 19 year old teen version. Next time you do this you little tongue depressor with biceps. I want some homo ass action on those tracks. Have you listened to that song recently in the car? Your legs will be on the ceiling. It's a jam everybody. SZA looks great. Wow that was a local reporter from Select Magazine who popped in from 1996 with their music critiques. Subscribe to my zine. Cara. Oh man. I have never started with Lewis. Right exactly. So my keep it this week is Kathy Griffin who sort of fell off for a minute when she did that insane Donald Trump severed head thing and she's back. She's going on tour. This bitch sold out Carnegie Hall in like a day yet she is still in interviews going on. She's like I hope no one has to go through the nightmare that I went through when you know everyone got mad at me over that and I had completely forgotten that happened. Clearly your career you bounced back mostly and like nobody who had like basic media literacy believed that like Baron thought that his dad had been beheaded. Like that was obviously a lie. No one's saying really gave a shit about that story and I wish she would just stop acting like a victim and just shut up and go on tour girl take your money. You're fine. It was wildly misreported that her career was over that made no sense at the time. I will say to be fair she released like a video that made it seem like Isis was holding her captive. All right. Mind you the Trump whatever that she was investigated by the Department of Justice or whatever. I'm sure that was a little zany. But you get that if you tweeted a death threat at the president you get and like it's not to say that I tweeted a joke about the press secretary and the White House tried to get me fired. So it happens. The idea that she was in any serious danger from that is not true. You're doing fine. Shut up. People only remember because you keep running your mouth about it. Nobody remembers this. We've had girl have you been paying attention? Every day is a crisis. Every day is something insane. We don't remember your weird bad prank a year ago. Kathy Griffin's like that. Like some character from season one of scandal popping up now before the finale being like I've got a grievance with you Olivia Pope and it's like you know what this bitch has been kidnapped. She has run B613. She does not have time for this girl whose husband cheated on her and tried to frame her for murderous I think from season one. Get over it. Kathy is like a Madonna level business lady. I mean like she pulls in that coin. She's fine. Kathy like you're fine but also a Madonna level harping on things when we're all ready to move on. We're done. Keep it. Bye. Go make out with Drake. Go make your money. My keep it this week involves America's favorite news anchor Laura Ingraham. Oh I love news and getting it from her right host of the Ingraham angle which I don't know what that almost upon it kind of a stray person definitely thought of it. It seems like it should make sense but the Ingraham goal anyway she is crazed and usually pushing like bigoted rhetoric on her show but lately she decided to run afoul of the parkland survivors as all of the conservatives are sort of dancing with on Fox News like they've all branded like David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez as enemies of the state. Well after all they are traumatized survivors of a shooting so they're clearly out together but they're all toeing the line on how much they can sort of go after teenagers who aren't quite 18 yet you know David Hogg is not a boy not yet a man but recently David was talking about the fact that he did not get into some of the colleges that he wanted to specifically didn't get into UCLA even with like a 4.1. Traffic is terrible don't worry about it. You know ignoring the fact that like he applied before all of this happened and I'm sure UCLA saw that tweet and was like oh no please come in. Laura decided to jump up the fucking window and tweet making fun of him for not getting into the colleges that he wanted to so you're already deciding to harass survivors of gun violence now you want to make fun of him for not getting into college and to David's credit he responded simply by listing every advertiser on her show and being like what's up yeah children of the corn you're going to the cornfield honey bye bye advertiser started bailing her show swiftly it was like the Titanic these teens are savages they are coming for adults and ruining their entire lives in one sentence tweets I mean like I was never I don't really interact with a lot of teenagers anyway I wasn't planning on like messing with a teenager but I will never I'm afraid to talk to them because these kids are brutal I'm afraid of teenagers in general drag the shit out of you buck up your career like these get from their couch while eating their talkies right like they are just so my official keep it is the fact that people like Brian seltzer water are going on CNN and being like is it going a step too far to get advertisers to boycott a TV journalist over their opinions and wondering what sort of dangerous president this could set and I find this all to be fucking nonsense but we should all politely let her thrive also you know what a free market it like advertisers can decide who they want to advertise with and people can bring things to their attention as they do all the time people are tweeting at companies all the time and they decide what they care about what they want to support like that's just how it works maybe you should just be better first of all trumps and forters like fake boycott things every other week and nobody complains about them doing that trump basically tweets at people not to support things they try and get liberal journalists like fired all the time just for like innocuous tweets so it's wild that all of a sudden we care about this just you know because one of these if they're they're all like oh my god when am I gonna say something stupid and maybe bigoted and like a harassed child just just oohla from the producers you know decided to set David Hogg and her advertisers have had enough you know and what's great is that I remember when jamael hill was talking about how you could take on esp and the nfl and the way to do it is through advertisers you got to fuck up with people's checks you know and I think that people are always being like what's the right way to protest you know can we protest by getting rid of people's ads and I think this is exactly the right way to protest the reason that fox news and these people who don't even classify themselves as journalists they're just like opinion commentators get to spew hatred and bigotry every week is because people give them money through advertising and keep them on the air and when you flip the script on them like this this is how you beat people like that I mean you got people coming out who don't even advertise with her saying that I ain't got nothing to do with her I mean you know you know we saw with things like bus boycotts that that just doesn't work that doesn't change history like what are you talking about can I do a slight keep it to uh the left side of this equation which is I hate Laura hate I have always I'm a little sick of seeing that gift of her allegedly giving a Nazi salute at the RNC or whatever no she's not she's just a creepy person waving just let that let that go she's not used to human interactions waving is new to her okay it looks a little not to you fair see both sides I did it joining me now is comedian and host of the LGBTQ podcast query Cameron Esposito I am here with Cameron Esposito comedian and host of a new podcast called query yeah I returned the podcast well yeah it's still pretty new it came out this summer okay but we had to go on hiatus for a little bit because our then our old network had a change in ownership and and etc so now we're relaunching on an earwolf but the show is called query and you should be getting an invitation I did get an invite to be on it but it's a 60 minute conversation between queer folks so like I'm hosting it and I'm talking to a person but it's not really an interview in the way that I come in with like a bunch of questions that I'm trying to hit about that person's current projects it's much more like I think for queer folks we are so often interviewed or put in a context in the media against straight folks so it's like I think there's absolutely a place for Terry Gross to ask questions of Lena Waith about what butch identity is like I think that's fine we do need that but I I also think that we've never had the opportunity to get beyond that where it's like in a conversation where I might know some of the words that you're talking about and so we're getting to like the next level of questions like for instance that are coming out stories aren't what we're constantly being framed by of course yeah no I get that you know it's interesting when you always see interviews with for celebrity is out you know the conversation still revolves around you know like how are you dealing with being gay in 2018 and it's always the sort of I don't know I'm dealing with it I dealt with it in 2017 I find that sometimes even that question is missing and that a lot of times it's what's your coming out story and then like the next question will be how did your parents take it which is a very interesting you know if you think about it that immediately puts queerness as somebody else's experience so it's like your parents experience of your queerness is what I'm asking you about not you I'm not asking you about you and again I think those are good conversations to have but it's never framed the other way where it's like when you came out what was that experience like for you what had you been sitting on that you weren't telling people how much relief did you feel you know like those questions framing it yeah with our stories first you know that's sort of why I feel like call me by your name came and went this year without much fanfare just because I feel like there was so much fanfare in the beginning I just had a in the beginning I feel like there was okay no tell me yes just because I feel like the film is one of the first gay films that sort of it's a coming out story for him but you know it's not really framed in how his parents react to it at all you don't even hear what his death thinks until the end of the movie you know it's really just sort of about his experience and I feel like so many gay films or TV shows are about writing around the gay person you know like how people react to it yeah like do you mean you think it's it was like almost too gay yeah for it to stay yeah well that and like the film Carol you know you know like Carol she was just she was living her life basically and there wasn't a huge focus on coming out to other people we jumped right into her already being a lesbian Carol is one of my favorite movies of all time what I what I also love about those movies that you're talking about Carol is also made there are queer people involved in the creation of that so not just is the book the source material the price of salt written by Patricia Highsmith who is living that life in that time when that story takes place but also Phyllis Naege who wrote the screenplay is gay and also Todd Haynes who directed it is gay so it's when we're involved in our stories full stop they tend to be more complex and more yeah and more centered on us so then yeah again that's the reason that I was like well I don't really see this in the podcast space like I don't see uh like the equivalent of WTF with Mark Marin yeah but this is a conversation between queer folks and we and I had some amazing folks on like Tegan and Sarah were on separately separate episodes and Evan Rachel Wood was on they put on keep it yeah they're great and who else you'll sell away and just great people having real long chats about identity because it makes it a little less I guess voyeuristic yeah there's that sort of quality to interviews or to other films that aren't made I guess by queer people because it feels like they're trying to find a way in and they're peering in so I guess it doesn't feel as authentic I think that's real and then I also think that when it's somebody outside of the community making something like the issues that they want to talk about for instance parental reaction which is a part of our lives but isn't thus like soul burning desire of my yeah of my existence on earth um is to be accepted my grandparents like that's not really yet it's more to find love and think of that to be my own person I also think that when we look at how like a straight person would frame us for instance it's like our fights are about like bathroom laws and our fights are about like the church or something like that and I think in our community it's like there's so much interesting stuff going on because the gay civil rights movement happens so fast yeah that there are these micro generations where like I don't know how old you are 31 31 so I'm 36 so we are like three gay generations apart yeah even though we are five human years apart we're like all of the because if for instance the year that I graduated college the same week that I graduated college Massachusetts where I lived at the time became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage so I graduated from college that week I could get married and being an adult like entering into adulthood which is what college graduation sort of signifies I was able to enter into adulthood as somebody who could get married if I was a year older than I am that would not have been true like I would have entered adulthood as somebody who couldn't legally get married and so we have all of these different identities going on in our community like let alone what's happening for folks based on race or where they fall in terms of the spectrum of gender or all the other things like it is so fascinating because our community doesn't use the same words to describe ourselves like we don't there are no universally accepted terms there are no universally accepted pronouns sometimes we're talking about sexuality sometimes we're talking about gender sometimes we're talking about sex all of this is going on within the community and if you're not somebody who's in the community you might think it's like what we care about the most is you know whether or not Donald Trump is holding our flag and like that's not what we care about like what we care about is like hey can we agree on like some words so at least we can have a conversation like what words do you use what words do I use like it's such an interesting time in our community and I feel like those words are still what bumps some people you know because a few weeks ago there was that W Magazine interview with Lee Pace who was asked about being in Angels in America he was going at length about how gay actors should play gay roles and like he loves like the state of like what we're in now and he told interviewer Brian Moylan you know that he's dated men and he's dated women but he still found the concept of being asked if he was gay intrusive in the interview wow that's what he said you know which is which was very weird to establish that you I mean but there are million different ways to describe someone who sleeps with men and women besides just by I guess yeah but it's weird you know I think that we need to be having these conversations about language I don't know absolutely well I mean it's still have yeah there are people who use different terms than I do and so I'm always like I don't know how do you describe yourself just say gay you know sometimes when I write I use the word queer just because I feel like that's become the new way that like you know like as an internet writer like writing about projects you know just to sort of encompass everyone I absolutely agree with you I mean I still use the words gay and I use the word lesbian to describe myself but I think that queer is more useful like for instance somewhere on Twitter yeah and then I also use queer woman a lot but then it's like my understanding of what a woman is evolving so we're just living in this very shifty time and that's really interesting and rad and you know who else could like benefit from hearing these conversations are people that think of themselves as like very structurally straight very cisgender like folks who have like these strict boundaries around their words and around how they identify those are the folks that like their identity is shattered if they find somebody of the same sex attractive as opposed to like if we can all be a little bit more malleable then we don't have to be so afraid when our words don't seem to be true in this moment like if I'm I say I'm like this hardcore lesbian but it's not like I don't understand that men are attractive and also like there are trans people so like what it used to mean to be a lesbian like the agreed upon definition of what that meant in terms of like the type of body that you were attracted to like that's very different now yeah so it's a really interesting time and I love talking about it and I think like I said if we're not included in the conversation it just gets really simplified and really like solidified and what I love is the expansiveness of it because I think it frees all of us to have better lives camera and tell the keep it listeners how to find your show yeah listen to it query is available wherever you get your podcasts so like apple podcast it's also
