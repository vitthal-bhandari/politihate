Welcome to The Interesting, where we break down the viral and very interesting news you might have missed. I'm V Spier, and today, oh no in Ohio, a trained derailment has caused the release of toxic chemicals into the air and water. We're going to talk about what citizen scientists can do to help. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a UFO? Yes, space junk and spycraft is everywhere. Should we shoot it down or let ET phone home? And then we'll check in with my pal Mercury Stardust, the trans handyman who will answer the age old question, are flushable wipes actually flushable? All that more on today's V interesting from Lemonata Media. Let's be smart together. Two weeks ago today, a cargo train derailed near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The train was carrying toxic combustible chemicals, and about a third of the cars ran off the tracks as it passed through East Palestine, Ohio. The train was folded up like an accordion. It was terrible. The cars went up in flames. The sky was filled with a thick dark smoke. If this sounds like a scene out of a dystopian movie, it is. Last year, Netflix released white noise starring Adam Driver, and the similarities between this crash and the trained derailment in the film is eerie. With an accident like this, there's that immediate visible damage. There's the crash, the sounds, the scary sights. The trauma is immediate for folks in the area. And then, right after that, comes damage control. The governor of Ohio ordered everyone within a mile of the crash to evacuate so they could escape the toxic gas, followed by emergency workers manually releasing that toxic gas into the air via explosion. Yes, guys, they released toxic chemicals into the air via explosion. So, controlled or not, you don't have to be a climate geek to know this is probably going to cause some long-term issues. Now, these accidents have long-term effects, and I hesitate to even call this an accident since whistleblowers at the rail union have been screaming something like this could happen on a kind of deregulation of the rail industry during the Trump era. And this particular region of the US is no stranger to disaster. There have been many past contamination events in the Mid-Atlantic, and they came to light because people and animals kept getting sick. Think about the increase of miscarriages in love canal New York, where a community was built on top of a waste site, or all the dying livestock near the DuPont chemical factory in West Virginia. There were also all the pipes and dishwashers that corroded in homes along the New York, Canada border, which turned out to be due to road salt runoff. And just a few years ago, residents in Buffalo were noticing lots of health issues, and eventually traced it to emissions from the nearby Tanoanda Coke factory. After this recent train crash in Ohio, residents are already worried about the potential long-term effect on their health. Nobody is coming to save us is another podcast from Lemonade Yes, but it's also true. The rail companies that created this mess aren't going to be the ones to somehow grow a conscience and apologize and make everything rainbows again. We know that because they offered the town of East Palestine 25,000 total dollars in damages. That's just five bucks a person. So we're going to have to save ourselves. Fortunately, we can look to the responses that other communities took when they faced similar danger. You got to stay vigilant, and you have to keep records. You get to be a citizen scientist. Pay attention to your surroundings, test your environment using low-cost at-home kits, and talk to your neighbors. A researcher in New York who helped bring attention to the harm of the Tanoanda Coke factory is on TikTok giving advice about how to do similar work in Ohio. She even set up a database for test results and laid out instructions for how to use them properly. And we will link to all of that in the show notes, of course. Please share this with anyone you know within 100 miles of the most recent East Palestine crash site. If and when it comes time to hold a company accountable for contamination and its effects, it will involve higher-ups like the EPA and law enforcement. By keeping records now, you can help other people down the line. And I know this next part's going to be hard, but I promise it's in your best interest. Residents need to avoid accepting any potential settlements or cash offers from the company responsible for contamination. Connecting with legal help or class action cases can put you in a better position as a community. You are not alone in this. And be sure to also heed the advice of safety officials in the meantime. If you're within several miles of the crash site, keep tabs on statements that the EPA is releasing. They found that chemicals were detected in half a dozen bodies of water in the area, and they are continuing to test locally and using vacuum trucks to clean up spills. They're also overseeing residential air screenings that the rail company is conducting in people's homes. But I would keep my own record as well. Their records are good. Your records are maybe better. Many people want more answers, and I totally get it. They want more frequent and nuanced updates. They want to know how much risk they'll face if they return home, and if they keep living their lives the way they were before this happened to them. Those answers just don't exist yet. But people are taking cues from what's worked in the past to look out for themselves and for their neighbors, and we'll be right here trying to help you along the way as well. Father South in the US were seeing a different kind of public health problem. According to recently released numbers, babies in Mississippi are contracting syphilis at nine times the rate they were in 2016. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection or an STI, and it's treatable. But when not treated, there is an 80% chance it will be passed during fetal development or during the childbirth process. Potential outcomes for that child are organ damage, vision loss, and impaired hearing. In rare cases, it could even be fatal. And Mississippi already has the highest rate of infant mortality in the country. The fact that this is happening way more than it used to points to several problems. One is awareness. How can you be treated for an STI if you don't even know you have one? Many people might not think they need to get tested, so they likely also don't know that they can get medicine for many of the possible outcomes. The CDC recommends getting tested for syphilis early in your pregnancy. It's just a quick blood draw, and if you happen to test positive, don't worry. Treatment is as simple as taking some penicillin. And as long as you start taking the medicine at least a month before giving birth, you'll see the benefits for your child. Plus, penicillin can be administered for babies who do contract syphilis at birth. It requires a hospital stay, but it is proven to be effective if administered within the first three months. There's also likely an under awareness of infections like syphilis, but we don't victim blame here, okay? We educate and we inform, and there is definitely another issue at play here beyond people not having the facts about STIs. Okay, so that's what you can do preventatively, but what if you don't have access to a doctor? In Mississippi, there are entire counties without an obstetrician. No OBGYN whatsoever, which means patients have to travel for their appointments, if that's even possible for them. Lost income, lack of transportation, and child care costs can make it impossible for many folks. In 2016, the state health agency announced it was closing nine of its county health departments, and that's also when these congenital syphilis cases started ticking up. In places where care is available, sometimes insurance coverage is the obstacle. Specifically, using Medicaid in Mississippi can create delays. In 2022, many pregnant patients on Medicaid had to wait about a month just to get approved for their first prenatal visit. We've got a structural problem here, friends, a big one. Fortunately, doctors think this is solvable as long as the resources can be directed to the people who need them. Already, over 60 state organizations support things like an increased tobacco tax that could fund and expand Medicaid. And if you think about it, we all need resources like tests and checkups, but many of us use them every day without even taking a second thought. So we don't notice them because they're always there. We have these clear solutions and tools, and if we're serious about changing things, we have the ability to put them into other people's hands as well. Like I said before, we cannot leave anyone behind. Hey, what was that up there? It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's the increasing number of unidentified flying objects, and they are getting a ton of attention recently. Throughout history, the US has had its fair share of alien fever. In the late 1940s, a pilot reported a flying saucer sighting. And ever since then, people across the country have followed suit. In fact, just in 2022, the Pentagon got hundreds of new reports of UFOs. But you know, we are here to be smart together. So let's clear up some of the misconceptions about UFOs and aliens. Now think back to when all this alien talk started. It was the 1940s. And what was going on then? There was post-war paranoia. There was political propaganda. There wasn't widespread access to information. Military and surveillance technology was just ramping up. And just a decade later, Russia launched its Sputnik satellite. And that freaked people out, man. So what did the folks in charge of our safety and security do? Well, we put more stuff in the sky, of course, and we have continued to put stuff in the sky, lots of stuff, including balloons, spy crafts, and yes, many of them are ours. Most of them are ours. The air has become an increasingly busy place. So it shouldn't surprise you that China sent a device over to our side of the woods. Countries have been doing this kind of stuff for decades, including the US. We do it all the time. And the US government has actually been tracking UFOs for years. Just for these relatively boring domestic security reasons, mostly. We've had some form of surveillance for potential aerospace hazards since at least 2007. And officials even started referring to UFOs by a different name. The new official term is UAP, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. It might seem like there's been a huge surge in UAPs these past few weeks, but it's just because the US scanners have been purposely tuning out things like balloons. Like I said, there are tons of things flying around in the skies. And if an alert went off for every single one of them, surveillance officers would get fatigued. And they might miss some of the more serious stuff, like, you know, missiles and airplanes. Officials are cagey about who saw this Chinese spy balloon first, like if it was a civilian on the ground or if it was on their official radar. But what we do know is that the North American Aerospace Defense Command pretty recently adjusted their filters. They found several more UAPs, including some more balloons, and have already shot them down. So broadly speaking, our government hasn't been spending all this time and their resources to try and see if the truth is out there. People will absolutely keep wondering about aliens. And I really can't blame anyone for that. I like wondering about aliens and for what it's worth an unidentified aerial phenomenon technically could be an alien. It's unidentified until it's not right. It's innocent until proven guilty, and I am ready for the aliens. But for now, that's what our federal defense has been up to, looking for missiles and changing their stance on how important balloons are. You know what I've been looking for? And maybe you guys have been feeling this too. I need some good news. And since there's been so much bad, bad awful news and anti-trans legislation running around rampant recently, I'm specifically looking for good news for the LGBTQ plus community. So that is what we're going to do next. We are going to find some queer joy. Let's start abroad in Finland. And this story does start out bad as many trans stories do, but it does get better. So there was this archaic and terrible provision that said in order for anyone to transition, they had to prove via medical certificate that they were infertile. Now, we weren't able to find out if these folks had to like get sterilized first, or if the government would only allow infertile people to transition. But regardless, this is horrific. The Finnish government by law was mandating transgender people were only valid if they would not produce children. The good news here is they took that back. That law is gone. It is over now. Transgender Finns who are 18 and older will also be able to legally change their gender without any taxing medical or psychiatric evaluations, which is really good news. I wish we had that here. What's even cooler is that these changes started with a citizen petition, and that petition got enough signatures to move to Parliament and the legislation passed by a large majority. So that rocks, that's good news. Over here in the US, we've still got some major legislative work to do. States are trying to outlaw drag shows and what they call gender impersonators. It's super gross and unfair. And you know, I think anyone should get to wear a suit if they want to. It's just your clothes, man. There are states right now that I can't go to because I wear a suit. Anyway, I'm specifically heartened by all the trans beauty and success that we've seen these past few weeks. For one, everyone's favorite TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney got to go to the Grammy Awards and she got to meet trans icon Laverne Cox. And I'm not bitter at all. I'm very happy for her, a little jealous, but still happy. And we also just had Fashion Week and the Runways featured transgender models like Erin Rose Philip. And a few weeks back, my girl Taylor Swift debuted her music video for Lavender Hayes. And she acted opposite Laith Ashley. Laith is a super handsome, very cool, super talented, trans creative. And he's done it all activism, acting, modeling. And now he's gained the coveted title of romantic interest in the T Swift cinematic universe. These are incredible people. These are wins. And this is just a few of the great trans people out there doing incredible things, living their lives, being peaceful and joyful and like, I don't know, living! Let us live! And while we keep fighting for the hard stuff, we're going to make sure that we have some fun along the way, all right? And you know who else makes difficult jobs really fun? My next guest. You know her as the trans handyman on TikTok. And yes, it is Mercury's star dust. We'll have her right after the break. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Boller, and you might know me from another Lemonade on Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved non-invasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool.

Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your healthcare provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of cola rectal cancer.

But today we are here with another TikTok pal. Miss Mercury Stardust, the trans handyman. She's got over two million followers, has been featured on NPR, Buzzfeed, and NBC for her helpful hints around the house and now she's here to talk shop and sequence with us. All right, so here with me today is TikTok Superstar and one of my favorite people on the planet. Miss Mercury Stardust. How are you, Mercury? I'm doing so good. I like that you like me because you're one of my favorite people on the whole planet. I feel like we started like around the same time, like during pandemic time, we were like, okay, let's do TikToks. Yeah, when would you say was your TikTok birthday? So it was March like 20th was the first time I made a TikTok and it was when I was still doing cooking content. But the first time that I did an under the desk was January 6th. Oh, because I was trying to explain the 25th amendment, what was going on in the capital, all this kind of stuff. And so I thought it was just kind of like a one off thing. And then people liked it and they were like, you better get back under that desk. Oh my God. I remember your videos popping up from that. Oh, wow. Because also just about two months later, I made my first TikTok. Yes. And I started blowing up. I remember we were like almost neck to neck and like following count and like blowing. We were like blowing up. I remember thinking like, yeah, the queers are taking over TikTok. Yes. It was so many of us who just skyrocketing at the same time. I have a TikTok question for you. Do you feel like you're ancient now that you've been on TikTok for like two years? I do and I don't. Sometimes I look back and I think about what was trending when I was first getting popular. And I feel like I was swimming so upstream against a lot of dance content, lip syncing. It was a much lighter time, I think, in online content creation. It was a really fun time. It was incredibly entertaining time. And then you'd catch like one of your videos about how to fix something or how to approach your landlord over rent or you'd catch mine about the news. And now I feel like TikTok has become very saturated in the education or even like pseudo education space. And we're not seeing all this like lightness that we used to. I love that you brought that up because that is such a real thing. My content has shifted a lot in a sense where now I don't make as many like fun. I'm just in my bedroom talking to you about random stuff videos anymore because they don't. No one sees them. But my genuineness has never shifted. That has always been true. Right? Even I do, you know, stuff about flushable wipes and stuff. Then all of a sudden I will see five videos on my for you page the next day that are all about flushable wipes. And it's like they're using the same things that I was saying. And there's nothing innately wrong with that. But then you'll see someone who is a cisgender white man do it and they go viral. Right? And it does hurt a little bit because like I'm happy this information gets out. I'm just happy it gets out. Right? But it tends to be really difficult when we're marginalized creators and only certain people will watch my content and not talk about my gender. You know, it means exactly. My gender becomes the biggest point of conversation in almost every TikTok I do. It doesn't, if I go viral on any platform, people will spend more time talking about what's in my pants than what's talking about drywall in your wall. Right? I had to start telling them to not do that. I was like, I just at some point, being gay is just a part of who I am. And if it's not relevant to why I'm on your show or why you're writing an article about me or why you follow me for content, then you don't have to say non binary queer newscaster v sphere. You could just say V right? You could just say under the desk news. People know what that is. You know, we don't have to go through the whole list of things. I think the irony for me is that my tagline like my name on TikTok is the trans handyman. There's like an irony to it. And the reason why is because when I first started V, I didn't think anyone was going to see me as trans. I still had dysphoria over my voice and my face. So when I first started, I thought I was just going to be viewed as a man. So I took on the trans handyman to let people know that I was a trans person and not to be a dickhead to me. And now it's shifting now. There's no I still love it. But being a representation that other people need is really important. But now that I'm like farther down in my transition and I feel very differently about my body and my life, it's like I have a very different opinion on it. It's why I don't see him the trans handyman as much. I'm still the trans handyman. You know, like I have no problems with that. But I don't lead like I used to with that because like, yeah, it's who I am. But also like at the same time, I'm not as so conscious about my identity anymore. But the new on some transitions and a new on some gender identity is lost on people on a 30 second or 40 second video on TikTok, you know, do you ever feel like when you're starting a video or when you're introducing yourself for an interview, I have this period of time where I like hold my breath while I know I'm going to have to like justify my existence before we're going to get to the topic where it's like, okay, I know the first minute and a half of this interview is going to be. So tell me you're coming out story and I'm like, name me one other industry in the world where the first question we asked somebody is about potentially the most traumatic and difficult complicated moment of their life before they're going to ask me why I think the news is trying to 100%. Do you feel that way? Do you feel like you have to justify yourself every time you're starting a video? Oh my God. Yeah. So sometimes when I do a video and I know it's going to go viral, you know that feeling of like you're like, I don't know if this is going to be the one, but it's definitely going to do well. And in the back of your head, you're like, what can I do to not make it do well? What can I do? What can I do to stifle it a little bit? Can I make it a little bit longer? Can I like just prevent it from getting pushed out onto for you page just a little bit? Because like there is a reality of like the farther I am pushed out, the more I'm going to have to deal with people saying things like, Oh my God, are you a boy or a girl? Or Oh my God, totally thought you were a girl for a second or Oh my God, jump scare. The jump scare stuff I think gets me the most because like I think the implications of a trans woman being a predator is already hard in my mind all the time, especially with all of the anti-trans law bills have been passed and almost passed in the last two years. It's just like really hard for me on a daily basis to be subjected to that. And I don't know, like I think you would know another another queer person completely gets what I mean when I say that like, I love what I do and I'm thankful for what I do. But every day I'm opening up a wound of trauma for other people's enjoyment. And some days I am very reluctant to do the job that a lot of people probably would consider very easy compared to their jobs. So we've been talking a little bit about where you're at in your journey now as far as a content creator, but I want to kind of like take it all the way back to the beginning. You grew up in a farm in Wisconsin. Is this where you started to get interested in the handyman work? Yeah, I kind of had to, right? I so my we had a family farm and I had two big brothers and my dad was really hell bent that I would be like them. They were like 10 and 12 years older than me. So by the time that I got into the picture into their lives, they were like already pretty masculine and basketball players and football players. And this is what we do. And my family was well known for sports and really well known for like farming and stuff like that. So we would get up at four o'clock in the morning and milk the cows and then go to the on the school bus and then come home and milk the cows and then maybe we would play in the back field and then we'll milk the cows again. So it was very much like this environment was very much work, work, work, work, work, work, work, you might be able to play for an hour of the day, but you better be taking care of it. So really early on in my life before any of the how to stuff came in and the maintenance stuff came in, what came in was this work mentality over self preservation. Like if I it didn't matter what my needs were, the needs of others and the needs of the farm were far more superior than my emotional needs or my needs for you know just wanting to be around people and connecting with people. Was it difficult to find a place for yourself outside of that work? Because I mean it's just you and the cow in your thoughts. I mean I always really enjoyed animals a lot but I don't think for me I really understood myself for a long time. You know like I don't know I always knew what was different. I knew it was different really early on but I don't think I had terms. I mean when I was in high school I had like two other really close friends. One would probably be deemed a trans mass person now but we didn't have a terminology back then and another person was a gay man who was like very closeted. So like the three of us were fairly close but like there wasn't any open like GSA or anything when I was a kid. I wanted to start one but my vice principal of my high school told me why would you want to rock the boat? There's not not many gay kids here. Do you know what I mean? In a school of like 500 people, 400 people, why do you want to rock the boat? And in retrospect after we graduated and 10 years later so many of us were queer. So many of us were non-binary and trans but we didn't have the terminology we weren't allowed to congregate in a way that would have worked best for us. We weren't allowed to just like live proudly. You know one of my teachers was a lesbian but she wasn't allowed to wear anything rainbow related. Even back then this was like 2007-2008. So I think that like conversation sometimes we make it feel like it's like oh my god I feel like we walked five steps backwards when we walked one step forward. In reality it's always been prevalent but now with social media and TikTok and other platforms we really there's no way to hide this anymore. Like I think that like trains people and non-binary people and queer people are front and center but so is the bigotry already attached to those systems and those people. Like it's there, it's prevalent, it's hard to evade it you know.

Listen to the Defenders on November 8th wherever you get your podcasts. Being a woman working in a male-dominated field I hate when people say male-dominated field because I'm like it's really more male-prioritized fields historically that's what it's been. I used to feel this way when I was the director of women's leadership at the James Beard Foundation we worked in the culinary industry and they'd be like well it's so hard for females in a male-dominated industry and I'm like it's not dominated. All these recipes are their mothers and their grandmothers but it is male-prioritized and you're in that industry as a woman now a place where you know it's called a handyman typically or we're going to call the painter guys like what has that been like for you throughout the journey? I mean you kind of got to experience it as a as a closeted trans person prior to coming out so maybe start me as a closeted trans person in this male ecosphere. What kind of stuff were you hearing? Oh wow that boy you're nailing it right in the head and it's killing me. So I started in maintenance I think like 2007 so I was like 20 years old or something at the time and I really was in a field where it was a boys club I mean there was literally talking my maintenance department there was about seven of us at the time and one time we were going to hire someone on but she was a girl and I remember hearing from the other people who worked with me that like oh I mean it would just change our culture it would just like be different you know what I mean like yeah I know I'm cool with her but like you know it would be hard and then when I would be like yeah well our lead custodian is you know she's a woman her name is MJ she's like 30 years older than all of us we all love her why is that different and then she would say yeah but I grew up with a whole bunch of brothers so like that's way I mean it's just different it's different do you know what I mean like this sense of like any... yeah proving they could assimilate to the male culture. Yes every single time like there was always a way to justify why there was a woman allowed in male spaces all the time so I internalized a lot of that right so like I was I was performing in gay bars traveling around the country as a burlesque dancer and as a drag performer for years I mean I was international I was getting awards but none of that would ever work into its maintenance world I kept those. You didn't tell them. No way are you kidding me it was fucking terrified I was like terrified that they would find out that I was performing you know in a gay bar it wasn't even it wasn't even like I was wearing makeup I was afraid of that too but I was petrified they would find out that I was in a gay bar. What was so scary about the gay bar part of it? Because I knew what they were talking about you know like they they flew they threw around slurs and they threw around ideology that was so negative and pervasive and to the point where it was like like you couldn't talk about anything progressive or they'll be deeming the weak one in the group but I worked there for 10 years and for 10 years of my life I was so scared every single day they would find out and then because I started getting more in national awards as a pearlesque tanser and I started flying out to Vegas and flying out to Hollywood in Atlanta where now it's like well it's kind of hard not to talk about this part of my life and there's articles being written about me as a performer and you know people are kind of talking about it like hey you know why is Mercury we have glitter you know what I mean? Like hey you know what I mean like look I was just at the club last night fella's dirty where this glitter came from 100% but then I was started coming to work with that's when I got my blue pompadour hair yeah that's when I changed the pompadour haircut is a key to your transitional experience it was 100% yeah because once you the pompadour comes next and then you start coming on as an unbiased and then you say that you're something else there is a rock ability to trans pipeline I would say that is something that's a hot take that I'm here for I'm here for that one yep but yeah I really I started wearing nail polish to work I my hair was dyed blue but again I was comfortable with being the quirky guy but even then I had to be the smartest one in the room to even get a word in edgewise because I was already deemed effeminate I was already deemed like weak or emotional so like even that maybe before I was out as who I really am right I was still struggling to be viewed okay so I went out and got a whole bunch of certifications I got like 14 certifications I had the most certifications in my entire department I got really good at a lot of different things I think I specialized in mudding more than anyone there and same with my paint my painting skills I've got really good at everything to a point where it was really hard to deny that I wasn't capable right I may not have been the most masculine person in this group so I wasn't always inserting myself into every single instance right but I definitely was able to hold my own and I didn't like embarrass myself very often you know were you more afraid that they would find out that you were a part of the queer community or that you are a woman the thing I was most afraid of more than either of those things was being found out that I was bad at my job I was terrified like I was I was so the thing is that's linked to queerness that's linked to womanhood because in their eyes if I am queer if I am woman I am lesser than I am not I'm not able to be credible you won't take anything I'm saying seriously the snide comments constantly you know there was one day well before I came out where we took one of the woman's restrooms and turned into a gender neutral room a family rest room because we had a trans woman a first trans woman we ever openly hired and instead of allowing her to go to the woman's restroom they made it a you know gender neutral restroom to try to appease people it was a huge controversy that knowing one of the talk about openly but everyone talked about behind closed doors right and when we first hired her on the maintenance department that I worked with right this was a company of a thousand people I worked in industrial maintenance for a factory and the maintenance department basically they took turns to walk around the building to find out where this trans person was and they were all like did you see her did you see her and they didn't say her they totally misgendered her and then they would try to find out her dead name and stuff and it was just an awful experience this was like years before I came out because at this whole time you're think you're watching what could be your future that had to be terrifying yeah and then when we were changing the room into a woman's restroom it was just oh the it was I remember having one of the worst fights of my entire career with another guy who I loved I loved this man he was one of the nicest people I've ever met my entire life but his view on trans people is so awful that like it kept me from coming out for years because even the people who were considered nice and polite and religious and sweet and loving and when give the shirt off your back would call you a monster and kick you in the front of a car if they could you know what I mean like it's hard because the things he would say about trans people was terrifying like I don't know what to do so I just shut up and I deal with it and then I internalize it and then I come out four or five years later and I never came out at that job I never came out at that job I left that job but being a woman in a trans person in this field was one of the hardest things I have ever done and my heart goes out to other trans people who have reached out to me over the last two years since I've been coming more of a figure in the community and ask me how do you do it and the answer is I do not know I don't know the answer I know I all I can tell you is that like I know it's terrifying and I know that is not easy and I am very lucky that I got out and people ask me to encourage people to go into the fields and I don't know if I can like ethically tell another trans person to go into the trades exactly it's so difficult because people will like you said look to us and say how did you do it or how do I come out or I'm scared to come out or I'm in a bad situation and I want to tell people my truth and I'm like maybe it's not the right answer but it is the truest answer and that is sometimes you actually can't sometimes time is what it takes and and you have to prioritize your safety and it's such an unusual thing to advise people on who are so wide I'd when they look at you and see you as a successful person who made it and then you're like I know but for years I felt like a coward or I felt like I couldn't show up as my authentic self or I didn't say anything when people said rude things because I was afraid or I was insecure and there's a lot of guilt that comes with that too there's just so much that goes on in our brains while trying to be an authentic person and then also still feeling like should I have done more could I have done more and sometimes the answer just is no sometimes surviving is what we're doing yeah 100 percent I would have conversations with people before I came out where they would say to me oh yeah no I knew another trans person who we worked with at you know such and such company but she always ate alone at lunch yeah because no one would sit with her and I remember just thinking how sad that was and then when I started you know pretend that potentially coming out I would ask a few guys you know like hey how would you feel about who I trusted right and there's a few who knew and if I stayed any longer at that company if it wasn't for the pandemic I probably would have come out if they were willing to stand up for me and I think that's what it is I think it really is about that's when you're a real ally and I think trans people and non-binary people need allies more than a lot of groups do in a lot of ways because I need an ally to even come out I don't even feel safe enough in that moment I need an ally who will be willing to say if you have a problem with her you have a problem with me and I and the strength and numbers are really real for trans people and I think that's what's such a crying shame about the grooming like conversation is that like the biggest strength for trans people is numbers and having people feel strong enough to come out together and having each other's back and now I'm considered a predator you know in some circles and that's rough and seeing us as whole people and not just well I liked you until I knew you were queer I liked you until I knew you were trans or whatever the case may be yeah those kind of things are very very hurtful and we could do a whole podcast on that but what we are going to get into after the break is the ways in which that you have made access to this information accessible to people and talked about the importance of women and queer people knowing how to repair things because we don't always get that education right because either we shied away from it because it wasn't for us or we didn't feel comfortable in that world but the power that people can have when they know how to repair things we'll also talk about a couple of mercury's favorite horror stories and if lushable wipes are flushable we'll do that after the break why hello there it's your old pal Sarah Silverman and I'm back with a brand new season of the Sarah Silverman podcast on my podcast I am talking about everything politics yeah we get into it favorite sandwich shop in LA I know a few spots and I'm gonna tell you about them I'm also going to be talking to you I will be reacting and responding to listener voicemails in real time let me tell you things can get weird and I love every second of it weird is my comfort zone the newest season of the Sarah Silverman podcast is out now wherever you get your podcasts it's me Sam B. look I've made a lot of choices in my life joining the daily show creating full frontal that one summer I got bangs I didn't say there were all good choices my next choice in life is starting this podcast with lemonade media it's called choice words and each week I'll be interviewing people I admire about the biggest decisions they've made in their lives we'll get into how that one moment impacted their life today and whether I should get bangs again choice words is out now wherever you get your podcasts okay mr. Curie we are back and we're going to jump in now to some of the nuts and bolts pun intended of the work that you do so tell me why is it important to you that women and queer people know how to repair things because they also have broken things you know I'm writing my book right now that's coming out in August of this year and I'm really excited about it and one of the things I wrote in the book is that if we all have a universal truth that when we're on a toilet and it starts overflowing we all panic why is it we only teach this stuff to men and only teach this stuff to homeowners when we have books that are literally everyone poops you know what I mean why is this true it's a little silly to me that if I go to somebody and I was just like okay do you know how to shut off a toilet in an emergency and if they tell me no my first thought is just like well they should have taught you that when you were first learning how to poop so I think it's silly I think it's silly to gate keep this stuff I really do I and sometimes people will push back at me and be like well um it's available if they want it and I'm like yeah whoo right and there is so much information that you said geared towards the homeowner but oftentimes by the by the time we're buying a house we just went through this my wife and I where we were looking at houses and we were going around with the realtor and they're like oh these pipes are bad these wires are bad this is the I'm like I would have had no idea this looked beautiful it had granite countertops and everything looked new and they're like no this house is trash like I'm like okay well how how is it that like somehow magically like a fairy comes down and is like now you're a homeowner you know how to fix things and it's just not true so I wanted to start kind of from the beginning because I have a pretty young audience people are sometimes in their first apartment and they don't know when to submit a request to maintenance versus what they should be fixing themselves do you have any advice on like what is the renters responsibility the first thing I would always say to a renter is that if you have a good relationship with your landlord and you feel comfortable with it you can put anything you want in it right like it will say in the least if you're responsible for light bulbs you know like it will say in the least if you're responsible for holes in a wall and etc like depending where you are in the country or follow your lease if you can if you don't if you're afraid for your safety if you're afraid for your belongings if you're afraid of retaliation if you're a queer person right like if you have a pride flag in your wall and you're just really afraid of the response you might get then then I think there's a lot of things you can do in your home and again my book is going to cover all of this because it's tailored for renters who but basically I think that when it comes to like clogs and replacing shower heads and garbage disposals and doing those kind of things very straightforward very possible I think even small holes in a wall are really possible color matching a paint job is possible fixing doors like having a door that doesn't want to close on you or having a door that has a bad handle on it all those things very straightforward very possible heck if you have a hinge in your door that is not like doing its job and it's loose and falling off and the holes are stripped out of the in the doorframe you can put toothpicks in there and then put some glue in it because the toothpick tips off and then just screw a whole screw back in it and you're good to go and no one's ever gonna know a maintenance tech is not gonna be like oh those toothpicks no they're not they're not gonna know I did this job for years I didn't know and it's how I did it you know you did a video on the four tools that everyone should have I have a myriad of tools here because again I like to cause play butch from time to time until I eventually have to like call someone to fix it because I just do not have these skills I'm very good at cars I'm not very good at home maintenance but so I've got like a electric screw driver I have like a staple gun I have all these different things but I feel like I never have the right tool at the right time what are the four tools that everyone should have oh you're right in my wheelhouse okay a multi screwdriver so that's like a 10 and 1 and I promise you someday you're gonna look at the tip of a of a screw and go I don't know what that is and then you're gonna open up your screwdriver and be like oh Mercury was right just get it it will save you a lot of headache down the road and then I would also get an Allen set so an Allen key set and that is the standard and a metric because a lot of the things in our in the United States is very much you know both we get metric from Europe a lot and we also have a lot of standard stuff so that together all that IKEA furniture those are a nightmare yeah never go with the IKEA tools I give you always have the stuff you need right and an Allen key set is a huge one you'll strip out those screws sometimes they give you by using their screw Allen keys that they send out because they're that I cheap cast iron the third one I will get is a utility knife I love a utility knife for a lot of reasons other people call them box cutters and then the last one is an adjustable groove joint pliers it is one of the most helpful if not the most universal pliers dash wrench you could ever get and this little crocodile looking one it's like a little crocodile yeah it has like it looks like a pliers with a little mouth right it has a little like a like if you hold your arm straight up in the air and then you put your hand out like you're saying hey I'm gay and then you're like a gay toothy wrench you're you're looking for the gay toothy wrench yeah it's definitely a pliers that is a little bit gay you know what I mean yes but all households need a gay wrench yes all how oh god I'm gonna say that for now on that's my favorite thing in the whole world thank you V um but that being said yeah adjustable pliers are almost um universal tools you ever use you could use an implumbing you could use an electrical you could use it for a bunch of different stuff it's the most handy tool have and then you'll notice I don't say um a level I don't say a hammer I don't say uh tape measure because in a lot of ways you don't if you're doing like decorations those things are handy right those three things are super handy for handing pictures on a wall and stuff but I'm specifically talking about mostly maintenance repairs and a lot of maintenance repairs I would say probably 75 percent of all the things I've already mentioned from like blinds to door knobs to strike plates to plumbing to you know uh even the garbage disposal all of that can be taken care of with those four tools and that is huge I think we put such stock in having the right tool for the right job that we kind of push away people's potential like if we all how do you know to have a right tool for the right job if you don't know what you don't know you don't know any if you know if you're going into this completely fresh how do you know what the right tool is all I know is that my dad had a full garage and a shed full of every kind of tool in the history of the world so I am very intimidated because I'm like my old man's got a rotary saw like he's got everything out there I don't even know if he uses it all but I'm like I'm just gonna call Paul and see if you can walk me through this my dad has been on FaceTime with me changing the alternator in my car like he has been on FaceTime with me fixing the garbage disposal with me like he's good at that stuff and when you grow up with a tool dad it is very intimidating because you're like how could I possibly have what I need I couldn't so here is a little behind the scenes for my maintenance technician for a property management company right so like my tool bag I had a backpack full of tools right I had 30 tools in there 30 that's it I own and I could do almost every single job with those 30 tools I didn't use power tools most of the time and you don't really have to and the only auger that I kept with me was that cobra skinny drain cleaner so it fit right in my backpack and that cobra skinny drain cleaner for those who don't know is probably one of my most famous things I tell people all the time it is a $10 auger that you can get from almost any hardware store that you can get clogs out of your sinks and your bathtub but basically what you do is you take the the wire that you come with the augers and you bend them at a 45 degree angle that like first inch and then that gets you down the the pipe really nice and easy super easy like it makes your life so much easier and then that's it and that's those are the only tools I kept in my backpack what is the call that you would get the most as a maintenance person what are people most often breaking oh my god in apartments it was garbage disposals I think I got a call about a garbage disposal every other day for as long as I was in maintenance because they lied to you you can't actually put a ton of food down the garbage disposal oh okay actually here we go this is great thank you v for just giving me this giant opening so here's a few things to know about your garbage disposal right now if you have a garbage disposal at home look underneath your sink and look at the number and the side of it is it saying one third or a half or a three fourth or one hp that's horsepower okay how strong is that garbage disposal is an indication of what you can do okay if it's anything under let's say one third it is kind of horseshit yeah I would say one third and under it's not going to do what you want you think it's going to do half power is fine half power is going to take care of most things but a third would get stuck unlike potato wedges and it would get stuck that's when egg shells become an issue I think now that we're on this topic I think it's really important to bring up you never run your garbage disposal dry you always want to run it with a little wet okay think of it as questioning my whole life right now I don't even know how many garbage disposals I've broken really okay good yes horror story I when I was very young I had a pumpkin carving party like at my first apartment and one of my friends put all the pumpkin guts down the garbage disposal and it broke it so badly that we ended up like backing up the sinks and like black stuff was coming out of the shower it was very horrible this is why I don't trust garbage disposal well you always anytime you put anything down it you always want to run it first with water and then you put it down there okay I think of it as like you're trying to eat something right like a garbage disposal is just a mouth right and if you are taking a pie and you're shoving a pie in your mouth and then you try to bite well that's going to be hard right so like if you bite like the edges of the pie before you just shove the whole thing in your mouth it's a whole lot easier right you don't expect to eat a whole pie in one bite so why do we expect a garbage disposal to eat a whole whatever in one bite and I think it's important to view it that way now what about using dreino stuff like that in your drains folks get a lot of hair down there soap scum gross stuff it's starting to get weird what do we do I will tell you this I feel like one day I'm going to get a letter from drain out just begging me to forgive them I don't know I feel I feel like we have in a strange relationship so I absolutely hate all chemical drain cleaners um I've been so public about thinking that dream chemical drain cleaners have really done us dirty a lot of ways because I think people just think that it's like a magical go away hole you put down this stuff and then your problems go away and I just need people to understand that your drains themselves are dirty and griming and beat up and the clean glass that you see dissolve hair in the commercials or on tech talks or youtube is not your drains and I have gone toe to toe with people about this before and be like yeah technically it does dissolve hair but it by the time it gets to the hair clog in your drain that could be eight ten feet twenty feet down the drain it has to go past all their grime little bits of pieces you know sometimes moisture and water and every time it hits one of those things it weakens itself right it's not a full strength by the time it hits a clog for example if you know you have a clog in it you're running the water and it takes less than five seconds and you have a a pretty hard like clog already that means you have a pretty shallow clog it's somewhere in the p-trap which is right underneath your sink right underneath your tub that you can get with like a plastic tool called a zip it or you could get it with a drain cleaner right but I would rather you use an auger right to use that Culver skinny drain cleaner auger than using any chemical drain cleaner or any zip it but if you need to do what you got to do zip is a really cheap and you can get them from a dollar store for a dollar so I'm not going to knock you for doing what you need to do financially right but try to take the clog out before you pour a bunch of chemicals into a place that's going to eventually take the water to some waste management system that's not great for the overall environment the next thing flushable wipes are not flushable and I have learned this from you and I learned this from watching Adam ruins everything a while back how could they market something like a flushable wipe and then it could really damage your property so I'm doing an experiment right now that we've been spending a lot of time on we're right now we have a whole bunch of mason jars filled with flushable wipes and we are trying to prove that they're not biodegradable and we're trying to prove that like even the best brand the one that everyone says is approved by plumbers which is cotton l I am very adamant that it doesn't biodegrade fast enough and that can cause a problem right um so this whole like are they flushable aren't they flushable thing I think that's the wrong angle because they are technically flushable but so is paper towel right like anything that can go down a drain you know what I mean um I think legally they have to be make sure that they're like oh yeah it's biodegradable over how long of a time though right three hours two days three weeks five years just get up a day it's a much better option for everyone yeah but right now we're testing 17 brands um and we have multiple ones going and we are half of our entire area is just filled with mason jars right now but I I'm really against flushable wipes a lot because I think that like yeah I understand what people would really use them and if you use them I don't don't flush them don't just you know have that private little um trash can or have a bag you can put them into and that's okay I'm there's nothing wrong with that keep your bum clean you know uh and there's a lot of accessibility reasons why you would have flushable wipes but I definitely think flushing them is a whole different story we only have a couple of minutes left but I wanted to give you space to maybe tell us some of your worst horror stories as a maintenance tech in the field what's some of the stuff you've seen that you were like no ma'am not me I can't deal with this you know I will say that there's not one job in the world that I would hate more than when I would get to a job site and then they would say to me all right so we need to take this toilet off and we need to replace the wax ring and every time I heard wax ring I would instantly my blood will boil and then I would instantly turn red and I'll be like if you have never taken the wax ring off of a toilet I ate I want to say you are a lucky you were so lucky but if you know what I'm talking about especially if there's an older toilet oh my god the way that a wax ring just like hears to the bottom of a toilet and it's like the one area that's exposed to all of the sewage natural like things oh I hate it I hate it I hate it yeah you can't wear enough gloves on that job like you can wear five gloves and you still feel like you needed going to a boiling hot shower before you can do anything else the rest of the day so that one's up there but I used to be an emergency maintenance tech for like natural disasters and about four or five years ago there was a massive flood here in the wonderful state of Wisconsin and about 45 minutes out of Madison my home they called me up and they asked me to come down and to help them out so I was the one the only people willing to walk through sewage there's like three of us and they would be like okay hey you know here's the health risks we had our siner waiver and they said okay you're the ones who get to deal with the poop all day and I dealt with I kid you not V to my chest I can't I and I I remember I like and I was there for three days we barely slept and when we were asleep we were like they they brought in trailers for us like sleeping the workers and everything we they literally made the ones who were in the sewage sleep in the the one trailer because we stunk so bad and there was no there was no way for us to clean ourselves properly it was like one of the worst times I've ever done but I gotta tell you super rewarding because there's nothing like I don't know it's kind of gross but like you're in you're in the sewage right but then you'll get like someone who's lived here for 65 years and you know they're elderly and they come to you and they're just like okay so in the basement I have this really nice you know like box that I got for my gray mom before she passed away could you please find it for me and then here I am like okay sir I got this for you you know I'm gonna do this for you I know I'm just like weighing through all the poop in the sewage trying to find this box on the ground when it's like chest high it was like oh boy you know what gets me through this those moments is knowing that like I I'm making a slight difference I honestly think in those moments that's why I'm okay with doing salvage stuff and I'm all the day okay to do renovation stuff like emergency renovate and stuff for free because like I don't know there's like a real ah I don't it's a community building stuff that I love and adore and it's why I got into this industry you know like I got into this industry because I generally love helping people and I get excited about it like I mean it sounds terrible but like when I got that call to come down and was like oh oh my god that's so cool I get to be there and help someone who's going through a traumatic thing and I get to be like they're like superhero for the day that's like so wonderful and it's so I don't know there's there's something way you can bond I got to drink wine at the time this is before I I've been sober for a long time now but this is beforehand and the person who did this he had a bottle that was like 85 years old and it was wine that he made way back in the day like I think he it might be like 65 years it was 65 year old wine but he made it the day his wife and him got married and they kept this wine and they had a whole bunch of bottles made and they had like maybe 70 bottles made and most of the bottles were lost in this flood but he had one left and him and his wife and the three of us got to have that wine together and he opened it up and he made us food and you know we're out in the front lawn because we couldn't go in the house because of how bad it's dunk and he made us brats and we drank this wine and hearing his stories and his life I mean that is the most rewarding thing on this earth v and to me that's why I love doing this work and even it was disgusting a great story and and and and the gate day so you are just a good
