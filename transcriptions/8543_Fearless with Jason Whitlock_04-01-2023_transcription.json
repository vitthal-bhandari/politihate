    "text": " Welcome, welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy, happy Wednesday, happy hump day to you and yours. We have a fantastic show planned for you today. We're going to delay Tennessee Harmony until Friday. You know, we didn't, our Monday actually was yesterday on Tuesday. So we're a little bit off this week, but we will have Tennessee Harmony. It just won't be today, it will be on Friday. So stay tuned for that. But today we have another fantastic show for you. Following up on our conversation from yesterday about Demar Hamlin, also including Dana White and some of the feuds going on between Shannon Sharp and Skip Bay was we have a fantastic show for you today. Royce White and Steve Kim will be here to help me unpack. These topics will start with a fire and then we'll get into this show. This will be a tighter show. We only got a couple of topics I want to get into and Steve Kim and Royce White are here to help me do that. Well, fantastic action pack, tighter show today. Yesterday we went for nearly two hours. Today, I think we may go an hour, but you never know, I get to talk and who knows. Anyway, let's get this fire started and then we'll bring Royce White in to help fan these flames. Monday night, as I watched ESPN's coverage of Demar Hamlin's on field collapse, I refused to entertain the possibility that tragedy could be related to the NFL's experimental medical trial, aka vaccine coercion. Other people were far less reluctant. Opponents of the experiment immediately connected Hamlin's cardiac arrest to his vaccination status, a status that I did not know Monday and still don't know today. Anti-vaxxers, which I am one, argued mostly with anecdotal evidence that there has been a rise in sudden death syndrome among young athletes since governments and corporations across the globe started force feeding Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed Medical Trial. I remain undecided on whether speculating about Hamlin's vaccination status is appropriate at this time. The 24-year-old remains in a Cincinnati hospital fighting for his life. What I do know is that many people within the ProVax group seem determined to pin Hamlin's death, or health death, I'm sorry, Hamlin's health crisis on the sport of football. Football is the proverbial bad guy. Speaking ill, the game is celebrated in modern America, where anything as uniquely American as tackle football is despised. What I also know is that for members of the corporate media questioning the methods and products of the pharmaceutical industry is rife with as much danger as questioning the influence of secular Jewish people in Hollywood. It's a topic best avoided. Public pharma is the most influential advertiser in all of television. Sports television now depends on pharmaceutical companies the way it once did on Miller Lite, Bud Light, and Old Milwaukee. The dope dealer replaced the bartender as the biggest bully on TV. Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and others are the puppet masters of the pontificators on TV. The vaccine manufacturers demanded their puppets blame football for whatever happened to Demar Hamlin on Monday. Yesterday, CNN.com contracted sports writer Jeff Perlman to spin a yarn about how Hamlin's collapse mirrors the 1971 death of Chuck Hughes, a Detroit Lions receiver, and it illustrates the inherent dangers in football. Writing quote, Jeff Perlman says, Should we talk more about the 2017 Boston University study that found chronic traumatic enthalopovir- CTE, you know what I can't even pronounce that word. CTE in 99% of brains obtained from NFL players as well as 91% of college football players. Can we question the wisdom of grown men slamming into grown men? Can we debate whether youth tackle leagues or life affirming or insane? Football is now allegedly being held to the extent it needs to be life affirming. Where do they come up with this stuff? Chuck Hughes died because of undiagnosed blood clots. He collapsed walking back to the huddle. Had he been walking to the team bus with CNN blamed football? Hughes' death speaks to the dangers of blood clots, the side effect researchers say the experimental medical trials cause. And what does CTE have to do with Hamlin? Why bring up CTE? CTE is the convenient mystery disease that can only be diagnosed in a corpse. You gotta be dead to be diagnosed with CTE. In my opinion, CTE is a distraction, another tool to demonize football and deflect from the drugs athletes ingest to compete. On CNN's morning show, ESPN's Bomani Jones talked with Don Lemon. Oh, what a cute couple that is, Bomani and Don Lemon together. They got together and talked about Hamlin. And of course, Jones blamed football too, take a listen. I saw you shaking your head when the Poppy's question to, can you make it safer or safe? And you said, oh no, I mean, it's like trying to make a safe cigarette. That's just not really how this works, how this gang works. And part of why people watch is the fact that it's not safe. Like that's an element to the drama of this is that the idea of the sacrificing, everything that has to put in, that's part of what draws people into this. And so we feel guilty when we see things like this. So we always try to come around and find a way to be like, man, you think they can find a way to make this safe? No, they can't. That's just not what this game is or what it's ever going to be. What's your reaction when you saw what happened last night? Well, what happened for me was interesting because I kind of missed it. And then once I saw that they were talking to somber tones and doing the solemn replay, I was like, oh, I don't need to watch this. But my thought was that it was like a spinal injury. That's something that you see often happening at football. After they came back from a couple of commercial breaks and then said that they were administering CPR, I called one of my colleagues and said, did we watch somebody die? Because that was like, it was so clear from the way they were treating it that it was that grave and that dire. And then I was like, well, they're going to play football. We didn't know. We did not know because I kept saying, is he, is he still alive? Like, what is happening? We did not know. I was just watching enough of these to recognize that something was very different. And the fact that Joe Book couldn't even figure out what to say. And then it's 10 minutes later and they're talking about CPR. And that was for me the moment that it became really terrifying about what exactly was going on. The chemistry, the on-air chemistry between Don Lemon and Bomani Jones, it just leaps off the screen. I mean, they need to do a show, Morning Don with Minka, Morning Don with Bomani. I mean, that was the chemistry between those two guys. It's just incredible. My reluctance to ponder the possibility that the vaccines the NFL promoted contributed to Hamlin's cardiac arrest, it's starting to dissipate. If it's fair to blame football, if you can go on CNN and blame football for something that it's almost impossible to blame this on football. But, you know, they're doing it. Why not ponder the impact of the so-called clock shot? I'm willing to pay the penalty for discussing the vaccine. We've seen from Elon Musk's Twitter files that social media platforms banned and shadow banned people who question the efficacy of the shots. YouTube discourages its users from negatively discussing the shot. Big Pharma greatly influences what we can and cannot discuss on all platforms. Their commercials finance the NFL and all the sports leagues, Roger Goodell would rather have football blame for Hamlin's collapse than have football viewers second guess their fifth booster. So, yeah, I'm going to go there today. I just, I don't know if this is vaccine related, but I do think enough time has passed that it's fair to have that discussion. A lot of people are. Many of you probably like me watch Tucker Carlson's opening monologue most nights. Tucker, this wasn't his opening monologue, but Tucker touched on this topic early in his show yesterday and had Dr. Peter McCullough, I think, on, he had Michelle Tofoya on. People are talking about, speculating about pondering whether this kid, this young man, was vaccinated and did it contribute to his cardiac arrest. We've seen, it's mostly anecdotal. I know there's some stats out there, but I haven't seen anything overwhelmingly, overwhelming from the data point of view and substantial research that makes me fully believe that all these athletes that seem to be dropping dead unexpectedly is related to the COVID shot, but people are certainly having that discussion. We're going to have that discussion here today. Is it fair? We'll do that first with Royce White. We'll also talk about Dana White with Royce as well. You guys know if you follow this show. Royce is a mixed martial art artist. He hopes to one day be a superstar in the UFC. So we'll get his thoughts on Dana White and what you guys know what happened with Dana's kid, his wife, and Cabo San Lucas. They're at a bar, New Year's Eve, drinking too much. His wife slaps him. Dana slaps back. Dana's had to apologize. We'll talk about all that and more with Royce White on the other side of this. But first I want to tell you guys how you can reach me and us via email, fearlessblaceshow at gmail.com. I love reading your emails. I love hearing about your eating good ranches.

Welcome back. Time for some Royce White in the new year. The deepest man, Morpheus, the all-knowing Royce White joining us here on Fearless. Royce, the whole country's been talking about. DeMar Hamlin and the tragedy that happened to him on Monday afternoon being an athlete. I'm sure it touched you in a way. The question we're pondering today is, is it fair or are people doing too much by saying speculating that a 24-year-old kid seemingly in perfect health takes a routine run of the mill hit in a football game, gets up, and then collapses? Is it fair to wonder about his vaccine status and whether the Vax played any role in this? I think it's always fair to be skeptical of the medical industrial complex. There are any and all circumstances right now given what we've seen. I think in this particular situation, people should be calling the question, the status of whether or not he was vaccinated. In my opinion, there seems to be a preponderance of young, fit, healthy athletes having issues like this. And not only athletes, but just young people in general who are healthy. I think there's something like a 200, it might have been 2000, but I'm safe with saying it's a 200% increase this year from heart-related or cardiac-related incidents without previous health conditions to determine it or to impact it. So, there's definitely something going on in young people. I would assume that that has something to do with the vaccine, but maybe there's something else going on as well. I mean, there's a litany of things that could be going on out there. I wonder if there will be any way to get to the truth because the NFL, if in any way this is connected to the vaccine, the NFL puts so much pressure. It didn't mandate it, but it put a lot of pressure on its athletes to take the vaccine. It seems like these pharmaceutical companies have immunity, but the NFL might not. And so, it'll be interesting whatever the official story is, can we trust it? Well, no, you can't trust the official story. You can't trust the NFL. You can't trust any of these sports institutions. They're carrying water for the medical industrial complex, the boot. There are many of them are in Pfizer's pocket and all of the overlords of big pharma as well. And I think it's unfair. Here's what I'll say about the vaccine hesitant or the vaccine reluctant or the vaccine deniers. Anybody who was against the way the medical industrial complex waged a sort of medical warfare on the American people or people all around the world. The reaction is a little unnecessary. I won't say it's unwarranted, but it's a little unnecessary. For me, let's take this for example. People will go, well, if the vaccine was dangerous, if 95 or 90 to 100% of the NFL players are vaccinated, then why are more people dropping dead? That's not the right question to ask. That's the wrong question to ask. The question is the people who do fall out and collapse like this player, did it have something to do with the vaccine and were the people who took the vaccine, whether they are adversely effect here in the now or in the future or not? Did they have informed consent? So I think that the narrative is getting warped and many of us out there in the world on the internet who had a problem with the way this whole thing was handled with the vaccine automatically gravitate towards all the vaccine is killing people. Well, maybe the vaccine isn't killing massive amounts of people. That has nothing to do with the ethics of the medical industrial complex properly informing people who consent to take the vaccine. So they're two separate issues. And I think we should set our chips on how procedures should work. Should we have been coerced by the NFL? Should the NFL be in such directly with a medical industrial complex that doesn't have the proper checks and balances? Should we have to be properly informed of the things we put in our body? Should we be mandated to put things in our body? This is where we should lay our chips to say, Oh, well, you know, everybody who dies from a heart attack from now until 2030. It's because of the vaccine unnecessary and it could be true. But I think it's unnecessary. Let's focus on procedure and policy and the corruption of the establishment. I think the other thing we have to be careful of for the people that publicly stated their reluctance to take the vaccine. I don't think we should behave in the same way as the people that push the vaccine because now that the information seems to be on our side, I'm seeing a lot of people want to rub it in the other side's face. And to me, that is making the other side more reluctant to acknowledge their error and be willing to support those of us who are like, Hey, man, this stuff needs to be strongly questioned. Everybody responsible needs to be held accountable. It's like everybody's chosen sides. And once and those of us that didn't take the vax one are I told you so moment and those people that took the vax won't take boosters are completely reluctant to admit like, Hey, I made a mistake and I want to make I want to make sure there's systems and protocols in place that this never happens again. I agree with you 100%. I would say we should always be trying to strive to show prudence in our action and things we say. And when people look and I understand when people fall short, especially in this case, because, you know, the establishment reached way, way over and out of bounds on this whole COVID vaccine deal. And so I understand people's impetus to go, you know, I told you so and really the people who didn't take the vaccine aren't just saying I told you so about the vaccine. They're saying I told you so about 20 years worth of misinformation, 60 years worth of misinformation and 100 years worth of misinformation from from a coalesce to corrupt establishment. And I think that's the real that's the real impetus around the, you know, the retaliation you could say from the people who didn't take the vax. They're the truth. They're the truthers that have been in the weeds, taken the brunt of punishment from the establishment and the corruption of public consensus for for generation or for many generations. So you know, you know, these are the 9 11 deniers. You know, these are the, you know, these are the JFK conspiracy theorists. They're all the same group of people. So they've been taking wax over the head for a long time. And so I understand their frustration, but this is where Christian ministry is going to is going to pay dividends. And I have to work on it myself. I oftentimes find myself on Twitter or online, just taking a spike and a hammer to people and saying, Hey, if you took the vaccine, you're in on it, right? You're either in on it or you're a coward. And so, you know, there's some, there's some merit to that. There's some need for that. We correct ourselves in society by this oratory, you know, composition. So people should push back. But that's not the biggest fight. The biggest fight is what we do individually. Well, and I want to be careful here, but, but I can see it since it feel it within my own family. I will, you know, because I was the nut job in my family. I was like, no, I'm good. I ain't taking the facts. And people were thought I was crazy. And now when you talk to them, no, I'm not taking no more boosters, but they won't, they'll say they're not taking any boosters, but they won't say, Hey, you know what, maybe you were right and I need to be more skeptical of what the government and corporate media tell me. And it's all tied in together because you're right. It's not just the facts. There are many people. I think an overwhelming majority of people that know like, man, we overreacted to the quirks in Donald Trump's personality. And we installed this corpse and robot and we can now see the ramifications of that. And we can see the wickedness of the left, but it's almost like they don't want to admit that either. You got, again, drag queens, sexualizing kids, and they still don't want to acknowledge like, Hey, man, has the left gone too far? And so I'm trying to, in my own behavior, trying to figure out how I can behave in a way that allows people to know like, Hey, man, it's fine. If you say I was wrong, I'm not going to rub it in your face. I'm going to welcome you to enlightenment. And that's not a full-throated endorsement of Donald Trump because, you know, some of the things Donald Trump is doing recently really irritate me, particularly with the abortion deal, the blaming, the pro-life movement and what. But I just want people's eyes to open up, quit trusting corporate media. The people you turn on that TV and those people are not there to help you, man, that they are there to lead you astray. Well, absolutely. And, you know, at your age and with your wisdom and as long as you've been around, especially when it comes to media specifically, you've seen enough to be able to be in that, you know, to be in that spot and be considering how you go about it at 31 years old as more of a militant. I'm just just hammering people a lot of times. And we should all try to find that balance. You know, I think a lot of what we see is that liberalism has been so deeply indoctrinated into generations and generations of people that it's hard for them to. And I oftentimes have anxiety at night thinking, what would need to happen for people to actually stop believing what they're being told and what they're being sold or what they're being given? Like what set of circumstances would need to be for people to say, all right, you know what, that's enough. This is outrageous. And as we go along, it serves as a very dark and daunting evidence that there is an incrementalization of misinformation and what Robert Malone called mass formation psychosis. We're at each at each pillar. When we accept something that was ridiculous, it becomes even harder for us to turn back in the bigger scheme of things. So you would think, okay, the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, the 2009 financial crisis, you know, COVID, the 2016 propaganda, Russia, Russia, Russia, you know, the entire big tech phenomenon in the dopamine project. Okay, which one of these things is going to make none of them? None of them. We roll through every stoplight without a without a without a bat of the eye for the most part, writ large, you know, writ large. There's the me and the you and Alex and Steve and the people in our audience, but writ large, people are invested in this status quo. And that's that's scary. That's that keeps me up at night. It really does Royce because I'll go back to JFK was assassinated. It was captured on film. It's been played everywhere. And people were, yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald did it or or even worse than that, even worse than that. I really don't. I don't want to know who did it. I don't care who did it. It's irrelevant who did it. It's irrelevant if there were the CIA and the FBI were potentially involved. It's that it's outside my control. So I'm not going to care. And I'm just going to put my head down and trust whatever the establishment tells me. It goes to me, it goes back to 1963 that we bought the JFK story and just kept it moving like nothing, nothing, nothing weird here. Yeah. I mean, completely self interested too, right? The boomers, the boomers had this concept had this money grab concept, right? Whereas long as the prosperity of America was on the rise, the corruption that led to it was was inconsequential. And we now know that that was one of the gravest errors in American history. And in many respects, the boomer generation is responsible for the way our country is today. I mean, in almost all respects, not to say that there wasn't corruption before or that my generation isn't corrupt. We are the we are the ungodly, unholy offspring of the boomers moral hazard. But yes, I would agree that that our society is frozen in front of our TVs and at the JFK assassination. And that was that was a linchpin of the prevailing psychology of the American people that, you know, we know that there's dark corruption happening, but it's in everybody's best interest to look away, right? We got bigger and better things to do. We got bigger and better goals to achieve. We got more to get. There's more for us out there. There's more to look away for us. And that's radical materialism to the max. And you know, I think it is, I think it's essential to know who killed JFK, but I think many of us already know, right? I mean, the CIA killed JFK. Let's just let's let's just say it. Let's say the CIA didn't kill JFK in the same way I caution about the vaccines. It's more prudent for a citizen to value their citizenship by drawing the most the most stark criticism and skepticism of their government. That's what the individual that's what being an American was supposed to be about. That's what being a nation of shopkeepers was supposed to be about that we get to question our government. We scrutinize our government to the highest degree. That's actually your civic duty. And we've abnegated that. So what we what we what we don't know is how deeply involved the CIA was in JFK's assassination. What we do know is that the CIA had the capacity to carry out an assassination like that. And they still have the capacity to do that in much, much more. And now it's not only the CIA. There's a 19 institution intelligence community that has expansive capabilities as well. And it extends to the five eyes. And now we signed an agreement. Most people wouldn't know this, but but this is how moral hazard works when you let the intelligence community kill a president on national television. Then 25 30 years down the road, they go, you know what? All of this constitutional protection of our citizens is is you know, it's it's inconvenient for us. So now what we're going to do is we're going to sign an intelligence collaborative with four other nations from the Commonwealth, the Crown, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Great Britain. And we're going to say instead of us spying on our own citizens, we'll allow Great Britain to spy on our citizens for us. That's the work around to our constitutional law. That's undermining our rule of law. And who did that? Oh, it was the neocons, many Republicans who talk about rule of law. They talk about rule of law for common citizens. They're not talking about rule of law for the administrative state, for the deep state. You know, so these are the types of moral hazards that we don't need 100% of America to wake up to in this new year. And I was thinking about this. We don't we don't need people to wake up to it all at once. All we need is that the group of us who understand to have the willingness to fight and sacrifice and die on behalf of the truth. And that can move mountains. That's the the faith of a grain of a mustard seed can move a mountain, right? And we haven't exhibited that on our side of the movement. I'm not waiting for 50 million sheep to just suddenly wake up one day and have a, you know, a salvific moment and go, you know, all of this selfishness I've been, you know, doing my whole life is is wrong. I need to I need to find God in Christ and get into the fight. I'm not expecting that. But what I'm expecting is that the Alex Jones is the Steve Bannon's the Kanye West, the Kyrie Irving's the Jason Whitlocks, myself, the Donald Trump's find an even higher ethnic immorality to go into this next round of the fight with. Hmm. I want to switch up Royce. Dana White is in some hot water. The Damar Hamlin situation is probably lowered the temperature for him. And it's kind of floating under the radar, but he's out in Cobblestone, Lucas with his wife celebrating New Year's Eve. They get an argument. She strikes him first. He hits her back. He's issued an apology. His wife has issued somewhat of an apology, more of a group apology. What should we think here about Dana White? He's been pretty outspoken on domestic issues and saying that there is no justification for hitting a woman. Because our show is called fearless, I'm going to throw it out there and just say, if a woman strikes a man first, are we a thousand percent sure that the man can't defend himself? I'm not trying to rationalize and excuse with Dana White. I would never put myself in that position when I saw them. I'm like, these guys are in their fifties. What are they doing at a nightclub? What are they doing out drinking? What are they? But we've moved so far with this feminist movement and men and women are equal that I'm not remotely defending Dana White. But this isn't the same to me as the Ray Rice situation or other situations that we've seen that I think are far worse. I'm not sure what I fully think. I think Dana White's wrong, but I also think his wife is wrong. I think that when you're in a marriage, you have to be looking out for each other. And by striking him, she's not in their drinking. She's not looking out for him. She's striking a man that's had too much to drink. I'm not justifying what he did, but damn it, just keeping it real. Anyway, there's a lot to unpack here. I hope I haven't thrown too big of a grenade in your lap. Maybe I've just dropped it on myself. But I'm just keeping it real that I don't want to be with a woman that strikes me, and particularly not when we're out drinking or at 53, I just wouldn't be at a nightclub anyway with my wife or anybody. But anyway, your thoughts? Well, I have a lot of thoughts about this. This is the oldest battle ground in human history. Outside of the spiritual and the physical realm, it's men and women, right? And the differences between us and the battle between feminine and masculine energy. And so this is like an age-old issue. And whenever we beat the globalists, me and my friends, we always joke, whenever we beat the globalists, whenever we beat the communists, the neocons or whoever else you could line up, the battle is still going to be between men and women. And that battle will always exist. There is no win in that battle. The only win is when people give over to God in Christ and more traditional ideas. And then they submit themselves, right? That's St. Thomas Aquinas when man submits his reasons to his passions and his passions to his reason and his reason to God, he can have peace and then he can have order. So yeah, Dana White was out of order right there for sure. There's no doubt that I'm sure he, that's why he apologized because he understands that he could have behaved differently. Dana White lives in the world. Vegas, he's the big boss, man. He's the big Kahuna out there in the city of lights. And that lifestyle comes with parties and events and appearances. And probably he drinks some. He's an old boss and Irish guy, so I'm sure he can drink many people under the table. I don't even know if he drinks. I'm just throwing that out there. But here's what I'll say to start. It becomes very hard for us as onlookers to properly diagnose the situation and how to view Dana with how we've tried to obscure the role of gender and men and women in our society, like you said. And I'm glad that you started there because I totally agree. If men are going to be equal to women in every way, then it changes the entire predicate for why we as civilized people have a, have a, have an intuition when we see a man strike a woman. And most of us do have a natural intuition when we see a man strike a woman and go up, that's not right. But why? Because men and women aren't equal. Okay. And when you start to blur that line, I'm not saying that the blurring of that line caused this situation or had any direct impact on Dana White's decision or his wife's decision. But you can see where it does because what I tell my daughters, you don't ever put your hands on a man unless you're ready to fight, unless you're ready to kill that man, right? And there may be a time where that there may be a day where that, where that, where that situation is before them, where, you know, there are men out there who attack women who try and, you know, brutally club a woman over the head, drag her into a car and driver to some, some house and a rapper or torture for three weeks or whatever, you know, those people are out there. That's not the situation. His wife decided to smack him because of a domestic issue that they were having within their relationship, obviously, and he had not threatened her yet. He had not put his hands on her yet from what we can see in the video. And she decided to take physical action. Now when you do that, there's still the potential for a man to say, you know what, that didn't hurt, right? You know, that doesn't phase me. But when a man's been drinking, different consideration. When a man is in the position that Dana White is in, right? And the thing, you know, who knows what he's dealing with? Who knows the stresses he's under? Only she would know that. Only a good wife would know where her man is on a daily basis. And you know, if the roles were reversed, if Dana White walked up and slapped his wife, first, this wouldn't even be an argument. And that shows the contradiction right there, right? We've sort of accepted through Hollywood, through popular culture, that when a woman gets mad enough, she can slap a man. And the whole payoff for it is that the man's expected not to retaliate. And if the man does retaliate, the woman has free range than to call the police and use the highest extent of a corrupt female pro-law to come down and destroy that man. And I think that that's corrupt to the highest degree, and that still doesn't excuse Dana White's behavior. But we have to discuss both things. And even more so, I think what's more important is the society we've built. That's the predicate for this circumstance than Dana White's actions. I will say that. That he didn't assault her in a brutal way. I mean, Dana's a big dude. I mean, he's not a little dude, right? I mean, if Dana wanted to take ball his fist up, he could have broke his wife's jaw, broke her eye socket, and I've seen that happen. And that's a whole different level of violence, right? When you go there, you've gapped out, you've lost it. And that says something deep about your own personal temperance. But the fact that women just have this idea that they can walk up and slap men is a symptom of our society writ large, I think. You've unpacked a lot and said a lot because you're right. This mindset of men and women are equal. And again, I don't think Dana White has bought into that mindset, but the culture has, and it impacts everybody's mindset. And so, and I don't want to go back to the caveman days. I don't want to go back to women in the kitchen or whatever, but I do want to go back to a mindset of like, hey, look, men and women are not equal, especially physically. So there is a way, as a woman, that I'm going to approach a man who has physical dominance over me. I'm not going to, in any way, approach him in a violent way. And, and, and, you know, I've seen people over social media, these, oh, my God, if you use the word provoke, that that's a bridge too far, we must cancel you and all this other stuff. But there's nothing wrong, in my opinion, with telling a woman, don't do anything to provoke violence in a man. And most especially when they're drinking. And then I think Dana's mindset, not trying to excuse what he did, he's wrong, I'm not trying to excuse it. But when you, and I'm not comfortable with women in mixed martial arts or boxing, I don't, that's why I was never a big ronda-rousie person. I just, I don't want to see women do violence towards each other. It, it, quite honestly, it grosses me out. I just don't find it enjoyable. But if Dana is immersed in a culture where they have female fighters and women who will go toe to toe with men, it can warp his thinking and his perception of women. If he's working with a bunch of women who are in gyms or go out at night and they don't have, they will whoop a dude's rear end. It can affect your mentality. And again, that's why I divorced myself from all of it. You know, I can, I feel comfortable having this conversation because I've never hit a woman. And, and certainly wouldn't put myself in a position where I'm out, you know, I pretty much don't drink unless I'm at home and don't drink enough, really get drunk ever. But, but I just wouldn't put myself in this position. It's, it's a complicated story that I think we just want to dumb down to men should never hit women. And there is truth in that. That statement is true. But let me tell you another statement that's true. Women should never hit men. That statement is just as equally true as the men should not hit women. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, yeah, men should never hit women is, is, is, is an idea that is predicated on a Judeo-Christian worldview. So again, like, like, like I indicated with the, with the anti-Jews when I, when I talk about that is that you're in, for example, your entire identity is predicated on this, this, this text. The way that men revere women, the way that men have come to treat women and put women on a pedestal in our society is largely due to our Judeo-Christian heritage. So when you go to throw the Bible out and all the customs and all the traditions that make America or modern society what it is, these are the things that, that, that you throw out and they don't want to throw them out. And you don't necessarily have to throw them out, but it creates a huge logical contradiction. And it makes it hard to sort these things out. And what I think people don't understand is in order to apply justice, like in order to have justice, people have to be able to understand the, the, the parameters and constraints of the ideas that they're working with and why they are, what makes something just, what makes something true. And that's what they really try to undo in our society. And that's when it's, oh, well, you know, a man should never hit a woman, even if a woman hits him, even if a woman, what pulls a gun out on him? I mean, what, what heights could a woman go to before it's justified that a man takes, you know, full, full force and retaliates physically? That's a line that's not drawn in our popular culture. It's just like assumed, like, oh, well, if a woman goes far enough, then it's justified. It's like, no, where's that, where's that common? Where's that idea being pushed or being, being drawn in a clear way? The vagueness, the indirectness, the lack of clarity around these issues is the seeds of chaos, right? So yeah, women are thinking, you know, I've seen, I grew up in that, I spent, you know, in the, let's talk about the black community, not to go ripped on, but let's go black women specifically. Black women are, are the queens of this. Black women have been indoctrinated almost culturally with the idea that at some point, if you cross them three snaps in a Z, then at some point they'll just, you know, they'll just smack the shit out of you or, or, or, you know, whatever, some women are just start punching you. And, and, and in our community, men are expected to not retaliate to sit there and take it. And you know, most of that is, you know, some of that's our fault. We should just move away from a woman, you know, you, you know, when your woman's like that, right? Some men like that. Some men like that sort of volatile dynamic with their woman. It adds a little spice and adventure to it. But, but that's where the culpability is mostly for men is that you, you know, when your woman is like that and you should, you should move on. Don't be a cuck, right? Avoid it. And again, as that whole, I want a strong woman, Bob, I want somebody to stand up to me, and Bob, I want some peace and quiet. I'm fighting the world. I don't want to be fighting at home. I know exactly what you're talking about. We're going to end it on this note, Royce. I'm going to quote for the Bible and thank you. Great job. We'll, we'll, we'll see you later in the week. But I want to end on this note just to clarify, here's my position on this. And, you know, it's very easy. It's all been written out for me. I'm going to go first Peter, chapter three, verse seven. Husbands in the same way be considered as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers. Dana White needs to understand that. We all do, but I'm sure if I go deep enough, there'll be something in the Bible instructing women on how to treat their husbands. And, and I just don't see liquored up at a club striking my husband. That ain't looking out for him. Doesn't justify Dana White, but that ain't looking out for him. All right. Stay tuned. Don't go anywhere. YouTube.com slash Jason with lock it. Notifications. Subscribe. Korean Co-Sail Steve Kim. Thanks. All right. Welcome back. Time for some Korean Co-Sail Steve Kim and Steve. I want to start with where I started the show with talking about big pharma, the vaccine, and whether or not it's fair to discuss the potential role of the vaccine coercion that the NFL basically a mandate in the NFL and the NBA. Not quite, but basically a mandate. Is it fair to discuss that as it relates to Demar Hamlin? Yes. Of course it is. I think as we watch this unfold on Monday night, I think a good deal of the American public had that at least in their back of their minds, if not flat out stated. But with that said, we need to get all the information. I know some of the viewing audience of this fine program got on us for not bringing it up yesterday and blaming the facts. Well, here's the issue. We don't know. And with the HIPAA regulation, we may never know. But to really make that determination as it's specific to Mr. Hamlin's situation, we would have to know, was he actually vax when he was vax? What's his medical condition and what was he predisposed to from a health standpoint? Now, do I have my concerns about young athletes all across the world suddenly collapsing if not dying? Yes. You see the post, you see the evidence, and you see these visuals of otherwise healthy young men and women, supposedly in the physical prime of their lives, suddenly dropping. Why? And we're not a I'm not making any accusations, but I would like some information. And we may never get it, though. I am so suspicious of the process of how the mainstream media has covered this issue. And also any organization that has pushed this upon their employees. I mean, this year, it's interesting I'm watching various games and the games go to a commercial and there'd be ads for Pfizer. And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I don't know if that's really a conflict of interest, but I know it conflicts a lot of people in the what they can say and how they cover this issue. Steve, I want to move to a little bit humorous ramification of this Damar Hamlin situation and the fallout on skipping Shannon on Fox Sports continues even today. I don't know who's seen. I should be open to the show. Shannon skipped yesterday's show over Skip's tweet. Skip's tweet. I'm on the record is completely harmless. It's been overblown. People are using it trying to cancel this guy. Shannon Sharp is a part of that movement and is trying to cancel Skip Bayless. But I want to play this clip from the open of the show. And then you tell me who the bad guy is here. I have my opinions. We'll hear yours. Let's play the clip. Look different. As the Brotherhood in the NFL when injuries happened when we know injuries are part of the game. I've seen guys suffer ACLs and a Kili's tear but I've never seen anybody have to be revived and fight for their life on the field, so they struck me a little differently because I remember seeing my brother paralyzed on the field temporarily, and he was able to regain focus. Skip tweeted something and although I disagree with the tweet and hopefully Hopefully, Skip would take it down. But I didn't want it. Yeah, I'm out. I'm not going to take it down. Okay. Because I stand by what I tweeted. Skip, let me finish. All right. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Let's go, Jen. Okay. I mean, I cannot even get through a monologue without you interrupting me. You could have came back. Skip. I thought, Skip, just let, I'm ready to bring up. I was just going to say, Skip, I didn't want to yesterday to get into a situation where Demar Hamlin was the issue. She'd been talking about him and not getting to your, not getting to your, your tweet. That's what I was going to do. But you can't even let me finish my open and monologue without you interrupting. Okay. I was under the impression you weren't going to bring this up because nobody here had a problem with that tweet. No. Clearly, the bosses wanted you to offer explanation. So clearly, some of them. No, they did not have it. Nobody. Let's go, Jen. That's where the focus should have been. And not on the football game. Yes. Let's go, Jen. Thank you. So, uh, who, who looks worse in this exchange? Well, like it says, Ebony and I very, not living together in peace and harmony. Uh, boy, this is a tough one. You ever been to that dinner party where you see that couple you know has been having some issues? Yeah. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, Every night like every night, every night at home, every Again it's cumin go every day to come here and Christine. towards a divorce. In this particular situation, in the context of what happened on that show, if you are Skip, let the man finish his sentence. In fact, a lot of arguments in couples, I think develop because people interrupt each other. And you could just tell how peeped and annoyed old Shannon was. Uncle was not having it. And you could just, I'm like, Skip, the guy took a day off from work. Me and you disagree, why, Jason? Let him have this say, then you have a whole hour to interrupt them later and have a discourse about it. But I will say this about Shannon. I get the sense that as they went to a commercial, that if Skip tried to come up to me, don't touch me, don't touch me. That's the way I felt. And I'm like, good, Grie. I felt sorry for that lady. Cause we've all been there in high school with that one volatile couple that broke up every month, but they always got the prom and the Sadie Hawkins together. When they get into an argument and you're there, it's the most uncomfortable thing. You just feel like Homer Simpson going back into the gym. Let me give you a little information. She's not there. She's doing the show from home. She's doing the show from home. She's not in the studio with her. It doesn't matter. If you're on that train wreck and you're on that Amtrak, you're thinking, oh my God, honestly, I would have. I want to stop you, Steve. I want to stop you and I want to replay the clip or just the first 60 seconds of the clip. Replay the clip, Justin, just because I just, I don't think Skip's interruption is nearly as bad as Shannon is making it out to be. Skip added his little comment and then said, go ahead. And instead of just continuing on, Shannon said, oh, he let me nail myself to the cross and make myself the victim. You won't even let me fit. He just said, go ahead. But let's replay the clip. Let's replay the clip. There's been a lot of speculation on why I wasn't on air yesterday and I won't get into speculation or conjecture in you window, but I will say this. In watching that game on Monday night, what happened to DeMar Hamlin struck me look different. As a brotherhood in the NFL, when injuries happened, when we know injuries are part of the game, I've seen guys suffer ACLs and Achilles tear, but I've never seen anybody have to be revived and fight for their life on the field. So they struck me a little differently because I remember seeing my brother paralyzed on the field temporarily and he was able to regain focus. Skip tweeted something and although I disagree with the tweet and hopefully Skip would take it down, but I didn't want it. Yeah. I'm not gonna take it down because I stand by what I tweeted. Skip, let me finish. All right, okay. No, you go. Let's go, Jen. Okay. I mean, I cannot even get through a monologue without you interrupting me. You could have came back. Skip, I thought, Skip, just let that, I was just gonna say, Skip, I didn't want to yesterday. We can stop now. We can stop now. Okay. All right. The man, the man said, I thought you were gonna take the tweet down and hold on man, time out. I'm not taking the tweet down, I stand by it. Don't interrupt me. Okay, go ahead, Shannon, go ahead. Shannon starts to reengage and then he says, no, let me nail myself to the cross. I'm a vet. I can't even get through my monologue, Skip. Skip, I can't even get. He was gonna let him get through it, man. He was just saying, I ain't taking that, you ain't telling me what tweet to take down or what. The tweet had no impact on Shannon Sharp or any of these people pretending like they were offended. First of all, Jason, I can't wait to me and you're at that point. It's gonna be glorious to watch that. I mean, yeah, the fireworks are gonna fly like it's the fourth of July. But you know what this is like? This is like that relationship that ends when the guy does not put down the toilet seat for the last time. And when that lady sits down and that porcelain hits her thigh, she just, that's it. Dog on it, I'm thinking you're not taking out the trash, not putting the water on the dishes as you wait for me to do the dishes and it's just caked on there, all that meatloaf. And for the last time, you didn't put up the dog down the dog gone toilets that you're out of here, buddy. That's what it seemed like. Now personally you're right. Do I believe that skip may have committed a false start by interrupting? Yeah, but then skips it, okay, keep going. And then you're right, Shannon kind of overreacted and he went with the illegal procedure and he did kind of see him a little bit pouty. But come on, look, we already know, we already know that there's a lot of tension and there's probably a lot of pressure from the inner circle and maybe the management, the representation and the fan base of Shannon Sharp to break out on your own. And right now to a good segment of the athletic world and sports media, skip Bayless is toxic. And maybe this is the way for Shannon Sharp to eject himself from that situation as a hero. He's tried, that's true. He is trying to elevate himself and he's using Hamlin to elevate himself. It's what these black elites do. They piggyback off a Hamlin, a George Floyd or whatever. Let me tie myself, oh, I'm so emotionally distraught over Breonna Taylor, give me a raise, give me a promotion, give me a better contract than Rachel Nichols. That's the game that's being played here. I don't respect it. This guy is beating Skip Bayless over the head, trying to paint Skip Bayless as a racist. Skip Bayless has bent over and taken, I gotta be careful, I'll remind myself I'm a Christian, but he's bent over and he's taken the black scene. He has taken the, he's paid money for Little Wayne to pretend like he's his friend. Skip Bay, Skip Bay gave Shannon a job. And now because Shannon's dissatisfied with his place on that show and their financial arrangement on that show, now let's smear Skip Bayless as a racist. Let's turn all of black Twitter and black sports figures all against Skip Bayless. And again, some of that skip was already doing with his schtick, but now they're smearing him with the racism deal. And there's just no proof of it. This tweet wasn't insensitive. It didn't harm anybody. Everybody's faking it and trying to use it to elevate themselves. And that's what Shannon Sharp is doing here. I'm not, look, I've written enough and have said enough about Skip Bayless. Everybody, no, I'm no Skip Bayless fan or defender. But it's relates between these two children and this little fight they're having in the playpen, Shannon looks a lot worse than Skip Bayless. So in other words, Skip got bent over like an LSU assistant recruiting department members, what you're telling me, okay. Here's the thing with all these athletes that are outraged by Skip Bayless. Right now he's got the power, he's snapped because you care about what he says more than he does. And this is what I think Shannon has to realize. He's an important part of that show because that's a two man show, right? You're gonna have some discourse, gotta have some chemistry, which right now doesn't look very good. But who is the straw that serves to drink? Who was the one that makes that thing go viral? Who's the one that gives that show any type of buzz if there is any? You would still have to say it. Shannon, it's good. Shannon, it's good. No. Well, okay. I don't know. Look, the fat ass of the meeting, we start talking about viral. These guys have competing podcasts that have nothing to do with this show. And Shannon's is way more popular than Skip's. Shannon is trying to bury Skip Bayless. And Fox Sports has a big investment in Skip Bayless. They don't need his sidekick trying to bury him unless they want him buried. Maybe Fox is tired of Skip Bayless and want him buried and maybe Shannon's the grave digger for Skip Bayless. I don't know, but- But Jason, I'm taking on your minutes. There's no other individual in sports that could, look, that tweet, the one he did on Monday night as Hamlin was laying pro, I would argue that no one else in sports media could have gotten the type of reaction for that very same tweet as Skip Bayless. I surmise that in that particular role that Skip has, you either wanted to be hated or loved. There's no in between. The worst thing you can have is apathy in a position like that. I think Skip is built for this in a lot of ways. He's probably used to it. He probably has an exterior that has probably been toughened up like Five to Hildbeef, Jerky. And the issue now is can you repair that show? Because that's good once in a while, it'll go viral, we're talking about it, all social media's on it. But man, do you really wanna do that five days a week for however long that show is? That's a tough watch to me. Yeah, first of all, it's not working in terms of, this is not, these two guys can't stand each other. People don't want to see that. People don't want to, oh, let me watch, let me tune in and watch these two guys that hate each other. And then occasionally pretend to love each other. They don't. This is the really, really bad marriage that everybody's like, man, y'all just go ahead and file them divorce papers and move on. But right now, to me, they're arguing over assets and Shannon's trying to improve his leverage. No, I want the house, I'm keeping the house. You can get the car and all that, but I want that. I think that's what's going on here. Let me move to another personality that we'd like to discuss from time to time on this show. Bobani Jones was on CNN, Steve, I don't know if you saw this. He was on CNN talking about Demar Hamlin and he was sitting down with Don Lemon and the chemistry between Bobani and Don Lemon was through the roof. I don't know if you saw this, but it kind of reminded me of morning Joe and Minka, the chemistry between these two guys. Let's play the clip where he compares the football to the tobacco industry. I saw you shaking your head when the Poppy's question, can you make it safer or safe? And you said, oh no, I mean, it's like trying to make a safe cigarette. That's just not really how this works, how this gang works. And part of why people watch is the fact that it's not safe. Like that's an element to the drama of this, is that the idea of the sacrifice and everything that has to put in as part of what draws people into this. So we feel guilty when we see things like this. So we always try to come around and find a way to be like, man, you think they could find a way to make this safe? No, they can't. That's just not what this game is or what it's ever going to be. What's your reaction when you saw what happened last night? Well, what happened for me was interesting because I kind of missed it. And then once I saw that they were talking as somber tones and doing the solemn replay, I was like, oh, I don't need to watch this. But my thought was that it was like a spinal injury. That's something that you see often happening at football. After they came back from a couple of commercial breaks and then said that they were administering CPR, I called one of my colleagues and said, did we watch somebody die? Because that was like, it was so clear from the way they were treating it that it was that grave and that dire. And then I was like, well, they're going to play football. We didn't know. For money, we did not know. Because I kept saying, is he still alive? Like what is happening? We did not know. I just watched enough of these to recognize that something was very different. And the fact that Joe Book couldn't even figure out what to say. And then it's 10 minutes later and they're talking about CPR. And that was for me the moment that it became really terrifying about what exactly was going on. That, to me, looks like a terrific television show. Morning Beta is what I would call it. Morning Beta with Don and Bo. That would be awesome TV. Yeah, we could call it two-sour lemons. Newsflash, Mommani Jones breaks a story. Football is dangerous. Right. You're right. But here's the issue. And I'm going to go back to what was said yesterday by you and I. Nobody is forced to play it. Everybody knows exactly the inherent risks that take place when you play this game. There's great reward. But part of that reward and why I never call it exorbitant is the risk that is involved in playing that sport at the highest levels. But it's become like this in thing to rip football. When you've pointed out for years, Jason, it creates the most amount of black millionaires on a yearly basis. It changes lives for people that don't even make the National Football League. It's like boxing. Boxing has saved so many lives. And I don't mean from people that are Oscar Dela Hoya to Ray Leonard and Tommy Hern. I'm talking about guys or young men and women now that get into a gym and find structure and discipline, compete forever, how long they can or want to. And they find a positive outlet and again, structure, which is important in their lives and they use it in their next chapters. I don't understand the whole abolition of football. Number one, it's not realistic. It's not going to happen. And also, if you really spoke to players and you speak to a lot more than I do, Jason, even the ones that didn't go as far as they wanted, even those ones that feel the physical toll of this sport, I think they would tell you though. And I hear this from boxers all the time. They would still do it all over again. No question about it. Finally, Steve, I want to end on this note talking about Dana White. What you talked about was Royce White. You're from the fight game, not from the mixed martial arts side of it, but Dana White, very popular founder of the UFC, gets in a lot of hot water, slaps his wife in a nightclub, responded to her slapping him. This is on New Year's Eve down in Cabo San Lucas. He's issued an apology, taking responsibility. His wife issued an apology where I don't think she took enough responsibility for her role in this. I'm someone, as I told Royce, I believe, look, if it's true, men should never hit women. And I think that's true. I also think it's true women should never hit men. I think that's equally true. Do you think Dana White will be damaged, removed from the UFC? What should happen to Dana White? I don't believe that he'll be removed. Now, will he be disciplined or censored by those above him? I think there's a chance now, will he be damaged? Yeah, the reputation is out there. Now you live with this, especially with some videotape. And Dana White, the man who is his age and power, personally, should never be out in public on New Year's Eve at a place like that. Too many bad things can happen. Power needs to be protected, and that should be private. And when you're in a public setting, stuff like that can happen. And that is not to condone Dana White. He should be condemned for what he did. I'm kind of with you. That situation there, it would have been just best for him to just pull away. But again, I don't know what state he's in. I really don't know the state of that relationship, to be honest with you. But it's never a good look. Even if you subscribe to the fact that, hey, you want equal rights, we'll give you equal rights. But the impact and strength from a punch, from a normal female to Dana White who works out, it's not equal. That's the issue. Do I believe that women have to be very careful in terms of putting hands on anybody? Yes, because you don't know what can happen. But let's be honest about it. If you take a look at the average lean muscle mass, bone density, strength, and power that can be derived from a male to a female, that's where you're like, I'm not so sure going eye for an eye is necessarily equal in this situation. But no, there's no doubt about it. The public reputation of Dana White will take a hit here. I don't see any other way it can't. Well, I would like to, and thank you, Steve, and we'll see you later in the week. Great job as always. But guys, I do want to say this just to the audience and to men in general, this is alcohol. It's no good. And public alcohol, no good. Getting drunk, it's no good. Virtually every dumb thing, really dumb thing that I regret, alcohol was involved. And I was never a big, I've never been a guy that drinks three days a week or four days a week. I used to drink more than I do now, but I can just tell you, alcohol creates bad decision making. If this 53 year old man is at a private party that he's hosting in his home drinking moderately, rather down in Cabo San Lucas, like you're a 30 year old guy kicking it at a club, probably drinking to excess. That's how you get yourself in these types of problems. That's how you get provoked and react. And when you're sober, I'm going to tell the story, not trying to gloss myself, but just trying to tell you what can happen when you're sober and rational. I'm down in Miami years ago. This was back when me and Dan Levittar were friends and I'm out with Levittar and some of his friends, maybe his brother. He had some pool party on the roof of some hotel in Miami. And some Miami at the Columbian or Latino woman or whatever gets upset with me because something happened between her and her boyfriend and the group we were in were giggling from afar. He walks up to me, gets all up in my face and starts just killing me with N words. N bomb. N bomb. You in this. You in. And I just looked at her because I was out of the pool party, but I wasn't drinking. I just looked at her and smiled. And everybody and it was repeated and this went on for a couple, two or three minutes and calling me every name in the book and blah, blah, blah. I just looked at her and smiled, like, you can't provoke me. You're not, I'm not going. I'm not joining you halfway to stupidity. That's the sober me. That's how a sober, rational human being acts. You start mixing in alcohol, people can provoke you into doing things that you regret. And so everybody puts all this, oh, drinking, getting high is the greatest, funnest thing you can do. Citizens are filled. Unemployment lines are filled with people who can't drink responsibly and lose their self-control and make decisions that destroy relationships, destroy lives, drunk driving, things you would never say to a fellow coworker. If you guys weren't out drinking, cost you your job, get you in trouble with your boss, all of that. I'm not telling you anything you don't know. Moderation is the key to everything. And then just knowing who you are, Dana White and I are nearly the same age. I'm a year or two older than Dana White. The nightclub days are done and I know you live out in Vegas and I know that as a UFC head or whatever, but you're worth billions of dollars, you're the face of the UFC, a major sporting league. The nightclub days are done. You and your wife can't be in any city, not out drinking and doing all that. Anyway, I say all that and just putting all my cards on the table. I like Dana White. I've been, anybody go check my records of things I've said about Dana White for years. I've always been a fan. At one point, I was saying he'd be the perfect guy to be the commissioner of the NFL because he's got a pair and he'll stand up. And so it does bother me that somebody who I respect as a leader and as someone who's masculine and won't put up with woke culture, it bothers me that he damaged himself in this way and hurt it, damaged his credibility, possibly going to get disciplined. Disappoints me. That's all I want to say today. We'll play some tomorrow. We'll see you tomorrow."
