    "text": " I'm Josh Klein. And I'm Elise Hu. We host a podcast from Accenture called Built for Change. Every part of every business is being reinvented right now. That means companies are facing brand new pressures to use fast evolving technologies and address shifting consumer expectations. But with big changes, come even bigger opportunities. We've talked with leaders from every corner of the business world to learn how they're harnessing change to totally reinvent their companies. And how you can do it too. Subscribe to Built for Change now so you don't miss an episode. Believe, fundamentally, that food solves hunger, that shelters solve sleep, and that housing solves homelessness. And if we're going to solve the problem of those that are out on the streets that we define as homeless, we better solve the housing problem if we're going to have an impact. And that's why we established this framework, what we call a 10-year plan to end chronic homeless in San Francisco. And that's why we established this framework, what we call a 10-year plan to end chronic homeless in San Francisco. Everybody, I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report. And yes, we are back live in studio, live streaming on a rumble, YouTube and local. Share, subscribe, tap that notification bell if you have not. And that cold open there was in honor of San Francisco, where I spent a couple of days as I am sure you guys know I went to visit Elon Musk at Twitter in San Francisco, in communist California. Some of that video that we just showed you there in that cold open was video that I actually shot right outside the Twitter offices. So really, think about the juxtaposition of I'm upstairs at Twitter offices with literally the world's richest man. I walk downstairs and it is the walking dead man. These people, they are drugged out of their minds. It's absolutely everywhere. We're going to get more into that in just a minute. And I'm going to obviously tell you all about meeting Elon and some of the things that I couldn't get into on the Twitter thread. And I just want to say before we start that I missed you guys. You know, I did not plan on not having shows on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I don't know when the last time we did that kind of thing was. I got the call on Tuesday at about 5 p.m. Eastern and they were like, can you get to San Francisco right now? And we scrambled and scrambled. I sat in the second to last row 32 E in the middle and my seat would not recline, but I did it to go see Elon. And obviously it was it was well worth it. So we're going to talk all about that. But before we get to any of that, something major happened in the world that had nothing to do with me nor Elon nor Twitter, Finland, which is a country far away Nordic country. You may have heard of it. Something really incredible happened in Finland. There is a 59 year old farmer who is the now first trans female ice skater and he went ice skating. And well, I don't want to say it too much before we throw it on the clip. I just thought I had to show you this because it's so wonderful when a 59 year old man can go ice skating as a Finnish woman. The grace, the elegance, the femininity of that 59 year old male farmer as a female. This thing, that was the move. That's where you could see she was starting to lose it. Anyway, I thought it was important that you all see that. It's wonderful for equity. It's wonderful for diversity. And it's a very exciting time to be a male Finnish farmer if you've always wanted to be an ice skater. Okay, let's get to it. I went to Twitter. So here's what happened. Let's show you the first image. So the first image here, I tweeted this out. This was after midnight on Tuesday night. I got to the Twitter office is what you're seeing there on the left. That's just me sitting there obviously. I don't know what that little Twitter box was on the right. So this office, you really need to understand. I'm going to try to paint this whole picture as clearly as I can for you. That is the commissary. You have to remember they had about 7,500 people working at Twitter, not all from that office, but they obviously had hundreds and thousands of people working at that office. It's a ghost town. Now I was there after midnight, but they have fired about half the people there. And also before Elon took over, virtually everybody was working virtually people just because of COVID and then because they're a bunch of whiny cry babies who don't want to work, they decided not to go to work anymore. So they build these incredible facilities. I mean, they had, you know, you get coffee, you get wine, all the stuff that you guys know, these ridiculous things that these tech companies do to keep these people there, these man children basically, or these children children, you know, they had ping pong tables and foosball tables and all of this stuff, arcade games everywhere. It's like, does anyone work? Does anyone work? Just to be totally clear, we do have a Miss Pac-Man upstairs and I only let the guys use it five minutes a day. Anyway, that was the office. And then I went upstairs and I met with Elon. It was a little bit after midnight. There were still a bunch of programmers there. He's taken meetings in and out. Finally, he comes up to me, we chat for a little bit and then he basically says to me, not basically, this is almost verbatim what he says to me. He goes, he goes, is there something I can help you with right this moment? He goes, he's like, you know, otherwise I'm really tired. I was out all day and it's late and I've been working for about 20 hours in a row. He's like, but if there's something you really need me for right now, I'll stay. Otherwise, can we do this tomorrow? And I was like, wait a minute, literally the world's richest guy. The guy's running Tesla, he's running SpaceX, Neuralink, Twitter, probably 18 other things, the boring company, all of this stuff. He's willing to stay to deal with my little Twitter stuff. That just right there kind of sums up almost everything else that I'm going to tell you about today, the commitment that this guy has to fixing this thing. So basically, I was like, no, Elon, you could go take a nap and we'll do this again tomorrow. So let me read you the Twitter thread that I put out. So this is going to get into the nuts and bolts of what I learned about Twitter and we learned an awful lot. Oh, and I should preface this by saying that the way this all unfolded is that about two weeks ago, I got looped in with two engineers at Twitter because obviously I'm one of the more public people talking about the fact that something seems like it's really wrong with Twitter. There was a couple of weeks when Elon got it where the engagement really seemed like it was the old days. It exploded again. And in the last few weeks, it seems very depressed and that seems very odd. It's like, wait a minute, you got Twitter. It seems like it was fixed and now why did it get worse again? All sorts of people usually somewhat conservative leaning, but it's basically just not woke people are claiming something's wrong. So anyway, these two engineers started doing a deep dive into my account. And as they were doing a deep dive into the account, I mean, really going into the code, they started seeing things that they had not seen before. So that's why this escalated to the point of, oh, Elon wants to see you. So all that being said, here is my thread with some of the nitty gritty spent the last two days at Twitter in San Francisco talking to engineers, product, product managers and yes, Elon Musk learned a ton about what's going on before I share. Want to note that after a couple hour meeting, I asked Elon what I could share and he said anything that's true. Kind of just come back to me for one sec before we continue on that. I just want to hit that point because so we met on the second night for about two hours. And it was me, Elon had one guy with him. I apologize. I actually don't even know that I was introduced to get his name, but then it was me, Elon, this guy and David Sachs was with us. We talked about a whole bunch of stuff, including politics and everything else. And that's really where he lit up when, and I'll get to that in a second when we talked about some of my political awakening, which I think is similar to his. Think about how interesting that is that at the end of the thing, at the end of the conversation, I said, look, I'd love to share some of this stuff. Is there anything you don't want me to say? Anything that's true. Like, and he didn't have to think about it. Like he didn't know what I was talking about with the engineers. I was sitting with engineers with their laptops, you know, two guys with their laptops, coding, asking me all these questions and I'm asking them all these questions. He had no idea what I had seen. So the fact that his default position was anything that's true, I think that that says an awful lot about the guy. Okay, here's the thread. A fractal, rube Goldberg machine. That's what Elon Musk called Twitter. As they fix the code, more problems arise. A delicate balance he likened to a Jenga tower. One wrong move, the whole thing collapses. They're working nonstop and both times I met him were after midnight. I met with several engineers who were doing a deep dive on why my account and so many others seem to be absolutely crushed after that two or three week return to normalcy when Elon first took over. They still have more questions than answers, but they did learn a bunch of stuff. Accounts aren't just hit with labels that are obvious to insiders. They now found more secret labels which are causing shadow bands. Just so you guys know, this is what they found on my account and that's why I was called in. What was hit with all three recent abuse strike, recent misinformation strike, recent suspension strike. It's unclear so far what these strikes actually do, but for sure they suppress views and recommendations. They are trying to figure out to what extent. I also had many innocuous tweets labeled NSFW, not safe for work or NSFA, not safe for ads, which affect visibility in the timeline. Also there's an entire keyword database so that machine learning makes us, makes us, makes sure not to promote violence porn, etc. But it's a mess of overreaching words. Literally the word gay was on the keyword list, which would make you not advertiser friendly and harm the tweet in the algorithm. Backing up for a sec, they found the recent suspension strike on my account most interesting because it was from July 2022 when I was suspended for calling out Jordan Peterson's unjust suspension. So those suspension was reversed. The action on the count remained on the account remained. Elon was bringing in people in and out constantly and seems to be aware of pretty much every issue. He thinks maybe the entire code has to be torn down and start from scratch. At the end last night, he said that the whole situation is a flaming dumpster rolling down the street. So I assure you they are aware of the problems and Elon and the engineers are there all night trying to untie this crazy knot. Some changes they've made like the 4U tab have confused people and hurt engagement for accounts who have gotten the NSFA label without knowing. They also don't know for sure why things got so much better once Elon made the acquisition and why it seems far worse now. Tom is probably related to the excitement around Elon himself which also coincided with the World Cup but that doesn't explain why it feels so off right now. We'll share more in a bit but have to catch a flight. On a personal note, Elon is funny as hell, laughs a ton and it's just really obvious he cares about Twitter because he cares about free speech and the bigger problems facing the world. He doesn't need this headache, he chose it. Also huge shout out to David Sachs who is helping Elon clean up this mess because he believes in the fight for free speech as much as Elon does and massive thanks to the engineers who opened up their computers showed me literally everything I asked for and were total pros. Oh and one other thing for now, Elon really lit up when we talked about the shifting political landscape out and how anyone non-woke is now far right. That notion is deeply connected to how screwy things got at Twitter and he's working to fix it despite the huge challenges ahead and then Elon Musk responded to my very wordy Twitter thread saying accurate thread. Okay so there's obviously a lot there. We don't have to get into all of the nitty gritty about the specifics but the most interesting the banner headline stuff is that they have now found stuff deep within the code that is affecting certain people. I gave them a list of a whole bunch of people all over the political spectrum to look into and they found various things on various people's accounts and some accounts that I thought would be hit with things they didn't find anything but really I sat with these guys and I don't know if you've ever sat with computer engineers before but these guys from what I could tell take their work extremely seriously they're so curious as to what's going on. That was the cool thing like to sit with these guys they're opening up all these programs pulling information all over these trying to make sense of things but as Elon said they fix one little thing you know he mentioned something that they had a little bug in Twitter spaces and they fix that and then it crashed the Android app and this idea of course that he thinks the thing might be so screwed up. I mean this is the most important communication platform online whether you like it or not and with all the frustrations we all have with it and all of those things whether you like it or not it is what it is that he might have to scrap the whole thing and start again and that is incredibly interesting he also you know he probably has some people at the company still who are not mission aligned with him and he's trying to fix all of it.

So now I want to talk to you a little bit more about my general trip because it wasn't just going to Twitter and meeting Elon that was enlightening let's say. I also wandered around San Francisco now I know I do a lot of stuff on this show about making fun of Los Angeles and making fun of California and the homelessness and the drugs and the state of decay and the general chaos and all of that stuff. But I have to tell you completely joking aside with no glibness or just nothing other than flat out lay it out here's how it is San Francisco is disgusting. It is a absolute dystopian nightmare the level of homelessness there and it's not just homelessness. It's one thing it's one thing to have homelessness and every city has homelessness. There are some homeless people in Miami not many but there are some. It is a drug infused nightmare that felt like the walking dead. I mean droves of seemingly gangs of people but it's disorganized uncontrolled sort of craziness people wandering around with old clothes with blood on it and it was disgusting. Anyway here's just a little 15 second snippet of wandering around town. Just enjoying myself day here in San Francisco beautiful town nice weather everything seems just fine and you know just you know having fun okay yeah you know just enjoy. I am not showing you this to be gratuitous or anything else I think this what I kept thinking when I was there is for as much as some of us might talk about this and you know you could turn on Fox and they show you okay the homeless numbers in these blue cities compared to the red cities. It was mind blowing to me. I lived in New York City most of my adult life before my eight years in Los Angeles New York City wandering around at all hours in the morning I was never once afraid like I never once thought I was going to be attacked or mugged or stabbed or anything. Every second walking around the street you feel it because it's everywhere it is literally everywhere and if you get like a 15 foot you know runway where there's no homeless people just and it's not again it's not just homeless people it is major meth fentanyl addicts. People with no teeth with it is just I mean the smells were horrible everything but if you get a little runway where there's nobody in front of you for 15 feet then there's just trash everywhere and needles and all that. So this is a video that I took we just showed you this in the Gavin News something at the open but this is me just walking I just put my phone out I cannot believe I walked through this thing probably not the best healthiest idea to do this but I actually walked through this this is basically about I don't know 500 feet from Twitter offices so you quite literally have the world's richest man upstairs and then downstairs this is what you have. And this goes on and on and on and I kid you not here I mean here's just some random pictures that I snapped back I asked me for 20 bucks the one with no pants on the left the other guys over here I was it some I mean it was just nuts like I can't even explain this properly but I really I was wandering around because my meetings with Elon kept getting delayed which is why we ended up meeting so late so I just had you know I could wander around the city during the day and I went to Sunglass Hut which was in what I thought was like a pretty decent area but it's it's sprawling it's absolutely everywhere and I'm going to link this obviously to everything that's going on politically today and everything else but I think it's important that you see that it's crazy to me that that's not on television every day for these for these liberals or these lefties or Democrats who think that it's you know it's that factory settings nonsense Democrats like people and Republicans like money right like that's what these people actually think and if you think for a second that those tolerant and diverse progressives that run that city you think they care about people look what they have done to the people and it's not just the drug addicts and the homeless people that they have ruined life for I kid you not when you see people walking in San Francisco almost everyone walks with their head down you're never going to see anyone smile I assure you of that and there is there is generally a sense of terror an absolute sense of terror I at one point because my meetings were getting delayed I realized I had to eat I was like all right I have no idea I might be in with Elon for six hours I better eat something so I could not find a restaurant to go do because everything was so disgusting that I was like all right let me put in my phone I'm just going to put in steakhouse because usually you'll find a steakhouse in a somewhat decent area so I went to go to master house if you ever went to master house every I've been to master is in Malibu and master is all over the place they're pretty freaking fantastic you know high-end steak houses I walked there it was no that video we just showed you of all the the homeless people the thing that was me walking over to master is I walk there and outside there's basically four guys cooking something and it wasn't steak cooking meth or fentanyl I don't know if you cook fentanyl or whatever it was but and then I just was like no forget this I'm not going in there I had dinner at my friend's house thank you buddy it was it was just unbelievable anyway as long as I was in California for the two days I thought you know what I'm going to stay here for a day or two I'll do some stuff down in LA with Prager you and I'll say to hi to a couple remaining friends pretty much everyone has left so I did go to Los Angeles and I have to say before we show you anything from LA compared to San Francisco Los Angeles is Shangri-La it's a dump but it's Shangri-La compared to San Francisco I went in I needed some hairspray needed some hairspray so I was going to go to a CVS over there I tweeted this one walking into CVS in LA anyone know offhand how much stuff you're allowed to steal without getting prosecuted trying to decide which hairspray to snag we did a little research on this what it turned out to be guys 950 bucks you are allowed to steal I mean really think about this in Los Angeles now I did pay for it I got some sort of Garnier Foctease gel I didn't even get a hairspray it was about nine bucks pretty solid I would say a good deal I did decide to pay for it because that's just you know I'm an upstanding citizen of these United States of America but you are literally allowed to steal up to 950 dollars worth of stuff and they will not prosecute you that means if you live in Los Angeles you can walk into Best Buy and you can take a PlayStation 5 Connor how much is a PlayStation 5 Roland for these days about 500 bucks so 500 bucks how much are the games now probably 50 70 bucks for a PS5 game so 70 bucks let's say you took five of those games right now you're at 350 you could you could get six games according to my math that's gonna get you to about 920 bucks you can walk into a Best Buy take a PlayStation 5 although I know they're very hard to get so you may not even have one there and you can get six games and walk out of there and they will not prosecute you and me this schmuck paying for my own gel just craziness anyway there's been a whole bunch of other videos I could have shown you a bunch more from LA we'll just do two that have been going viral these were not shot by me but I did comment on them just to show you and you'll see why again I'm not doing this to mock homeless people I'm not doing this to be gratuitous we are right now at a really interesting divergence in America we are at a fork in the road and it's becoming more and more obvious which way will we go will we go woke and socialist destruction or will we go freedom loving and capitalist loving and decency and all of that stuff so here's a video from Los Angeles that's been making the rounds take a look at this one but you guys you have everywhere man you got it you got a baseball bat you got your hey i'll send it to the cup out of here what the wow wow look look how look how crazy they are at you guys once the city you guys once the city gonna come clean this up is that propane okay I hope you guys are pissed off I'm pissed off that they threw my phone that guy has a cell phone what the f*** is going on we're gonna show you one more of those but you really need to understand again this is sprawling all over the city I actually had dinner on Friday no no I had dinner on Saturday night no no dinner on Thursday night man it was a crazy trip I had dinner on Thursday night with some friends in hollywood we were at a extremely nice restaurant actually but outside it's just it's just insane it's just that and it's everywhere and and what's so interesting about this is think about these last two and a half years of this bizarro matrix that we're living in we have constantly been told about public health we we quarantine children and we didn't let people visit dying relatives and we force people to wear masks and inject themselves with all this stuff do you think that the people that are in charge of LA or san francisco are doing anything related to public health can you even let let's just say this was all about covid you have all of these people doing drugs with no sanitation like it's just absolutely insane here here's one more and then we're gonna get to the other way you can go on that fork in the road so it's everywhere guys you you get the point okay so what what does this mean if you're watching this and you're going all right day but i see it i get it these are these are big government policies these are blue run cities and states uh what do you do what do you do well there are simple answers it does not have to be this way but it is consistently this way when democrats take office because they purport to like people but apparently not those people i don't think they like themselves very much but that's a different psychological topic we'll get into another time but why are san francisco and los angeles like this why did a guy like me leave los angeles and move to a place like florida which if you would have said that to me 10 years ago i would have said that you were insane well there's a very simple answer to it it's good governance good governance rule of law doing the right thing and doing basically the things that we all knew were saying say 10 or 20 years ago so what's going on here in miami well you may remember a couple months back i interviewed miami mayor frances swarez on why miami is flourishing and why it is not the distopian nightmare that we just showed you from san francisco and los angeles the flourishing is every day i wake up and there's a new los angelino coming to my town now i'm starting to worry but and i've been in an elected office for 13 years so maybe there's a correlation between the 14 and 13 but look i i think uh you're right i always say miami's an idea it's more than a city and it's an idea born out of a trauma what's the trauma the trauma is many people in mind were kicked out of their country of truth were exiled uh because a leader in their country said give me all your businesses give me all your property don't worry we'll make everything equal and you know what they did they made everything equal yeah equally miserable for everybody right and so we are traumatized by that and i think that's why miamians are so fundamentally pro america we're so fundamentally pro um you know sort of fair market and free market uh and we believe in freedom and liberty right we believe in freedom and liberty our parents our grandparents know what they fled we're doing it right here and we have a diversity in the true sense of diversity not that that even matters i would not care if all of my neighbors were white or all of my neighbors were black or half of them were cuban and a quarter of them were venas wailin and then we had some Bolivians and some asians i wouldn't care if they were decent citizens that's the thing that is the american dream nobody really cares what you care about is hey you came here or somebody before you came here are you going to work hard are you going to be a decent citizen are you going to work to not destroy this this tenuous experiment of freedom which is not the default position of humanity you only have to look at the history books to look at how precious this incredible free experiment that we have running right now not sure how much longer it's going to last it's like this is freaking precious what we have right now the default position is to have authoritarian leaders and dictators and have most of the people living in filth while the elite live in their castles but we are doing it right in some places and i continue to assoir as he talked about why other cities are going that direction while miami is going in the right direction so how does it make any sense i thought you need the government just needs more of our money to make things work but you're keeping taxes low and some and we don't have you know roads exploding and all sorts of stuff yeah it's it's so counterintuitive how is it possible how is it possible so let's let me give you a real example right if you are living in new york city right now cost of living differential between york and miami is two to one so in york the median home price is a million dollars in miami median home price is five hundred forty two to one right in addition to that in york you're paying fifty if you're in the highest tax bracket a lot of new yorkers are because again you're cost of living well they're all coming down here now well but check it out let's do the math right you're paying fifty four cents out of every dollar in taxes that means that for every dollar you earn you take home forty six cents in miami you get sixty three cents right it is a huge delta so what's happening now in the united states is very similar what happened to troy at the industrial revolution right which is that you're seeing this change from industrial to digital and miami is the only city in america that got the memo and has basically built its entire economy to capitalize on what i call tsunami of opportunity and cities like new york and and san francisco and silica molly thought they're too big to fail and i'll tell you they they're not okay one more time guys i'm not doing this to be like oh look how great it is i move to the right place and blah blah blah i'm doing this to show you there there is a blueprint i always talk about the wider florida blueprint related to the san justice but it's also happening at a city level and then it happens at a town level and eventually below that it happens at a at a community level and hopefully a family level and then believe it or not you know what it all boils down to the individual level that's how this thing can work you know i texted uh... mayor sware is right before the show started i said i'm gonna i'm gonna say a couple nice things about you on the show today and about miami he just texted me while we were playing that clip you know how many homeless people we have in miami i mean this is wild guys six hundred forty and he said he's working to make sure that we'll have zero he wants to figure out a way but the thing is our homeless people here our old-fashioned homeless people they're not zombies they're not whacked out on crazy drugs of course there's some level of drugs here but the drug thing this fentanyl thing i mean that i'm telling you i saw something that is very that is much scarier than what i really thought this thing was and i thought it was pretty bad couple numbers just to give you a little context so we have six hundred forty homeless people in miami right now seventy thousand in los angeles twenty thousand in san francisco i'm pretty sure i shook all their hands on my walk uh... and there's about oh uh just under six hundred thousand in america as a total so there is some real stuff to talk about here okay and i just want to say one other thing about mayor sware is because look at this picture the two weeks ago dude i don't remember if we showed this on the show but two weeks ago i take the team out for dinner uh our intern joseph was visiting i took the guys out in coconut grove over here we had a great dinner and then i just bump into the mayor he's just wandering around saying hello to people a lot of outdoor seating in miami was a beautiful night he's literally just smiling and shaking hands with people and and as i tweeted what did i write there i said something like uh day people often say dave what's really the difference between miami and los angeles in miami you bump into the mayor wandering around with a huge smile on his face saying hello to everyone in l a the mayor can get you 20 percent off crack on the street corner uh and just i don't want to do any misinformation here apparently she can get your 25 percent if you know somebody okay that's counterinpass you'll get your 25 percent off your local crack if you're in los angeles so apologies please don't delete me okay so why are these why is this divergence happening and and why is it widening by the second well it's pretty obvious one side has decided that competency has nothing to do with how you will hire people it has nothing to do with whether you will bring in the best engineers if it's at twitter it has nothing to do with whether you'll bring in the best public servants if it if it's in the government it's all about ideological possession that is their total that is the sum totality of what they believe in they believe in identity beyond everything else and if you don't believe me here's black lesbian press secretary korean john piaire explaining that uh yeah uh it's that um i'm certainly not going to get ahead of the president that is not something that i can do uh from here but look and i kind of said it at the top the bine hares administration is the most diverse in history that is a fact and we expect to uh we expect this trend to continue uh the cabinet is majority people of color for the first time in history the cabinet is majority female for the first time in history the majority of white house senior staff identify as female 40 percent of white house senior staff identify as part of racially diverse communities a record six assistance to the president are openly lgbtq nobody cares about any of that well i can't say nobody i mean i guess you guys care but no sane person cares what we elect you people to do is hopefully keep the wheels on the car right we have a car it's going down a rickety road all we ask that you guys do make sure the wheels stay on this thing because the roads in bad shape we're about to go over this this bridge that thing's kind of banged up uh could we do that and what they do is higher based on diversity and she's really proud of that like that is the pinnacle of her success and it's the pinnacle i would say of the biden administration success they have majority people of color in the cabinet now that that's kind of interesting because we don't have a majority of people of color in the country so are you guys discriminating against white people actually you are but somehow in your world that's not discrimination they've a much i think she said majority female i think she said majority female identifying cabinet i female identifying and it's like yeah we're the ones that hate women it's so stupid it's so stupid but again it goes to nothing about their expertise pete buddha judge was the mayor of south bend indiana it's a tiny little city in indiana and then they made him transportation secretary there was probably thousands of people who are city planners and engineers who have worked their entire life so that they could have a job like transportation secretary really look at the map of the country figure out what roads need to be fixed do we need to do high-speed rail here what's going on with the airlines what can we do related to competition can the government get some regulation out of the way so we can fix some of these things you know we're working on an international tour in may that hopefully i'll have some more info about soon and we were looking at some flights last week and it's incredible to fly from country to country in parts of europe it's as cheap as like sixty five bucks like i was trying to put together the budget for this thing and i'm thinking okay i'm gonna have to buy all these tickets for all my guys i don't know is that a thousand bucks a seat to get out of the some of these countries sixty five bucks it cost me i think it was 800 bucks to get seat 32 in the middle to go to san francisco from miami last week so many things are screwed up but that doesn't matter guys we've got gay peat he's gay it doesn't matter he's gay here's more from biden and diversity if you hire people based on diversity you will not hire the best of the best what i would like you to do is hire the best of the best i don't care if our transportation secretary is indian i don't care if our defense secretary is a lesbian and i don't care if my god if we hired a white person the scariest of all things but we do something else we hire incompetent people based on diversity here is dr fatima cody uh she is the biden administration deputy of health for 2025 for this current administration and she's talking about the current dietary guidelines and i just want you to listen to this woman and you tell me if she is the best of the best if you die it you lose weight right the number one cause of obesity is genetics that means if you are born to parents that have obesity you have 50 to 85 likelihood of having the disease yourself even with optimal diet exercise sleep management stress management so when people see families that have obesity the assumption is what are they feeding those kids hey lady first off is there some genetic component to obesity obviously but do you see what they want you to do they want you to think you have no capacity over your own life they want you to think that if you drink a 64 ounce coke with all of that sugar and you eat crap all day and they lock you in your house and you don't exercise and all the you have no ability to control any of these things do you know what you do have ability to control it's your own life it's the one thing that you can probably control on this earth you can control how much you eat how much you exercise but they want to diminish those things it's why we spent two and a half years of covid not talking about hey get some exercise that that obesity is the highest co-morbidity related to covid we we told people stay at home order in all the time don't do anything right we literally closed gyms we closed beaches we told people don't get vitamin don't walk out there these people are all incompetent but sometimes every now and again it's worse than just incompetence the same people who see racism everywhere well i should say racism everywhere except where it actually it is actually is they bring on people like Ilhan Omar Ilhan Omar who married her brother google it it's true eventually they'll remove it from google she married her brother she is a really awful person she has been all for defunding the police she has absolutely destroyed Minneapolis she hates america despite being a first generation immigrant who moved here from samalia became incredibly powerful and she spends every day trying to undermine this country that has been far far too good for someone like her well she was on cnn yesterday talking to dana bash and dana asked her about her previous anti-semitic competent comments and here's some double speak for you so when you apologized for the all about the benjamins comment you said anti-semitism is real and i'm grateful for jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-semitic tropes what did you learn a lot um i certainly did not or was not aware that the word hypnotized uh was a trope um i wasn't aware of of the fact that there are tropes about Jews and money um that has been a very enlightening part of of this journey yeah it's been so enlightening of course she knew exactly what she is doing she's just a like there's nothing we can do with these people like there's nothing we can say about them that would shame them and then adam shift and adam shift i did not i wasn't sure this i had the google it he's jewish and i just like to say is it you we apologize if i have to write a letter to somebody and just like we don't want anything to do with adam shift i'll gladly do it but he sits there knowing he is sitting with this vile racist woman and he does not say a word but how hilarious is that's what the panel on cnn is it's adam shift adam shift who completely made up the russia collusion hoax who now is running for senate he's a congressman he's now running for senate in cali so we'll probably get him it'll be even worse in california you have him you have eric swalwell was the other guy sitting there he's the one that slept with the chinese spy and you know it's true because the media refuses to debunk it and kevin makarti keep saying it and then you have illhan omar who basically is an islamist and and at some level is at at the very least i mean she's deeply anti-american she defunded the police in minneapolis they destroyed minneapolis and then she blamed the police for not doing their job on top of marrying her brother and a whole bunch of other stuff these are awful awful human beings right they really there's just no other way to say it if that is what you use your power for i don't know how i can describe you anyway so do you see what i'm getting at their priorities are so off they're so far off that they're automatically by default damaging the very people they govern and speaking of another one of those people here is new york governor kathy hokal and i cannot believe that this woman i know i call her kathy c word usually i cannot believe that the people of new york reelected her but they did and they will now get what they deserved she still this is this weekend she still will not hire unvaxed health care workers even right now with everything we know take a look our health care systems seem in desperate need of staff right now we've had ambulances waiting five hours at our local emergency rooms to unload patients the hospitals the nursing homes say they're waiting for doh guidance on whether they can hire any of those workers back what's the latest with that it's a problem but i don't think the answer is to make have someone who comes in who's sick be exposed to someone who gives them the coronavirus uh give them covid 19 i don't know that that's the right answer in fact i'm pretty sure it's not so all right guys we're getting demonetized that botox bitch has no idea what she's saying okay the fact is that if you get the vaccine you can still get and transmit covid more people who have gotten the vaccine have died of covid than people who have not and if the vaccine worked and someone walked in who was unvaccinated then the sick person the other person would not get sick right it's all so extraordinarily stupid but they keep going they cannot that botox bitch that's a good line we're gonna we gotta use that one again um it's just endless with these people someone please if you are in New York and you're saying and i know it's a thin little sliver of people that we could say that about i have a couple family members that are pretty decent but like someone sue the hell out of her the idea that the governor is saying we will not hire unvaxed people while they're having these shortages while uh ambulances are backed up and emergency rooms are overflowing and everything else it's like if any of that is true and that's what you're doing somebody sue this woman put her on the penal colony of rurapente that's a star trek reference i think it might be the first one i've ever made on this show this guy john kabell got a close-up of uh of her necklace look at this thing the woman walks around with a vax necklace tell me this is not a cult but speaking of cults here's bill gates admitting that vaccines don't work and that's why we need more of them anyway so antibodies antipersils we think we can also have very early in an epidemic the thing you can inhale that will mean that you can't be infected a blocker an inhaled blocker we also need to fix the three problems with vaccines the current vaccines are not infection blocking uh they're not broad so when new variants come up you lose protection and they have very short duration particularly in the people who matter which are old people and every one of those things is is fixable in fact doing that work is going to help vaccinology very very broadly vaccinology i didn't even know that that was a word okay fine what does bill gates have to do with your health how did he become this person that we are supposed to listen to about all of these things when by the way we've shown it to you many times before we have all of the videos them lying about everything related to the vaccine that it works that you won't get covid that you won't transmit covid blah blah blah blah you get all of it and they just keep marching on that when i talk about how these people are evil and soulless and everything else it's not just because i disagree with them politically i might have every disagreement with them related to abortion and taxes and foreign policy and everything and you can have principled people on both sides of an issue you could have confused people on both sides of an issue but these people who get everything wrong and then they just keep marching forward despite reality that is something twisted and evil i don't know of a better uh i don't know how to describe it better than that but it just keeps continuing so the other thing that happened while i was gone this is wild stuff and you are not seeing this on mainstream media and you must understand if the mainstream media ignores something if they ignore something you must know that it is real this is exactly what they do and to even prove that so you know i go to twitter i released this entire thread which with pretty incredible stuff related to what's going on at twitter do you think anyone covered that at cnn or fox news or anything else no but if you go and you go on cnn site and you search elon musk or you search twitter you're gonna find all these hit pieces about him but then when people find out interesting things about the code the code that was supposedly used by darndel trump to manipulate your uh election with russian bots uh they go crazy about that but when reality hits they ignore it so ignoring is becoming the number one type of fake news that's one thing okay the other thing that i missed while i was gone is that project veritas which you guys all know project veritas and i've i've had uh what's the name i've had uh james o'keepe on the show um they do great work uncovering uh basically they get they do they do spy videos people have accused them of manipulation a whole bunch but a lot of the stuff that they do is quite good uh they sat down with a guy at a restaurant named jordan tishton walker he is advisor director uh and he basically said that yes they do want to mutate the virus meaning they do want to mutate covid and other viruses so that they can keep people vaccinated this is and then just watch this whole thing this is wild visor ultimately is thinking about mutating covid well that's not what we say to republic do you know don't tell anyone this is you have a problem you have a problem you have a problem you have a problem like i first born like no you know the virus is mutating yeah well one of the things we're exploring is like why don't we just mutate it ourselves so we could work on complete the pre-adptemberly developed new vaccines right so we have to do that and we're going to do that though that's a risk of like as you could imagine no one wants to be having a follow-up company mutating to be like very controlled to make sure that there's virus doesn't create something like you know it's always everywhere it's so crazy but it's the way that the virus started it will not be to be honest like it's no sense if desire should talk about it nowhere i'm like yeah i know meet jordan tristian walker a director of research and development strategic operations and m rna scientific planning advisor it sounds like gain of function to me i don't know it's all bit different i think it's different it's like this it's definitely not getting a function what sounds like it is i mean it's okay no no no no no no no no no direct it evolution is very different and we're not supposed to begin function research or the viruses like yeah very run and on but you do like these like selected directional mutations to try to see if you can make more potent yeah so there there is research on the way about that i don't know how that's going to worry we're not being more out-predicted because like jesus first this is absolutely wow this guy is a director advisor fact okay he is doing research with the m rna vaccine fact and what he talks about there is something called directed evolution directed evolution this is gain of function and that's he's playing these linguistic games around it gain of function when you manipulate right what do they want to do they want to mutate a virus they want to gain a function of the virus so you have a virus i mean this is this is just like basic stuff you have a virus that's out there then what were they doing it at wuhan they were studying how do you manipulate that virus to gain a function of that virus so you can do something else whether you want to weaponize it or anything else but they play all of these linguistic games so when the guy says to him that uh directed evolution sounds a lot like game uh gain of function he's like well not really but then you know he's laughing through it any kinds of admits it and if you want to link this to our earlier story where we started today remember when everyone kept saying for years what you guys do with twitter is shadow banning and what jack dorsey testified was we do not shadow ban so when the twitter files came out you know what they called it visibility filtering so it's the exact same thing whether it's directed evolution gain of function or visibility filtering and shadow banning it is the same exact thing so anyway this guy is now being exposed these are his words right these are his words he's being exposed by project veritas and then james o'keef walks in they have the aha moment and then all hell breaks loose hey there is this you take him you work for fizer my question for you is why is fizer want to hide from the public the fact that they're mutating the covid viruses this rule life i'm literally oh why are i was trying to impress a person on a date what you're lying this is absurd don't touch me well this is not why the way don't why are you doing don't tell anybody who's just working at a company who literally called the public you f*** off you really did please read the box please watch the box please please don't lock your door please don't lock your door give me why is there so stuff please unlock please unlock the door please unlock the door we're trying to get along the door i lock the door i mean it's like to catch a predator it's wild but anyway look more and more will come out of this of course but this will continue that divergence that we have in society much like the twitter files there'll be a whole bunch of people who see that video who start thinking and knowing that fizer is interested in gain of function research and there will be this whole other set of people and it's a shrinking set of people which is the the white pill on all of this right it is the good news on all of this the silver lining on all of this uh that will just take what the machine gives them and the machine intentionally ignores the truth so what is it that these guys have to do well as i mentioned project veritas and chains will keep her just back on twitter because elan brought them back they were suspended a long time ago do you think they were suspended because perhaps the government had been working with twitter to suspend people is that such a crazy conspiracy theorist is that like so crazy to think that i'm not so sure so what do they do they have to make sure that they ignore certain stories but they also have to ban people which is why they ban project veritas it's why Robert Malone was banned and it's why i was banned for saying mandates were coming and it's why Jordan Peterson was banned for saying that uh who who was it that had the penis that got the penis back and then well elan page was Elliot page or any of that stuff there's so many stupid characters in this idiotic play that we're in it's hard to remember all their names you know anyway here is a new york times journalist her name is mara gay of course her name is mara gay uh this is a woman who once said that the ruben report was a white supremacist talk show she said that in the new york times i did not i did not know that uh here she is on msmbc freaking out because trump's going to be allowed back on facebook you don't want to whether you're a company or an institution you don't want to hand over the keys um to democracy to have someone destroy that democracy dude so do you want to be that institution that really helps take down the country ah so letting donald trump back on facebook will help take down the country donald trump who was president for four years and we had a great economy we had all of these middle east peace steel side our border was way more protected we had other countries pay in their share into nato and the un and a whole bunch more uh if we bring that guy back and we let him post on facebook we're going to destroy the country i don't think we need donald trump to do that i think the democrats and the corporate press and everything else are doing just fine on that right uh but returning to twitter and linking this with the coverage of the left and and and the disaffected liberals that i'm always talking about what we need to do is expand this blueprint right the blueprint of what's working in florida which is also connected to the bravery of someone like elan musk who remembered that lifelong democrat had never voted for republican until he voted for my raflores because he lives technically he lives in in texas um but now has said he will support elan musk what we need is the whole bunch of sane people to come together take the blueprint of florida export that and and and let's see what happens so right after i met with elan musk to bring this whole thing around uh the very next morning he was hopping on a plane that night even though i left him at probably 130 a.m or something he was hopping on a flight going to dc and here's who he was meeting with yeah he was meeting with uh mccarthy that's right leader mccarthy right there and they were meeting he also for the record he did we meet with the keem jeffries keem jeffries is the leader of the democrats in the house but here is a guy who is just fighting for free speech who has extraordinary influence and power and he's meeting with the republicans and the democrats to to hopefully ensure that places like twitter social media companies and where our information our information is sourced from and pushed out to the world that it will be more impartial uh i wanted to show you that picture specifically because as i've been saying for the last two or three weeks i think the republicans are turning right now i think they are not going to be as ineffectual as usual i think they are going to do everything they can in the house at least to cut the funding for stuff the house can't do everything without the senate and of course the democrats still do have the senate um they can't do everything but they can do an awful lot so the left left elan musk and you know what the left left another guy i showed you this tweet once yeah the left left jordan peterson too i wasn't a conservative until liberals cowtowed to radicals ain't it the truth and speaking of jordan peterson uh jordan peterson was on a very small podcast on the computer machine you may have heard of this thing it's called the joe rogan experience uh and he was on a couple days ago and they started talking about what's going on with the world economic forum what is going on with these people who meet to decide that top down layer of we control you down there i thought this was quite good i've been trying to understand the driving ideas underneath this globalist utopia tyranny that seems to be developing from the top down and i think it's driven at least in part by this religious vision that i already described you know that you have to construe culture itself especially industrial culture as the tyrannical father raping and pillaging everything in its way which is unbelievably dangerous way to think to one-sided and uh the the the idea that you have to impose limits to growth on people in order to have a sustainable planet and so when i look at ideas like that that first assumption you know the planet has too many people on it it's like i don't like to hear people say that because when i hear that i think okay buddy who exactly are you thinking about getting rid of oh well it's not like that it's like yeah it's like that it has to be like that it is absolutely like that like i've already felt that i'd be that war for the last six months and i would say it's war because what i observed happening in europe when i was there last was that well you can see this you don't have to be in europe to see it but it's more direct if you're there is that it's pretty damn clear that the globalist utopians are willing to sacrifice the poor for the sake of the planet it's like that'd be fine with me not really that'd be fine with me if the consequence of your actions raising energy prices for example actually produced an improvement in those things you wanted to improve if you're if you're cure for the planet is well you know we got to put 350 million poor people in jeopardy just so that things are hypothetically better in a hundred years i think yeah i don't think so buddy and also it's a little bit too convenient for me that your prescriptions to save the planet are accompanied by this is insistance that the only way forward to that is to give you all the power it's like there's a bit of a moral hazard in that don't you think it's like i'm just saving the planet give me all the power it's like you want to save the planet or do you want the power and let's let's put the first the second one first because the probability that you're a saint or the messiah is pretty damn low man he's good he just gets it he's good um look this top-down thing it ain't working and we must fight it and i love that Jordan said i feel like i've been at war for the last six months you know i i happen to know Jordan pretty well i think he's been at war for a lot longer i think we're all at war at some level i think this divergence that i'm talking about uh it's going to lead us to a very weird place so we need more people to come down the path that i'm trying to lay out for you good guys right here and i think it actually is happening um but when you see that uh when you see a guy like Jordan Peterson now fully saying the liberals went bananas right when you see a guy like elan musk telling people before the election vote for republicans not because he thinks they're so great but they're better it's like that means one side has gone completely crazy and how i wanted to close the show today there is a guy he is a soviet kgb defector he's long since passed uh but in the 80s he was putting out a lot of videos from lectures that he did his name is yuri bezmanog you may have seen some of these videos they go viral every now and again and he describes exactly how the communists the socialists the soviets would destroy america from the inside and one of the things that he focuses on most is how you'd go after the kids you'd go after education so you could just you don't have to shoot guns you don't have to drop bombs you don't have to invade you could actually destroy young people's minds and then with a little bit of patience you could take over a whole country here's one little snippet of that you'll see it's a little pixelated right up trumpet then it does clear itself up education this struck them from learning something which is constructive pragmatic efficient instead of mathematics physics foreign languages chemistry teach them history of urban warfare natural food uh home economy your sexuality anything as long as it takes you away okay uh social life replace traditionally established institutions and organizations with fake organizations take away the initiative from people take away this possibility from naturally established links between individuals group of individuals and society at lunch and replace them with artificially bureaucratically controlled bodies instead of social life and friendship between neighbors establish social workers institutions the people who are on payroll of whom society no bureaucracy the main concern of social workers is not your family not you not social relations between groups of people the main concern is to get the paycheck i mean it goes on and on we'll play you more clips from him over the coming weeks um but what he's describing there is exactly the thing that jordan peterson now says he is at war with it is the exact same thing that we spent a whole bunch of time over the last two three weeks talking about it the world economic form it's not about individuals it's not about personal responsibility they want to break down all of those things and they don't want social interactions they want social workers you will be a worker you will be a piece of the machine nothing more than the cog than a cog in the machine i would prefer not and i think you would prefer not and we got work to do nothing better to do than save the world guys it's me monday over at the roob and report locals community i put up a babylon bheadlatt i just thought this was perfect in light of everything that i've been talking about today having maxed out
