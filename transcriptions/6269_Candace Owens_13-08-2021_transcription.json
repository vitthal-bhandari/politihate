    "text": " Welcome back. This week I had a Twitter debate, just like I have a Twitter debate. Every week, this time it was with an individual by the name of Serena Danyari. After we exchanged a few tweets, I invited Serena to this show for an open dialogue, and I was absolutely thrilled that unlike most people on the left who won't talk to me face to face, Serena agreed to join me in person. Unfortunately, after my producers booked Serena's flight and hotel, Serena backed out. So instead of having that conversation, we're going to have this segment of counterpoints. So this is where the entire debate began. It was actually about vaccines, and Serena came across my rhetoric, which she deemed to be anti-vaxx because I have been very open with the fact that I am not comfortable with the rush nature of the COVID-19 vaccines or the pressures around getting the vaccines. And so I've made a personal decision not to get the vaccine. This deeply upset Serena. Serena tweeted to me, you are the one who is deranged and urging your millions of followers that the only true means of preventing a deadly virus that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives is not effective. Live without fear, by all means, but to spread delusional lies is morally repugnant. And this amazed me. It amazed me that Serena called me delusional because in case you did not know, Serena is trans. So I had stumbled across the internet as somebody who is a trans woman who is accusing me of being delusional because I am making a personal decision regarding my own health. And it actually gets even more bizarre. Serena went on in this Twitter exchange and of course I answered back and I said, I just want to make sure that you are a trans woman telling me that I am a delusional person because I choose not to get a vaccine. You believe that between you and I, I am living in a delusion. Is that correct? To which Serena answered, yes, queen, I believe you are delusional. While my decision as a trans woman to get breast implants and turn my penis into a vagina impacts literally no one but me, your choice to deny science and spread anti-vax misinformation that spread delusion impacts many. Denying science, a trans woman is accusing me of denying science. Is biology not science? Is anatomy not science? Are none of these things physiology? Is that not science? So this is where we are in 2021 where we are now being preached to you about the reality of science by people that have made decisions to transform their bodies and believe fully that they can actually pick their genders. And of course this spat went on, it went back and forth and Serena then said, I say this to you with an open heart. There is no singular experience of womanhood. Reducing women to anatomy and reproductive abilities is an insult to so many women trans and cis. What about the women who have fertility issues? Are they less of a woman? Those with hysterectomies, period. Okay, I want to respond this because it's important. I have been a very loud voice against the trans gendered movement and I feel that I am one of the few voices that is standing up for women. I want to continue to do that right now on CounterPoint. We'll be right back to this episode of Candace in just one second. But first, I know a lot of women can relate but I do not know anything about cars. I simply want mine to work. So thank goodness for rockauto.com. Ordering parts on rockauto.com is so much easier than walking into a store and being made to answer questions like is your odyssey an LX or an EX and then they usually just have to order the part online anyways because it's impossible to keep every single part in stock. Rockauto.com always offers the lowest prices possible rather than changing prices based on demand like airlines do. Why spend up to twice as much for the same auto parts? Rockauto.com is a family business serving auto parts customers online for 20 years. Go to rockauto.com the shop for auto and body parts from hundreds of manufacturers. The catalog is unique and remarkably easy to navigate. Quickly see all the parts available for your vehicle and choose the brand specifications and the prices that you prefer. Go to rockauto.com right now and see all the parts available for your car or truck. Be sure to write Candace in the How Did You Hear About Us box so that they know that it was me that sent you. Now back to the show. Counterpoint number one is that this culture of the media and the academia and people pretending that being a woman means to simply walk in and pay for a cosmetic procedure is deeply misogynistic. My second counterpoint to you, Serena, is that a cosmetic procedure believing that going in and getting breast implants makes you a woman is an insult. I'll tell you why because what this trans movement represents is a caricature of what it means to be a woman. Being a woman isn't just having a procedure and getting your breasts on. I don't believe that Dolly Parton is more of a woman because she has extra large breasts. I want to give this to you another way and I'll ask the questions, Serena. Do you believe that you can pick your race? Do you think race is a social construct? Do you believe that if you dyed your skin black and said yo, yo, yo, what up my N word that would mean that you were suddenly black or would you realize that that would be a caricature of what it means to be black? That would be a joke to believe that because you said a yo and you rap and you wear a chain and some gold teeth. Hey, I'm black. No, that would be an insult and a stereotype and it is an insult and a stereotype to believe that makeup and breasts makes somebody a woman. And as my last counterpoint to you, Serena, I would like to address your idea that some women have hysterectomies. That's true. Some women have fertility issues. Is that make them less of a woman? You asked and let me answer that question. No, it does not make them less of a woman. In fact, it affirms their womanhood. Only women can have hysterectomies. Only women go through menstruation. Only women can talk about that struggle of what it's like going through IVF and trying to conceive a child and what pressures that puts on the female body that actually affirms their womanhood. These are experiences that only women can have. And when you decide that that means nothing, that you can walk in and pick a plastic surgeon and suddenly that makes you me, it's deeply hurtful and deeply upsetting and I will continue to be a voice against it. Thank you guys so much. As always, I always invite anybody to have a dialogue that is willing. Up next and in continuing this conversation, one man's story of his transition and the regret that followed. Stay tuned."
