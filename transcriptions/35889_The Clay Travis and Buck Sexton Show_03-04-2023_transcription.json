If you saw an interview like on her hands and knees, like basically worshiping at the altar of this dude who decides to identify as a girl. And he's doing it in the most, I would say, performatively absurd manner possible. In other words, not only is he a dude that identifies as a girl, but he is like the most stereotypical girly girl you could possibly imagine. And again, this is a lifelong man who decides to identify as a woman. I tie it in with the leatama situation where all over the country, women of the year are dudes. And so I was thinking about this over the weekend because outkick had a story up about it. And it's Bud Light that is deciding to be the official beer of this fake chick. And beer overwhelmingly is is consumed by men, actual men. And Bucky got me thinking in all this crazy trans talk, can you name a famous celebrity driven woman who has decided to become sorry, man who has decided, no, I'm going to cross over now, woman who has decided to become a man. That is clear chick that decides I want to identify as a man. I can't even name a famous one. Can you name one? Only in your head can you think of one? Previously, previously famous people who are women who want attention, I would say, have switched over to become, but no one has become famous. I think this is the point you're making. That's right. From a female to as the result of a female to male transition, there's certainly not winning any athletic competitions. We all know why. So that's for it. So for women out there, I wouldn't love to hear from women 800 282, 282, 882 only women. All right, I don't want to hear from any dudes on this. Why is it so bucked by and large? I was thinking about this a lot over the weekend. Most men you had WrestleMania going on, for instance, wrestling very popular with men because men tend to aspire to be the most masculine version of men that we could be by and large, right? Why are athletes popular? They're bigger, stronger and faster than most other men. Why are superheroes big and strong and ripped? They're bigger, stronger and faster than most men. Why did men get interested in wrestling men tend to aspire to be wire Navy seals? The most popular in badass in the in the military? They're the biggest badasses men aspire to strong to force and special forces and some others, more sock they they enroll in all those guys together, right? All special operations, special operations, special ops guys, right? Even in the military dudes by and large would look up to the special ops guys, right? Masculine men are the embodiment that most men aspire aspire to be. A woman who identifies as a man is by and large, smaller than most men, puny in general, not making even a team, much less winning a championship. Most women who identify as men and men tend to, I would say, I think you would agree with this, mostly ignore women who have decided to identify as men because they don't fit the masculine ideal. And we certainly don't aspire to them or make them famous. Why do women? Why is it? This is why I'd love to hear from women in our audience. Why do women make men who identify as women famous? It's really only one side of the transgender divide here that is becoming celebrity famous and making money off of? Do you have a? I think this is one area where and obviously this audience, all the women are I think rightly appalled not only at all this stuff being aimed at children and gender transitioning for kids and all which is just just they're losing that fight, by the way, which is why they're getting crazier and and why they're getting their arguments are getting more deranged. But they're also pushing harder as a result to you're noticing this. They're hoping that they can turn the tide by doubling down on, you know, drag shows for kids and all this stuff. But women recognize that there's a really it's a parody of women that these transgender individuals are doing. And you see this with someone like a Dylan Mulvaney. Is that is that really how women act? I mean, he vocalizes and and you know, and presents really almost like a like a really mature like 13 year old girl, right? Yeah. And he's an adult. He's an adult human. He does this whole it's as though you were taking a stereotype and turning that stereotype up to 11 on the dial. And it's it's really honestly, it's it's demeaning to women. But I actually want to drill down on something we I think we skipped a little bit past for a second if I could clay. Why is Bud Light doing this? Yeah, that is because I have a theory but I want to hear why did Bud Light of all coming this is almost like, you know, I'm can you think of a more short of like a firearms company like this is a shock to a lot of people. Why did Bud Light do this? I think it's because and this is my theory in general. If I start a new media company, it's going to be what I focus on. Certainly it's something I think about a lot now that outkick is is a company inside a Fox. I think it's because Bud Light, like every company is taken over by the diversity equity inclusion, the D E I people. And even people who recognize how absurd it is to be spending advertising dollars on a trans spokesperson are afraid to say it publicly inside of the company for fear that they will get fired. And so there is a conspiracy of silence. I think the vast majority of people who work at Bud Light would be like, this is stupid. This is the antithesis of our product. And I believe that they are terrified to speak out. They're trying to keep their jobs. And so the D I people are powerful inside of the company and they can push through almost anything. I really agree. Okay. But let me let me let me just add a layer to this. Right. I mean, I think that's all true. But this isn't, you know, for trends day of awareness or something, putting that, you know, there's like this trends flag now, which is a specific up. This isn't like a there's there's the what companies do. I think you and I see this the same way. What companies do so they don't get attacked? Which is another thing, right? There is okay, we'll go along. We'll do the minimum because we don't want the D E I commasars to come after us internally or externally, right? So there's the, but this, this is whole levels beyond. This is really slapping your audience in the face. This is what happens when you hire these people and put them inside of the companies. They're the exact opposite of, you know, the Biden administration put out like you're. So when the president of the United States endorses you, you're the opposite of powerless. You're actually supremely powerful. And I think these woke ideologies, they are totally lying when they're saying that they're trying to speak out for those that are not privileged. They are the privileged people. I think they've taken over inside of companies, even at Bud Light. You know, I saw this story on on Daily Mail, which I think people started to realize is among my favorite news website. And it looks really good. Why is it that we have to go to look Fox does the biggest traffic of any website on the right in the whole country? But you know, there's Fox, there's Daily Mail and you know, there's New York Post. Why is it that one of our best websites in my has to be a British news website? I just think it's interesting because I think that they're allowed to do that. They will say things that are outside of US politics is mother point I'm trying to make. We can get away with that at Outkick now, Buck, which is why we have exploded an audience, I think, because congratulations. I saw second highest month ever by the way month of all time at Outkick.com. If you're a sports fan and you're like, I want to pull out my hair, you'll probably like Outkick. So but yes, yes, but so the story of the Daily Mail and it's look, believe it or not, Freddie, but you and I are nice guys. We want everyone to have good happy, safe lives and everything else and we're very polite to people on our day to day lives. So I read this and actually it's it's sad and it's why will nobody kiss me? Dylan Mulvaney's man to girl transition has won her. Daily Mail writes he him tick tock fame, riches and allies in the White House, but left her lonely and undatable. And you know, this is a part of this that never really gets talked about, which is what is really the future for individuals like this? Like what happens first of all, if they decide to detransition, which are not allowed to talk about, but does happen. It is real. There are people out there and they will with the Kristen back, the Navy seal was gone back to Chris Beck, I believe. A D transition trans Navy seal. How many of you have even heard about that? And by the way, Beck is saying he's come out to say, I think it's Chris Beck. I know him as Kristen, he changed his name, said that was, you know, it was it was illness. I mean, I was in a bad place. It was a bad time for me. And you know, you see this and it's really sad and they're encouraging people and not just encouraging elevating, celebrating and kind of worshiping to your point about Drew Barrymore. This mentality and these decisions that are going to lead a whole lot of people to misery. Yeah, you know, how many people even know that a lot of the time when they do the top surgery and they move the breasts, there are wounds that never heal. There's chronic pain. There's, you know, because you're not supposed to chop off your breasts. If you're a woman, how many people even know this? You know, they're not how they're lying to people and they're leading down path is a path of misery. And so this thing about who's going to date Dylan Mulvaney. What's an interesting question? Who is going to date Dylan Mulvaney? What is the demo that he is looking for here? Right? I mean, this is how many dudes out there, I think it's a fair question. One a date, a guy or a girl that has male genitals. I mean, like, this is zero. If you are actually heterosexual, but if you remember, this used to be kind of a comedy point would be like, guy tries to hook up with a girl finds out she has a penis. You're accidentally hooking up with a trans person. It's like every guy's worst nightmare. In fact, if you remember, he's Ventura is like, that's the entire thing. That's the entire complex, the entire basis of that movie. I just bring up the kindness that clay just because they want they keep saying be inclusive. You know, just let people be who they are on the stuff. It is, if somebody came to me, and they told me that they were doing something that I knew to be really bad. They told me they had a gambling addiction. And they're like, look, like, I don't think it's that bad. I've just, I can't pay the mortgage and I've gone bankrupt and I borrowed money from some loan sharks that I would be like, don't do this. I'm not going to affirm your desire to do this because it's going to be very harmful to your life. I think when they look at outcomes here in the reality, what's happening for so many of these people, it is harmful. It is unkind to participate in the delusion. That is the bottom line. You are not actually being kind to these people. It is the opposite of that. And I would love again, 800-282-282. Why are women allowing this? Why are women allowing men to become celebrities pretending to be women? Men don't do it. Men don't allow women who become celebrities and certainly not spokespeople for our gender. What's going on here? I think it's utterly fascinating just to compare the way that the trans experience exists right now as it pertains to fake men versus fake women. Stock markets have been brutal. Everybody's talking about inflation. It's everywhere. Buck and I recently met with Dutch Mendenhall. Dutch is the founder of Rad diversified. He's a patriot.

We've got some of our ladies in this audience lined up and fired up to talk about this issue of well, French genderism and specifically here, the Dylan Mulvaney Budlight, right? Anne Heiser Bush or what was it Budlight? Yeah. Yeah, it's Budlight. And we'll talk to them right now. Let's get to it. Marilyn in Long Island, New York. What have you got for us, Marilyn? Hi, guys. I love the show. Yeah, I'm glad you're talking about this because no one seems to bring up how offensive this is. First of all, he's everywhere, which is huge. And I watch the Budlight commercial. I mean, it's offensive. And I guess you guys have watched it that says, I don't know what this is all about, but yeah, I bear, right? How do you women don't know what March Madness is? Like, why isn't anybody outraged? And he also did an ad for Kate Spade. I actually fired an email off to them because it was so offensive. I mean, you want to talk about transitioning with class. Look at a chest, a chest, any bone else. She was a woman that became a man. And it wasn't everything in your face. And you know, if you're going to hire a spokesperson, go to RuPaul, at least that's a diva and not a parody. I mean, I don't know why women aren't outraged at this. I find it so incredibly offensive that women are stupid. And we just want to put on pretty nails and we just want to sit around and do our hair. Like, why do people allow this? Yeah, no, don't female act the way that they act. It's such an exaggerated version of femininity. And it's not a positive one, right? It's not like, Oh, I'm a mom and I've got to take care of three kids. And I've also got to make sure that I can manage my job and all these other things. It's like, I like to wear pink and I like to put on fingernails. And I like to style my hair. It's like, to your point, Buck, it's like a 13 year old girl who is just like suddenly become a woman. It is truly, it's offensive and it's demeaning is the better word. I think for it. Marilyn, thanks for calling on. Great talk to you. Kelly in Georgia. What's going on, Kelly? Hi, I want to chime in and about how offensive it is. It's unlike a person who is trying to actually live as a woman. You don't stand out. You try to blend in that people who are exaggerating like Dylan Novani is to me, it feels like black face to women. It is so offensive to me. And I don't understand why everyone is an up and arms about about it in defense of women. I mean, Kelly, you're supposed to clap when a six foot three man wins the NCAA women's swimming championship. Now that that is what the point here in clay, we'd come back. We got we'll get more of this in a second. We got more calls. Also, did you hear for anyone out there, the new prime minister of New Zealand, which is a beautiful country that apparently is also now a socialist loony bin. After COVID, we saw that the new prime minister of New Zealand was asked a really tough question, Clay. You see this? What is a woman? The new prime minister of a an English speaking westernized country was asked what is a woman you should hear his response. I do want everyone to hear it. We'll get to it in a moment. If you're a small business owner, you might have heard about the IRS's refund program called the Employee Retention Credit or ERC. There are billions of dollars set aside for businesses like yours that survived the pandemic. Go to getrefunds.com to determine if you qualify in as little as eight minutes. See if your business qualifies for ERC assistance. Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during COVID-19. Getrefunds.com has already helped clients claim over $3 billion in payroll tax refunds through the ERC. They may be able to help your business too. There's no upfront charge either. They don't get paid until your business gets its refund. Many businesses believe they won't qualify based off incomplete or outdated information, so don't let this opportunity pass you by because this payroll tax refund is only available for a limited time. Go to getrefunds.com. Again, don't wait. Act now. It's a limited time. You can get this refund. So go to getrefunds.com. On the front lines of truth. I want to take a couple more of your calls. I also want to talk about was it Kelly from Georgia who was saying that she thought she thought like this was basically I'm starting to see it and I would encourage all of you to think about using it too. This is that the blackface analogy I think is not a bad one at all. If you think back historically, the reason why blackface is offensive is because white actors would pretend to be black and engage in extremely exaggerated behavior that was designed to stereotype blackness in an instant manner. And to demean it. I mean to be demeaning about it. Yeah, that's correct. I don't understand how what men pretending to be women who are engaging in basically womanface, they are putting on an exaggerated version of what they believe women are and in many ways ridiculing them. And I'll give you an example, Buck. Some of these dudes, these are men with penises are pretending that they have periods and or postmenstrual cramps. It's like, wait a minute. What are you talking about? Now, I'll give you another example from my own wife who's who was upset about this stuff. She says, look, when you become a grown man and you suddenly I decide to identify as a woman, you've had none of the experiences that women have had growing up. You haven't been in a parking lot late at night, terrified when you're 16 or 17 years old that you're going to get raped. You haven't gone through what the entire experience of becoming a woman is. And then suddenly at 25 years old or whatever the heck age this person is, you're parachuting in and trying to tell me about being a woman in an exaggerated fashion. It is offensive, just like black faces. Well, it's like if someone came up to me and they said, you know, hey, I want you to celebrate me. You know, you're 41, but I've I mean, and Clay's got a lot more time under his belt, but you're 41. And I want to tell you about what it's been like to be a guy for the last three months. I'd be like, I think I think there's some battle scars that I've got that you don't, you know, like I think there's a little more to it than just, you know, deciding it is really demeaning. And I think that it's important that understands why they're doing this. This is about compliance. It really is about getting you to bend the knee. I mean, at at its core, at its essence, put aside because they can't, there's no rational arguments they can win over this stuff. They can't, I mean, here, can I do it now? What the New Zealand Prime Minister, you haven't heard this yet. So Clay, I haven't heard it. This is the new Prime Minister. Remember the old Prime Minister, Lucinda Audeann was like, was like the the Stalin of mask wearing and vaccines. I mean, she was the worst in, you know, and probably the whole English speaking world out of New Zealand. She was the Prime Minister. Here's the new Prime Minister asked to define what a woman is. This just happened. Play it. How do you and how does this government define a woman? To be honest, Sean, that's that questions come slightly out of left field for me. The, well, biology sex gender, people define themselves, people define their own genders. Yes, it said that he believed 99.9 percent a woman do not have penises. I know it's a strange thing for him to say, but given recent events in New Zealand, I'd ask again, how do you define one of women? It's, I think as I've just indicated, I wasn't expecting that question. So it's not something that I've, you know, formulated, pre formulated an answer on. But in terms of gender identity, I think people define the gender identity for themselves. Clay, just make it up. Can't answer the question. This is the Prime Minister of New Zealand. He's like, I didn't think about gender. It's like, dude, this is not hard. An adult human female, it is not difficult. But there's, you know, Venus's women have a giant is going back to kindergarten cop back in the day, if I remember correctly. It's a pretty easy distinction. And so New Zealand has its first, and I think this is part of why there's this discussion. Georgina buyer is the first openly transgender of the New Zealand parliament. So they now have a transgender member of parliament in New Zealand, which is why this conversation is underway. So now they can look forward to Georgina buyer lecturing the women of New Zealand about womenhood. Yeah, this is where we are in society. But it really is about making everyone bend the knee. Women have been weighing in. We got a bunch of calls still lined up. Let me get a couple more of these. Carrie from Holland, Michigan. What did you think about the decision to suddenly make a fake woman, a spokesperson for beer? Hi guys. First of all, I love the show. Listen to it every day. Thank you. I call you're welcome. I called an hyzer bush this morning because I'm very kicked off and offended about this. I did get a live person on the phone. And what I said to her is, first of all, I was no longer going to purchase any anhyzer bush products as a result. But I told her I'm extremely offended. I am 56 years old. I was born a woman and my womanhood is a lived and personal experience. It is not a costume. And I am tired of being erased by corporations giving a platform to men who are wearing my womanhood as a costume. And the last thing I said to her, I said, do the geniuses in your marketing department not know who your demographics are, who actually drinks Bud Light? Yep. And she said she would pass my comments along to the appropriate individuals. Well, good for you for I know we on the right, we should actually, you should call places like this and tell them what you think because the left does it in the left will lie about what's going on. Oh, no, no, no, this all how could you do it? You know, do you hear what Clay had Buck said and the lie about us though? You know, try to get us banned from the airwaves or whatever. Thank you for stepping up. Elizabeth in St. Petersburg, Florida. What's your reaction? To your point about people being afraid for their jobs, if they speak out, I think this is one of the main problems. People are so afraid. That's a little bit pathetic to me, although I do understand it, but this isn't going away. So I think families or communities within the company should start rallying and figuring out their options. Maybe they migrate to another company. They start, you know, trying to find other ways to work in the same industry that they rally some of the people within the industry and PS. Where are the men? Where are the men standing up? I marched in London every month for six months and we got up to a million people in the street. Excuse me, and mainstream media didn't cover it, but we were predominantly women to start with. So I'm just wondering where the men are. I think it's a good question and I'll go to Jill here in Grand Rapids in a minute, but that's my point. I think men overwhelmingly reject the idea that a woman can become a man to such an extent that by and large, we just ignore it, right? Because men, and I really believe this book, and I think I've got three boys. So I see it through them. Men aspire, despite what the media might tell you, to emulate hyper masculine men. Athletes tend to be bigger, stronger and faster than your average man. Special ops forces, bigger, stronger, faster wrestlers, boxers, whoever they might be. They're radio hosts, maybe with our sexy vocal cords. You and I do not have the most sexy and masculine job around. I wish we did. I wish I could kick indoors and beat people's asses for a living. I'm not I'm not the biggest, strongest dude out there, but what you see is when a woman becomes a man, she can't aspire to the alpha male standard because she can't even make a team. Whereas I'm talking about athletics, a dude who decides to identify as a woman can suddenly become a spokesperson for women and a champion and a woman of the year. There's no man. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't think of a man of the year that has ever been awarded to a woman in any facet. It just doesn't happen. I'm trying to think I can't think of one either. And you guys out there certainly are welcome to call in and remind me. But I was thinking about this a lot over the weekend. Jill and Grand Rapids, what's your thought on all this? Oh my goodness. So many thoughts. I just I also am a mother of two boys and they're hyper masculine boys. But what I have seen so much is just the the D masculine. I mean, the masculine has been taken out of our society. They're trying to do it. Yeah. Well, I just see this, you know, this this that slavery, lean freedom, dichotomy really making its way and just a split between us. And we do have this like linking in of like this total. If you guys know what I mean by fat slavery, right? And lean freedom where we have a whole part of society that is just willing to say, yeah, there is no, you know, like the New Zealand, there is no distinction. I don't know. I can't decide. Can't say what a woman is, you know, and then there is a side that is still saying, there is a truth in this world and is willing to say, yeah, there is a distinction. God made man and God made woman, you know, and yeah, Jill. Yeah, I think you're I think you're now that we're going to break. I will say this. I am, I think anytime I don't have daughters, Buck. I've got three boys. So I know directly what it's like to be a boy growing up. I've been through it myself. But I think what Jill's kind of hinting at, and I know a lot of you women out there are seeing it too, is when you are a woman who is raising boys, and I would imagine also, and again, I have an experience, but when you are a man who is raising a girl, you get sort of a cross sexual understanding of the difference of the sexes. And when you're a mom out there and you're raising boys, you don't want to raise a feminine boys. And you might not even think about it. I think a lot of women don't think about it. But you see the way that society is treating your boys. And you're like, this is not creating a world of strong men. And we cannot have a society filled with weak men, regardless of how much of a feminist you might be. Does that make sense? They the left wants a and the left and the Democrats are the same thing. They want a society of weak men because weak men is easier to control. They want you physically weak, they want you emotionally and psychologically weak, and they want you to comply. And if you can comply with lunacy, if you can say things that you know in your heart and soul to be untrue, to be forced to celebrate them, this is actually what they do in totalitarian societies. Because it demeans your own ability to think through what is my reality? What is my relationship to the state? All of a sudden, you're a part of the farce as well. Not there's too easy to control. So true. There's a difference between someone deciding how they are going to identify and you being required to acknowledge and treat it as truth. And they don't want strong men and women out there. Because if you are a strong man or woman, you will be willing to stand up to direct falsehoods. The fact that we've ended up in this situation where the party of science is the one that's trying to tell you that there's no difference between men and women. Or did you see this crazy story, Buck, that in Australia now they're saying we shouldn't even identify the sex of a baby when they're born. We should let him choose when they get older. In case the doctor gets it wrong. If a doctor can't tell what the gender is, he shouldn't or she shouldn't be a doctor. Amen. Pure talk is out there. Look, they got a $30 a month plan to save you a ton of money. They'll give you unlimited talk text, plenty of high speed data. And unlike AT&T Verizon or T mobile, you know, you can save $1,000 a year with Pure Talk. Given how much inflation is roaring and how expensive life is in America right now, what would a thousand extra dollars at the end of the year mean for you and your family? That's what Pure Talk can provide to you. They'll create value for you. They also care about veterans and our military. In fact, company CEO and chairman of the board is a US veteran. They're based all here, US customer service. And when you become a Pure Talk customer, you have an option to support America's warrior partnership to help prevent veteran suicides. So why wouldn't you make the switch today? You can save $1,000. You can help to support agency and companies that have values like yours. And it's super easy to do. All you have to do is dial pound two 50 say clay and buck. And you can save 50% off your first month. That's dial pound two five zero say clay and buck. Start saving today. Learn laugh and join us on the weekend on our Sunday hang with clay and buck podcast. Find it on the iHeartF or wherever you get your podcasts. Coming up in the next hour, we're going to talk a bit more about what the expectations are here in New York City. The Trump Force One currently in the air right now. And there's a lot of response to this interesting thing we haven't really gotten into is going to run to Santas said that he would not participate in an extradition. So I suppose the Trump team decided that they weren't going to face that one down. I think that's I think that's pretty interesting. But we'll talk more about that. Marjorie Taylor Greene, apparently on the way to New York, the mayor of New York, Tally Gerda, watch out. So we've got a lot to discuss on that. But one thing that I that I mentioned to Clay, and I'm still sitting here saying, are they really going to do this this thing where they don't they keep saying we can't really know the real motive delay is a tactic of propaganda. I want to ever know correct. And maybe this is a good way to because if you delay something long enough, the public loses interest. And so the political impact of the recognition of the facts when they do come out is much less variations of this like Clay said, if they were to say drop the manifesto from the Nashville shooter tomorrow, very hard not to feel like that's trying to bury it in a new cycle where it won't get very much attention. But one of the things that I used to see regularly analyzing, I mean, I was even analyzing terror terrorism and terrorist attacks at CNN, believe it or not, for years, was the narrative of we can never know the real motive. Yeah, and they would only say this when it was something that the all we can never really know the real motive. You say, well, hold on, I think we do know the motive. And they would say this when you had someone, for example, specifically, like shouting a lot of walk bar, I'm doing this for ISIS, or I'm like a pawn of al-Qaeda, and you would have idiots go on TV who would say, we don't really know what the motive is here. Let's not speculate. And then they shut down the story that way. There's also this effort to make it about something other than what I just happened here is a writer named James Kirchick, who is saying that a big problem here is that the media is misgendering the Nashville mass murderer play to what's interesting if you've noticed they are misgendering and dead naming the murderer, right? They're referring to the murderer by their given name, not their chosen name, and by their referring to her as a woman, as opposed to what her identity apparently was, was a man, which is not the way the media usually does these things. They're usually very particular about the subjective sense of gender identity in respecting that. If someone says they're a man, then they're a man. But in this case, they're not doing that. No, in this case, because they realize the mass murderer and they don't want to look like complete lunatics when they're reporting on this. So they're referring to a woman, Clay, you know, who is phenomenal on this is from the Bill Marshall, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsham Sears. Here's what she said about this on that same panel about the misgendering play three. Hang on. You know what? This person murdered six people. I don't really care who you say you're you are. You murdered six people and three of them were children. You don't get a say. Well, she's dead now. So, you know, but you don't get a say in telling us who you are and what you're about. You killed six people. Winsham Sears for the win there. Amen. You know, I'll also point out how did this story start? Nashville police chief came out and said she didn't wait to see how this person identified the killer was a woman. The autopsy shows the killer was a woman 100 years from now. If they exhumed the graves, you know what they'll say? This was a woman. Do you know why they'll say that buck? Because biology is real. You don't get to pick your gender. That is all made up and it's time for a lot of us to stop playing make believe."
