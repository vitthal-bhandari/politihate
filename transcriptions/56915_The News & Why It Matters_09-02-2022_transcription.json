But you will love the mental gymnastics they have to do in order to say something is fake when it is in fact real news. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Hey, welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy hump day. I am Sarah Gonzalez and I'm joined today by chief researcher of the Glenn Beck program. It is Wednesday and he is here. Jason Butch role. Thanks for being here. Cleanest best t-shirt for you Sarah. You're wearing your Sunday best as usual. I'm so glad you dressed up to see me. Also on his main voyage on the show, we have Colin Wright who is managing editor at Quilett. Also, no big deal, just an evolutionary biologist as well. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I think maybe ex-evolutionary biologist I left academia. Okay, yeah, that's true because you don't want to be associated with their kind anymore. I still like evolution and all that stuff but academia has sort of imploded since I left. I kind of left as the bus was exploding behind me. I feel like one of those actions was these people protest behind you going on as you were leaving. Okay. All right, so let's get into the news of the day. So Stacey Abrams, we talked about this on the program yesterday, you guys. So those of you who watch the show every day, this is no shock to you. Stacey Abrams, if you are living under a rock and hadn't heard, she was caught maskless at a school in Georgia. And this was, remember, the campaign said it was one photo. She took her mask off for one photo, you guys. Oh, oops. And then like three more surfaced of her in different places of the school. All the pictures, no mask on whatsoever. But don't worry, she did make sure to mask the young children who are not actually prone to anything bad happening to them from COVID. She made sure to mask them behind her. So she's doing all right, so she says. But here is Stacey Abrams apologizing for all of these photos of her unmasked associating with all of these people, but making the plebs wear their masks. Here's Stacey Abrams on CNN. I will say this, I went to read to kids for an African-American read-in day. I approached the podium with my mask on. I followed the protocols. I told the kids I'm taking my mask off because I'm reading to kids who are listening remotely as well. And we were socially distanced. The kids were socially distanced for me. I told them that's what I was doing. And then the excitement after I finished because it was so much fun working with those kids, I took a picture. And that was a mistake. Protocols matter. And protecting our kids is the most important thing. And anything that can be perceived as undermining that is a mistake. And I apologize. Yeah, a lot of social distancing going on in that picture, you guys. Also, the social distancing that was going on in the other pictures that we've seen, I believe, outkick was the one who broke that story of her standing like, you know, right here, right next to adults, administrators of the school who also, you know, she was not wearing a mask there as well. Not a lot of social distancing. But who can blame those kids for being so excited to see Stacey Abrams come read at their school? I'm sure they were just jumping for joy. They just couldn't contain themselves. Oh, I'm sure they were because, you know, I'd say probably, I'd wager maybe 90% of the country doesn't know who Stacey Abrams is. But I'm sure all those kids did. And it made them very, very excited. Jason, that's very unfair to say because as we know, she is the true governor of Georgia. True. That's true. So how could they not know their own governor? Their own rightful governor? I know, right. The point you just pointed out about how outkick had to release these photos. Outkick. So one photo had already come out. When you covered yesterday, did you cover the additional ones? No, we didn't have them yet. So like, they're bad. Especially because the first one came out and then the campaign spokesman said that, basically it was like, how dare you, you know, an African American read in black history month. Which you noticed she made sure to bring in. I would there for an African American read in, you can't criticize me. I'm black. Yeah. Yeah. But that was one of the tactics. And the other tactic was, yeah, she just took the mascot to talk to the kid. She was far away. But that was it. She showed up and then followed all the protocols. Yeah. Well, then outkick is like, oh, yeah, bam. And then, oh, I think even there, she just said one picture. Yeah. But there was like four other pictures that were released. One where she's taken a group photo, one where she's like hanging out and another. She never wore a mask. Right. Ever. Right. And obviously, we don't care about that. But the hypocrisy here is staggering. And there's always in every one of these when there's always that one moron, right, that reveals very publicly how they really feel about everything they're lying about or what they really don't actually care about. There's that one moron in Miss Abrams. You are that moron. Yeah. She had a really good sort of PR writer for that one. Yeah. So that was all predicated. It was all predicated on the fact that this was the only photo that would be released and nothing else could come. Right. Well, and I think there's other ones come out then sort of the jig is up. But see, but that's my question is if the mainstream media doesn't ever pull those other ones, does she have to admit to them? I feel like they live in this world where if CNN doesn't report on it, they just don't even have to say that it happened. Well, the media used to do that. They used to do their job on these things. Like if there was a claim, they used to get curious. Maybe we should see if other photographs were there so that we can corroborate what the campaign manager says. But it took out kit. Right. Out kit had to do this. Not the post, not the times. It's unbelievable. Yeah. It's really, really bad. So we'll see if Stacey Abrams, you know, governor, I'm sorry, governor Stacey Abrams actually ever suffers any consequences from this. But I mean, I can't blame them if I was the left and I just constantly was able to get away with being hypocritical and putting all of these restrictions on other people while not having to abide by them myself. And then when I get caught, nothing really bad happened. So I'm like, I'll keep doing it. Why wouldn't you? Right. Why wouldn't you at that point? Like no one is teaching you that your bad behavior has any consequences, right? Yeah. Everyone's just going to cover for you. So there's not really an incentive structure put up where people are going to be held accountable for anything. Right. I think that's basically what people get pissed off the most is the whole hypocrisy involved in it and the cover up after the fact. Yeah. Well, and, you know, masking my child in a school who won't, not my child, but those of you who send your kids to these public schools and they're being masked, it's like, my kid isn't even like statistically speaking, it's like his risk of death is zero and you're going to mask him and tell me that it's for his protection. Get out of here. What's crazy is five years ago? Yeah, probably like five years ago, maybe something long, well, maybe a little bit farther back, but something like this would take a campaign. Yeah. Absolutely take it. Like they got caught lying about something and not only that, not only they lied about it, but they showed that they don't really believe in the thing that they, the only issue for them. COVID is the, and how to handle is the only issue. That's what they can't paint on. Nothing else, just COVID. Well, now here's the poster child. Stacey, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And we all know this because we keep on seeing other, you know, photographs from other places where they're not wearing masks. Yeah. Gavin Newsom, you know, the list goes on, but they obviously don't care about this. It's very, very public. But like, I remember Mitt Romney, he got his entire campaign got taken over that binder of women. Yes. Yeah. It take this, no, we're so, this is how, I guess it's just a lesson of polarization, how polarized we are now. It doesn't matter. Like everyone's already chosen their side. I think now that no matter what side you're on, you know your politician or your guy or girl is lying about everything. But now they, I think people feel like they can't go back and they're just going to back that candidate, you know, regardless. I wonder how prevalent back in the day dunking on someone publicly was, whereas that's like a commonality just on social media. And it's not even a big deal anymore when someone gets dunked on like that in public anymore. It's just like, oh, that's just, that is just another Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, here is that picture from Outkick that does not look like a bunch of children who were just so excited and jumping for joy over Stacey Abrams, reading them a book for African American reading day that they had to just surround her. That just looks like just blatant hypocrisy. And there's more than that. Oh, I know. I know. I know. You know, we're talking about Stacey Abrams and these people and campaigns. I find it very fascinating that the left, I guess, doesn't have anyone else and just continues to run the same people who are losing, like Robert Francis O'Rourke, right? Better O'Rourke. Or just not relevant at all. Stacey Abrams. It's like, how many times can these people lose their elections before you stop running them? Do you really have that small of a, or no bench, I guess? Like, it's fascinating to watch. And then I think about it and I'm like, I really, I guess they don't have anyone. What's, what's weird is they had clearly marked Stacey Abrams back when she, after she lost the election. Wow. That's a crazy thing to say. Wow. I know. But they had clearly or marked. I'm looking at like, Democracy Alliance events. That's the George Soros big, dark, super pack thing. They were, had hers, like the keynote speaker after that. And she was, they were, they were, you know, showing her in all these different states, clearly setting her up for something a lot grander. Yeah. And I'm like, why? Yeah. Like, what is the appeal? What has she done? What does she do? Like, like, I don't understand. Like, I don't know. I guess their barrel is that small. Because I, Beto is another animal though. I don't know. I almost get the sense that I think they do want Stacey Abrams to be successful. I kind of feel like they just want Beto to go away. Because he says the quiet parts out loud. They're like, don't tell them we're taking their guns from them. You're not supposed to say that. And Beto just says it out loud. I don't know if anyone. Yeah. They're like, shut up. I think that's, that's Beto's problem. Okay. So Colin, let me ask you this. Since you're new to the program, right? Evolutionary by all ex-evolutionary biologists. So you did work in academia. I feel like I need to ask you where you fall in the political spectrum. You know, I don't even know anymore. So I used to always, I've always voted Democrat in my entire life. Including last election. They didn't vote for Biden voted for Tulsi Gabbard though. But now she's considered alt-right or something. I don't know if she's right or not. She's right. I know. That's so weird when she's considering. So, yeah. Yeah. I used to, so I still kind of consider myself on the left. But I think the whole political, you know, spectrum is kind of off-kilter where we now sort of have the authoritarians and the libertarians. And then we have this, this woke thing is doing this completely other thing. I usually don't describe wokeism being left. It's just kind of like down or up. It's not a z-axis just going in a completely different direction. Interesting. Because I find myself who lifelong liberal, I can't even talk to them. I can talk to conservatives. I can talk to Christians and myself and atheists. But I can talk to them. Because we're using the same sort of language. We're using evidence who might come to different conclusions. But you talk to the other, you know, the sort of woke left. And they don't even agree on foundational principles of knowledge. And how do you even come to how to gather evidence? And, you know, they're all about power dynamics and things like that. It's completely just, it's completely different than anything I've ever encountered before. Right. So, so then as someone who has historically voted for Democrats, how, like, what do you think of how they're running things now? And they have, as we just mentioned, Stacey Abrams running for governor. Again, nobody likes Stacey Abrams. Better or Roark running for governor. Again, nobody likes better or Roark. Like, who, what are they doing? Who do they have? Why don't they have a bench that they are picking from? Why aren't they, for lack of a better term, grooming people to be someone? Why are they just using these same failed people? I'm not sure why they wouldn't go all in on someone like Tulsi Gabbard, who has the liberal values, has even the identity points, you know, woman of color. Was ex-military on them? I mean, they're, checks all the boxes, yet they just demonize this person, which is not woke. Right. And so, yeah, the whole, the platforming of that woke ideology is just taken over and I'm just so put off by it that I'm likely, depending on who runs, I would definitely consider voting Republican next election. Yeah. Even though I think my ideological shift has been very, very small, if anything, I've stayed in the same place while the sort of the center of the spectrum has just, the ground has moved beneath my feet. And it is, it is interesting because, Jason, you see the, he's talking about all of the, this, this woke group. I don't think it's that many people. I think they just scream the loudest and the squeaky well gets the grease. That's what you would think, but then it seemed like, I mean, you watch in the last election and everyone was pretty much saying the same stuff. You know what I mean? It was like, it's like, everyone has got this intersectional mindset. Like, they want to, you know, section off different members of society, make them fight each other and tell them that everyone hates each other. Right. Against politics now. Right. Well, yes, and you say that and all of the candidates were saying the same thing, but also, like, most of them got 1%, you know, of the, our vice president got like 1% of even the Democrats. And at the end of the day, they ended up coming down to two old white men. Yeah. So like, I, again, I, I feel like everyone feels like these are the talking points that they're supposed to say, but I don't feel like anyone actually believes it. The only person that I really will, I respect Tulsi Gabbard. I think she has a, I don't consider her anywhere near conservative at all. And I don't know how that's been a come up thing. Because she's not. Well, she did say that she doesn't agree with late term abortion. Right. So that's very right wing fringe. See, no, that's sane. So like, I would say the, like, all my friends that are sane Democrats, which I would, I guess you would put yourself in that category. Right. I think I'm sane. He's on the show. So I'm not allowed to say that about me. Other people have to say that. Like, that's what, that's what it sounds like to me like, like maybe like a JFK style Democrat or something like that, which now there's, he, he would be GOP. Right. Nowadays they would, I feel like they wouldn't even let him in the Democrat party anymore. But all my friends that are sane Democrats, they fit, they like, I'm not going to vote Republican because they just have to, there's too many differences. But they don't know what the heck to do. They feel completely isolated. You know, they're, they're politically isolated because everyone else just seems so crazy. And none of them have good ideas. Like, like, Andrew Yang, I'll listen to him all day long. I won't, I won't vote for him. But at least he's got some ideas that are different and out of the box, which is very rare all across the spectrum. Yeah. And he'll talk to other people who disagree with him. Right. Right. Right. Right. I mean, you don't get the people who are on the vocal of talking to anyone else. Unless they're just shut them down. Right. Yeah. Unless it's just to like dunk on them or call them, call them names. Talking at them, not talking to them. All right. We've got more to come, but we got to take a quick break. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Built Bar. So I got an email today that Built Bar have their banana cream puffs back in stock, or at least they did earlier. You need to go to the site today, like right after this program and go check because they sell out of those things very quickly. They are a fan favorite. And let me just tell you, they're one of my favorites as well. But Built Bar is where you need to go if you were looking for a protein bar, something that is going to keep you full, something that is going to keep you on track for your weight loss goals. But it's not going to expand your waistline. It tastes like a candy bar. They're all covered in a 100% chocolate. They've got that high protein, low calories, low sugar. You got to go get set with Built Bar today. Jason actually hates me because I got his wife hooked on Built Bar. It's true. And he's like, dang it, Sarah. And now she's asking me for more. Every day when I go to work, I go to work. She says, she asked me to put a book on her. And I do. Because that's me now. You're a bar dealer in the building. You got to go to built.com use promo code news15. You'll get 15% off of your order. That is news 15 for 15% off over at built.com. There is a video that has surfaced out of New York. This is Webster Central School District. And the video is it was recorded at a school board meeting. And you can see a security guard. He looks like maybe he's just a not as overweight. Paul Blart is what he looks like when you see the video. You'll understand what I mean. But he is very mad that this man has the audacity to attend the school board meeting and sit there listening intently by himself sitting there not causing any problems. But he was not wearing a mask. And that is not OK. That is so not OK that the security guard had to actually put his hands on him and get physical to remove him because he is, as we know, the biggest danger, the biggest threat that mankind has ever faced. Watch. They found him. We're going to be working. Oh, time to look at this. Look at this. What are you doing? What the f*** are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Is this how you do it? What are you doing? You put your hands on the shoulder. Holy crap. Holy crap. That's assault. That is assault. Oh my god. They're doing the children. Oh my god. Doing that to the children too? Holy f***. What the f*** are you doing? What are you doing? There's students in the building. Officer, do something about that. It's for your health and safety, though, guys. All right. It is for your health and safety. And again, if he was such a threat, I don't know why they would get that close to him just to kick him out. But as you can see, he's a menace to society sitting there at the school board meeting, listening intently to what was taking place. I would like to say that it's this horrible school board, which they are. But I would like to put all the blame on them. And it's all their authoritarian, you know, like crazy. I hope you're going where I think you're going. But that's BS. It really is. So any government, and again, I'm libertarian. So I hate any government, period. But any government, the more power you give them, they're going to take it. They're going to gobble it up like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And they're going to build upon it and build upon it. It's going to grow. And they're going to do whatever they want, because they can or they think they can. No, the real problem is all those weak-ass parents sitting in there with a damn mass on. Thank you. That's the problem. And it's going to keep happening if you allow this. All of them should have been sitting there with their mass off. Did you notice the only people I heard pitching any sort of fit were women. There were a bunch of men who turned and looked and watched and turned back around with their masked up faces. Like, where are the men here standing up? Your children are suffering right now. And you're just sitting there with a damn mask on. We're weak. We're a weak society now. You want to contrast that to another video that came out today or last night of an Ottawa. So in Ottawa, the Trudeau was like, hey, if you bring in any gas cans to assist or whatever, then you're getting arrested or whatever. So they responded the very next day. A huge long line of people, people bringing in gas cans. Basically said, screw off for doing it anyway. You can't arrest all of us. Exactly. That's when he's out. I know. And where America, it supposed to happen here, first Canada's embarrassing us. Yeah. Well, it's one of those things that everyone just took the mask off the literal mask, not like the proverbial mask. Off at the same time, then that would be, you know, there wouldn't be anyone just to launch all your arrows at. So if you're the first person to do anything like that, then you suffer all the social consequences. I mean, I can't. But it's so easy to take these sort of civil liberties away from us. But it's so slow to get them back when you ever try to do that. So we see the same thing happening in Canada, pretty much everywhere where they've enacted these authoritarian controls for COVID. It's going to be a slow process coming back. I don't even know if we're ever going to be able to fly planes the next decade without a mask on. Don't tell me that. I'll never try to fly. Everyone can always pull the, you know, I just care so much about you type of thing. And then, you know, oh, like they're being so nice. We're not going to get rid of these things. Think of the children too. That's why the kids are always the last ones to have their masks removed. Some states have lifted their mandates, but this, some schools still say, but just the kids need to keep these on. Yeah, we got to go on the schools. Even though I think they're at risk of dying in a swimming pool is higher than getting COVID, but we don't have them wearing, you know, water wings on, where they go. In case they happen to stumble on a swimming pool. So when you put it in terms of the actual statistics of harm, what we're doing is completely nuts. Yeah. So I'm told that we have a video, I have no idea what the video is. All I know is that it features Randy Winegarden, who in my opinion is like the spawn of Satan. And I'm just told that she is talking about what, how the teachers union feels about the mask mandate guidance watch. What Dr. McBride just told us about masks, not particularly being effective for children. What's the argument against taking off masks in schools? Well, the argument is that you had, well, let me just say this. I am in favor of an off-ramp on masks. Right. The real issue becomes, is the spread low enough so that there's no dissemination or transmission in schools? And it's not the teachers transmitting to kids. It's more kids and kids, particularly in elementary schools right now. And so the question really becomes, do we have, that's why I like what Massachusetts has done. Because what they've said is that on a school by school basis, they said if there's 80% vaccination rates, then those schools can lift the mandates. There it is, there it is. And it all comes back to the vaccination rate. So basically everything she said there was completely untrue. And I would like to remind Randy Winegarden, who is the top dog over at this giant teachers union, she should know this. Statistically speaking, as we were mentioning earlier, Colin, the children have a much greater risk of dying from the flu every single year, yet you're not requiring them to wear masks or get a vaccination, sorry, a shot, because it's not a real vaccination for that. So it boggles the mind how she can sit there on national television and be able to speak these falsehoods and have nobody say, actually, hold on a second, what you're saying is not at all true. Are you living in an alternate freaking universe? You devil woman. That was good. I don't know how I can even follow up on that. I thought what was weird was when she said, she's in favor of having an off ramp for masks. As though this is suddenly occurring to her now. Rather than the beginning having an actual off ramp planned, when we meet these certain things, this is when masks go away. No, they implement the policy first, and then they have no limiting factor of when this has come out, where they just wing it, see the pants, and then, oh, is it 80%, is it zero COVID? What's the rule? No one ever says this, begin with, it's always just make it up as they go along. Right, and of course, we do need the 80% vaccination rate for something that they already have told us, their own CDC director has told us, we'll not stop the transmission. We'll not stop people from getting it, but you really need that 80%. Yeah. Is that not an arbitrary number if it's not stopping the actual transmission? What's funny is these questions now. I hate this woman. You just wrote, thanks a lot, control room. You just ruined my whole freaking, I hate this woman. What? Yes. Not going to say it. These questions, they couldn't even ask me to really talk about what, six months ago, but now, all of a sudden, suddenly, the science has changed, which they keep saying. And they can now talk about these things, about an off-ramp for mass. No, the science hasn't changed. We've had two years of data going through schools. And OK, fine, so some of these places in the country, they haven't had schools open for two years, but my kids' schools have been open the entire time, except for what was at the end of that one year, what are 20, 19? Yeah, 20, 20. Yeah, 20, 20. Man, we've, that's been a really long couple years. It's been like 85 years, actually, in my head. But my kids have been going to school. And then they have a COVID dashboard, and I look at it. He's in high school. So there's a whole lot less touchy feely going on, if you know what I mean, in the other grades. But in high schools, there's probably a whole lot of it going on. And they very rarely have any kind of outbreak. I mean, at any one time, 10 cases. Or something like that, which was probably even more, but they're young and healthy. So they're not showing any symptoms. Yeah, so cases. Exactly. Don't matter. But the cases thing, that's what really irritates me. And you mentioned the zero COVID. That's like, that's their goal. And they know that will never happen. They know that will never, they can't even do zero COVID in China when they can force people to lock down and put them in bubbles. Like, they can't even do it there. It's not going to happen. The variants keep getting less and less severe. This is going how nature has usually done these things in the past. But I mean, it's all time. Which is why, Jason, which is why every single, for the last two freaking years, every time, I can't think, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here. Colin's going to come off thinking that I'm like super conceited. We had shut up, Jason. We have been right on this every single time. The whole two years, I can't think of one thing that we've been wrong on. You know why? Because it just took common sense to say, OK, it's a respiratory virus. This is how these usually work. This is the standard for, why would a cloth mask work? Why would all these things work? Like, it just took a little bit of common sense to know that these things were going to happen. Like, that, it blows my mind that now they're like, oh, well, the science has changed. Oh, no, it just took a little bit of common freaking sense to know how things like this typically work to predict that it would be the same freaking thing. But I'm not an evolutionary biologist, so what am I going to know? All right, we've got to take another quick break. First of all, I don't think our sponsor, Jenny, is sell. So listen up, there is only one week left to save 60% off Jenny sells most popular package for Valentine's Day. So gentlemen, if you have not yet gotten something for your lady, you've got to get on it. All right, she's going to be very mad if you don't get her Jenny sell.

And you're going to get that primer, Jennysell.com slash y. Well, you may remember the story that we brought you about the Biden administration, well, all in the name of racial equity, sending free crackpipes out throughout the country, because, look, they want to make sure that if you are a drug user, that you at least have nice equipment to continue your drug habit with. And yes, you may be asking, am I as a taxpayer paying for people to be sent for druggies to be sent? Free crackpipes, the answer is yes. You are actually going to work so that you can fund people's cocaine and methamphetamine and what, I guess that would be crack, right? I don't know because I'm not a drug user. I have no idea. But we talked about it. This was a real story. This was in the budget for, I believe it was the Department of Health and Human Services. And it was in the Substance Abuse Harm Reduction Grant. So Snopes got a hold of this story. And in their, like, the gymnastics that they have to go through to be able to call something mostly false or lacking context or whatever the case may be. I just wanted to, just in case you hear this from your liberal friends, that didn't actually happen because Snopes said that this was mostly false. You fake newser, you actually can be rest assured that it is actually true. And here's why Snopes listed this claim as mostly false. And if you read the fine print, it says what's true, a US Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse Harm Reduction Grant did require recipients to provide safer smoking kits to existing drug users. But what's false is that there were, like, actually a lot of components of this grant program. And this wasn't the most important one. It wasn't the grant's primary focus. It wasn't the purpose of the program. So this particular story is mostly false. That was what Snopes used. Now, by the way, my producer did go back to the story right before we aired the show. And Snopes is now calling it outdated. So they're just saying it's outdated. And by the way, this newly stipulated detail of the grant program was not originally available, meaning the assertions made in a first wave of coverage had become outdated. So just so you know, the fact checkers that are getting people kicked off of YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and all of these places, this is what they're using. And this is how they are coming to the conclusions they are coming to convince you not to believe your own eyes and ears. It's fascinating. Colin. Yeah, I mean, I used to go to Snopes before. And I thought they used to not be partisan. But it's clear that they can now take statements that are completely true and construe them as mostly false, just because they don't include every single bit of information you could possibly include in the story. Like, was it true that they're using crackpipes? They're giving crackpipes to people? Yes, that is entirely true. Are they only giving crackpipes to people? No, they're probably giving more things to them, but that's even more concerning possibly. Yeah, the well, needles, I think. And yeah, there's definitely more than just the crackpipes, but they don't include that context, right? And I recall, I think it was during the Joe Biden's campaign, the people would say something off the wall that he said, and it would end up in one of these fact checking articles. And they'd be like, well, yeah, I mean, Joe Biden did say that, but obviously, what he really meant was this. And it's like, oh, okay, now we're giving him a pass because we think what he really meant was that. That would have been nice for you guys to give the other side, ever. Yeah, now the fact checking is just such a meme at this point. I mean, it really is. I think how you talk about the grading system. And this goes into how deceptive they are. Mostly false, by definition, is kind of true, right? And that's what they do, is they take something that actually does have truth to it. But because they have a partisan mission to accomplish there, they take everything else that doesn't have anything to do with what you just said, and they make that the focus of it, that way they can slap a mostly false on it, but they also, in these things, they recognize, and we always point this out, that there was truth to what they were trying to do in whole. That's a very complicated way to saying, yes, they are partisan and full crap. I remember there was, we had to fight this all the time here, all the time. And I remember there was one, we did some story. I think it was Joe Biden's ancestors were slave owners. It was completely true. It was, you know, dumb. You're a comilless. It was a comilless. No, no, it was Joe Biden. Oh, both of them. It was just Joe Biden. Okay. No, I thought a story that comilless ancestors were slave owners as well. That was probably true as well. But this one we did, and we had, there was genealogists that had done this, very respected, you know, their version of peer reviewed. Yeah. And there was bulletproof. And we're like, hey, we're not saying this is whatever, but you know, by your own standards, this should mean something to you, right? Right. And they fact checked it, said it was false. So they handed it to me, our people, and I looked at it, and what they actually listed as saying that it was mostly false was nothing we even said in our entire deal. I was like, wait a minute. So we wrote it back. And this thing that you're saying, you're saying it's true, it's false. We never said that. We never said that. And so it took like a couple of weeks by then the damage is done, then they write a small little thing and say, oh, upon further, blah, blah, blah, but you could still search for it if you wanted to. And the only thing you would see on the top was still mostly false. Yep. It's ridiculous. Yeah, that is unbelievable. All right, you know what? Let's go ahead and take a quick break. I want to, there are a couple things that I want to get to when we come back if we have time for them. So first we want to thank our sponsor, CB Distillery. So look, after you go and you get the Gen Yes-L for your loved one, you need to go to CB Distillery because nothing shows that you care about your loved one.

And Ivey League spokesperson confirmed that transgender swimmer, Leah Thomas, will be eligible to compete in the upcoming Ivey League women's. Wow. Because they said women's swimming and diving championship. Then just look, I know I say this all the time, but it never stops being true. I do always feel like we need a flowchart to explain what genitalia, how they were born, all of these when we use the term transgender. So this is a biological male who is competing in these races, in these competitions. And now the biological male will be able to. They say the recent rule changes do not impact Leah's eligibility for this month's Ivey League women's swimming and diving championships. As the effective date for this unprecedented mid-season NCAA policy change begins with the 2022 NCAA Winter Championships. So because as I don't know if you guys heard, but they have this new policy that recently came out, that they defer to national governing bodies for sport eligibility, the NCAA does. But they say Leah Thomas will still compete. Colin, I know this is a topic that you, I would say are fascinated with, but I don't know if that's the right wording. Yeah, I mean, it is very frustrated. Yeah, frustrated with. In a society destruction type of way, you know, it's one of those issues where it's hard to even believe that it's going on because it's so clearly differences between men and women. It's transphobic. It's really transphobic. I've gotten, I've been called so many names for that before. It really comes down to the redefinition of what a woman is. You know, most people, and I assume you both hold that a woman is an adult human female. Yes. And what a lot of these activists have been able to do is redefine that. Redefine what a woman and a man is or a boy and a girl to a person of either sex who just so happens to identify as a woman, as a man. Which pretty much always gets reduced to if they're identifying with these stereotypes of masculinity or femininity or the rules and expectations of society that puts on individuals because of their sex. And so you don't have to change any rules in the sporting bodies at all. You know, we have the WNBA, we have women's swimming. And just because we now just have redefined what a woman is, now all these rules that were initially put in place to, you know, to protect female athletes. Now people can just identify into these categories. So there's no longer protected category. And it's not even just sports. It's women's prisons. It's their dressing rooms, day spas, all that type of any space that was, you know, designated for female only is now multi-sex. Well, and you say it's not just sports, but I mean, even with the sports, there could be a lot of families who are really dependent on the scholarship. You know, they want their girl. Their girl wants to go to a specific school and needs a scholarship to do so. And, you know, you can have a boy, I'll just say a dude, come in and swipe it from her because he wasn't good enough to participate in his own competition. Yeah. And just think about this. This is a new phenomenon, right? It's only just now starting. Think about what it's going to look like in 10 years. It's only going to get worse. It's like they're trying to destroy everything that we used to love, right? Like we used to love, like people used to have a brand, you know, loyalty. And people really loved brands, Apple, whatever, you know, whatever, car brands, all the stuff. But now they're, as they're going woke and then taking these public political stances, they're destroying a lot of things that we used to love. Like I don't look at Coke the same way I used to. That seemed to be like an all-American thing. And I see them as like a partisan, you know, bull crap as they weigh into state politics. But it's across the board. It's that, it's movies. Like there's actors that I don't even want to watch their movies anymore. I'm like, shut up, just act. I don't care about your political stances. And now sports. The things that we used to love, me personally, just to love about sports is it was a level playing field. No one had an advantage. You had, you know, the advantages that God gave you and how hard you worked, you know, and how much, you know, time you put in to get great at your craft. But there are, it's equal. It's equal. The moment it comes to unequal, they start putting asterisks on your names when it goes for records. Like, you know, PEDs and you know, stuff like that. They want to still want to allow you to take steroids. You still can't do that. But you can just switch genders if that means you can, if it gives you an advantage, that's, you know, they're not going to touch it. They're injecting these little things that make us hate what we used to love. And 10 years from now, as this gets a lot worse, who's going to watch sports? You know what I mean? Yeah. I love women's sports and, but it's a bunch of biological men dominating that sport. Not watching. I'll give a crap. It'll all come crumbling down. But if you, it's, it's crazy. And as with all leftist, you know, far left policies, the further you take them out to fruition, you take them all the way out to the extreme, you'll see where it ends up. It's, it's dumb. It's ridiculous. And it's meant to destabilize and, and destroy. Now. Same thing's going to happen with this. Colin, you recently penned an op-ed and you said, when asked, what are your pronouns? Don't answer. Can you, can you expand on my use? Why you are so transphobic? I'm just kidding. I do every day on Twitter. So I'm happy to do for you. Yeah. So it seems like a really innocuous thing to ask, what are your pronouns? And I assume you would just say, oh, she, her or something, you know, just seems. I would never say that actually. That didn't really take over when I was in academia, but now it's, it's the norm in many universities and schools. Yeah, it's, it, I still receive all the emails from a lot of the departments I used to be in, and almost all the signatures have. Stop. She, her, he, they, you know, they'll mix and match as well. How do people send their children paying for this? Yeah, it seems like to, to most, it probably just seems silly or annoying at, at best, or, you know, exhausting at worst, they constantly go in and ask people, you know, my name's Colin, my pronouns are he, him. What are yours? You're a mom. And so, but. Oh, I'd have an answer. But it's actually, I think much more harmful than people are giving a credit for because the ideology that's producing these types of requests are based on gender ideology, which as we see with the trans athletes, decouples whether you're a man or a woman from whether you're male or female. And so, when someone is asking you, what are your pronouns? They're not asking you, are you a female? They're actually asking you whether you identify with femininity or the social roles and expectations that are placed on people based on their sex. And most people probably don't identify as, you know, these caricatures of masculine and femininity. Everyone's sort of a mix or somewhere in between in the way they express themselves. I mean, there's average differences and males are more likely to be more stereotypically masculine. But this is, you know, there's a lot of people who are gender nonconforming. And it wouldn't be a big issue if people were just, you know, saying that, oh, I'm identifying as woman because I'm more feminine. But we're currently describing people who are gender nonconforming. This is called now gender dysphoria if you identify as these other stereotypes if you don't fit them. And these come with puberty blockers for kids, cross sex hormones, irreversible surgeries. So whenever you're, if you're participating in these pronoun rituals, you're basically operating within that ideology that says that whether you're a man or woman is completely disconnected from sex. Yeah. Same thing when you describe yourself as a cis man or woman. Right. That language is operating within an ideology. And it's, they're using these pronoun rituals to sort of normalize gender ideology throughout society. So stop answering. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. That was, um, that's a crime. If you liked what you heard here, which obviously this guy is sane, even though we'll forgive him for previously voting Democrat and hold out hope that we'll fully red pill him. You got to go find his, his opinion piece. It is in the Wall Street Journal when asked what are your pronouns. Don't answer. Also, I'm sure here on Twitter you said. Yeah. Okay. And you can find me at swipe right. Okay. WRIGHT, my last name. That's cute. And also I have a website called realities last stand that I sort of it's a news. It's a weekly newsletter.
