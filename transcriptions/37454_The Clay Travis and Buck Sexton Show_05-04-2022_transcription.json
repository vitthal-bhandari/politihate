Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you as we roll through the Tuesday edition of the program. Letting you know where we're headed. We're going to talk about a mom who spoke out against the mask mandate in New York City and has already lost her job. Elon Musk owns 9.2% of Twitter, the largest single shareholder he is now going to be on the board. That is going to be an intriguing story to follow as it pertains to Twitter's embrace of the First Amendment. Stacey Abrams four years ago was worth 100 K. She ran for governor. She lost. She's now a multi millionaire. We will discuss that. Colin Kaepernick is the biggest fraud in the history of sports media. All that coming your way plus we're scheduled to be joined in the next hour by Monica Crowley and then in the third hour by Senator Ron Johnson of the state of Wisconsin. But right off the top, Katanji Brown Jackson is going to be confirmed. There are now three Republicans. I think Buck, you got it right when you said that you thought three Republicans would ultimately end up not quite Nashville, no Sridomist level, but pretty good. Pretty good. Two of the three makes sense. And let me explain what I mean by that. Susan Collins in Maine has a perspective that has been consistent and that I respect. And that perspective in general is I am going to give deference to the president in general. And the Senate's job is to advise and consent and look over the nominees, but not to say, Hey, we're only going to support people who agree 100% with us. And Susan Collins credit, she stepped up and supported Brett Kavanaugh when there was immense pressure on her not to support Brett Kavanaugh. And really, when she won re-election against Cohen, I believe, was who was running against her, the expectation was she was going to lose. She won comfortably Maine trust Susan Collins to make the right decision. So I respect the consistency of the principle of Susan Collins when it comes to giving deference to the president, whether he's a Republican or a Democrat and voting for most of the time, the nominees. C.S. Murkowski, Senator from Arkansas from from Alaska, is in a tough re-election battle right now. And I believe she is making a political calculation that she's more likely to win if she supports Katanji Brown Jackson. That's less noble to me. I also think that Murkowski got it 1 billion percent wrong when she voted against Brett Kavanaugh. That to me is reason enough not to be a big fan of her. If I'm Alaskan voter, I would not be pleased with this decision, but she's been a bit erratic in terms of whether she's going to support or not support nominees. She ultimately voted for Amy Coney Barrett. So I'm less impressed by Murkowski. But again, she's in the middle of an election. The person that I'm disgusted by fuck is Mitt Romney. That's the right way. I am I am utterly disgusted with Mitt Romney. And it's not just about this vote, Buck. In the last few weeks, Mitt Romney has said I'm voting for Katanji Brown Jackson. This one got me way angrier. He voted against repealing the TSA mask mandate, Buck. He was the only Senator on the Republican side. Remember there were 57 votes, seven Democrats or eight Democrats, whatever it was, actually were willing to vote against the TSA mask mandate credit to those Democrats for getting that right. Mitt Romney got that 100% wrong. Remember, Buck, he said, I'm going to defer to the experts, even though the experts have gotten almost everything wrong wrong, he didn't show up to vote on defunding the Biden vaccine mandate. This was a big vote. He wouldn't even manage to make it there. And remember, he also accused Tulsi Gabbard of treason for opposing war in Ukraine. Greg Price did a good job putting all those things together of cowardice, in my opinion, from Mitt Romney. So if I'm a Utah voter right now, Buck, I am done with this dude. I want him out of office. I think that he is so concerned now with the New York Times editorial board writing something nice about him. And also when he dies one day, that his obituary in the New York Times is going to be nice. I think he is a fraud. I think he is a chump. I think that he is everything that is wrong with people who get so obsessed with the intelligentsia liking them that they don't stand up on principle anymore. And he was the Republican nominee for president in 2012, everybody. Just when we talk about the the GOP and some of its failings, just remember that this was the guy. I mean, I voted for him. So there was that, you know, which, which now I say out loud, I go, but when I, you know, I felt that was the better choice at the time. He actually was pretty good back then on border issues, believe it or not, he was a big e-verify guy. So there were some things that I could point to I say, well, Mitt was, Mitt was better than, uh, better than the alternative. But Clay, there is a, there is a specific Republican malady, a specific GOP, uh, psychological defect whereby people get into elected office and, and as you put it out with the New York Times, they are so quick to stab their own side in the back for just the most meager pat on the head from the Democrat elites, just, just some crumbs from the table of vanity fair and all of a sudden they, you know, they forget about why they got there in the first place, what they promised to do for the electorate. There are some other Republican senators that I'm sure people are thinking about in this context, too. By the way, good, good, uh, historical context there from Rieckowski. For me, unforgivable for a Republican to have voted against Kavanaugh. Unforgivable. Uh, I wasn't going to write the, I'm listed. We got a lot of people who listen in Alaska, Buck. I wouldn't vote for her. I know she's got a challenger who's an actual Republican. Yeah. She's trying to run basically as an independent and Alaska does have a strong independent street. We should dig in less significant. We should dig into who her primary challenger or, or who the other, you know, who the Republican is in that race, uh, because there, there needs to be, that, that is a total, that is a no go. I mean, if you vote, if you're a Republican, you voted against Kavanaugh, you're no longer as far as I'm concerned, you shouldn't be an elected officer, at least not as a Republican and not even as an independent. I think that's outrageous. So then you get to Collins, who she's going to be in a tough one. And here's, here's the thing, you have a likelihood here of a big wave in the house. Senate is a trickier game. And you know, we got to play strategically on the right so that we actually end up, I mean, if you have a Joe Biden last two years of term one, I think, assuming of course he's going to stay in for the last two and not step down, you have the house in control that's helpful. You have the house and the Senate and Republican hands. Joe Biden's just sitting there getting ready to figure out what the, I would, I would say for reelection, but who knows what the plan is actually going to be. And the Senate map is not super good for Republicans going into this midterm. It's not going to be an easy one. You might end up, you know, maybe we get a, you know, a two or three, if we get a two or three seat swing, that would be pretty solid, I think, for the GOP, given what the map actually looks like. So if we get to 53, 5347, make sure my math is right there, that would be good. Obviously, in the house, I've said 50 plus, we got to go 50 plus. So Susan Collins, I'll get the past two. But with Mitt Romney, Clay, Mitt Romney went marching with BLM with his mask on outside. You know, I guess when you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars because you basically levered up and looted a bunch of companies with bane private equity back in the day, you know, when you've done that, money doesn't really appeal to you anymore. Principal doesn't really appeal to you anymore. You don't want to be in the fight. You want people in prominent positions to like you. And that's the disease that Republicans have some of them. It's so pathetic. Again, I give credit to Susan Collins for standing on principle as it pertains to these votes. And, and again, I'm still fired up as we just talked about with Lisa Murkowski. I think she's made poor decisions. Again, if I'm in Alaska, I don't want her to be my senator based on what she did with Kavanaugh. But at least she's been inconsistent, right? For and that's not a praise, but she's been unreliable in terms of how she's going to respond. But for Mitt Romney, I mean, he's not up for reelection. To your point, Buck, he's got hundreds of millions of dollars. If it's just this, I would say, okay, whatever. But to not be opposed to a mask mandate on airlines, to not stand up and vote against the Biden vaccine mandate, to be willing to turn your back like that on the vast majority of your constituent on the vast majority of Republicans across the country that are fighting for freedom. I find this guy detestable now. Yeah, it's I really do find Mitt Romney to be a detestable person. It's cheap false virtue that he's after. And it really is the equivalent of some of these former Republicans who run over to MSNBC. And maybe they still call themselves a Republican, or maybe they call themselves independent. And all they do is go on air to trash the side that they supposedly support and represent or did at some point. It's pathetic. I mean, there's a reason why, you know, the the betrayers and the traders are in the final circle of hell and Dante's inferno. It there's just something so unseemly about being that person who turns on your own side for the amusement of those who despise you. The left hates Mitt Romney. They don't like Mitt Romney. They're not going to say he's a good guy for this or whatever. And but there are some people that I guess are on the right. There's a little tiny, uh, percentage that are taken in by this and think that Mitt standing on principle. No, he's doing this because then he gets it. It's just all ego driven. He's just, he's just hurting the cause. And for what? He has no future in the Republican party. And here's my concern, Buck. It could end up 51 49 and Mitt Romney could be regularly siding with Joe Biden and the Democrats to get them to 50. So Kamala can break ties, right? I mean, he could be for the Republican party. If the Republicans are in the majority, he can get those sweet, sweet editorials in the Washington Post about how Romney's a maverick and how he's cementing his legacy and the Romney brand is separate from the tainted Trump. We can, we can play the whole thing out right now. That's what I'm afraid of is because to your point on the Senate map, you could end up 51 49 and Romney could be the Republican who is like Joe Manchin is to the Democrats right now. A guy who is willing to buck his own party. The difference is, you know, Joe Manchin is representing a state that voted for Donald Trump by a larger margin than any state in the country. So arguably he needs to be serving his constituents by not being a dyed in the wool Democrat all the time. Mitt Romney represents you. Yeah, maybe historically the strongest Republican state almost in the country, right? I mean, Utah, Wyoming, maybe one or two others in the conversation. Yeah. So he has zero pressure. And in fact, I mean, we could probably open up the phones right now. I'm sure that there are a lot of Utah listeners right now who are furious. We're number one in Salt Lake City, Buck. There's tons of you listening right now in Salt Lake City. And I bet you guys are as disgusted with Mitt Romney against not one vote. It's the series of votes that he has had or failed to make over the past several weeks, which have been a repudiation of much of the Republican. I think that's important too. The pattern here is such a clear indicator because one time you could say, all right, maybe his principles, you know, I disagree with him, but maybe his principles in this one instance that just happened to get him to pat on the head from the New York Times editorial board or or whomever. Maybe but time after time. I mean, I think I think he's got an addiction. He loves those crumbs from the Vanity Fair Lib table. What's also mentioned, by the way, Buck, he voted against Katanji Brown Jackson to be on the DC circuit. So what did he see that made him change his mind? This is an important detail for people out there. You vote as a senator for the elevation to circuit courts and district courts and everything else. Mitt Romney opposed Katanji Brown Jackson on the DC circuit. And then after that testimony, after actually rigorously examining her record, he decided that he was wrong to support her for the DC circuit. This is the flip side of Lindsey Graham, right? Lindsey Graham voted for Katanji Brown Jackson, the DC circuit set upon reflection. I don't think that she belongs on the Supreme Court. I'm okay with her being on a circuit court. I don't think that she belongs on the Supreme Court. Mitt Romney didn't think that she belonged on the circuit court, which is a less serious job, but he thinks she belongs on the more serious job of the Supreme Court. It's completely illogical. He's an imbecile. And I frankly find him quite contemptible. Yes, but a little bit of fire in Brimso to start off your morning. If you're on the West Coast and to start off your day, if you're on the East Coast. In the meantime, how about saving some money? You can switch from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.

A lot of people, very well-meaning people who cared about me, just thought that it was caused by a diet or can be cured by diet and exercise. Especially right after I was diagnosed, people saying what was it that you ate or are you going to have to change your diet to get rid of this? There's still a lot of, you know, people see me pick up some kind of dessert and they're like, oh, should you really be eating that or thinking, you know, if they give sugar-free things to people that that's helpful. Listen to health discovered on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to Clay and Bach. We've got a lot to get to today, including the latest in New York City where, yes, that's right, Eric Adams, instead of dealing with rampant crime, the flight of hundreds of thousands of residents, the high taxes, the dirty streets, he wants to make a campaign for moving members of the LGBTQ community from Florida as a Florida as some hellscape that people don't want to live in. But also he has had a lawyer for the City of New York fired over the mask issue. Clay's going to break that down for you in a second. We've been telling you that they're coming back. And I know that, you know, sometimes people say, oh, come on, Bach, you know, you've been in this fight for a couple of years. You and Clay have been talking about this for a long time. People have had enough. They're not going to. I don't think Fauci thinks we've had enough. I think the little Fauci isn't done with us yet. And here he is telling you, you might be forcing masks on everybody's faces again. I don't want to use the word shut down because that that is a rather draconian concept there to shut down. If we do see a serious uptick, we should be prepared to pivot and at least temporarily go back to having masking in certain into a sessions. Pivot, he said, notice that he is openly conscious clay of using words that won't really tell people what's going like. He doesn't like lockdown. He doesn't like mandate. He doesn't. He won't even use his favorite mitigation anymore. You know, we're going to pivot. We're going to be adaptable. It's like this guy says he's just a little propagandist. It's all. It's also transparently ridiculous to me, Buck. What is going to end up happening is many blue states and blue cities are going to bring back masks. We've already seen it. We're going to talk about this in the next segment. If you haven't already heard it, if you're a parent, you're going to hear this next segment that we're going to have about a mom who wanted to speak out against her kids who are preschool age being forced to wear masks. She spoke out to the mayor of New York City. We're going to play all the audio for you. She got fired from her job for doing it. If you are a parent, this is the great fear out there. This is why it matters that you're labeled a domestic terrorist. If you speak out at your school board meetings, this is why there is right now this culture of permeating fear among so many Americans when it comes to saying what we actually think. That's why I feel so fortunate, Buck, that we can actually go toe to toe with these idiot politicians implementing these policies that make no sense. We're fortunate to have the jobs that we do because I don't care and you don't care what the consequences are. We're going to tell the truth that we believe that these masks are absurd. Talking about this fired lawyer for speaking the truth about masking kids and how Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, broke his promise to the residents of the city. We'll get to that in a moment. Don't wait on an important way to prepare for the uncertain financial waters ahead because you're going to end up saying to yourself, why didn't I take action sooner? Gold is something that people get into when they know they're trying to prepare for inflation or a really rocky economy. You can get real gold sent right to your home. Now it's so easy. I've had it done myself with the Oxford Gold Group. The Oxford Gold Group is the industry leader in precious metals because they offer gold and silver at the lowest prices on the market.

Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton show Tuesday edition of the program rolling through here and a lot of you are fired up about Mitt Romney as we were both fired up to start the show talking about what I think it's fair to say is a betrayal from Mitt Romney. Not any one particular incident but this has been building particularly related to me to not being the only Republican not to oppose masks on airplanes being unwilling to show up to vote against the Biden vaccine mandate. And now you flip your vote on Katanji Brown Jackson. You didn't think she was qualified earlier to be a judge at a lower level court. And now you suddenly think she's qualified to be a judge at the Supreme Court. It doesn't make any sense at all. By the way, Mitt Romney said, well, I thought she was outside of the mainstream but then after meeting with her, I now think she's in the mainstream. I'm paraphrasing his opinion. But all that says to me is Buck, well, so you did a poor job the first time you considered her nomination. And now you're doing a better job? No, this is, this is all transparent. This is ridiculous. And a lot of people from Utah want to, want to weigh in. So let's, let's go to Julie and Dave. They are fired up over Mitt. We've got a lot of Utah right now coming in. We got a top team coming in strong. Utah is showing up strong. Again, we're number one in Salt Lake City. We appreciate all of you listening out there. Julie and Dave, what do you guys both want to weigh in, I guess? Hello. Well, I was told by your screener that I would to speak and my husband was to be a silent partner, which is the way it should be. You know, in all marriages, if you ask women, I think that's certainly true. It's certainly true in my house. No, I'm just kidding. No, actually, I was going to have him beyond that the screener didn't want us both to speak. But so I, you know, worry, we are lifelong Utah residents. And we just wanted to weigh in that he is an embarrassment to us in Utah. And we just want everyone to know that he does not represent the values here. We have so many children in the state. And the Kataanjibran Jackson thing is just amazing to us that he would side with that given her her record on sentencing regarding child porn. He is not responsive to his constituents. I mean, we have emailed him on an issue. And it took him like six months to even reply to us. And it was a form letter that did not even address or make sense to the issue that we had emailed him about. You know, we don't know what his angle is. But we will actively campaign for and support any opponent that conservative that comes up against him. I know there is talk of RAG Sean Reyes throwing his hat into the ring against him. And we would be so excited for that to happen. I don't know if it's just spite or his ego regarding the Trump issue. And that conservatives didn't accept him as a president. But Trump endorsed him. You know, I think he did. I got a check on that. I remember he remember this maybe Secretary of State. I think Trump endorsed him. Yeah, I remember they had that awkward dinner for him. We did not vote for him. Yes. Last go round. Because I could see, you know, I could see the Wolf and Sheets clothing. If you want to put it that way. Can I just just just throw this out there. Trump did endorse him back in 2018. Did he? Yes, he did. Well, well, regardless of that, we know our history history and and you know, I don't know if he's playing a McCain and he just wants to be viewed well in the history books or the, you know, like you guys are saying you guys are spot on with what you're saying about him because he is just. Well, thank you, Julie. You were you were a stoop. Lister. I appreciate it. I really appreciate everybody. We got a lot of people who want to weigh in. And look, I think he should have a serious challenge in 2024. And I think what he is thinking he is going to do, Buck is maybe he's going to run for president in 2024. And he's going to be the rebel and look, Mitt Romney is I mean, the best description I ever heard of Mitt Romney is he's the guy who's in the photo in fake, the fake photo that is in every frame that you buy in a department store, right? Like Mitt Romney is the bland sort of, you know, well kept, well groomed, white guy who's in every photo in a, in a picture frame, right? You know, if you go into a department store, they have the fake photo that's like the standard bearer inside of the picture frame. That's Mitt Romney. He stands for nothing. There's no depth to him. He is a absolute in my opinion, just was I think we're not alone here given how every line has been lit up with colors from Utah on this issue. Specifically, we've just got Utah colors. People around the country are annoyed about what he's done too. But we got Brian in Layton, Utah. What's up, Brian? Hello, big fan Buck. After the 2020 election, I would get annoyed when you kept talking about COVID rather than a potential fraud in the election. But you were completely correct. I'm Utah voter and definitely didn't vote for Romney in the primary and almost didn't vote for him in the general. But I was lazy and filled the straight Republican ticket. I would definitely take that back and I'll make that mistake again. When I heard he voted to keep kids in mass, I was disgusted and I wrote him right away. And I got that same lame response that you mentioned earlier that he trusts the experts. That's finalist response drives me crazy because it is the leader that we elected that are responsible to weigh all options like you've been on your show for years, for years. And I recommend to everyone the books, get in the game by not seem to live because we can't trust experts. They have their bias. They have their their skin is barely in the game. And we need leaders who have skin in the game that will weigh all options and be reasonable and smart like you guys think. Thanks so much, Brian. Appreciate it. I think Naseem Taleb is a pro mask guy. So we got to we got to check that one out. I'm pretty sure. But the stories do reflect Buck that experts get things wrong all the time. And the more of a limited expert you are, the more likely you are to get the things wrong in your chosen field. Take it outside of masking. Look at economist, economist get everything wrong. You know, they can tell you why something matters after it happens, but their forecasts are almost universally wrong. Well, this is also why the history of medical breakthroughs, scientific breakthroughs, really breakthroughs comes a for to consensus always. I mean, there's there are people because they didn't know something before. Usually when someone comes along with some great piece of new knowledge that is true, ever and around them, the system, the establishment, the apparatus doesn't say, wow, you're a genius. They say, Oh, that's reckless. What do you mean you want to sterilize instruments? You want to wash your hands between surgeries? What are you crazy? You're mucus and blood and stuff on your hands. It's possible when you go from one surgery to the next, that was the state of modern medicine, so to speak. And so what the middle of the 19th century give or take? Yeah, coming out of London, they suddenly started saying, Hey, maybe if we clean our medical equipment, maybe if we sterilize, maybe this could make sense. And that was ridiculed by all of the people in positions of power at the time. Every major breakthrough comes a for the scientific or expert or whatever consensus of the time. Just remember that one. Let's see. We got Bob and Ogden, Utah. Hey, Bob. Hey, how are you doing today? We're good. What's on your mind? Well, going back to the when Romney ran for president back in 2012, I refused to vote for him for the simple fact that when Harry Reid accused him of not paying taxes for 10 years, Romney would even stand up and defend himself. And I figured if he's not going to defend himself, he's not going to defend the American people. So I wrote in bill a cat, a much more qualified individual. All right, he doesn't stand up for himself. Steve in Salt Lake City. Let's get Steve in here as well. Hey, guys, something happened to Romney between the first and second debate in 2012. I campaigned for him. Dennis Miller was right there ready to go to that second debate and keep going with him. And something happened. He didn't even go after Ben Godsey. You know, he did have a good Russia comment. But something happened between that first and second debate back when he was running against Obama and I'm still trying to figure out what that was. I mean, Steve, I remember those debates very well. And that first debate against Obama, Mitt Romney absolutely crushed it. I mean, it was not close. Not even even the Democrat spin room afterwards. There was kind of a muttering of, oh, that wasn't good. And then in the second debate, when the Benghazi issue came up, Candy Crowley boxed out, mitt, so to speak, and decided to jump in in favor of Obama on the, did he call it a terrorist attack or not? And that kind of turned some of the momentum because, you know, CNN is a Democrat propaganda network. So that's not surprising. I also think, you know, historically, there is a press. You're right. He dominated in that first debate. Historically, there is often the case. Trump was a disaster in the first debate against Joe Biden and then just completely cleaned his clock the next time they went. The president often does a really bad job, the first debate, because he hasn't been prepping as much as the contender has because he's, you know, the president of the United States. So he's worried about everything else. But man, I wish we could go back in time and change that first debate that now that I'm speaking about it, that Trump had with, with Biden, because if he had debated the second time in those situations, like he did the first one, it would have been a utter destruction.

Listen to health discovered on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show when your enemy is in retreat. That's when you want to press forward. That's how you turn a retreat into a route. And there are a number of political issues where the Democrats are running for cover now that more people know what's going on now that they understand the reality of some of these positions. They can't really make the case, not in a midterm election year. They can't get away with just appeasing and and doing whatever the woke left says. They have to explain some things to the American people. I think one of the areas that is surprising to many of the Biden regime so far is that almost 80 year old Joe Biden is somehow now a woke warrior for the trans child agenda or for trans children. I don't think anybody saw that. I don't think they had that on the on the bingo card, so to speak. I don't think they were expecting this one. And here you have the White House being asked about this because this is now a reality. It used to be clay when we would have these debates. Hey, if we're really going to, you know, use different gender pronouns, how long until you have males in women's prisons and women competing against men in sports and all these things have how long before and they said, Oh, you're just fear mongering or Oh, we can go back and play all those clips. You go find that all over the place editorials five years ago, 10 years ago. And now it's shut up big it. That's not a man. It's a six foot three woman who happens to have male genitalia swimming in that pool. Okay. Okay, that's an interesting position for them to take. And the White House and this is what I mean by there they're on there on defense now because people have seen quite clearly the reality of this left wing agenda policy or this left wing agenda rather on the policies that it creates. Here is the White House. Here's Jen Psaki being asked by, of course, Peter Ducey about what the White House's feelings are right now on men competing against women in sports. In some places like the Ivy League now, there are biological males competing against women. Does the White House think that it's fair? Well, I would note that we're not the governing body for the NCAA or any other system out there that I believe you're probably referring to the case over in swimming in the NCAA. We understand how important sports are to student athletes across the country. But the NCAA obviously makes puts these policies in place. What I would say, Peter, if we look at this broadly is that we celebrated international transgender day of visibility last week with a slate of new actions to ensure we're continuing. We continue to protect the dignity and identity of all Americans. Oh, Blather, Blather and misdirection Clay. The question was to the White House, should men compete in women's sports? This White House is too cowardly or perhaps too savvy because they know how the American people feel to answer. Well, credit to Peter Ducey for asking the question, Joe Biden needs to be asked this question directly himself because to your point, Bucky, 79 years old, there is no way on earth that Joe Biden, who I believe is a sports fan based on past statements, everything, some clicks on outkick when no one's looking. I think I think he may have been on out. Well, I don't know. He knows how to use the internet, but if he knows how to use the internet, then he might have been on outkick. I think he's a big Eagles fan historically played sports growing up. And so there is a zero percent chance buck that 79 year old Joe Biden believes that a biological man should be kicking women's asses in this woman pool. And also the democratic base does not believe this either, right? There's about 10 or 20% of Democrats that do and everybody's cow towing to that group. But do you think black, Hispanic, Asian men in particular who are overwhelmingly sports fans? Do you think they want their daughters and granddaughters and competing against men? No way. And so this is a dodge. And it's a dodge buck because Democrats can't figure out how to figure out how to balance this pyramid of victimization because women are a huge percentage of the democratic base now. Overwhelmingly, the Democrats are made up of women. And the transgender community is a overwhelming base for the Democratic Party. You have to make a choice. You're either in favor of transgender rights being so inclusive that there is no difference between men and women. Or you support women's sports can't have it both ways. And I think the overwhelming majority of Americans support women's sports. They believe women should compete against women and men should compete against men. And the Democrats are afraid to say that because it attacks their base and they know that they're on the wrong side of this issue. If there were more than a handful of actual, I'm going to say actual journalists, just people that want to get real answers from this White House, there would be follow on to she didn't answer the questions. A very straightforward question. The White House factors in on Title IX issues all the time. The White House factors in on or will weigh in on any number of cultural and political issues. You know, they'll to pretend that they don't have a position on this is cowardice. But they know that if they make it too obvious, the Democrats are always hiding what they really believe to fool. Unfortunately, you know, 10% of the middle of the country, you know, metaphorically speaking, politically speaking, in the voting for them. And so this is why they won't answer the question, which is why we have to keep pushing and keep asking because Clay, their only choices are betray women's sports or betray the West, the left wing lunatic base. There is no third. That's right. That's right. And they're refusing to pick a side, speaking and picking aside, moms have picked a side. They want their kids out of masks. A mom in New York City just lost her job for making that argument. You're going to want to hear this story next. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth.
