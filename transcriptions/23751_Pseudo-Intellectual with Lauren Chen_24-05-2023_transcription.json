    "text": " So it looks like the LA Dodgers have found themselves at the center of a nationwide political and social controversy, but before you start feeling bad for them, just remember that they brought all of this on themselves. Now in case you were not familiar with this ongoing story, allow me to introduce you to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. You see, they are a drag group that is made a name for themselves parodying and really mocking the Catholic religion. Apparently they are, quote, known for their campy, gender-fluid religious costumes and demonstrations, and the Sisters have scandalized Catholics almost from the moment of their inception in 1979. Now I have the displeasure of bringing up the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence because apparently they were supposed to be honored by the LA Dodgers on some Pride night that was supposed to be going on. And now why a baseball team is having a Pride night at all? Uh, I mean that's a good question. One, I'm not sure of the answer to considering that gender and sexual identity doesn't really seem to have a lot to do with baseball, but apparently this isn't really that new of a thing because it's been going on for 10 years. But anyway, once people found out that the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence would not only be invited by the Dodgers to this event, but would actually be honored by them, it raised some eyebrows and I think rightfully so. In fact, so much so that Senator Marco Rubio sent this letter to the MLB commissioner. As Rubio explained, the Sisters are men who dress in lewd imitation of Roman Catholic nuns. The group's motto, Go and Sin some more, is a perversion of Jesus's command to Go and Sin no more. The group's Easter ceremony features children's programming followed by a drag show where adult performers dress in blasphemous imitation of Jesus and Mary. The group hosts pub crawls mocking the stations of the cross and even the Eucharist, the sacrament that unites more than one billion Catholics around the world. This letter further asked, do you believe that the Los Angeles Dodgers are being inclusive and welcoming to everyone by giving an award to a group of gay and transgender drag performers that intentionally mocks and degrades Christians, and not only Christians, but nuns who devote their lives to serving others? Well said Marco Rubio, and I mean still at the core of this whole conversation, I believe we need to be asking why? The LA Dodgers, a baseball team is even dipping their toes into something like pride. I think it just goes to show how everything has become politicized under the left. But anyway, after that letter from Marco Rubio as well, it's just general outrage from Roman Catholics and people with common decency. The Dodgers eventually did disinvite or pull back from the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, but before you count this as a win, it seems like the Dodgers, they have bent the knee once more to the LGBT crowd after, I guess, louder and more aggressive pressuring from the left. Because if there's one thing the left does do better than the right, it's, I suppose, bullying corporations to submit to their wins. And we have more to talk about here, but first I want to put something on your radar. It's really cool. Special from here, Blaze TV, the Reckoning. You see, last night, Glenn Beck laid out the Biden crime family's staggering level of corruption in his viral special, the Reckoning, and during that show, he outlined a plan to finally hold the Biden's accountable for their crimes. But you see, it does require all of you listening to Take Action in order for it to work, head over to the Reckoning Guide dot com right now and download our Biden Crime Family dossier. This guide contains a list of hundreds of crimes the Bidens appear to have committed, as well as the contact information of the prosecutors and attorneys general with the power to bring them to justice. Join us in demanding that these officials take action and prosecute these crimes together. We will wage a public pressure campaign so great they can't ignore us. Again, that's the Reckoning Guide dot com. Please join us in calling on these state officials to finally enforce the law. There are enough of this that we can make it happen, but it's going to take some effort from all of us. But as I was saying, as mad as people on the right and Catholics and Christians were, that the LA Dodgers would invite a group that really makes a mockery out of their religion, it turns out that the left was even more offended, even more outraged that the LA Dodgers would dare not honor these drag queens. How could they? I mean, basically, they're basically Hitler for not saying, hey, drag queens mocking Catholicism. You are brave and stunning. And just for context, by the way, it's not even like the LA Dodgers canceled their entire Pride night. They just said, you specifically group of drag queens that is mocking Catholicism. Maybe it's not the best idea that you come. Yeah, leftists didn't like that. Here's one actually for our reference, specifically US Congressman Jimmy Gomez. He wrote that by caving to political pressure, the Dodgers opened their front gates to the hate and transphobia, Marco Rubio, and far-right extremists have been trying to spread to California for years. All this bigotry towards drag queens and trans Americans has been one big dog whistle for the extremist space ahead of the next election. Gomez also continues that one thing that's been made clear by Angelino's reactions, this bigotry won't fly in our backyards or our outfields don't peddle that crap here or anywhere. It would be clear in case we weren't all aware of the current situation in America. It is perfectly acceptable and you will be welcomed by the mainstream. I mean, the media corporations, you name it, it's okay to completely mock and deride Christianity Catholicism. You can be little or religion held by, I mean, what is it, a third of the people on earth? You can mock Jesus Christ. You could burn the Bible and it does not matter corporate America, the mainstream media, Hollywood, they will still love you. They will still welcome you. They will honor you. But if you for a second look at a drag queen and say, hang on a second, I'm not sure about this. Not even necessarily critical of the drag aspect of it, but you just don't like that maybe this specific group of drag queens is mocking Christianity. You will be absolutely crucified by the left because apparently being a drag queen is now a protected status. Like, you know how religion used to be considered religions like Catholicism, that is actually how the left now views drag queens. If you're a drag queen, do whatever. It doesn't matter. You're stunning and brave and at the top of the oppression hierarchy. At least until there are more developments with the whole Jordan Nealey case, in which case, you know, black people will once again take their position at top. But no, for now, especially since it's June, it's the gays. And speaking of the gays, actually big gay, the gay lobby, they did not take kindly, predictably, to the Dodgers decision. LA Pride came out saying as a longstanding partner of the LA Dodgers. Once more, why are the Dodgers partnering with LA Pride? Like, does that, that doesn't make sense? They said we are very disappointed in the decision to rescind their invitation to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to be honored at the 10th annual LGBTQ plus Pride night. They continue to say that Pride is a fight for equality and inclusion for the entire LGBTQ plus community. And we're not going to stop now. Let's make this year's Pride celebration louder than ever. So once more, these people, these activists, to be transparent, they only care about inclusion when it comes to their degenerate lifestyles. Okay, they don't care about inclusion when it comes to Christians, Catholics, certainly not Republicans. They only care about including those that they share, I don't know, mental illness with. And so ultimately, because corporations have absolutely no backbone anymore, and nobody cares about the thoughts or feelings of conservatives and Christians. To top off this story, we have this statement from the LA Dodgers. Delivered, of course, on a Pride flag, this message reads, after much thoughtful feedback from our diverse communities, honest conversations within the LA Dodgers organization, and generous discussions with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the LA Dodgers would like to offer our sincerest apologies to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence members of the LGBTQ plus community and their friends and families. We have asked the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to take their place on the field at our 10th annual LGBTQ plus Pride night on June 16th. We are pleased to share that they have agreed to receive the gratitude of our collective communities for the life-saving work that they have done tirelessly for decades. In the weeks ahead, we will continue to work with our LGBTQ plus partners to better educate ourselves, find ways to strengthen the ties that bind and use our platform to support all of our fans who make up the diversity of the Dodgers' family. If you are a Christian, if you are a Republican, a conservative, if you are just a sane person living in this clown world, in my opinion, you cannot, in good conscience, continue to support the LA Dodgers. What they have done with this statement is made perfectly clear the fact that they do not care about the feelings, the sensibilities, the opinions of Christians. They would rather pander to these degenerates because simply put, they are in vogue right now. And by the way, I also want to add that this isn't just a case of the Dodgers placing more importance on drag queens than religion because I mean, I think we all understand that if it were Islam, that these drag queens had been mocking, there would be no way, absolutely no way, that they would have even been invited to the stadium in the first place. And the reason why that is, is because Muslims don't take offense sitting down. Let's just say it. And I'm not saying, you know, I support trying to be hit or bomb people because they offend me. But let's be real. The reason why these companies are comfortable offending and spitting on Christians is because we never do anything about it. So I think it's time these corporations learn that there is a cost, a literal financial cost to giving us the finger. That's basically all I have to say for now though.
