Hello America, happy Monday. Hope you had a great weekend, beautiful summer weekend, a little bit of rain on the east coast, but we needed it, yards were getting a little dry. We went up to our cabin and did a lot of yard work. It was actually kind of cool to work in the rain. He didn't break out as much of a sweat. You weren't dehydrated as easily, and we got a lot done in the yard. My wife was real happy that we got the gardens looking a little better up there, which is always an exciting thing to enjoy in the great Shenandoah Mountains. All right, back today, we got to get right back to work because there's important things going on. It's hard to believe, but within a couple of weeks, children are ready to be back to school. Yeah, bad news, kids. Summer's almost over. Good news, parents. Summer's over. You get your kids back in school. But that means we got to be keeping an eye on all that is going on in the school system. This rise of drag queen shows that are kids are being subjected to a lot of questions about teachers and school educators and others encouraging students to consider gender transformation treatments. There is a cornucopia of dangers out there for your child, and of course, you're right. Don't stop when your child walks in the classroom. You still have a say over what goes on in the classroom. And someone who does this better than anyone else, Tiffany Justice for Moms for Liberty is going to join us. Give us the headlines and what's been going on. Believe it or not, Moms for Liberty got censored by Twitter. Yeah, a lot of people are getting censored all in a row right now on Twitter. But she's here with the latest on that censorship, what it is, what's going on. And one of the interesting things that Moms for Liberty is expanding upon. They already got the classroom, the school boards, the woke administrators and teachers covered and they're growing in their work on that. But they're also beginning to take on woke prosecutors whose policies put your children at risk on their way to school and their way home from school in your backyard playing because the bad guys get out within days with Omis no bond. After committing a heinous crime, they put the entire community, including your children, your family at risk. We've all seen the video of those young children being forced to walk to school was through a drug gallery where people were shooting up with dangerous drugs. That's not the community we want our children walking through. That's not the environment we want them to. That's why Moms for Liberty is upping their game. They're going to be here in the second half of the show. First up though, Ann Dorn, to me, when I talk about courage, she's the model of courage. She's the model of grace, a model of inspiration. She is the wife of the late St. Louis police captain David Dorn. You all know him. He was a community hero beloved by his community shot dead by a BLM writer in St. Louis during the summer riots of 2020. His attacker was just recently convicted. And even during the conviction, Ann Dorn showed the grace that she has been come known for. She actually said that she felt for the family of the killer because they were losing a son just like she lost a husband. What a graceful thing. Gracious, graceful, loving thing to say at a moment when maybe feeling a sense of justice and vindication would be the normal response. But Ann Dorn isn't just gracious. She is courageous. She's out there fighting against Black Lives Matter against well prosecutors trying to get corporate America to realize funding those organizations, funding those cyber prosecutors only wreck mayhem, not only on their company, but on their communities and on their customers in those communities. She's doing a great project with concerned communities for America led by Pastor Mark Little. We've had Mark on this show, an amazing guy energetic and willing to stand up to corporate America and say, you know what? Funding BLM is just not smart. Defunding the police, funding both prosecutors or supporting well prosecutors are failing to speak up against well prosecutors. They actually put your customer base at risk. That's not a good business model. Get out of that business. Well, that's what Mark Little's doing. And Ann Dorn has joined the fight. And what a powerful story she has and the loss of her husband, the extraordinary grace and resilience she has shown. We're going to talk to Ann Dorn about that in just a few seconds after the commercial break. But first, I want to tackle a couple stories that went on today at just the news. One that I wrote myself that I think is worth taking a look at because the subtle ways that we get misled in America, well, they're getting more sophisticated. It's easier, it seems, for politicians to get away with misleading statements, particularly with the media that doesn't want to have the courage to challenge them. But let's take a look first at a very important story. My colleague Madeline Hubbard wrote over the weekend, there are 10 Wisconsin County clerks, 10 city and county clerks who have referred new voter fraud cases from the 2020 election, meaning they have found the evidence they want prosecution This data comes from the Wisconsin election commission, which is the permanent bureaucracy that regulates Wisconsin's legislature. Of course, it was a permanent bureaucracy that not once but twice has been struck down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court for falsely or illegally imposing regulations on the 2020 election that weren't allowed first with permanently staying at home and allowing people to vote without a voter ID court said that was illegal during COVID-19. And then for the distribution and use of mobile ballot box, drop boxes, as we call them, those also weren't authorized by Laura, the Constitution, both of those decisions, which allowed hundreds of thousands of voters to vote in ways they weren't allowed to have been declared illegal. They're not going to be allowed in the next election. At least that's what we are. But these clerks are going beyond making sure that 2022 is finding evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and meeting it out and getting it to prosecutors and to regulators so they can be punished. Check out that story, a really good story in Justin News this morning from my great colleague Madeleine Hubbard, who we've had on the show before. On the censorship front, I know we're going to talk a lot about moms for liberty on this and Tiffany Justice, but Twitter also sends for the epoch times over the weekend. And well, they reversed it without explanation. They did it and without explanation, they reversed it. That's good for free speech that it was reversed. Let's hope that keeps up and we don't see any other examples of that silliness. And finally, the story that I wanted to talk about Liz Cheney, remember I said the subtleties of how misinformation, disinformation, misleading claims get to live on in America? Well, here's why that sometimes happens, right? Oh, about a week ago, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Republican for Wyoming who's about to face her voters in the Wyoming primary coming up later this month, she said that Donald Trump should be reprimanded to spies because he didn't issue an order forcing troops to go to the Capitol January 6. And I heard this and I'm like, wait a second, the president can't just order troops under the Posse Comatades Act, a law that's been on the books for 150 years, you have to get permission. You have to get permission from the local community. You have to get a request in most circumstances. That's been the longstanding rule and approach of the Pentagon under President's Democrat and Republican. And I know Liz Cheney should know this. You know why? As my rare story this morning points out, her father Dick Cheney, the former Defense Secretary, former Vice President back in 1992, followed the law the right way. He didn't order troops into Los Angeles until the mayor and the governor of California during the Rodney King rights said, help, we need help. What they did is they authorized it in advance. And when the local request came in, the Pentagon could do it. That's exactly what Donald Trump did during the January 6th riots. He's met with his military team on January 3rd, a day earlier, his Pentagon already offered the troops and said, hey, send us a request, Capitol Police, Capitol leadership, if you want it, they returned down for that. But even after being turned down, the president authorized his team verbally to go ahead and make troops available, something that happened the next day. There was a standing order made by Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary. They did it the same way as Dick Cheney, which makes Liz Cheney's criticism rather unfair, rather illegal. In fact, if as her criticism implied, the president should just order troops in, there would have been a greater outcry. And don't take my word for it. That's what the Pentagon inspector general said. There wasn't a legal basis for the president just to go send troops without anything. And let me read you what they said about the approach that the Trump Pentagon, the Trump DoD did in the days leading up to January 4th. These are direct quotes from the Pentagon inspector general, a nonpartisan expert in the law of the Pentagon, the outside independent chief watchdog with the Pentagon. This is what they said about Donald Trump's approach to getting troops ready for January 6th. We concluded that the actions that DoD Defense Department took before January 6 2020 to prepare for the planned protests in Washington, D.C. on January 5th and 6 2021 were appropriate, supported by requirements inconsistent with the DoD's roles and responsibilities. Well, that doesn't sound like Liz Cheney. But let me read further. In particular, we determined that the decisions made by Chris Miller, Defense Secretary McArthe, the Army Chief, and other senior DoD officials and actions taken by the DoD in response to the civil disturbance at the US Capitol of January 6th were reasonable in light of the circumstances that existed on that day. And the request they did and didn't receive from D.C. officials and the US Capitol police. In other words, the Pentagon can't just deploy at will, they need to get a request and that they follow those requests accordingly and had prior authorizations ready to go. Wow, this Cheney, maybe she should check her father's history books might help her out a little bit. Check out that story. The headline is Liz Cheney's January 6th attack on Trump undercut by her father's own actions during the 1992 LA riots. All the details, you don't take my word for it. You can look at the documents. I have the Dick Cheney order. I have a document that the Pentagon at Fort Leavenworth at one of its study groups produced in 2018 that went through the history of Pentagon deployment of National Guard's troops during moments of civil unrest. Very clear what the rules are consistent with what the Pentagon IG found out. All of those documents, emails are in the story, including the District of Columbia mayor, mayor Mario Bowser, who on January 5th said not only did she not request troops on January 5th, 26, which would have triggered the Pentagon to give them troops. She actually said, keep your boys out. I don't want your boots on the ground. Don't do it unless we ask for it. So how about that? That's something that Liz Cheney doesn't put out in her statement. Her criticism are clearly unfair and illegal in this case. All right, folks, we're going to take a quick commercial break. When we come back, we've got a great lineup for you starting with Ann Wooddorn, the widow of David Dorn, the great police captain slain during the 2020 summer BLM riots. All she's doing to make America better to take her husband's tragic death and turn it into good in communities big and small and in boardrooms across America and Dorn first, followed by Tiffany Justice co-founder of Monps for Liberty back to back right after these commercial messages.

Every so often as a journalist over the last 30 years, you come across a person who encounters tragedy and instead of curling up and mourning and doing this, they go right back out in the field and try to turn tragedy into good. Our next guest fits that to the bill. Her husband, Captain David Corn, was shot dead during the 2020 summer riots in St. Louis, the BLM riots. He was a beloved character in St. Louis, a great police figure, a great community figure, taken away from us way too soon. But his wife would not let that be the end of this storyline from getting his killer convicted to creating a dynamic in the community in America to try to get common sense back in policing and communities. And Dorne has been doing it from top to bottom and she joins us right now and great to have you on the show. Thank you for having me. You are an amazing person. Your resilience, your determination. And I know we have a lot to talk about. I want to talk about your radio show and the concerned communities of America. But first, just for people who might not have known David's story, your amazing husband's story, tell us a little bit about his background and what happened that fateful day in the summer of 2020. First of all, David was a policeman for 43 years. It's what he's always wanted to do in his life as a kid. He wanted to be a superhero. So what better way to do it than become a police officer. So after serving his community for 43 years, he just retired. But he had a friend who owned a business. Lee owned a pawn in Doreshah and Lee lived about an hour away when we lived about 10 minutes away. So anytime the alarm would go off, David would go check the business to make sure it was okay. And the night of April or April of June 2nd, the alarm was sounding. And as we both knew the riots were taking place in the city, earlier the night four officers had already been shot and business were being looted and burned down. When the call came in, he didn't give it a second thought. He ran to the business. And while encountering some of the looters and rioters and talking to some of the young men, one of the young men turned and walked away from him and then turned back around and fired 10 shots killing David. Unbelievable. It's hard to go back in time to remember just how violent and chaotic those moments are. So recently, your husband's killer was brought to justice convicted by a jury. That was a great moment for you. But you have this poignant moment where as the conviction is coming down, you want to convey something to the killer's family. Tell us a little bit about the message that you sent his family. His mother was very upset and had to leave the courtroom. And I have sympathy for her. She's losing her son. You know, just when someone takes a life, they don't take their life and they don't they don't ruin the life of just the person they've killed, but they ruin their family's life as well. So I have a lot of sympathy for her that she's losing her son. Yeah, amazing that you can find that. Can't pass it in you. You have started a radio show, which is going bonkers. You're the host of Hidden Heroes Radio Show. I love this show because you celebrate people that we sometimes may overlook. We're doing amazing things. Tell us how that's going. It's so pretty good. You know, it's hidden heroes. It's humanized as the life of first responders. I don't always bring first responders on. A lot of times, I just bring their family members on to let people understand, hey, their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their brothers, sisters, children. You know, so I bring all their family members on to talk about what it's like to be married to a first responder or be to live with the first responder in the household. But then I also bring on organizations that support first responders and that want to do good and help them. So it is amazing to talk to people and find out, you know, and let first responders know that there are still a lot of people out there who do love them and care for them. Yeah, it's such an important message because it's easy to take all the static and anger from a small group of Americans. Like, well, that's what the rest of America thinks. But in fact, it's just the opposite. Most Americans love their first responders. Others want more of them, particularly in this time of uncertainty. We've had a little bit of time for communities to absorb the Black Lives Matter riots, the message that was there, the idea that we would defund police. What do you think communities like your own, St. Louis and others are beginning to understand about that movement? They're understanding that Black Lives Matter aren't for Black Lives. They moved in, they destroyed their own communities, where most of the destruction took place within their own communities. And Black Lives Matter, the only thing they did was provide bail for some of these people or they got like the woke prosecutors and got people let off. They didn't give any money to any of the businesses, the Black businesses that were destroyed. None of the family members who lost loved ones throughout the last few years were supported in any way, but Black Lives Matter. Their agenda is, you know, if you're killed by a police officer, if you're a Black person killed by a police officer, then we come forward and we protest. Other than that, what do I think to do with you? But even then, they don't support those families. They just go out and it gives them a reason to destroy cities. That's a remarkable one. You have now paired up with a real powerhouse. Pastor Mark Little has been on the show many times, concerning communities for America is beginning to spread a message nationwide. Tell us a little bit about the project and what you're doing. Well, myself, along with Dominic Rivera and Esther, and I can't pronounce Esther's last name, unfortunately, I do apologize to Esther all the time about it. But Esther's husband was involved in an accident where he was drunk by a car and he's now paraplegic. Dominic Rivera, if you remember, back to January, her husband was killed in New York as she addressed the Woke VAs and the police department in the eulogy and myself. But we're going after the Woke corporations, the athletes and the celebrities that have just blindly funded Black Lives Matter without question and support them without question as they're calling for the death and destruction of police officers, defunding police officers, multiple houses, paying their family members, hiring their family members, and just giving them very large salaries. So none of this money is going back and the corporations, the athletes and the celebrities aren't questioning this. They're not fighting back and saying, well, wait a minute, we gave you money to help the communities and hear you're not doing anything with it. So we're calling attention back to them and saying, listen, your money is going to waste. And if you truly want to help your communities, you know, we'll help you help your communities. The concerned communities of America will help you. We'll help you build back these communities the way they need to be and we will fund the projects and the things that need to be done within these communities, whereas Black Lives Matter is just pretty much stealing from these people. Yeah, it's really remarkable. We had someone on recently who did a documentary about 18 months after in Minneapolis after George Floyd killing and obviously that city like St. Louis had such enormous trauma and they went back through the entire committee, all the places, the small businesses that were burnt down and looted and said, has Black Lives Matter been here? I think I didn't answer it. No, we didn't get anything for them. All we got was this destruction. It seems as though this message is now being welcome that the people understand that this was sort of a charade. And at the end of the day, the real opportunity is for economic empowerment. And what do you see as the key levers for building back communities, making them stronger in urban America? It starts with communication. Everybody's down at the same table and talk, you know, have an open discussion of what is needed and what we need to do together. You know, it's a community. We have to build our communities together. We can't expect someone to come in and save us. You know, we have to save ourselves. Yes, people giving money in community design, but there has to be an openness about it. There has to be honesty of where that money is going and how it's going to be spent. But it takes the entire community to come together to do that and not just someone saying, this is what we're going to do and this is how we're going to do it. You've got to have the community involvement to make it successful. Yeah, it is really remarkable. I'm curious what reaction you've gotten from all the corporations who two years ago were bending their knee to BLM, making promises to donate, have any corporations engaged constructively with concerned communities for America and and said, Hey, we didn't know this. We want to get right. We're going to stop it. Any feedback at all from these corporations? As of now, no, I don't believe we've gotten any feedback from any of them. I, well, I take that back. One of them, one of them did say, yeah, we'll talk, but they have done anything else since then. So they've not reached out back again to us. Yeah, lip service over actual action. That's so frustrating. Once I had four concerned communities for America, obviously, taking this into the boardroom, we take it into the communities. What should we look for for the rest of this year to see the growth of what concerned communities for America is doing? Well, we're going to continue to take on that that action as far as BLM. But then our next step is going after the world prosecutors, the ones that are not prosecuting crimes out here in our communities, allowing violent offenders to go free across our countries. So we're going after them and the George Soros funded prosecutors who are letting their communities down by not doing their job. You know, my opinion's always been politics should never be involved in crime. And these prosecutors are allowing politics to play into it when their job is to prosecute cases and not pander to politicians. It's really, really remarkable. One great thing that has happened over the last couple of years beyond all the great work you've done to cement your husband's legacy to make sure the death isn't wasted that make good out of a bad situation. There are a couple highways in Missouri, right that are now named after him his name will forever be remembered as people drive down the highway. How amazing was that last year to see that? That was amazing to know that everybody will see Dave's name coming and going from work. He lived and worked in that community, both areas for most of his career and to know that they honored him in that way. It was special to know that his name is going to be carried on. Yeah, there's no doubt. Well, it's also carried out through the extraordinary work that you're doing. And what is the best way for people to engage and get involved with what you're doing, follow what you're doing on social media? Because you got something going on almost every day. It's very exciting. What's the best way for that to happen? Well, there's a couple things. On Facebook, you can engage me with the Captain David Dorn Foundation, where I'm raising money to help for area-first responders right now and the more we get the more we can help. So we're raising money to help area-first responders. So that's through Facebook or with the site you can get the online page. You can get our page through the same thing. Go through, right straight through Facebook, Captain David Dorn Foundation. And then we have Concern Communities dot org forward slash pledge. And people can engage there with that community and we can work on getting better resources for our Black and Brown communities. Yeah, such important work, Fortn' Work. And your inspiration, and on behalf of a grateful nation, you do so much to inspire us. I know a lot of people would have crawled up into a ball after losing such an extraordinary man and going through the trauma of that. But instead, you've shown us all how you actually make good of a bad situation. And for that, we're really, really grateful. Thank you. I appreciate that very much. All right, folks, go check out the Facebook page for the Foundation and Concern Communities for America. Two amazing causes, two ways to honor the great legacy of David Dorn and his amazing wife. And thank you so much. We'll have you back on real soon. I'm sure there's a lot more to be talking about on this great journey you're taking. Thank you. I look forward to it. We as well. All right, folks, we're going to take a quick commercial break when we come back to Tiffany Justice from Monter Liberty be joining us. They got banned from Twitter again.

Our next guest is a wife, a mother, a former school board member, and most importantly, co-founder of a group I know you felt the impact from moms for Liberty. She is Tiffany Justice. Tiffany, great to have you back on the show today. Hey, John, thanks for having me on. Let's start with the big news last week. Clearly, the Elon Musk end of his deal with Twitter has had an impact. There are more censorship going on and Twitter is like it was pent up for a long time. They had to expand it really quickly. Among those is the monster Liberty Count got bounced off last week. Your reaction to what's happening and also why did you write that made them sensitive? Yes, so I put out a tweet on the moms for Liberty Twitter and you can follow us at mom's the number four Liberty. I put out a tweet and I said that January, dysphoria was a mental health disorder, which it is classified as and I said that there were some predators in California, specifically Scott Wiener. I didn't mention him by name, but I will now who sponsored a bill and put up a bill that said bill is SB 107 if you want to go read it that said that California could become or wanted to become a sanctuary state for transgender youth. I guess so if children want to run away from their parents or if someone feels the child isn't being affirmed in the way that they should, they can bring them to California and make that happen there and all other laws will be ignored. So parental rights be damned. Apparently, in California, they would like our children and to liberate every other child in America. Apparently, that was considered hateful speech by Twitter. Still have no idea why. Just that's just amazing. And these are factual things, but there's nothing in that statement that didn't have a fact attached to it, right? Yeah, no, there wasn't. The last part of the tweet was that I said that I asked that said, is preteens getting double mastectomies sound like progress? And that's happening. And then I had someone say to me recently, well, you know, how can a preteens, you know, I said, you know, girls go through puberty younger than 13, right? I mean, you know, and these are people that are talking about things about children. They have no idea. And so what we have right now in America is, you know, we've got middle school girls who are having a hard time going to puberty. If you can find me in middle school girl who didn't, I'd like to talk with her. It's not easy. I've been through it. I raised a daughter, right? But you go through puberty and you kind of grow into being a woman, as it were. And but there are these girls who are being told that if they're uncomfortable during this time of their lives, that somehow something might be wrong with them, that they might actually be a boy. And that is just madness. And so moms for Liberty moms are very concerned about this issue and sounding the alarm. Yeah, it's absolutely amazing. By the way, for those who might doubt that Twitter sensors, real factual things, there is a jamma article, jamma being the Journal of American Medicine. That's kind of famous. Their pediatrics version in May of 2018 actually did a whole study on the very dynamic that Tiffany just talked about, which is chest reconstruction and chest dysphoria and trans masculine minors and young adults. That's the name of it. The short of it is, they're doing mastectomies and preteens. That is according to jamma. It's not in doubt that the Journal of American Medicine is pediatrics sub-journal did an entire pair of reviewed study on this. It's a real dynamic. And even though it's real, you get censored for it. How about that? It's just a remarkable. Tiffany, you do so much work with moms for Liberty. It seems as though every day, the war on silly America, that's what I call it, all the silliness we got going on, is being won in small battles and big battles. A lot of energy at the school board level. But now you're taking a look at some of these woke prosecutors who won't enforce the law or putting dangerous people right back on the streets. Tell us a little bit about why that's important for the safety of children. Yeah, I think the biggest issue that we have right now in America, the biggest crisis we have, as far as I'm concerned and there are a lot to choose from right now, is a literacy crisis. We're raising a generation of children and they are not reading well. And all of the data that we're seeing show that kids weren't doing well before COVID. And now we've had two years, three, two and a half years, but it's disrupted learning and they're still then they're doing worse than they were before. And so what we're seeing is that children are not learning to read in school. We need to look no farther than our prison systems to see the effects of the literacy. In Tennessee, for example, the average inmate, male inmate has a reading level of first grade and as the female's third grade reading level, people who cannot read cannot have successful lives. It's very difficult. It's like condemning a child to a life of struggle. And so when we look at the crime that we're seeing all over this country, parents are scared to walk their kids to school. I saw a mom in New York who just posted a video of what it looks like to walk her child to school in this city. And it was disgusting. There were people using drugs that was garbage everywhere. She said that she had seen people having sex on a park bench. I mean, this is just taking your kid to school at 738 in the morning. So, you know, it's time American parents are just done with this nonsense. If you said it's silliness, it's more than silliness, it's dangerous. And so, you know, we need to, we need every elected official, every appointed official to wake up and see that our kids and our families are in danger. And we're not going to stand for it anymore. And it's very seldom that I like to point out that sometimes Europe is ahead of us. But England, a great Britain, last week closed down the Taft Stock Clinic, which had been one of the most famous clinics for creating transgender surgeries for particularly in pre-teens and early teens. If England is backing away, what message does that send to the United States? Well, it's a big wake up to the United States. We've had Sweden and Finland speaking out about this. You know, they had gone farther down this path than we had in America. And right now, they're rolling things back and they're saying that medical transition is not the way to go, that there needs to be more mental health analysis. And so, I'm thankful for American heroes who are pushing forward. We have a surgeon general. I live in Florida. We have a surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Latipo. And he came in during COVID and he really straightened out a lot of different issues regarding parental rights. And we were happy to see that. And now on this issue of gender dysphoria, he has issued new treatment guidance to doctors across the state. And it's really important. You can go to the Florida Department of Health and take a look at it. They're going to have an important meeting on Friday where they're saying none of this gender transition, medical transition stuff should be happening. And so, it's really important to recognize that this is an issue with care providers. And we're looking at parents whose children are going through this or they're helping their children through it. People in the country need to understand doctors are telling parents that this is the thing to do. There are doctors that are telling parents that if they really love their child, that they'll put their child through gender transition. They're in fact sometimes being told, do you want a trans kid or a dead kid? Fearmongering that their child might commit suicide if a parent doesn't agree with the gender transition of the child. And so, we're just thankful to see doctors like Dr. Latipo and others that are standing up. And we need more of them. If you're a doctor and you're listening, we need you in this fight. Standing up and having the backs of parents who are saying, we need to wait and talk through this issue with our children. We need to recognize that there are comorbidities associated with gender dysphoria that need to be addressed. And we really need to help our kids make it through their childhood with their innocence intact, not being perverted by, as I said before, predators. Yeah, such an important dynamic. And so many people like yourself now that the mom's really censored when you just try to bring out facts. It's so frustrating because you end up fighting with one hand behind your back. But you keep winning. How do you plan? How does mom's really plan to deal with this Twitter suspension? Yeah, so you know, Twitter is the town square, whether you like it or not, right? And at mom's really really worked to embrace the best of social media. There are a lot of great things we've found comes from that town square. And so, you know, what I've asked Twitter was, please tell me how the tweet was hateful. They don't seem to have any answer for that. I think because there isn't one. And so, I'll probably go forward and delete the tweet and rephrase it in some way and see if I get slapped down again. It doesn't seem to be, you know, that there are any rules or norms that we can follow here. But, you know, we're, we just added two more states. We're in 40 states now. The chapter is growing like wildfire all over the country. So go to mom's, celebrity.org and join us, please, in this fight or help us. You can donate and help us and help us support chapters across the country. Yeah, it's really remarkable. Big fight you got going now with the California state legislation. How is that fight going? What is it, the chances of that passing? You know, I'm not exactly sure to be honest with you what the chances are of it passing right now. I think what California parents are excited about is that American parents are fighting with them. You know, if things are being allowed to happen in one state, American parents need to recognize it can be happening in your state, right? We recognize in Florida, we were 30,000 votes away from having a governor who would have walked us down harder than any state in this country. And so American parents are waking up and saying, okay, I don't need that to happen in my state to know that we need to create some safeguards to make sure it doesn't happen here and then to have the backs of California parents. And that's what American parents are doing right now. So we'll do everything we can to help to fight this legislation in California. I know that there were like 21 Democrats in 16 states across the country that said they wanted to do this in their state as well. And so, you know, American parents wake up, make sure that this isn't happening in your state. Yeah, it's important to check and to know and also just know what's going on in your school district because a lot of teachers, a lot of school administrators feel emboldened to step in and take the role of parents away from parents and talk to your child without your knowledge about these sort of issues. And so it's so important to keep on top of those things in your school district because it just takes one person to inject themselves in to create a process that could be really, really scary. Florida and California, when you look at the two, we end up, basically, they're really the emblems of the two different approaches to this. It seems like the Florida approach is winning. You look at the polling data, more people like what Florida is doing on schools, on the transgender issue, on critical race, Siri, quite frankly, on business climate. Do you think the Florida model becomes the contrast that everybody goes and says, I want that. I don't want any more of this craziness. Yeah, it's already happening. I mean, I talk to moms every day who say they wish Ron Defanser's was the governor. They can't wait to vote for him if he runs for president. We just had him at our national summit. We gave him something called the Liberty Court for fighting for freedom. We believe that Florida leads in a lot of different ways. And so I'm just blessed to be from Florida. Mom's for Liberty was started here. We had that spirit of Liberty here in Florida. And, you know, we're working to make sure that every parent in the country knows that this is what life should be like. This is what's possible. And you don't have to continue to put up with this woke ideology and nonsense tactics from politicians who don't represent you anymore. Yeah, pretty remarkable. The drag shows that seem to be expanding in these pride month celebrations in schools, they're getting all sorts of euphemisms. But from a parental perspective, they're very troubling, aren't they? They are very troubling. But just the deal. I mean, I'm a mom of four. I'm not approved. Right. I like to have fun and I'm an adult. I mean, there are some things that are for adults only. So I think the question, you know, parents are like, okay, wait a second. My kid doesn't need to be a part of every aspect of life that an adult is a part of. I saw a drag show that was just recently at the Grace School in Manhattan. It's a private school in a church, John, a drag queen walking down the aisles towards the altar in a church. So, you know, it's just gotten to a point of ridiculousness. I think, you know, the biggest issue with me, and we go back to this gender stuff, and women in general in America right now, there are proposed changes by the Biden administration, so Title IX regulations. Americans, you need to go and you need to look at that and submit comments right now. But when we look at the way that drag queens are presented, you know, someone asked for a definition on Twitter, and I saw someone say, it's a caricature of a prostitute. These are not women being represented. This is a caricature. And so, you know, we really need to respect women. We love women at Monstrilliberty. Obviously, we think moms are rock. And so the drag queen stuff, I think, is just the most, honestly, it's like everything just gets pushed to the most absurd point. And drag queens reading stories to children or dancing for them is the most absurd thing I've certainly heard in quite some time. Yeah, and these are young children. I can't process this yet. That's why parents need to be involved. And they're just trying to jump over the parent and indoctrinate these children. It's such a remarkable thing to watch over the next few weeks. What should we be watching for? We got new schools going to school, new school year starting, kids getting back to school. Florida seems like the teachers unions can't figure out the very clear laws that Florida's past. I'm sure they'll be made clear to them quickly. But what are the big issues you think parents should be looking for as they send their kids back to school? Yeah, so I'm going to give a couple different resources to parents. You need to be paying attention to what your kids are learning at school. You need to be talking to them about what they're learning. A couple resources for parents go to SLS Liberty, Southeastern Legal Foundation wrote a parent handbook for parental rights. You can download it from their website. Go there, check it out. Courage is a habit. It's another website that you can go check out. They have an opt out form for surveys. There's a lot of data mining going on in public schools. And then one of the best things you can do for your kids is opt them out of all surveys. So courage is a habit. You can follow them on Twitter, go to their website and download that opt out form. Super important. The last one is Alliance Defending Freedom has something called a promise to America's children. That's really important to go and take a look at. Bring it to your school district. Bring it to your superintendent and show them that and say, this is a promise that I'd like you to hold true for America's kids. So lots of different things happening. There is an abundance of resources on the internet. Go and look up parental rights. Go to Parental Rights Foundation. Check out where you are in your state and parental rights. You as the parent have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of your child and don't let anyone tell you anything else. Yeah, such an important thing. And such great toolkit. Southeast Legal Foundation does a lot of work with Justin News on our Freedom of Information Act Open Records. We have a lot of judgments to get information for the American public. An amazing resource. And you should go check out that guide we had Kimberly on just the other day. And she was talking about that guy. It's such an important one. Tiffany, great stuff for everyone who wants to stay in touch with you. All right. So we can't use the Twitter account for Mom's Camp Joyful Warriors. John had that. You are in the celebrating because you have a lot of success. I love the tagline that you guys have. The first time I heard it, I think I might have been able to see back last year. But parental rights do not stop at the classroom door is such an important concept. And that is why what you're doing is so important. You're educating parents that they actually have a say over what goes over in the classroom too. Such a great thing. Tiffany, thanks for joining us. We love having you on. And I know we're going to have to get you back on real soon. Awesome. Thanks, John. Have a great day. You as well. All right, folks. We're going to take a quick commercial break. When we come back, we'll wrap things up for the day. Folks, there's an organization that still backs Obamacare, gun control, and extreme transgender policies that endanger our kids. They claim to be bipartisan, but last year, 95% of their donations went to Democrats. Who are they? AARP. And you know what? AARP doesn't represent the values of a lot of American seniors. Fortunately, there's a conservative alternative. AMAC, the Association of Mature American Citizens, proudly champions Americans' rights to free speech, religious liberty, and the Second Amendment. AMAC defends parents' rights to protect their children and is fighting to restore America's election integrity, something we all can appreciate. With more than 2 million members nationwide, AMAC is pro-faith, pro-family, and pro-freedom. They're unabashed about it. I'm proud to be an AMAC member, and I encourage you to join today as well. Let's send AARP a strong message that they don't represent conservative seniors. Join AMAC today at amac.us. That's AMAC.us. Slash Just News. You're listening to me for free right now, and that's awesome because more and more things aren't free right now. I mean, think about all the things you're paying for daily, monthly, yearly. Well, here's something that won't add to that list, the free IHART radio app, podcasts, streaming music, digital radio, all free. It's the future of audio, and unlike almost everything else in your life right now, except maybe air, it doesn't cost a dollar. So take advantage of this. Listen to everything you love on the IHART radio app for free. IHART radio. IHART radio. All right, folks, that wraps up another edition of John Salomon reports. A big thank you to Tiffany for all the great updates she gave us. And by the way, she made some news on this show by saying she's going to delete or alter that tweet to try to get back on Twitter. We'll have that up in the story in a little bit. And we also have a big thank you to Ann Dorn for all she's shown, including just her courage and grace under fire. Losing your loved one, your husband of many, many years, a community hero, would cause a lot of us, maybe me, included to roll up into a little ball and withdraw. And just say, I've suffered too much. I can't do this. But that's not what Ann did. Ann has gone out and taken the death of her husband and turned it into more good. Just like David Dorn's career was for his community. Challenging the Black Lives Matter movement, challenging to funding police. Challenging world corporations not to support policies that put their communities and their customers at risk. Concerned communities for America, Mark Little and Ann Dorn, having a big impact in the boardroom, to the dinner table. Great folks. So grateful that they could join us today and give us an update on their great work, Tiffany. And big thanks to you today. We really enjoy all the work you're doing. All right, folks, before we go call it a day, at least for this podcast, a quick reminder that we have amazing partners, advertisers, sponsors that have products and services that can benefit you, whether you're a businessman or at home. And one of those is Bambi, B-A-M-B-E-E Bambi. I'm a small business owner. And the last thing I want to focus on is HR because I'm busy. I want to get news out. I want to get my TV show done.

John Solomon reports the podcast from Justin News. Hello, America. You know what? We're up against another government shutdown later this month. And our wise leaders deal with it. How they always do? More spending. While lawmakers are high-fiving, your savings account continues to lose value because more spending weakens the dollar.
