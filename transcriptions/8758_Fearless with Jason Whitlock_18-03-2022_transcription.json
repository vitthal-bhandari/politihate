    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock and you have tuned in to the perfect show for this Friday afternoon, Friday evening. The weekend is here and I'm going to get us rolling into the weekend with a fire so massive that I'm going to have to call in to fire and to help me fan these flames. Delano's choirs and Royce White will be here early in the show to talk about this fire I'm about to start and Steve Kim will be here on the second half of the show to talk some Devontae Adams and Aaron Rodgers and maybe we'll sneak in a little DeShawn Watson as well with Steve Kim, but we're going to start with a discussion about Lee Atomas that's so much bigger and broader than just Lee Atomas, the University of Pennsylvania swimmer. I buckle up, sit back, put your thinking caps on, expand your mind and as I try to connect the whole Lee Atomas thing to something much bigger going on all across America and really across the globe. All right, Lee Atomas, the male swimmer competing at the NCAA Women's National Championship is just another log on the fire of lies in golfing America. According to the headlines, Thomas made history Thursday night winning the 500 freestyle by nearly two seconds becoming the first transgender woman to win a Division I national title. Now, if you object to this obscenity corporate and social media argue that you do so out of fear of Thomas and other trans genders. Sally Jenkins of the Washington Post articulated the prevailing sentiment Thursday morning writing quote to exclude trans athletes from elite competition out of fear of our own constricting fears and uncertainty is wrong, harmfully so. I want to stop right there and read because I picked that quote, but I want to read you the very beginning of Sally Jenkins column in the Washington Post. Hate to tell you, but in a way everyone is trans. Everyone is trans according to the Washington Post and Sally Jenkins was one of the most decorated sports columnists in the history of America. I've never agreed with all those decorations. She's good, but she's not what they've hyped her into being, you know, part of his female sports writer and they figured out a way to celebrate her. But Sally Jenkins is a good column. She's written things that I really agree with. She's written things I disagree with and but have written them profoundly in a provocative way. She's talented. Her dad Dan Jenkins is one of the best sports writers in the history of America. She's nuts here though. Absolutely nuts. And this accusation that anybody who objects to this man competing against girls, you know, we're all transphobic. See, we all allegedly have an aversion or hostility to disdain for or fear of transgender people. I don't fear Leah Thomas. I have no aversion, hostility, or disdain for him. There are those of us who are lie phobic. We have an aversion, hostility, disdain, and fear of lies, particularly falsities codified into culture, rules, and law. We see an avalanche of lies transforming our once great nation into the United States of lies and chaos. We see the uprooting of truth and the empowerment of falsehoods as the climate change that will destroy the planet. Leah Thomas has no business swimming against women. He has a penis. He spent his first 20 years on this planet living and competing as a man. Despite two years of hormone treatment, he has the shoulders, size, and the build of a man. His reduced testosterone level doesn't qualify him for womanhood. God hands out those qualifications inside the womb. We recognize those credentials on a birth certificate. There are those of us who still believe man science does not trump God's truth. Let me repeat, I harbor no ill will toward Leah Thomas. He is a pawn being used in the devil's game of deception. My animus is saved for Satan's collaborators, the atheists, agnostics, and so called Christians who help build the inferno of lies Thomas just joined. America's coalition of liars touches every demographic, every faith, and every political faction. America can't reject the Leah Thomas lie because we've swallowed too many of the others. Let me write off a list of lies that we have swallowed. January 6 was an insurrection comparable to Pearl Harbor and 9-11. Oh, police are killing black men so randomly that black people should live in fear of routine traffic stops. America was founded in 1619 when it enslaved its first black person. Securing our southern border, it's racist. Oh, oh, the N word is a harmless term of endearment when used by black people. The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution are invalid and irredeemably racist because our founding fathers own slaves. George Floyd is a hero worthy of memorials and monuments. Marriage between a man and a woman is no different from marriage between two people of the same sex. Obese women and men. Oh, they're all perfectly healthy. Abortion is in murder or immoral. Its proof women are equal. Oh, mass stopped the spread of COVID. No, no, no, wait, wait. Experimental medical trials stop the spread of COVID. Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are bright public intellectuals sincerely challenging the establishment's racism. Oh, here's one. Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler. No, wait. Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler. Yet America is a smorgasbord of lies. White lies, black lies, brown lies, gender lies, political lies, racial lies. The lies make chaos and division inevitable. Our fear and reluctance to confront and combat these lies doom this nation. Leah Thomas isn't the problem. His gender dysphoria is not new. There have been men who felt like women since the beginning of time. The rest of us are the problem rather than treat Thomas's dysphoria. We have chosen to adopt it as our own, normalize it and build a war, a world, obedient to feelings over truth. A children's hospital in Portland has issued an instruction manual for young boys on how to tuck their penises. City Group, the banking conglomerate, announced it will pay the travel expenses for employees seeking out-of-state abortions. The United States of Lies supports and financing rewards immorality. People who object to and or warn that the tsunami of lies will be our undoing our demonized and punished. So most of us play along. We suffer in silence, hoping the insanity will reach a level of absurdity that erases the legitimacy of all of it. We underestimate the strength of the lies that bind America's coalition of liars. Lying to yourself is similar to pregnancy. You can't be a little bit deceitful. One lie leads to the acceptance of the next lie. Nicole Hannah Jones, the Arthur the New York Times 1619 project, she cannot speak against the Lee-At Thomas lie because she knows that that could make the LGBTQ plus crowd challenge Hannah Jones' 1619 lie. You follow? The liars have to stick together. A Black Lives Matter supporter can't publicly question the sanity of allowing illegal immigrants to flood our southern border because he or she fears scrutiny of the sanity of BLM. Reverend Al Sharpton can't criticize same-sex marriage. Race hustlers and sexuality hustlers formed an alliance 60 years ago. Sharpton must support the COVID and mass hysteria. His lies force him to embrace their lies. He joined NATO for liars. It's likely you did too. Thinking it would bring peace, you probably jumped on board with same-sex marriage or the myth that January 6 was a horrifying, deadly conflict between police and white supremacists. Or that George Floyd played no role in his own death. Or there's nothing wrong with Black people calling each other inward. Lies do not promote or deliver peace. They foment disorder. Lee-At Thomas is out of order because we've ingested a buffet of lies for far too long. That's the beginning of my fire. And I hope that you get the point. Early in the afternoon, I put out a column saying much of the same things, virtually all of the same things. And I'm not sure if people fully grasp it because everybody, where to go? Sticking truth. Lee-At Thomas, Lee-At Thomas, Lee-At Thomas. And this is a travesty. And we don't fully grasp or understand how we're all participating in this travesty. Virtually all of us. That laundry list of lies, and I could have gone on even further, but that laundry list of lies pretty much applies to virtually everybody to some degree. In order to go along to get along at work, over social media, people were sitting around pretending like, well, you know, January 6 wasn't an indirection, but, oh my God, it was just a travesty. It was just, it was horrible. And it's one of the worst things that's ever happened in America. You know, maybe indirection's a little exaggerated, but, but, oh, it was just horrible. I'm sorry. In comparison to what we saw during the summer of George Floyd, the truth is January 6 was nothing. And it would have really been nothing without the assistance of the FBI and all the other government plants that for a minute and, and inspired January the 6. A group of idiots went into the Capitol at the behest of some government agents. They didn't go there with zip ties to kidnap people or stop the election process of Joe Biden being announced or ratified as president. Idiots went in there at the behest of other idiots or conspirators. And they just wanted to show up and tell the politicians, you're out of order, you're out of line. These people should not be writing in jail cells and people that don't have the balls to say that they're liars, liars who are contributing to the lie of Leah Thomas. It all, again, once you start accepting one lie, there's all these other lies that come along with it. When you build a culture in a society that ignores truth is hostile to truth, really hostile to uncomfortable truths. You're just legalizing all the other lies. And so now we got a six foot three, six foot four man swimming against women. And this won't be the end of it. There will be men playing basketball against women in NCAA college basketball rather soon. Might be next year. It'll certainly be in the next four or five years. Because we have again, you embrace all these other little lies. You got to embrace them all. And you're, just, oh, well, that's my little pet lie that I go along with, but I'm not down with all these other ones. You can't be down with one and not supporting the others. Because when you support one, it makes you have to silence yourself about the others. And so if you think, and I know Reverend Al Sharpton don't really care about God, I get it. But he's not retop- he knows what's going on with Leah Thomas and men competing against women in these sports. He knows is wrong. He knows it violates every biblical tenant he ever once knew and forgot. But he can't say anything because his platform is based on a lie. When your platform is based on a lie, you can't call out other lies. You have to form an alliance with all the other liars. And you have to either shut your mouth or join in on their lives. And that's why so many alleged Christians have gone, well, abortion, that's complicated. I'm just going to look the other way. I got no opinion. My political leanings tell me I've got to support it or whatever. So I'm going to, it's part of the Barack Obama package. The Barack Obama package, you know, it's like a cable bundle. If I buy the entire bundle, I get it at a discounted price and I just got to ignore the channels I don't like. Now you've bought the entire bundle and you're co-siding for everything in that cable package, including abortion. And that's, I'm telling many of you that are sitting there repulsed by Leah Thomas, you've bought part of this cable bundle. This channels a part of this cable bundle of lies that you actually support and therefore, when these type travesties happen, you can't in a full-throated, authentic way speak against it. Because you're afraid your lies may get called out. Maybe you've been running around pretending George Floyd is the greatest victim in the history of America and this generation's Martin Luther King or hell even Jesus Christ. And you've been using George Floyd to promote yourself at work. Oh, I better get that promotion or your racist just like Derek Chauvin and all the other cops that kill black people. How many black people who call themselves Christian have stood on the neck and back of George Floyd and blackmailed their bosses? You're a liar. You're in support of Leah Thomas and all this other chaos and abominations against God and every rule, every thought, every biblical principle that's ever been taught to you, you're in objection to it. Oh, Donald Trump, he's a dictator. Now because someone on CNN or MSNBC told you Vladimir Putin, he's a half-hiller. You believe that now too. And trust me on this, I don't know what Vladimir Putin is. I'm no expert on Russia. But I'm not going along. The same people that lie to me every single day, oh, this time they're telling the truth and because they're all Republican and Democrats and all the TV networks, they're all saying Vladimir Putin is right off of Hitler. These are the same people that have been lined up the entire time. I'm not buying that garbage. They don't have to bring me more than their word to get me to buy into that. The same people, oh, put a mask on and COVID will stop. Two weeks will break the curve. Take this shot in the ass or in the arm. It'll stop COVID. But now I'm sorry, Putin, he's Adolf Hitler. The last week we were telling you it was Donald Trump. This week is Putin. Who's going to be next week? Jason Whitlock, he's Adolf Hitler. He's a Hitler supporter. He's a Russian propaganda. Russia's supporting me. You don't believe anything. I'm not, I'm just sorry. Either you're going to stand on truth and save this country and man up, woman up and stand on truth, or you're no different than the rest of them. You just have your little pet lies and oh my god America's systemically racist. And the black man, we ain't got no chance because white people done gathered up and it made all the rules so we can't make it. Yeah, Barack Obama was in aberration. Mike Wilbob was in aberration. Jason Whitlock, I have a receive it ain't submit. The whole everybody that made it black, it was in aberration, it was luck. I can't do it. The whole world is against me. Yeah, I know I say I'm a Christian and if God is on my side, who can be against me? How can I fail? But really I'm not a Christian. The white man is my God. And if he doesn't like me, I'm nothing. That's what you really believe. Man up and say it. You've bought the lie. I'm and so I hope no one hears this as I feel sorry. I do have compassion for Leah Thomas. This man has some serious mental issues. To have the audacity to stand on that podium and celebrate and talk about this stuff he accomplished like he did something. This man has some serious issues. His parents need to be investigated. His neighborhood he grew up in needs to be investigated to have the and it's not about him feeling like a woman. It's about having the audacity to take his six foot three, six foot four ass and go compete against a bunch of women and take pride in it. Play play his little post match post swim interview that he did with ESPN. Leah, how did that performance measure up to your expectations coming into this meet tonight? I didn't have a whole lot of expectations for this meme. I was just happy to be here trying to raise some computer as best as I could. You've undoubtedly been under the spotlight over the past few months. How have you been dealing with that and reasoning with everything? I try to ignore it as much as I can. I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races and just try to block out everything else. What did that race mean to you? It means the world to be here, be with two of my best friends and teammates and be able to compete. Thank you for stopping by. Thank you so much. Coward. I'm not even talking about him. That and I don't want to call this woman a coward that did the interview, but it was a cowardly interview. She should have asked him, you got a penis between your legs. Everybody else in the pool had a vagina. Do you think that's fair? Are you sure with what's swinging between your legs, you need to be out there swimming against women? That would have been a bold interview. Put Leah Thomas on the spot, making man up and answer a real question. Don't go off into his la-la world that he somehow has accomplished something worthy of celebration and admiration. There was a woman outside the swim meet. I think she swims for Virginia Tech. She actually womaned up. There should have been thousands of people. Everybody in the damn swim meet should have been out there with this Virginia Tech woman who went on camera and complained about this travesty and obscenity that we're sanctioning and codified into this society. Play the clip of the Vitex swimmer keeping it 100. They were Virginia Tech swimmer. What did you think about Leah Thomas competing today as a swimmer in this competition? What are you feeling? What are other athletes feeling? It's a common conception that we are all very disappointed and frustrated with someone who is has capabilities more than us women have to be able to compete at this level and take opportunities away from other women. Like I have a teammate who did not make finals today because she was just bumped out of finals and it's heartbreaking to see someone who went through puberty as a male and has the body of a male be able to absolutely blow away the competition and you go into with a mindset that you are you don't have a chance if that makes sense like it's hard to compete against someone with the aerobic capacity the muscle development the body of a man it's hard it's hard to think about it like that and staying positive I bet for other swimmers who are in that he is probably overwhelming I'm not sure I can't speak for them but it's disappointing to see in frustrating definitely. And you said that one of your teammates was crying today because she didn't make the finals you said that she was 17th and there were 16 spots so Leah Thomas took one of those spots talk to us about what your teammate was going through and that experience. She was very emotional and it's hard to see because it's her last NCAA's and she really loves that race and it was just heartbreaking to see that she put all her effort into it today and went to best time that she's went in the morning session before and still not make it back. It's hard to see someone who works every day every night still not be able to compete against someone like that. So that woman was crying done put 16 17 18 19 20 years in to her swim career to get to that moment and then she's denied by a man with some dysphoria issues that I'm sympathetic towards but again it's just no look Caitlyn Jenner the former Bruce Jenner he gets it he's on record like she shouldn't be swimming against these women so you can have gender dysphoria and still have common sense and still have some integrity about yourself. Leah Thomas has none but neither do all the parents who are sitting by quietly as their daughters get treated unfairly. Why is this little woman from Virginia Tech this college student is child? Why isn't she surrounded by parents? Saying this is not fair for my daughter and daughters and all the silly ones that are running around cosigning for this these nut jobs acting like this is okay because they want to be on the right side of history they want to make sure they don't get canceled and no one sends them a mean tweet and everything's okay on their job because if I stand up and tell the truth and stand on any that whole laundry list of lies that I keep saying get promoted if you say any of them at work oh my god I'll lose my job or someone may go to HR and complain about me or I may not get promoted. We're building a society that is nuts and incapable of staying together this is just the beginning we're nowhere near the end of this gender insanity. I'm sorry I went that long I'm mostly apologize to Delano we're gonna bring the smartest man on the show into this conversation he wrote a column today that has some synergy with what I wrote and what I were just talking about here my monologue Delano will start with your reaction to Leah Thomas winning a NCAA division one title and my contention that the reason why this is being allowed and why the whole country hasn't risen up is because there are so many other lies that we have told ourselves and are telling the public that we've handcuffed ourselves to lies and so we can't speak up against lies that are in our you know that we disagree with and so we just have to embrace all the lies. Jason I was listening to your monologue listen to your fire starter I'm hoping you gave me something for me to burn down but I mean I'm I'm with you 100% I think there's a couple things going on right I'm gonna address the Leah Thomas situation first I see so many people including Sally Jenkins who's calling my red who keeps starting this conversation in the wrong place they keep saying well Leah Thomas doesn't have an advantage over some of the the girls or the women he's competing against we have to look at testosterone levels and there's new data and science Jason my my oldest child is six I'm I'm at the point I were I'm teaching her you know logic and deductive reasoning this is a category error the word woman has a definition I wish people like Sally Jenkins and Mina Kimes and Jamel Hill and people who fought for women their entire career particularly as it relates to sports would just simply say this is what a woman is a woman is an adult female human so anyone who is not an adult female human should not be in women's sports it doesn't matter how Leah Thomas could be five six and 150 pounds he doesn't belong there because he's not a woman just like if I show up to the tour de France with a moped or motorcycle and I said well but they both have two wheels why you guys discriminate against me they'll say because this race is for a certain type of bicycle a motorcycle is not a bicycle it's a different category they may look the same you may you may feel the same when you ride them but they're not the same and that's why these people they they get into well this person feels this particular way right or they don't really have this type of advantage or the science is changing we're not really sure and you're right it's lies it's all lies let me not cause it's it's all lies and and the people who are doing it are either too dumb or too cowardly to say that it's lies and and I really fear what this is doing to young women and girls because you saw even the interviews that you played you could hear the girls biting their tongues right they don't want to use the wrong pronoun they don't want to say the wrong thing because because they're on camera right they're on record they don't want to get canceled they don't want to get socially censured they don't want to be penalized they don't want to lose out on endorsement money and it's the same thing that the Sally Jenkins is the world of doing they don't they don't want to get called a bigot they don't want to get the jk ryling treatment where you are separated from the content that you create right so the thing is Jason we still have a closet it's just that the 99.9 percent of the people who understand that that men and women are different have been forced into it and the small number of people who actually have gender dysphoria and the large number of their activists and ideological supporters are the only ones who can live out loud and proud and and that's my problem with it because we to your point we we are conditioning ourselves to be liars and that's why as a matter of practice I don't do the whole pronoun game pronouns should be learned as a matter of grammar not as a matter of sociology I don't see one inch of territory to any of these people because I don't want to have to go home and look in the mirror and realize that somebody made me into a liar because then how am I going to tell my kids to be bold and courageous when I can't even acknowledge the most sort of fundamental truth of human civilization. You said a mouthful and and one of the things I really love and I want to hammer the point is because it's not just on this gender issue that people are being forced into the closet it's across the board as Christians people are Christians are being forced into closet don't talk about your faith publicly don't use the word Jesus publicly keep that in the closet conceal that we only want to talk about your secular values or secular beliefs then and look how that plays out in real life because again when you understand that Jesus Christianity and the truth walk hand in hand together Christianity Jesus it's about truth and the truth setting you free and so people like me who literally spent time in the inner city fathers bar my favorite place on earth the mass peace lounge in the inner city me and my father one bedroom apartment 400 square feet 1984 in the inner city I'm sitting there like hey man this whole little notion that people in the inner city black people in inner city are running around scared of the police right more so than they are the gangster disciples in the blood we can't say that because we got to stay in the closet and let the half-rican-americans and the other elites that they put on tv they get to loudly shout oh the police they're killing us and the baba and LeBron James gets to loudly shout to his 40 million twitter followers we can't even go outside baba and so it's like the lie can be shouted the loudest and the truth has to be whispered in private in a closet with other people who are afraid to stand on truth and so this assault on the truth is an assault on god in the story and that's why I wrote my piece right and then I talked about Christians have and particularly Christian conservatives have a choice it's either christ or chaos and and I use a number of different examples including you know sort of the the minor dust up or controversy with with Dave Rubin when you know he and his spouse announced that they are expecting you know two babies one in August one in October and and for a lot of you know folks that I follow with Christians it's like okay we understand that that Dave is gay and he once was atheist he said he grew up as a secular Jew we don't expect him to hold to biblical sexual ethics but when we see self-profess conservatives and certainly conservative Christians celebrating that which god would would condemn then we saw asking ourselves what's really going on here what would the conservatives mean when they say they want to conserve things what exactly do they want to conserve and if and if a lot of us if it's if all you want to conserve is low tax rates I'm not interested not interested because when Jason when I sit on here and I have at the left and I hammer the left and the feminists and the male allies and and everybody else over there who subverts the natural order of god's design for family as it relates to husband wife and and their children and conservatives cheer and say yes that's what we need in America in the black community more intact families if conservatives are saying look what whatever people on our side want to do right we're we're libertarians as it relates to sexual sexuality then a lot of people like me are gonna say you know what we may vote for republican candidates but to the extent that you know you think we're we support that we're going to cheer loudly no not interested and I think Christians need periodically reminders that Christianity is what I call a whole bird faith neither left wing nor right wing right so so when we want to divvy it up we got to cut that thing right down the middle and if either party and clearly the democrats they're far gone people like Joe Biden Raphael Warnock William Barber Al Sharpton they're on all they endorse all of the lies that we're talking about so I'm not even considering them but part of what what you know Christian conservatives have to do is ask ourselves okay if the republican party becomes the party of drag queen story hour um and and you know rental wombs artificial wombs and artificial sperm and eggs and we say you know it'll help people who who who can't reproduce have their own babies is that a party that or move we want to associate ourselves with and that's one of the questions we're gonna have have to ask ourselves because as you said everybody is lying and one of the things I put in in in in in my column which is a bit of truth is is it's a sort of a simple fault experiment if you put a hundred men of peak physical condition on an on a deserted island with a hundred trans women and you know the left loves to say trans women are women okay let's put it to the test and you wait a hundred years when you come back nobody would be alive not a single baby would be born and no new generations would have been created that's that's not an attack that's a fact and the question is do do do we as a society and culture want to ingrain that type of ideology into our cultural norms and legitimize it through our public policy and to me Christians are in the best position to answer that question but the problem is that this entire conversation has been co-opted as is often the case with things in our country by the issue of race right and I started my column by by citing Dr. King in the civil rights movement and how they use the the truth of the scriptures as sort of their their moral calling card to turn America away from spiritual wickedness as related to you know racism and and violence against black folk and turn us particularly in that in that sort of uh lane turn us towards the truth of God's word that all of us have created an image of God Christians conservative Christians have an opportunity to do the same as relates to sex, sexuality, marriage and family but many of us in sort of the Christian evangelical camp have been compromised because there are Christians and I can name a few the white ones practice ethnic paternalism they think that they can solve all the problems of black folk they're the ones who like to tell their friends oh systemic racism is why black people have all these problems and we need to do more we need to we need to give more we it's our responsibility to solve their problems and then you have the black ones who practice ethnic extortion right who say give us give us money give us money for our organizations give us reparations and in that way you will pay indulgences to wipe away the sins of your forefathers and everything can be made right the problem is that's not going to happen that's not the way the world works and any any Christian that thinks any black Christian that thinks it's more important for a white believer to affirm their life and tell them that black lives matter than it is for a black man like me to care for protect and provide for my own family and my children has got this thing totally upside down but what the Christian right and the secular left are doing is this they're running the play from the same playbook they saw that at one point whiteness and white supremacy was the norm white domination was the norm and black people had to suffer oppression under that once that was removed through law and policy and social custom over the course of decades they start other groups started to say oh we could run the same play paint ourselves as oppressed paint whoever's above us as a pressor and use the the the pain of black suffering and the strategy of the black civil rights movement to pull down that oppression so here come the women with feminism to fight sexism and then after that it's the LGBT crowd to fight heterosexuality and after that it's the transgender crowd to fight cisgender privilege and so on and so on and so forth next we'll become minor attracted people then you're gonna have to transhumanist who say I'm neither I'm not human I don't abide by time time is a social construct and to the extent that I I'm not human but I want a family so we need to create artificial wombs artificial sperm artificial eggs and so on and so on and so it'll go until we hit a stopping point and Jason what I'm doing and I think what we're doing is trying to call out to America and said it is time to repent to turn from your wicked ways and go back to the god of this creation he made us he understands clearly we can't hold it together we can't even hold together our views on male and female for more than two election cycles the Caitlin Jenner thing where ESPN was in 2015 we're not 2022 it's not even 10 years and now people act as if male and female are just arbitrary categories so yes what Leah Thomas is doing is is an abomination right we shouldn't feel we shouldn't feel like we have to be forced into the closet we should speak our truth I'm gonna live my truth Jason the problem is and the question is are there enough courageous people and particularly men who are willing to do the same I wish that young lady was standing there doing our interview with her father having her back that's what I wish more men need to walk around with you know fake bottles of kerosene and a lighter and say look if y'all don't let up off my daughter and let this pressure up off of our kids something is going to get burned down in here metaphorically of course so I think that's what it may have to be for real we may have to do it for real and just what was it just a year or two ago everybody was running around talking about they had a girl dad and Colby Bryant his daughter was the greatest thing in the world and now where the girl dad's at silent slap them avatars on and and and one thing I do want to say just before I let you go because I got to get to Royce why we got to keep it moving but one thing I want to say I just want to address here because I'm right there with you in terms of like and I've been maybe even more so like all these politicians Republican Democrat they they they're all liars they all change with the win here's what I'll say about not Republicans or Democrats but about conservatives and this while give us credit here at the blaze the conversation we just had the column you just wrote where you addressed head on Dave Rubin what's going on with he and his spouse and and the kid and I know Dave I consider Dave a friend the one thing I'll give conservatives an opportunity uh credit for is like we can have a conversation of disagreement with her out demonizing each other running around scared or you know talking behind each other's back I hope Dave I think is gonna come on the show in a couple two or three weeks weeks he's got a book coming out I think there's other people at the blaze that agree with you and me as it relates to what you wrote about Dave and his situation and how we feel about marriage I've had the conversation with Dave we're still friends I'm sure he doesn't I'm sure I hope he doesn't co-sign for my gluttony and still respects me even though I'm I'm gluttonous and and and I know that people get a smile on their face but but gluttony it's a death culture I mean it will kill you and it does not enhance your life and so that's no different than how I feel about sex outside of marriage gay sex same as gluttony or whatever and so I'm willing to and get people they want to call me gluttonous call me fat whatever I don't have a problem with them I don't have a problem with them so they'll say I'm like that's wrong I can still respect them hell I even love them for telling me the truth to be quite honest but I'm just glad that we exist in an environment on this side of the conversation where you can have these conversations and still find common ground and respect for each other I just wanted to represent before I let you go but Delano great job as always thank you Jason uh we'll

surprises here he's the smartest man on the show and i like the calling the voice of reason okay and also let's keep in mind the guy still has a hairline all right and of course i'm talking about none other than tafaceti the lano squires check it out cuts off his private parts and uses skin from all over his body to create a fake vagina none of that stuff is loving none of that stuff is kind but we

forward you know we went 10 years into John Gruden's emails and we found racism in those emails from John Gruden back we're not looking forward we're not moving forward being a fail this hurts this hurts those emails hurt me i think Whitlock is tired of all of his talk about the lano being the smartest man on the show okay Jason is about to take this little kid to the wood shack he's about to put the hands on him i believe Jason Whitlock is going to take the lano squires out back and feeding wood and water you know he's going to put wood on his ass and have water coming out of his eye

unpleasant seven-seat the show me broke and of course i'm talking about tj moon the seven-seat listen this man is has such a Tom Brady fetish that i do believe that he's starting to look like him okay he's a resident statistician and he's the master of suburban number conscious okay and he's also a master of biblical sexual provocatevities because a womb is substantially more valuable than sperm right one guy left from battle can go knock up 20 women and you can then pro procreate and you're tried as saved whereas if you send all the women to battle and you've got a bunch of men back home and

respond to twitter how do you think it's going to go all right welcome back uh you know what i don't know what to call this guy uh i called delano the smartest person on the show i may just start calling royce the smartest person i know maybe maybe that's the way i can get around uh this uh but to uh follow delano up with royce white is uh quite an honor and a treat i'm looking forward uh i felt like royce was the one guy i could do a mono fire starter delano could unload and and take the conversation to a higher level when i was sitting there well who could bring something else unique to this conversation i thought of royce white and i have no idea what his take is on any of this stuff we've been talking about but i know i can't wait to hear it so royce white welcome back to the show um i have argued today that uh all these lies are connected so there's the lie that lea thomas is a woman and it's justifiable for him to be out there competing against women at the nc double a championships and swimming and and i i contend that the reason why there's not more uproar or why this hasn't been put to a stop is because there are so many other lies that we have uh swallowed amplified across america that we can't stand up to any lies because we've swallowed just way too many and have undermined our credibility in so many other places that it's very difficult for us to rally around and point out something as obviously wrong as what lea thomas is doing your reaction well i think the status quo of our society has become lies by and large i think we're living in times of of great deception and i would even say it's uh it's a culture uh in an era of the double cross and the triple cross and you know the reality of the situation as i see it and you know that i'm very very critical of the neoliberal lgbtq intersectionality movement but if i take a step back from my position politically and assess the reality person by person individually i'd actually say that a large portion of the lgbtq pro women's rights and pro black movement are being manipulated i just i just think they're being manipulated you know to be honest i think that this entire beta male marxis revolution is intended to do very strategic things at bottom cause confusion attack people or or take people's a sense of humanity away and and destroy their faith in god and if you if you can take somebody's sense of humanity away it makes it very difficult for them to defend their rights their constitutional rights and their inalienable rights that are god giving um and and that's what we've seen uh start to happen as these neoliberal you know marxis movements have have risen to the surface here in this country and in the west you know uh lea tom is for example a man a man with the penis can swim with women and we see that as a social revolution uh that's noteworthy and and considered an achievement meanwhile the nsa and the cia and and uh many other intelligence organizations uh conspire with big big tech to take our data to sell our data to use our data to undermine our security our privacy uh in this hyper surveillance state and nobody even has anything to say about it or people do but it but it's said in the background it's said in hutch tones and it certainly isn't seen as anything noteworthy like lea tom is having the right to swim in the pool with a bunch of other vaginas uh and and be swinging a penis in the water voice one of the things that disturbs and or baffles me is there are so many people who swear by science trust the science the science and so there's and so humanity has been reduced to whatever numbers or whatever chromosomes they come up with and a dna or if we can bring your testosterone level down to this that makes you a woman and and it's like this whole belief that science trumps god goes directly to your point of their dislodging us from many faith-based views to install man and the government as the ultimate authority and and i just can't believe people are so naive that they actually want to trust man to be the ultimate authority the history of man is wicked well well let me let me take it a step further this is what i mean by the double cross and the triple cross because we know you and i as black men that our skin color has been used as the the lynch pin of this entire identity politics revolution but here's the kicker all of this is just eugenics and Nazism rebranded and repurposed and they've swapped out the racism for elitism that's all that's happened here and when you go back and you look at eugenics and and what the the founding ideas were it runs very congruent to the fourth industrial revolution which is based on automation artificial intelligence robotics gene therapy right these are all code words to use science as a justification for eugenics and Nazism that's spawned from Darwinism and we all know that the Darwin evolution theory was intended to to you know destabilize belief in god and belief in the bible and belief in judo christian west that was the that was the purpose of Darwin and there are many people who are even in disagreement with this sort of marx's revolution that still subscribed to Darwin so you know this is the double cross and the triple cross this is why it's very difficult to to stress to people how much of an injustice our education and our our acquisition of knowledge truly is on the everyday person these are info wars these are informational wars and culture wars that have been played out over many generations and and to say they trust the science that that's not you know that's not an affirmation of of goodness in any way eugenics was science and and they had very very real ideas about which of us human beings were worthy of of of being pro of pro-creating in which ones were which ones were the the bad stock and many of these people who pushed these ideas when you really get down to the basis of it that they wouldn't meet the criteria of the good stock to be quite honest and so again what the globalists have done they've repurposed rebranded Nazism and eugenics to say hey we'll do away with the race part we're all mixed up anyway now let's not get caught up in that we'll hold our race purity in the inner circle and what we've now gone to as an elitist uh criteria where we want to now push ourselves to a transhuman future and and we'll do away with the whole race piece because we're better off getting more people roped in to the movement if we blow out the the windows and the in the walls of race. I just happen to believe that at some point right now in the recruiting stage of what you're talking about I think they deemphasized race. Yeah. Once the recruitment process is over and it comes to implementation race is going to come right back into the formula and uh LeBron James and his heirs may survive but the average black person is going to catch major major hell am I wrong for thinking that? Well they already have and again you know the LeBron James and those types of people will be tokens of uh they'll be a relic of a society uh to remember you know they'll be paintings they'll be much of what they are already in the pro sports world is is an art right there a piece of art to appreciate over time and be sold as an asset with the rest of the estate when the owner gets ready to to move on from that pursuit uh and it won't change in the future when we go to a globalist agenda and you know everyday common black people are already catching hell from this because 30 million black babies which is also a product of a of a eugenics Nazi based genocide is one of the biggest political and social injustices done on on the the demographic of everyday working class blacks in this country and again on the in the spiritual they want to destroy the faith in god in the political they want to go after your citizenship and devalue it and and you know the race piece i think black people brown people minorities are a byproduct that they're a bonus collateral damage but really they just want to go after the working class they've traded in race all together they want to go to a social class system where the elites win and the working class are either serfs and in the future you know that will be a stopgap for them being you know phased out by robotics and artificial intelligence i'm going to ask you a question that i have i probably shouldn't ask because i don't know where it's going to go and i'm not an expert on this so i'm really uh asking for your insight because i haven't decided what i think but i made mention to it in passing in my mono and in the column i wrote today and i just assume you have a thought on it but i've watched the world go from Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler to now Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler and i don't know who's going to be Adolf Hitler next but i i don't know what to think of the Ukraine Russian conflict i'm leery of buying this narrative that Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler and the worst thing on the planet and so i'm sincerely asking because i know you run in circles where these conversations are going on all the time what do you think of Vladimir Putin and what's going on in the Ukraine well first i'd say i think wars and our time and and for many generations have been between elites and kings and not common people so i think when people decide to go to war or use military you know military action it's usually the common people that suffer whether that be economically physically etc but i think right now geopolitically we have a four player jon ball and and your god glen beck laid this out as well i shot you that text message one day and said how beck laid this out on his show about a week after i had written it in my sub-stack right and and i see it the same way that he does you got the free people right you got people the people all across the world you have globalist which is really the anglosphere right the west who are again this this repurposing and rebranding of of eugenics for a world government agenda and then you got the chinese and the russians and the distinct difference between them is the china and russia want a nationalist dictatorship and the globalist just want an international dictatorship so you're seeing a fight right now in the ukraine between national dictatorship and international dictatorship and and you know i'm not one to say what is the greater of the two evils i will say that they're that that us as citizens watching from a third party view uninformed and uninitiated and the eso teric jargon for these geopolitical conflicts in the history many people i've forgotten about the big pigs or the the cuban missile crisis or the the pretense or the the premise of the cold war right so i think a lot of people are tuning in now and see what's being shown to them in terms of russia invading ukraine and have a very a poor understanding of the history i think pouton is our enemy and in in the general sense and i would say that because for for one very distinct reason he believes in state censorship and that's unamerican he doesn't believe in the freedom of speech as a fundamental constitutional inalienable right of his citizens and we do but the catch is we say we do but in actuality the technocracy has conspired with the government in the west to to silence and censor the speech of dissidents as well so who are we to call you know who are we to call the kettle black in that in that instance or in that consideration but i would say if i was in charge pouton would be our enemy because he doesn't believe in free speech and that's a fundamental cornerstone of american constitutional values so i feel for the people there in the ukraine and then the russian citizens and everybody who's affected by this conflict it'll be interesting to see what happens here over the next few months and so you touched on many of the things that my instincts were telling me as i've been watching this play out over the last two weeks and and so a lot of the description i hear of pouton and the tactics well i go well that sounds like us that that sounds like joe biden and that that sounds like just what you said our tech companies are are silencing people at the behest of the government at the behest of the democratic party and their leaders oh you can't let people question covid oh oh my god someone like there Donald trump is an existential threat he must be silenced across all platforms uh again that that's the democratic party silencing their opposition that's the same type of thing we accuse pouton of doing and so i'm like you i see pouton as a bad player a bad actor uh and someone we should be against but i also i don't want to apply that standard to pouton if i'm not willing to apply that same standard right here at home to the people who are operating just like pouton well here's the three card monty with it pouton and believes in a nationalistic dictatorship like i said so his concept is that corporation and the state should be merged at the at the level of the nation state the globalists believe that the corporation and government should be merged at the world in a you know at the worldwide level um so there's a distinct difference in how that plays out in a place like america where you have two political parties that sometimes pose as as opposition to one another in many respects um it's not really the democratic party that has used big tech to censor to censor its opponents big tech and the corporatocracy is integrated with the democratic party that the republicans sometimes are merged in with and and are in on it with um and and they have uh went out and tried to censor dissidents and and and fighters for freedom um so it's not really the democratic party the democratic party is actually the puppet in it uh the corporations the the corporatocracy the fed uh the central bank cartel the medical industrial complex the media industrial complex the military industrial complex big techs just uh uh a more recent player in it but they're actually running the democratic party and i think that's an important distinction to make and and and orient and oneself in looking at these things but i agree with you overall that yeah the democratic party in there and and their agenda has certainly done exactly what they accuse pouton of and all the while they're still very soft on china and and and what what china has done to the weegers in east turquestan is much more atrocious atrocious than what pouton has done in the ukraine already now there is an argument to be made that a very hard line to be drawn is for one nation state to transgress another nation state sovereign border and in that case you could argue that china has not done uh to the weegers what pouton has done to the ukrainians however um if you're if your baseline standard is the is the uh violation of basic human rights then china has done to the weegers a hundred times over what pouton has done to the ukraine and that's just a matter of fact and and oh by the way it just so happens that they also have implemented the the eugenics nazi based uh gene ethnic cleansing that came from and stem from the early eugenics movement in in the west and in europe so uh you see right there the ally ship between the globalists in china and i think china is just sitting back going let's see how this plays out between russia and the west and and will will pick our next move uh you know what that is advantageous for china because china's religion is china right they do have a religion is the chinese people they believe they have the mandate from heaven and that gives them authorization to be the center of the world and they plan to go back there and they're not shy about saying it um thank you royce good stuff as always gave me much to think about this weekend that's royce white the smartest

well he's peaches an herb now he's reunited and he feels so good and he got paid well for it it's interesting if the money was equal but he still said i want out of green bay that meant that maybe him in the pack or simply had irreconcilable differences because since last year you heard reports of that negotiation getting very contentious and look as a player you get one chance at this maybe two other contracts outside your rookie deal if you're any good national football league and he felt you know what i get to go back to the west coast i get my college quarterback and i get paid a boatload of money i think he was saying maybe i've gone as far as i could with green bay as it relates to the packers and erin rogers i found this very interesting now jason i'm fond of saying that statistics tell you not everything but something and if you look at devontae last year he missed one game yet he still had 1,553 yards receiving the next two guys uh val marquez val discanthling and alan lasard combined did not have a thousand so my question is this jason is a jordi knelson walking through that door and now they got some draft capital with this big deal and and it's shifting things around it's really frustrated a lot of packer fans throughout the country that the last five six years they never given erin rogers a bookend receiver in other words dordi knelson had a james jones he had a jennings now you got to basically start over from scratch and say okay who's your number one guy this is going to be interesting to see who has affected more in their performance is it going to be the wide receiver or the guy that got him the ball is it the chicken or the egg i'm i'm hoping that the green bay packers select warren central product uh perdue product david bell people have him slae he ran a four six at the combine so people have him slae it as a second round pick if he's there in the second round pick and they take a receiver in the first round i'm to they're going to be very happy david bell will be an impact rookie uh but that's just my bias he went to my high school it's one of the best kids i've ever met uh a gem i want to bring uncle jimmy into this conversation just because uh the los vegas raiders like everybody in the afc west make them major moves major moves uh bronco's got russell wilson what is she what do you know uh raiders just get uh divante adam's the charges get jc jackson and somebody else who am i forgetting i thought they will mack kaleel mac uh as a chief friend so you got your chief's gear on are you concerned um first of all it's they've pleasure to see you you're a movie buff i'm i'm gonna throw a couple of names out here and i want you to tell me the lines first i'm a quote Colin Kaepernick then i'm a quote omar little and then i'm a quote rick flare okay Colin Kaepernick said heavy is a the head that where's the throw i mean the crime that's the wire that's that's marlo in the wire okay and then you had omar that said if you shoot if you come for if you shoot for the king you bet not miss yes come for the king you bet not man and then you had rick flared it said in order to beat a man you got to beat the man whoa so man i'm telling you something man i'm a member of the can city she said we don't care you know in order to beat a man you got to beat us everybody is trying to come and duplicate us don't nobody care about divante adam nobody cares about and roger's ain't throwing to him so what difference do it man he got david car throwing to him dare car david darek or erin it don't matter he don't have erin roger's throwing to him i don't care to me divante adam's going to the raiders is like sammy wackens i mean you know to in canada sony we thought he sidelined sammy i mean what what do i care kyleal mac he was already with the raiders furthermore let me tell you this about the raiders oh the raiders got your boy what's his name the the defensive guy they just picked him up the raiders got uh that that was from the card notes or whatever chanler john chanler john do you know who they got rid of so as they signed chanler they got rid of them they got rid of car nation yeah now the question is who's he gonna sign with now rumor is i don't know if you've heard about this one for pen huh you don't swim for pen now rumor is he's gonna be uh he's talking about he's talking about being a running back for the wnfl a running back for the wnfl yeah we're not touching that i thought you said he was gonna go to the packers but uh stave i got another topic here for you uh jocina anderson formerly a vsp and i think now she's with cbs sports or that's where i see her uh she tweeted something about uh de chan watts and then i want both of y'all's takes on this i'm told the who's who of atlanta from members of the braves hawks music world including little baby and quavo have all reached quavo i'm sorry quavo quavo have all reached out to de chan wattson to let him know we want him home per source also told it's been down to two teams since yesterday world's just now finding so uh with little baby and and quavo is quavo quavo quavo uh with him with you know them joining in the recruitment of uh of de chan wattson i mean that that's pretty much got a seal the deal i think that everybody around the nfl we're just waiting for a little baby in quavo to weigh in on uh de chan wattson with that endorsement that's like male copper and tod mcche uh coming in on the sine watt it's got to be a done deal in it lana well look first of all i think it fits culturally though i remember during the early run of matt ryan and matt ryan had a great run as a falcons quarterback looks like it might be coming to an end i still remember seeing a story where there were more michael vik jerseys years after he left to become the don king of dog fighting then there were number 12 jerseys and they embraced michael vik even to this day i still believe that him and dion sanders are the two most popular players in that franchise history and it's obvious to me they feel like hey we want a black quarterback and we want one of the best ones possible but i also think in all seriousness for de chan watts and this works because he played at clampson from a regional standpoint it works i look for some reason he believes i got to be close to home i want to be as close to clamps and it's possible i don't think he wants to be in carolina the pieces seem to be fitting here but um yeah the fact that ti and that mayer kisha bottoms i don't know she was on that list or not i don't think that's exactly the recruitment that i would go by to prove my next franchise yeah do we know where killer mike is on this has he cosigned this as killer mike endorsed the sam what's big boy and uh andrae three thousand now marcellus give you that work don't talk about andra like well man anyway well yeah with mare andrew young involved get some old school people in that game jim uh little baby i don't know if you remember me telling you the story uh it's probably two or three years ago me and quavo uh we said quavo me and quavo shot dice uh together at the cosmopolitan uh and he had a backpack full of one hundred dollar bills and he would just reach into his backpack and throw him onto the table and they count off the money he was making a rain on you he's making a man on a dice table i mean literally he he had a backpack full of hundred dollar bills and he grabbed a handful throw him onto the dice table they count up the money and he he captured what very he lost he emptied that backpack and they left and went to another casino they went and grabbed another backpack and went to i think they said they were going to the wind or yeah place else the way quavo married to karate b no that's offset oh offset yeah i for offsets married to karate b k what quavo offset and tone it this is not that that's who it is definitely the meagos yes yeah all right Jason go ahead jimmy yeah uh i don't know if you saw this last night but i i this is what i do for fearless this is the type of soldier i am i get into the trenches i put myself through actually watching a college basketball game and i have a few random thoughts real quickly number one that ucla game with aprons one of the worst games i ever saw i i mean they threw up so many bricks my tv spoon has a crack in it i thought they're playing homage to Russell Westbrook but i have to tell you the tea the only thing worse than them was the tnt studio crew i felt bad for Seth Davis they had Chapman out there they didn't even just let him retweet other people the material that he's terrible on air Frank Martin has no more hair left and he's very gravelly and then they have a woman's basketball player Candace Parker she looked pretty nice it's literally the worst studio show i've ever seen it's an indictment that Charles Barkley who literally admits like me and you Jason we know no college players it was actually more interesting and insightful than anybody on that whole crew and the only thing worse than them this is a personal thing of mine and you talk about die di di e right the diversity inclusion that thing it's affected sonic commercials i've always thought those two original white guys were hilarious they're quirky they were funny they're like Abbot and Costello they had this great chemistry now they're trying to do every single group now grace creed color sexual they're terrible bring back the original sonic white guys that's what i got from watching tournament basketball on a Thursday night what i got from it i watched i watched some of that Thursday afternoon and this is not because he's a friend of mine but uh frank mart they've done frank martin no favors by putting him with that crew frank mart not found very credible as a college basketball coach talking about the game but you put him in that crew of that diversity inclusion and equity crew because rick's Chapman's there because he tweets far left wing stuff he knows nothing about or he can't articulate very well his thoughts on college basketball i mean it's amazing what you what benefits you get from joining that left wing mob rick's Chapman was convicted or accused of or charged with stealing a bunch of stuff to support his drug habit and boom he puts out a left wing twitter feed and next thing you know he's on you know TNT or whatever to somebody tbs somebody's college basketball broadcast pretty amazing uh you know the thing i like about steve kim or the thing i like answer kidney don't he's gonna get his talking points in whether i want him or not well that was it he's a Jason that was me going and how are you gonna talk college basketball yeah that's him calling out how you gonna talk college basketball and not mention kentucky getting beat by uh who they get beat by st pete'sburg yeah yeah look first of all he said he watched college basketball his dv got broke good that's what he get no better for yeah i mean i guess you must have had a bad game and by the way do we have time i have a lea thomas take if you don't mind do we have time go ahead stay on the right i mean sure what we're doing korean coz yeah you want to be going no wonder korean and blacks don't get along my god hey hey just leave and get out of here get your hands off that orange juice okay we're for past that though all right so the lea thomas situation reminds me of that 80s movie you guys have to both see it remember soul man was c thomas how he was that white lost dude who wanted to get into his favorite law school so he took a pill to become black and there's this famous scene where they're playing pickup basketball at this ivy school so he's a black guy at that point he was automatically the first pick and he's like no no no no and he ended up being the worst player it was kind of like me when people would choose me to be a math tutor i'm like not really i'm not really that kind of agent and so literally lea thomas is the opposite of that and it goes to show you that anytime a male transitions to being a lea and goes into women's sports they automatically become world class and so i think that's where the uncomfortable nature comes from people like sally jankas and mina kimes they've been championing how good women's sports has been for 20 years and one swimmer has debunked that narrative steep cam steep cam do you got anything else steve on the steep cam show i'm good i gotta get launched i'm hungry here you know yeah could you give me a pack of smokes and uh and some weave you can say i'm like hey could you get me a pack of coals wait you're out there cool you know what steep now that you're here no no no i'm not gonna let you go now i'm not gonna let you go now i'm gonna make you participate in the approval rating uh for erin rogers why not yeah why not i mean since he's his show it's his show uh delano's piss right now who are you think he is so i'm gonna make you participate in the approval rating uh job performance for erin rogers uh he's coming off an mvp season i keep him at the same scores but a 24 in job performance i'll put you in i give him a 25 remember back in the day they had to start the show tv show called the six million dollar man yeah well he can start in the show now called the hundred and fifty dollar man 150 that man signed a contract for 150 million dollars all right that's all doing your job big wit uh steep as an erin rogers homer this is gonna scare you and surprise i'm giving him a 20 he's not mr january uh you're great in the fall you got to be doing the playoffs and he keeps losing at home that to me docs them a few points all right i i got you written down as a 20 uh character i'm going up actually in character he got his money uh i'm i'm sort of a fan of erin rogers at this point i love his stance on covid and the vaccine uh so i'm giving a 22 in character uh i'm gonna give him a 25 again first of all the character i like the little rock and roll rock and roll grunge character that he plays on the state farm commercials yeah i do like that but the thing that i don't like about him is he gets sacked a lot and i don't know steve you're a fan i don't know if you notice this but it is matter of fact let's take a look at some of the people he been getting sacked by no i'm gonna tell you something fellas i could be wrong but that's an offensive line i could get behind it they got some sunshine coming from the behind or whatever i'm just saying i could get behind that offensive line that's all i'm saying all right i give him a 25 25 steep where are you having one character i want to give him a 24 i don't think i'm gonna dock him for that when once that thing came out about the immunization he should have said yeah i lied to you so what what are you gonna do about it i don't think you should have capitulated one minute about that thing authenticity is our next category you may maybe should have saved that comment i'm going to give him a 19 in authenticity authenticity down a point he's pretending like he's not or according to reports he's not bothered by the vontay adam's choosing their car over him i don't know how authentic that is so i gave him a 19 in authenticity because i gave him a 20 because first of all i i'm gonna be honest with you he's one of the few players in nfl that had the ca jones a a.k.a. kahunas to stand up to the nfl to to to dr. fauke and to just this whole political thing regarding no who's pronunciation is worse quavo or fauke well i'm always i'm always i'm always makes more sense than fauke i think bottom line is erin stood up to it erin stood up to all of the nonsense he's like and he never budged and i just give him respect because to me he's just an american we need more of that uh steve where do you got him out in authenticity i'll give him a 25 because he's not afraid to alienate teammates or family i love the consistency and then it factor i went up to a 23 he got a hundred fifty million dollar contract he is definitely it in green bay he's the only thing in green bay right now so i got him at a 23 and uh it factor uh i'll give him a 21 green bay better be careful because green bay i think erin rogers might do green bay just like kobe brian did los angeles in this last year of his contract hmm he'll build up his stats but they ain't gonna get no championships hmm uh that's a good analogy the second way to you a Lakers fan steve uh steve it factor where you got him i'm gonna get him at a 20 until he starts winning and getting to a super bowl i'm gonna keep him there you gotta wait he's got let me just take some if he only wins one lumbardi trophy that'll be a let down on his career no if and or buts about it gentlemen all right uh me and steve have him as a smoke show i've got him at 88 quarter my mass steve's got him at 89 uh jimmy's got him at laser hot 91 have you seen that office of line give credit what credit is due they make blue m&m's jim let me let me let me take them down let me take them down to your restaurant a couple time give me some of that truffle chicken yeah let me get some of steve kem agros no play room all right thank you Steve thank you for letting me be on the show man yeah i want to thank you as well we'll see you next week on"
