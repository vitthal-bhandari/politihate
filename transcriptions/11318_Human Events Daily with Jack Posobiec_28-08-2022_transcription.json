    "text": " Jack was over here for Sunday special human events. We're sitting down with Marjorie Taylor Greene. Now we had a pre-recorded interview from a couple of weeks ago, but we candid. We completely got rid of that interview. Why is that? Because something happened to Marjorie Taylor Greene this week, this Congresswoman. She was targeted not once but twice in the sanctity of her own home, swatted, and we're told reportedly that this was done by trans activists. They sent police to her home in the middle of the night, two nights in a row. They told the officers that there was an active shooter involved at inside her home. They wanted her killed. They wanted her dead. They wanted her taken out. Everyone knows who the Congresswoman is. I think she needs no further introduction. Here we go. What's going on there? Okay, so the caller stated that she reported that their boyfriend had come to the home and that they shot him five times and he's currently in the bath test. The caller received to provide names, but in system providing the address and hearing that responder had it correctly. Caller stated that they were going to load the gun and take their own life and then stop responding. The line is still open with our mental health responder. Okay, who's calling me? What company are you with again? The veterans and military crisis line. And you said some of these possibly shot some money? That's what Sir Chatter is telling me. I worked with Suicide Lifeline. She had these shot his family members and he's going to shoot herself as well. They may possibly be a plotter. We're not 100% sure. The family's family. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard to a very special edition of human events daily. We're excited to welcome back on the program. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Gray. Now I wish it was under better circumstances, but unfortunately the reason that we are interviewing her today and the reason that we kind of scrapped our normal agenda and said we need to focus on this specifically is that Congresswoman, you were just the victim of two swatting attempts that came a little bit dangerous and that had the opportunity, when a few of these instances, to become extremely kinetic and become very, very out of control. And so, Congresswoman, first of all, are you okay? Is everything all right? Yes, I'm okay. Thank you so much, Jack. And my family is okay. So that's the good. Everyone's okay. Yes, everybody's okay. But the reality is it was basically an attempted assassination by police in the form of swatting and on a member of Congress. Like we need to see. Well, these extremists were using the police as a murder weapon almost or attempted to use the police as a murder weapon. But before we get into that, let's go back and unpack. I know you've told the story and we chatted briefly earlier this week, but I really want to go into this. I want to hear your side of it. Your home, it's the middle of the night. You get a knock on the door. Tell me what happened. Well, as you can imagine or anyone listening or watching this can imagine, when you're sound asleep in the night, you're not and you're not expecting anyone at the door. If you hear a knock at the door or doorbell, it is very scary. It's startling. What I was woken up to after one o'clock in the morning was doorbells, knocking and seeing flashlights and hearing people outside my bedroom window. And that concerned me. So I got up, got dressed, was going to take my gun to the door, but I did not thank God. And I went to the front door to police outside my front door and outside my front yard, opened the door to a very serious situation. The police were responding. They informed me responding to a 911 call where someone had called in and said that a person had been shot. Five times in the chest were aligned in a bathtub. There were children in the home and there was a there was going to be potentially more murder or suicide happening. So when police get a call like that, as you know, Jack, they show up tactically prepared guns drawn ready for the circumstance of the situation they have to respond to. It is a high alert situation also very dangerous for our great police officers. So when I opened the door, that is what they were prepared for. And I was of course so confused, not knowing what was going on and not expecting anyone at my home and just ask them, you know, what's going on, what's happening, is everything okay. And then they informed me of the call and I said, no, I didn't make that call. And then that's when I got really scared because I thought is someone in my house. And I asked the police officers to come inside. I wanted them to check my home. And that's when both of us, you know, realized and the sergeant in charge, he goes, yeah, I think I think you've been swatted. And I think this is what's going on. So I shout out to our room police officers here. They were amazing. They were they were clear headed. They were in control. They were prepared to handle the worst situation, but they were also so quick to realize the real situation that we had going on. Now that was one night that happened. And that's night one. But then right. So this happens again. Yes. And then the person called back afterwards and confessed. The reason why they swatted me was because I am against transgender surgeries for children. I've taken a very strong stance against it. And they are angry at me for that. They wanted to have me murdered by police. They wanted to. We were trying to ban it. Yeah. Harm done to me or my family because I introduced a bill the week before protect Children's Innocence Act to make this a felony. For any child for anyone performing so-called gender affirming care on children under 18. Yeah. No double mastectomies. No hysterectomies. No castration. No puberty blockers. No hormone therapy for any child under the age of 18. You know, it's important legislation that should be illegal. And they're mad at me for that. They're so angry at me. They want they want to kill me for it. So that was just night one. And the next day, you know, same thing was looking forward to a good night's sleep because I didn't have one the night before. Went to bed, but I was awoken after just after 3 a.m. The very next night. Same scenario. Exact same scenario. Except the only difference is is our local police officers were totally pluted onto the situation. So when I opened the door, it was very different. They were saying me and mortise here because of the call following our protocols. We don't want to alarm you. We understand what's going on. We just want to check on you. Are you okay? Which I was so grateful for them, of course, and said yes. So that was two nights in a row. And now there's a very serious federal investigation going on in coordination with our local police. You mentioned the investigations going on. But first, I want to say I do agree with you that they know that, of course, that you're a supporter of the Second Amendment. They know that at what they were doing. They know that it was one in the morning and the second time three in the morning. I think personally that these folks hoped that you would answer the answer the door with a gun out with a gun in your hand. They were trying to provoke a type of situation like we've seen so many times. This is why personally that I've spoken out against red flag laws because they are trying to provoke one of those types of situations that leads to somebody getting shot and potentially yourself. Have you have you given any thought to that? The fact that this could have gone a very different way for you. Yeah, I'm glad you point that out, Jack, because that's exactly the way I thought about it. Normally in the middle of the night, and even in the daytime, if I'm not expecting someone to my home, I will carry my gun with me to the front door. I'm a member of Congress. I've had a lot of death threats. You know, there's people out there that wish me harm due to the horrible things the media has lied about me. Yeah, I'll go to the door most the time with a gun. The fact that I had that gut feeling, even though I was very disoriented, just being just woken up, that something told me, don't take the gun with me. Thank God. Thank God I didn't because that is how people get killed. Just as pointed out with red flags, that's how these awful things happen. The police do not want to do that. They don't want to make that mistake, but when tensions are high and no one knows the scenario, both parties are confused about what's happening. This is how people have been accidentally killed in a swatting incident. And so yeah, I think you're absolutely right to point that out. I think whoever this was doing this to me knew that very likely I would take a gun with me to the door and be so shocked with police coming to my house in this manner that yeah, I think their aim was to get me killed. That's just it's horrifying that our country has come to such a place like this where there's no room for conversation. There's no room for discussion. It's just tribalism and then hyper-tribalism, hyper-extremism to the level of oh, and by the way, of course, you know, there's been no outpouring of support for you. I know you're, you know, you're not going to say this, but I'll say it for you. There's been no outpouring of support. The media doesn't have your back. In many cases, the members of your own party don't even have your back on this. Just send a tweet out. Send a tweet out. I'm glad that my colleague is safe. I'm glad that she's okay. I'm so it's so terrible that we have to go through this harrowing experience or even if it's somebody on the other in the other party just to say this attack like this should never happen to a sitting member of Congress. But I mean, I'm sure you may have heard receive some personal messages, but in public, I got to tell you, I'm just not saying it. Wow. I did receive a lot of personal text messages, which I'm thankful for. And I've had such a busy couple of days that I haven't been able to like look at everyone's social media. And I'm shocked to learn that I you would think every Republican colleague and Democrat colleague of mine would speak out against this, but that is so shocking. I think what is is extremely concerning to me is the handling of it with the media either it's a complete blackout and they won't talk about it or like MSNBC putting in their headlines, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene targets trans kids, which is an absolute lie, complete and total lie. If anything, all I'm trying to do is say, look, leave kids alone, let them grow up before they make these permanent changes to their body on radical awful changes that they cannot undo before they're even old enough to really even think about is this what they really want. And yeah, it's I don't know how we got to a place in our country, Jack, where it's controversial to say protect kids. We have to protect them. We have to protect their identity. We just have to say this is not a time for children or any person to make such a radical decision for for my God. Surgeries that will will damage their body, genital mutilation surgeries that will last a lifetime for these children. And they're not even old enough, not even old enough to vote. And so I think that's I don't know how we got in a place where my stance is controversial, certainly not controversial with the American people, but the mainstream media and the, you know, basically the fools that live in Washington, D.C. think it's controversial. And so I think it just shows you we're in a true spiritual war in America and you can see the attacks on me or our proof of it. But it's not just me, Jack, it's any person that stands up and fights for what is right and what is good. And I think it's so important for everyone to realize this is this is the this is the world we live in today. And so we basically just need to understand how to get comfortable being uncomfortable because if you're in the fight, if you're trying to protect kids and you're trying to do what's right, if you're a Christian and you're you're trying to live out your Christian faith, you're going to be attacked for it. And you're going to have to be okay with it. That's exactly right. Now, are you able to tell us obviously as a member of Congress, the Capitol police, your security is there remit. FBI, though, I would hope is getting involved in this. Are you able to tell us anything about the entities that are that are working on this investigation? I can't give full details, but it's multiple federal law enforcement agencies, as well as our local police. So if you can read the lines, you can definitely figure it out. Absolutely. You know, of course. But when it comes down to it, there is a larger picture here that I wanted to get into because we're so we just in the midst of recording this, we've just received the affidavit from the Mar-a-Lago raid. We've seen not much there other than a records dispute, it seems like, or you know, some kind of argument over, you know, who's who put the files where. I don't see very much in terms of a crime because when you're talking about the president of the United States, he has unilateral authority to declassify anything that he wants. He is the security clearance. He doesn't need security clearance. He is it. But you see the FBI with this national daytime raid in terms of that, and you look at that versus your local police who came out knowing, by the way, when they came out, they were told there was an active shooter in that home in that they came out themselves. They came up putting themselves in harm's way in the middle of the night, two nights in a row, by the way, which they didn't know what was going on. That could have they didn't come out because you were a congresswoman. They came up because you were a member of the community to be able to go there and hopefully protect your life by putting their own lives on the line. And we asked this of police officers, local police officers, every single day, every single day we do this. And yet we demonize the same police officers that we asked to do this for us in the middle of the night. And I just wanted to ask you, where do you see this? Because obviously you're one of the more outspoken critics of the FBI in the entire US Congress right now. And yet you're also a huge supporter of law enforcement. So walk me through some of that. Well I see a night and day difference between our local law enforcement and the upper echelon and the FBI. And that's not something that I'm just saying. I think that's every single everyday American on the street. You can't tell people out here in Rem, Georgia, or basically in any rural town or just mainstream state of America, that Peter Strut and Lisa Page are exactly the same as the great men and women in law enforcement that are just trying to keep our town safe. They're night and day difference. Because you see the people like Peter Strut and Lisa Page and James Comey and Christopher Ray and Willie Van Gogh with Merritt Garland and the Department of Justice. These are political operatives that abuse their positions of power to attack their political enemies. That is a massive difference in the great people that showed up at my doorstep two nights in a row. And we're seriously taking their jobs very, very seriously analyzing the situation. And they didn't use any kind of politics in their decisions. They made decisions based on the facts with what they sit what they could see and what they knew. And there that's the difference. Now, I did come out and say defund the FBI after the raid on Marlago and a lot of my critics have used that against me. But the reason why I use the word defund is because when Republicans take back Congress and we're in power in January, guess what? We can't pass laws because the White House will still be controlled by Democrats. The one thing we have control over is the budget. We control the purse strings. We'll be writing the checks. And so we can defund certain sections of the government. And I think we should do it. So when it comes to the upper echelon and the thousands of people that work in the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., I think we need to take a close look there and say, who's really doing their job and actually enforcing federal law? Or who's in that building that really just cares about taking down their political enemies? Because we know what the FBI is. We watch them. They wiretapped Trump Tower. We watch them raid Marlago. We've seen their agents go on mainstream media, news on interviews over and over and over and lie to the American people about President Trump and so-called Russian collusion. So we need to take a hard look. Congress needs to take a hard look at the FBI and who these people are and say, you know what? No. We do need to defend a pay check just to use your position of power, because all you are is a bunch of unelected bureaucrats, and you're not going to use your position as a weaponized against the people you don't like in politics. Our government is not set up for that. And it needs to be changed. Law enforcement on the ground, let's talk about defund the police. This is Democrats' effort to create lawlessness in America all over our country, and it has caused crime rates to spike out of control. And so when it comes to defund the police, you know what? That is absolutely wrong. We need to support our local men and women in law enforcement. And if anything, we need to fund them. We need to help them. We need to support them so that they can hire more people because they are outnumbered and they are undermined right now. So the criticism on me is not warranted for the statements that I've made. And I think the problem for the people criticizing me about it is they just haven't gone out to the streets and talked to all the people I talked to you because I can guarantee you right now, Jack, people agree with me on the statements I've made. Well I think by the way, also one of the issues is that we saw this in the wake of 9-11, and I say this as a prior intelligence officer, that we saw this almost ballooning of the power of the FBI, and we took what was a national criminal agency, and then we added a huge national security function to it. Counter-terrorism, counter-intelligence. It's not they already had counter-intelligence, but we really greatly upped the power of that. We passed the Patriot Act. We passed so many of these things that the civil libertarians, by the way, Ron Paul, who was a congressman in the house along with you, or prior to your arriving there, spoke out greatly against this. And so... I was obviously right. I was just obviously right. And so he said that if you do this, you are going to create mission creep, and that's going to bleed over into everything the FBI does. And I don't think people have a problem when the FBI is going after, I don't know, child traffickers or child pornography, or, for example, bank robbers, and just crime in general. Obviously, your bill, your bill right there, by the way, that would criminalize and make a felony, the child mutilation, that would require federal investigation, that would create a crime that would be investigated by the FBI. Because that's what we're talking about, crime, where the lines get blurred is when you add in this national security element, and then the politicization of this organization in Washington, D.C. And I think if I understand correctly, it sounds like that's what you're talking about. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. I think you're making such a good point, that is what I'm talking about, but there's also this, like we can add layers to that. And I can't remember a business background, so I understand it in that terms. Is a lot of times companies just get overloaded, they get over in place. They have too much overhead. They've hired too many people with too many different titles, and everyone's fighting to do the same job. That is what's happened in federal law enforcement. So look at the layers we have. We have the FBI. We have Homeland Security. We have ATF. We have Border Patrol. We have ICE. We have the IRS, who apparently they need to be able to use deadly force. But look at all the- 87,000. Yeah, 77,000. That's right. That's something else in Republicans have to be fun, by the way. But look at all the layers there. And so what it has created so much bureaucracy, and it has created a serious problem, and it's like which agency, which law enforcement part of the federal government, handles which crimes. Because if you go in and you look at all their websites, you find out that they're all doing the same thing. And so the way I look at it is I'm looking at it from a fiscal- By the way, Congresswoman, one piece that we actually broke on humid events earlier this week, I want to make sure that you had this information. You mentioned the IRS right there, the 87,000. So in that bill, the IRS is now creating a centralized IRS office. And the person that's been chosen to oversee this centralized office is named Nicole Ray. I'm not going to say it wrong. Nicole Flax, excuse me, Nicole Flax. And Nicole Flax, and you may not recognize that name off the top of your head, but you may recognize the person that you used to work for during the Obama administration, Lois Lerner. So Nicole Flax was an accomplice of Lois Lerner, was another one of these people who, by the way, remember the email server went down and they couldn't find the correspondence. She was one of the ones in communication with the Obama White House regarding the targeting of Tea Party groups, the targeting of conservative patriot groups. She has just been appointed Nicole Flax. There's a name for you to oversee this new centralized IRS office in the same bill, the tiring on these 87,000. So we see again, the opposite of what you're talking about, they're centralizing power, they're ballooning power, they're bringing their accomplices in, Lois Lerner's accomplice to oversee the whole thing. Whereas what you're talking about is no, target it, focus, strip it down, get people to understand that they need to focus on their mission. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nicole Flax definitely needs to be defunded. And so does that department. I mean, that's, there's an easy one right there. Yeah. No, that's terrifying and that should scare every single conservative. That should terrify any Trump voter and donor, especially that would be a lot of small business owners. That would be just my goodness. So many people across the country. Yeah. That's, that is a serious situation. But and look at how they do centralized power. But that's what we need to do is we need a decentralized power. We need federal law enforcement agencies that do go after real criminals. The ones that are hurting children, the ones trafficking drugs, the ones, you know, doing such horrific financial crimes, kind of like Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden family. But we don't need, we don't need people in the IRS and in these government agencies who have one pure motivation and it's political. And this is, this is exactly what you're talking about. So for me, just having the business background that I have, when you look at a company that is so over inflated that just has way too much overhead that's bleeding money. And that's what we are. That's what our government is. We're over $30 trillion in debt. We have people abusing their jobs and their crap. So we need to use a scalpel type approach where we cut out different parts of each agency. We shrink them down. We want them to be. We want them to be laser focused and effective. That's what we want these agencies to do. But we don't want them to be politicized and we don't want them their power to be abused. And so when I say defund the FBI, that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about let's remove these factions and these political operatives is really what they are. That's that's that's it. Political operatives. And we need to take them out and get these agencies back to focusing on real crime and not very well story that I I'll tell you this quickly because I want to be respectful of your time. But the story that I was told by a fellow Intel officer years ago was was about the UK and their experience with this in World War II. So everybody knows that UK has MI5 and MI6 right? Well, where's MI1, 2, 3, 4, right? Whatever happened to all that. So am I military intelligence? Well, during World War II, the UK government had this ballooned out all the way up to MI14, MI15. And it's exactly what you're talking about right now. They had a different agencies doing all sorts of things. And you had a lot of overlap. A lot of people doing the same thing now in the midst of World War II. Sure, that makes sense. But afterwards they looked at the government and they said, you know what? This is too much. We don't need this in peacetime. What we want to do is shrink everything down. We're going to have one agency for internal national security. One agency for external national security such as MI5 or MI6. And then for a national criminal office, they have Scotland Yard. And so Scotland Yard is that national criminal office. But one thing that's different between the US and the UK is that we do have our local police forces which are run locally. And I think Al Sharpton has said this once or twice publicly. I think the agenda here, what they want is to demonize police so much in this country that we get to a point where we say, as a people, okay, we've had enough. We don't want local police anymore. We want a national police force centralized in Washington, D.C. That isn't beholden to the people of that area. It's not beholden to the sheriff's. It's not beholden to the town council or the mayor. It's beholden to Washington, D.C. I want a police state and every single American should be terrified. That's a police state. I think you nailed it right there. We have to do everything we can to prevent it. I think we need to fund and we need to support and basically enhance the power of local law enforcement. If anything, states, local law enforcement should be able to work together across state lines. That's how you take power away from the police state and the federal government. You empower each state's law enforcement to do their job because that's all they want to do. Local law enforcement, they live here. They care about their communities. Their families are here. Their kids go to school here. They're invested in keeping our streets safe at where we live. But just as you said, if they're centralized up in Washington, D.C., where they don't care what's happening and say, Roam, Georgia or somewhere else in the country, then we have a real serious problem in America. It becomes something it was never meant to be. I think that's absolutely right. Congresswoman Margie Taylor-Green, thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much for your candor with us. And we're praying for you, the whole audience, we want to make sure that you stay safe, your family stay safe, and hopefully they can catch the people. We hear it's trans activists that were behind this that are trying to, A, take you out, take you off the battlefield because you've been so effective and being the first member of Congress in the entire country to step up and say we need to ban this horrific act. And act, by the way, mutilation of children. And not only that, these gender dysphoria, these gender affirming procedures, which we've also seen by the way earlier this week, it was exposed that the University of Washington was lying about their studies saying that, oh, the data shows this helps the kids with depression, especially go through these treatments. That's not what the data said at all. It said there was no effect whatsoever. Oh, so heartbreaking. Thank you so much, Jack. And listen, we just have to keep fighting to protect kids. And I think we're going to win this battle if we all jump in together. God bless you, Congresswoman. Thank you for joining us here at Human Events. Thank you so much. We'll talk soon. I'd just like to thank once again, Congressman Marjor Tilly Green for spending time with us this Sunday for a special here human events. You look at her spirit. You look at the fact that she isn't willing to back down. In fact, if anything, this just makes her want to fight harder. We need more people like that. Imagine if we had 435 members of Congress with that much passion for doing the right thing for our country. Doesn't always mean you're going to agree. Doesn't always mean you're going to believe that your way is the best. You don't have to all think the same. Okay. We don't want that kind of conformity. That's the left ones. What we want is people are people who are this passionate about their country and who refuse to be stopped. And I will say this though, my biggest criticism other than the people doing this is for the members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who refuse to denounce these attacks on Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. You should be rallying around her because when you do that, you rally around the sanctity of your own institution. Show me where that is. You haven't seen it. You say you're against violence. You say you're against hyper politicized statements. Where are you calling out this violence, potential violence used against Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene? Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay a short."
