    "text": " Turbulent times call for clear-headed insight. That's hard to come by these days, especially on TV. That's where we come in. Salem News Channel has the greatest collection of conservative minds all in one place. People you know and trust, like Dennis Prager, Eric Metaxas, Charlie Kurt and more. Unfiltered, unapologetic, truth. Find what you're searching for at SNC.TV and on local now channel 525. We're close to a year of having done the manhood hour with our very, very special guests to explain what ideology targeting masculinity and classic concept of manhood have wrought on our civilization. We've done more than I think three dozen interviews. And this is our first repeat interviewee. Why? Because we could interview him every single day and we would not not be able to exhaust the mind of information he provides, especially on what it takes to save, to vouch, save our civilizations and the kind of men we need who in times of crisis are indispensable, but then afterwards we seem to want to jettison them. Here's a little clip from our guest talking about pattern as a modern age ax and then bring it all around to the 45th President of the United States. Let's have a quick listen before we introduce him. But he's also got a pre-civilizational animal cunning. And how, why would you? How could you succeed in the Manhattan real estate market? Dealing with crooked unions, crooked politicians, crooked community. You got one hat, you got the builder's union, you got Al Sharpton, you got Bill de Blasio. How do you deal with all them? Bill the skyscraper. So he has certain skill sets. And those skill sets are not compatible with administrative, whether it's civilian or military parlance and the way you solve problems. And I guess the only way we could reconcile that paradox is that you wouldn't want a government of trumps or patents or those types of people, but you might want one or two of them on occasion when the system finds itself incapable of doing things. So if you haven't had workers' wages increases in 12 years, or you haven't had 3.5% on employment in 50 years, or African-American unemployment in seven years, then maybe people have the country decided I'm willing to put up with the President of the United States saying that Jerry Nadler is a sleet bag. The redoubtable, one of your favorite guests from the Stanford universities Hoover Institution, senior fellow author of veritable library books all worth your while, Professor Victor Davis-Hanson, welcome back to America First and to the Manhood Hour. Thank you for having me. Before we talk about concrete individuals and current events in the state of manhood in general and the assault against it, I tell everyone, go and watch this hour-long lecture on patternism on Ajax, but let's give them a little tease or a little spoiler right now. Is this a cycle we have to go through? Does it have to repeat itself again and again and again? That decent societies when they get soft and flabby, when the existential threat comes down upon them like the Nazis or what have you, we have to have men who are barbarians. We have to have tough men, men who slap about shell-shocked corporals and privates, because that's how we save civilization. And then after they've saved us all, we say thanks, but no thanks and like with Churchill, they get jettisoned. Are we condemned to this kind of cycle, Professor? I think so. I think there's something about free market capitalism and consensual government that creates a lot of capital, wealth, prosperity and freedom and that can after generations lead to laxity or inewy, and then we forget how rough it was or how tough it was to create these very successful societies. And we become paralyzed, calcified, calcified with existential threats sometime. So in these moments of darkness, you have to turn to people that you had shunned before and you will shun after like a Curtis Lamey or a George Patton or Winston Churchill. And it just keeps reoccurring. It goes back to classical, sulfately in tragedy and his phyllic teeties and Ajax and even edifice and Antigone, they're the same type of character. And we see it in John Ford Westerns again and again and again. And indeed the entire Western genre is about the civilizing overtaking of the Wild West, but in that process it can't deal with some of the existential challenges to civilization and they bring these remnants, these vestigial cowboys or gunslingers into their fold to solve problems in a way that they feel they can't solve because it would be contrary to their notions of sobriety and sober and judicious behavior. And then when they're done with them and the problems solve, they're kind of horrified they ever had to use them. When I grow up, I want to work for a woke company, like super woke. When I grow up, when I grow up, I want to be hired based on what I look like rather than my skills. I want to be judged by my political beliefs. I want to get promoted based on my chromosomes. When I grow up, I want to be offended by my coworkers and walk around the office on eggshells and have my words policed by HR. Words like... Grandfather. Peanut Gallery. Long time to see. No candy. When I grow up, I want to be obsessed with emotional safety and do workplace sensitivity training all day long. When I grow up, I want to climb the corporate ladder. Just by following the crowd. I want to be a conformist. I want to weaponize my pronouns. What are pronouns? It's time to grow up and get back to work. Introducing the number one woke free job board in America. Redbloom.work. How much does... You wrote a book about President Trump, the case for President Trump. How much does the 45th President fit into this mold? One of the many reasons I believe he is so detested by establishment figures. One of them is because he is without question an alpha male. He is like the rude mechanics of Shakespeare. He is a man's man. Does he fit into this mold? Is that why he has to be so rejected by the powers that be? Yeah, the powers that be is defined by the Washington establishment. I think I got kind of in trouble in that book because I didn't quite say it, but I said he wasn't going to end well in the sense that I thought he would be very, very successful because he did have these skills to cut through even though he had no Republican or Democratic experience team he could draw on because they both were suspicious of him. In a mere four years he did extraordinary things, but the manner in which he achieved those things was against the grain or it offended the sensibilities of people that had all sorts of insidious power and they were going to destroy him or get rid of him. And so it wasn't surprising to me that they concocted the Russian collusion hoax or the Russian disinformation lap talk of the hoax or the hoax or the first impeachment and a whole series of other things that we're now seeing again and again and again. But the problem is that very often they don't have second appearances. We'll see about Donald Trump, but it's very hard to be a tragic hero, solve the problem and then leave and then come back. And then we have these Westerns, the return of the magnificence or the sequel, but there isn't a sequel to Shane and there isn't a sequel to the searchers and there isn't a sequel to the Wild Lunch and there's not a sequel to Ajax and Philitides don't quite have a great ending and that's what's kind of sad about the whole thing that we don't have the ability or the humility or the character to appreciate these people and the type of skills that we lack. Yeah, maybe in this case there will be an exception because the job wasn't finished the first time round, so the sequel is the continuation of what President Trump had to do in the first four years. In one of your more recent books, The Second World Wars, Plural, you have a very, very heartwarming dedication to your progenitors, your uncles, your name sakes who fought and died in that war. The generation gone are the values evinced by the members of your family who went to fight for freedom in faraway lands. Does it still exist in America? Do those men still exist, Professor? They do, but they're not the majority anymore. They're atypical. They're a minority and they're looked down upon with suspicion. The most important part of black and white world, most of those people that came back from World War II, of the 12 million people who were in the service, about 5 million only were in combat. And when they came back, they found it very difficult to fit in with the post-war booming American society for the rest of their lives in some cases. But they were products of the Great Depression. They were products of having parents that were born in the 19th century. They didn't have a lot of affluence. They had faced dire poverty. And they felt, you know, John Ford made a movie. They were expendable. They felt that given the greater good of the United States, if you put a man on a B-29 that was on proven on the Mariana, say, Tynion, and you say, you're going to fly 1600 miles away. And then you're going to go over Japan and you're going to bomb it. You're going to turn right around and go back 1600 miles without sophisticated navigation. That's a lot to ask for a 21-year-old and yet nobody ever complained today. I don't think you could ask that of them. We see them, these vestigial elements in Afghanistan and Iraq. And what's really worrisome is that there's a demographic that repeatedly joins the grandfather was in Vietnam. The father was in the first goal for the children were in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the fourth generation is ready to go again. And yet we're 40 or 50,000 people short in the military. And you get the impression that this tragic cycle of these heroes that have come out of the woodwork and say, you know, I'm willing to go to this god-awful place. That's what my family does. They're no longer appreciated. And they are tragic because, you know, they die. If you look at the white male from the middle class or the southern rural environs, they die at twice their numbers in the general demographic. And, you know, I've said that on a number of occasions when people in the military got very angry at me and said, how dare you talk about the dead in terms of percentages? Well, that's what the military does with everything. Promotions, advancements, recruitment. They talk about race and gender in every context except who dies at the most disproportionate, most disproportionately. And it's that type of lower middle class, middle class, white male who dies and got awful places like Fallujah or Home and Province. And we don't appreciate them at all. We, if you're Mark Millie or Lloyd Allen, you blanketly blast them or charge them with false accusations that they suffer from white rage, white supremacy, white privilege. And they don't sign up anymore. They're saying, no, I don't want to do that. They're not fully appreciated and they know that when they're very visited, they do a very small element of the American population. You're literally pushing a program in the academies that says, if you're a cisgender woman, a transgender woman, a non-binary agender, bi-gender, two-spirit, demi-gender, what's demi-gender? Sir, that's a term of the people that are eligible for that particular scholarship that is available to, it's a person who looks at their gender in a different way than I do, sir. Well, sure, that's all of these people. You're a cisgender man. You don't even get to apply. Well. Do you know what demi-gender really means? I'm not really sure, sir. Right. So do you know what agender means? All one word, not a space gender, but agender. Sir, I don't. Right. So here we are pushing a fellowship calling for people that you don't even know what the words mean. So, Professor, we have this Python-esque. I mean, it really is like Monty Python moment with Congressman Gates, with the superintendent of the Air Force Academy, where he can't tell the Congressman what a demi-gendered individual is or an agendered individual, that is the requirement for a fellowship program at the academy. The general is squirming in his seat. How did we get to a place where the rank denial of biology becomes a regulation and a stipulation at one of those places? Is there a question at one of the institutions where we are meant to be training fighter pilots and Obama pilots, Professor? Yeah. I think the left looks at the pentagon as a way of short circuiting the Sturm and Drang of the legislative process. In other words, if you're Elizabeth Warren to take an example and you've got a four-star general or a secretary of defense, you don't ask them anymore about the revolving door. You don't say, did you come? Are you going out to Lockheed or did you come in as secretary from General Dynamics? They don't care about that. In this Faustian bargain, they say how many gay people are in your battalion? How many women have you advanced? How many people of color have been promoted? And that sets the tone for people in the lower ranks that they say to themselves. You can get a pit of pass in your post-military career. If you become part of that, I call it the pentagon corporate elite, and it doesn't have a lot to do with battle efficacy. I don't think you're evaluating any more. Lieutenant Colonel, it said my battalion put 99% of its artillery shells on the target. At least not as important as I had promoted or I brought in this type of race class gender profile. That's unfortunate. It doesn't have a good record. We're kind of developing a commissariat, if you will. Explain that. For those who aren't familiar with the Cold War and the Zampolit political officer, how does the commissariat fit into what is being built today or being done to our military? Well, we're using criteria that are not related to battlefield efficacy to evaluate who we bring into the military, how we evaluate them and how we promote them. And that's not unusual in other militaries. The Soviets did it with ideology under the commissariat position. 19th century armies did it on the basis of aristocracy and what your family background was, or British regimental system. Often you had to buy an officer position. But we've never done it in the United States. That's why we were the best military in the world. Now we're using ideological criteria to adjudicate how the military functions. And once that's known, and it is known as the American Arctic Institution anymore. And you can see it with a proposed next chairman of the joint chiefs that the former common enough super superintendent of the Air Force Academy who was being considered based on his loud and well known, advocacy for woke issues and diversity, equity inclusion, but not a distinguished fighting record that would be preeminent, maybe at the top five or six in the country. And so when you have, I guess what I'm saying, when you have the chairman of the joint chief lecture people about their white privilege to a group of people who are dying at double their numbers in the demographic in combat. And then calls his Chinese counterpart to warn him that his own commander in chief may be volatile. And he's worried vis-a-vis how the Chinese may react to that. Then you've got a different military than we've had in the past. Can it be, if you look at historic example, can this be undone, this viral political infection? I mean, if you look at the state of the military in 1939, I think we had the same armed forces as Belgium did. So we had this miniscule capacity, thanks to the likes of Major Vida Meyer and others. It was ballooned up to the 12 million and it was an incredible fighting force. But that was almost tabularaza, that was building from scratch. When you have this inculcation of the antithetical to the Esprita core, other examples are there systems for un-taught. I think so because we have to evaluate the role of public opinion. And from all the polls that we, and there's not a lot of them, but the polls suggest that the American people are not in favor of this. Not in favor of this. So if you were to re-elect a Donald Trump or a Ron DeSantis, and I just picked those two because they've been very vocal about it. I don't know what Tim Scott or Nikki Haley may say, but those two have at least said that in very similar ways they would shake up the military. And that is they would not promote, allow people to the highest levels that were political or were in their positions because of politics. But the problem is that the Pentagon is in Washington and all of these high ranking officers as they go up the chain of command and various, some of them are in the National Security Council, some of them get posted to Congress. They testify and they understand that when you have either Democratic, Democratic, and Majority of the parties or Democrats who are in the Republican state, they may have been necessary adjustments for their own personal interests or careers, especially post out of the military. I can remember the days when Les Aspen 40 years ago, which is a rail as a Democrat about a general who would be going out to, let's say, Lockheed is a lobbyist. He'd say, you're not going to do that or you're not going to give an exemption for you to come in. The left was just a watchdog and then they have flipped and say, wait a minute, why do that when we can offer that as an incentive on the one hand and then politicize the military? It has become the Petri dish for politicized ideological experimentation because it's the one entity that really maintained a capacity to measure based upon merit. So that's why it has to be undermined. The Twitter account is VDHans and the website is victahanson.com.

If you want to have a healthy generation of men, of adolescent men, they have to see how a man carries himself. Today, this is labeled toxic masculinity. Fourth right, courageous, holds the door open for a woman, is prepared to use violence where violence is justified. We don't have those role models in, let's say, the culture shaping individuals toolkits or what do they call them today, the social media influences. On the flip side, we have, I think of Jack Smith in the news of Thursday and Friday, new indictments, new attacks against the clear alpha male who was the 45th president. What I see is a model of cunning, of underhandedness, of using the indirect approach, using the administrative state. Are we at a point where that has become the model for how to fight? It's not the straight up, you know, outside the saloon, face to face with each other. It is the person who can use the most devious tactics, is the one the establishment respects. Yeah, I think the problem is that to get to a position where Jack Smith is, that is a renowned DOJ lawyer that goes in and out of public and private practices called upon as a special counsel to really take down conservatives. And a guy like Anthony Fauci was 40 years there. You have to have a particular way of communicating. You avoid controversies. You make sure you don't have your tracks anywhere on controversial decisions. And that becomes a nerd into you. And then when you see somebody like Donald Trump, you use all of those contacts you've made, all of those protocols you've developed that have allowed you to even to be promoted and be quite successful without any real evaluation of your record and what you've actually done. In the case of Jack Smith has been pointed out, he doesn't have a good record of being a special counsel. He's gone after people before in an underhanded way and had the charges overturned. Anybody went back to Anthony Fauci's record could see that he should have retired 10 years ago. And but they have a skill sets that aren't there to solve major problems or be to imagine it, but to continue their own, uh, cinecures. When they see somebody like a Trump or an outsider come in, they feel that they know the system. They're kind of like little putions that can tie Gulliver down if there's enough of them. And that's what we're watching right now. All of these prosecutors and all of them, their media contacts and all of their help within the deep state that leaks and everything. They're putting ropes around Gulliver and they're trying to tie him down in these four indictments and they're not doing it, of course, to Hunter Biden or to Joe Biden. Because they don't oppose the existential threat to them. It's Trump. What does it say to you though? And maybe this is a glimmer of something positive that seemingly after every indictment, whether it's Manhattan, whether it's Miami, whether it's the latest one, President Trump's popularity increases. Does that mean that at least the derisively titled fly over states? They understand what's really happening. They do. And my only worry is that these people that are against Trump are not stupid. They're as you say, they're cunning. And so they feel that people in the red state, Republican primary constituencies are different than themselves and they would have natural empathy for the efforts to destroy a tragic hero. But they're on to the next level of Machiavellian machinations and they feel that in the general population, these vestigial people, these holdovers from red states are not the majority and people are more like them than not like them. And they think, and you know this better than I do, their strategy is to tie Trump down and humiliate him and bleed him and get empathy from people who rightly so see how unfair this is and admire his resilience to this. And the wider electorate, they feel that the constituent is not the majority. It's a new United States and this new United States will punish Trump for going against the administrative state or for being rude to the media or using vocabulary that is not in the accepted parlance. And that's what they're counting on. I don't know if they're going to be correct or not, but it's obvious what they're doing. I think they may have miscalculated, but we shall see. It's up to the people who love America. It's not even political anymore. I don't see it as a Republican Democrat thing. I see it as those who believe in America and those who think America is the problem. It's really quite that simple. The website is victorhandson.com.

I'd like a sanity check from you if I may professor because I've been saying this for I don't know nine on two years now and I hope I'm I hope I'm right. But I see a potential especially of late with the testimony the hearings on Thursday of last week and then more stories every single day. I see this potential for this a tectonic catalytic effect of the the ideology of transgenderism being a wake up call for those who otherwise deem themselves to be apolitical and then to have a a healthy reaction to this assault on masculinity and even femininity. So I think it was on Wednesday we had representative Hunt. I think he's a former US Army helicopter pilot and I don't know about you professor but I don't think I've seen a statement as forcibly put on any issue from the floor of the house in many months if not years. Let's listen to what he said about the threat to his family. Ms. Scanlan. My daughters are going to watch this because you have become their new hero and I can assure you that my four year old my two year old daughters will not change in front of biological men. This is ridiculous. I don't care what part of you are a part of. If you think that we're all equal in the same biologically you've literally lost your mind. And when my two daughters work hard in the sport work hard in their craft to be the best that they can be amongst other women they will compete against other women. I owe Victoria and Olivia and every other young lady in this country that if you think I'm wrong I am not the problem. I can assure you. Professor that's not a political statement. That's a political statement of fatherly love of common sense of reason. Could this be the issue that breaks the back of the extremists who hate our civilization. I think there's one or two of them and that's certainly one. And another one is this decivilization of our major urban area. You just saw something like that open recently where the head local head of the NAACP said I'm calling on white and Asian and black middle class people to stop this crime and to blast the city council and they lined up for quarter mile to get in there and these were people who had voted the system in and they never in their right mind thought that crime would go up to Piedmont or Montclair and they're saying that this can't go on. It's a decivilizational issue. We're going backward in time. But do the people who are lining up who are protesting. I mean you're there. I mean you're in California. You're there in Stafford. Are they making the connection? Is there not a cognitive dissonance? Do they understand that they are reaping the bitter fruit of the seeds they have sown by supporting those, if not those policies, those actors who initiated the policies that created the rampant crime? Are we seeing a Damasine moment? We are. It's slow, but it's starting and they understand that they created a Frankensteinian monster and they never thought it would turn on them. But all their money and all their education and all their zip codes are not enough protection from what they've created. And all these issues are force multipliers, so you have the transgender that affects their children as this veterans pointed out and we have crime that creeps up in neighborhoods that's not supposed to go. And then we have kids from the upper, upper, wealthy, liberal, white classes that have perfect SAT scores and 4.5s and they're not getting into Harvard or Stanford because being a white male. So, for the new record for admissions, there are only 10 incoming talks. This wasn't supposed to happen to me. We played away all the rules. We were very liberal. We created affirmative action. And yet, like the transgender issue and like the crime issue, I think very slowly, incrementally, people on the left, especially their elites thought, oh my gosh, I'm the victim of my own ideology. And I don't know whether the Republicans or the conservatives can capitalize on that disenchantment. It'll be very interesting, but it's there and it's growing because whatever's, what can't go on won't go on. And you can't have a society where men are dominating women's sports or people are running. So, sitting around the major thoroughfarers of Oakland and the police watch or people are walking into stores and shams just going and walking out with no consequences or somebody who's an Eagles scout at 17 with a 4.5 and a perfect SAT score is turned down from every college he applies to because of his race. That can't go on. And I think a lot of people now see that and they're on the left. And when you say capitalizing on that discontent, I presume capitalizing on it would mean getting people politically mobilized, especially locally, local school boards, local positions. Yeah, it would take a charismatic politician to say something along the lines. You don't like me. I understand that. We don't agree on everything, but I'm your only hope because I agree with you on these issues that are destroying your quality of life. I didn't create them. People you voted for did, but I'm here to save you from them, at least according to my station. I don't know if you have to be that blonde, but a good politician could appeal to them in that way. And I think if you start to look at the polls of independence, and that's one reason, by the way, that Donald Trump won the majority of independence in 2016. I think there were problems he had with the media and the 70% in many states who didn't vote on election day in 2020. But his argument in 2016 was, you guys voted for all this and this chaos and you need somebody like me to come in. And he got a lot of people in Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were part of the blue wall because they felt that it couldn't go on. And he was right about that. And we'll see. But it's much worse now. It'll be much worse in 2024 than it was in 2020, that in 2020 was worse than it was in 2016. So we're in a trajectory of downward trajectory. Well, they say elections are one in the middle and in another year and a half's time, it will indeed clearly be worse. We're out of time. Let's try and get to some treatment, not just some diagnosis. Let's put your books up on the screen. We have several of them available visually. The dying citizen is the most recent. Please get that. Also, we have the Second World Wars, how the first global conflict was fought and won. And the case for Trump, all of them are worth your while. One of your favorite works, Professor, is Who Killed Homer? I want to tie all of what we've discussed back to this book, The Demise of Classical Education, The Recovery of Greek Wisdom. Is this the panacea? Is this the answer? How much of what we are fighting for is the result of what's happened in the education system in the last, what, at least 60 years? And how much of the education systems being fixed will be the core to the solution? I know you have a long term affiliation with that amazing institution, Hillsdale. But we need more Hillsdale's or we need the Hillsdale's spirit to infect institutions around the country, do we not if we are to have a chance of undoing the insanity? Yeah, I think so. And it starts at K through 12 is where the real battle has to be fought. There's no civic education. There's no history as we know it. There's no disinterested inquiry. It's not tragic. It's melodromatic and psychodromatic. So in these courses, they start deductively where we're going to show you that America's bad, that these particular names in American history have to be discredited. Their statues have to be teared on. Their names have to be changed. And they do that very early on. And the result is twofold. The student becomes ideologically prejudicial, but they're also ignorant because they have not had philosophy in English and German and French and all of these rich topics, subjects. And then they emerge out of high school and college with the two worst traits possible combine ignorance and arrogance. And you can see it when they talk. They don't know anything. And we see people in Congress that come out of this educational system and they're embarrassing their ignorance. And so I guess the answer is there's a lot of answers, but it would start with why are these huge $35 to $60 billion Ivy League endowment's not taxed and why in the world do we give tenure to professors when you could give them five year renewable contracts. If they met certain criteria of publication or teaching or university service that was outlined rather than giving them a blank check, why do you need a teaching credential to teach high school, but you can teach at a community college with a master's or a BA? Excuse me, a PhD. So we could give people the options. Say if you don't, you're going to graduate, you want to teach a high school kid or eighth grade, get an MA for a year in history or biology and just skip the education in the future. If you don't have the education indoctrination, it's not academic at all. It's just indoctrination. So there's things that we can do. I think we need to get the government out of the student loan business. And that would really hurt the university's progressive woke agendas because they would have to have the moral hazard with which shift from an anonymous face to their own institution and financial stability. And so if they want to issue all of these loans and they want to teach all of these fluffy classes and have all of these superfluous DI people and then their students can't make their loan requirements or they graduate with these worthless degrees and then they can't get a job and they default and it comes back to them. And if that happened, then they would start saying, we've got to trim this and cut that and get back to basics. So we could do it all. But unfortunately, it would require a Republican president, a Republican Senate and a Republican House, and then at least a majority of Republican governors and state legislatures to be on the same page. It is doable and there is a plan. I love this phrase, all those fluffy courses. I think the adjective you may use the most in this book is therapeutic, that these institutions have become therapeutic. They're about making the students feel good, not taxing them, not introducing them to new ideas as is what classical education should be about. Well, that flew by. Please check out viktahanson.com. Follow him at VDHanson on Twitter. Subscribe to the Blade of Persias. Thank you, Professor. I'm Sebastian Gorka. You've been listening to The Man Who Now. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, keep your head on the swivel. Watch your six. Hold the line. Never give up. Never give in and stay frosty. Our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. I know not what cause others may take, but as for me give me liberty or give me death. The world will little note a long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. I have a dream to do. Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorka's off, tear down this wall. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people. And the people who knock these buildings down will hear all of us soon. And we will make America great again. This is America first with Sebastian Gorka. But the biggest complaint that I get is that the Republicans find out this information and then they do nothing about it. They don't do anything about it, right? Telly knows, you know, they do. And it all dies, you know, they die. The radical lunatic Democrats, they impeach me, they indict me, they rig our elections, and the Republicans just don't fight the way they're good people, but they don't fight the way they're supposed to fight. The others are dirty sick players and the Republicans are very high class. They've got to be a little bit lower class, I suspect. That was Harry Pennsylvania at the weekend, one of the biggest, biggest cheers for the president. It was his observation that what he hears all the time from you, the American people, is that we find corruption everywhere amongst the Democrats. And then the GOP, the so-called concern is the so-called Patriots do nothing. Let's open the show with no monologue because we have a very important guest who is the opposite of that. I think seven, eight years ago, he decided to do something as a very young man and create it perhaps the most influential organization for the salvation of our nation that we have to date. Turning point, USA, and he's its president. Charlie Kirk, Charlie, welcome back to America First. Dr. Gorka, you're very kind. Thank you. I have to be here. It's just a statement of fact, if you're not supporting TPUSA.com, you should be. Charlie, you texted me early today with at least some good news, an article in the Hill that high schoolers, high school young men, are trending conservative. And this in the Hill is not exactly a conservative outlet. So give us the breakdown of this incredible new good news. Yeah, it's extraordinary. In fact, it shows that Gen Z young men are far more conservative than millennials were at the same time. And in fact, it's the most conservative that high school seniors have been young, male high school seniors have been since the Reagan era, Dr. Gorka. So what's going on here? I do want to take a little bit of a victory lap at Turning Point, USA. We're the only organization on the right with the high school program. We spend a lot of money time, attention. We're hiring 50 new people this week actually just on this project. We have over a thousand high school chapters, but it's not just us. It's other great communicators like Matt Walsh and Shapiro that have been doing content that have been very persuasive to this demographic, but also it's something bigger than all of us. It's the trend, which is the entire society right now is against men. And you have your masculinity hour, Dr. Gorka, that I love listening to. You do a great job. And young men, if you're a straight Christian white male, the whole world basically says you're awful. And for a portion of young men, they say, I'm going to go look for anything, content, podcasts, movements like Turning Point, USA, that speak to me that say, you're not awful just because of who you are or how you look. And the society has become hyper feminine. The bad news of this poll, Dr. Gorka, is that young ladies are more liberal than they were 10 or 20 years ago. But it's actually offsets because the young men are not just a little conservative. They are vocally and outspokenly conservative, which is really throwing a little bit of a glitch. This is the second question I had because you look at the indoctrination amongst those who support trans and everything else in open borders. It's yay deep. It's incredibly superficial. As soon as you ask them a question and you've demonstrated it on campuses everywhere, they collapse. My question is, is this trend line significant or is it just young men are being cool because it's now cool to be conservative? It sounds like it's deeper than just a coolness factor. Well, it's deeper because what, here's what we find is in the trajectory. Once someone is conservative, they don't really go back. I mean, there might be some outliers here or there, but the trend is our friend. So the earlier you can get somebody to be a conservative, there's an attachment there that doesn't die. As you well know, Dr. Gorka, they get married. They have kids. They hopefully buy property that they get in the workforce. So if they're conservative at a high school senior, this is going to be an unbelievably conservative generation. Wait till we get to really dive into them when they're in college and they get into the workforce. So what I'm saying is that if the starting point now is young men are as conservative as they have been since 1980, the most conservative. Whoa, that's a 40 year high, more conservative than they were in the 90s during the Bush era. In fact, if you look at the Obama era, young women and young men were as conservative. I mean, as liberal, that's unbelievable. And now it's almost a 20 point difference. And so, of course, there's work left to be done. This is significant. It's profound. And as these young men grow up and they become the leaders of our society, they're going to have conservative positions. And this is Dr. Gorka. You said it best. What's so amazing about this is the educational institutions, social media are demanding that they're liberal and they're fighting the trend. That's what's so incredible here is that this is with all the indoctrination. So what are you talking to millions of people right now? You have an amazing podcast. I'm honored to be on the freedom network with you. What is your message to everyone listening now who's a parent, an uncle, a grandparent? Yes, they have to support turning point. But what do they have to do, Charlie? Well, first and foremost, there's hope. And I think the article was actually really beautifully written in the Hill, which is exactly, it's not Brightmark.com, right? Where they say that there is this assumption that Gen Z is the most progressive generation ever. And they say not so fast. It actually isn't. And I lived with millennials. When I first started turning point USA, there was this assumption that millennials were going to be the most progressive generation in history. And it turns out that millennials are now 50-50. They're about three points in the local direction, but they've moved like 25-30 points over the last decade. And I think turning point USA has had a lot to do with it. So there's hope. That's number one. Number two, which is there's work to do with young ladies, right? There's a lot of work to do there because that's the part of the poll that is not as promising, but that can move over time. But understand that this is a much better starting point than where we were even five or ten years ago. Why is there actual... Sorry, why is there that discrepancy with the females, in your opinion? Well, I just think that progressivism plays to the emotionalism that young ladies largely have both temper mentally and politically. God made us different. Young ladies probably are less likely to want to say no to open borders or trans-surgery because they look at it as being compassion and long suffering and kind, where young men are more likely to say no. Actually, there's limitations and we maybe should have close borders and it's not a good idea to chemically cast straight 16-year-olds. And then the abortion issue probably largely resonates with a lot of young women. So there's work to do there. And also just if you look at... It's so culturally mandated that young ladies are on the left. Now, I'll tell you, there is a varied lead. We have the largest young women's leadership summit. We've been doing it for seven years. We have 2,700 young women that do not believe in this trash of the kind of progressive leftism and they're making differences in their communities. But it is definitely harder for them. There's a great part of the article at thehill.com says, The future the conservative movement is men. The future the liberal movement is women.
