    "text": " Continuing on the theme from last week because I believe that this is such a critical topic right now, today we talk about the fact that young boys seem to be going astray. The school system is stacked against them. Society seems to be dismissing masculinity altogether and being a man is something that actually has to be defended. My guest today, Dr. Leonard Sacks, joins me to talk about five factors driving an epidemic of unmotivated boys and under-achieving young men how the school system needs to be overhauled if we are going to re-engage our boys, the dangers of endocrine disruptors in men's lives and how boys are going adrift and more importantly, how to get them back on track. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. You boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler and I am the host and founder of this podcast. The one you're listening to right now, Order of Man. I am so glad that you're here, that you're joining with us, that you're not only listening to the podcast, but you're out there in your families, your businesses, your neighborhoods, your communities, and you're doing the work of men. Lord knows we need this now more than ever. It's been a crazy week. I'm just getting back into the swing of things after a very, very successful uprising event. That's a three and a half day experience that we do with 24 men who fly in from all over the country. In fact, we actually had somebody fly in from France in this last event. So we're going international with this thing as well. So getting back into the swing of things with that, getting on top of everything, planning our new event, which is a father and son event coming up in September. I'll talk with you more about that later in the show, but man, I'm busy. I know you're busy. You can listen to a thousand other podcasts, but you are here joining in this mission of reclaiming what it means to be a man in a society that seems to be more and more losing sight of what it means to be a man. And I said in the opening remarks that it's fascinating to me that masculinity actually has to be defended. Seems like it's the case more and more and you and me and millions of other men across the planet are again banded together to make sure that the world knows what it is that we should be doing as men and then sees us stepping up as men. So I'm glad that you're here. I'm glad you're tuning in. We've got an incredible, incredible show lined up with somebody I've been following for a while. In fact, I was introduced to him through my wife. I'm going to talk more about that in a minute. But before I do get into that, I do want to just make a quick mention of my friends and our show sponsors, Origin, Maine. Now, I know I talk about their training equipment, their compression pens, their geese, their rash guards, their supplemental line with Jocko that I personally use. And I completely suggest that you get ahold of that stuff because it is valuable, especially if you're training and doing jujitsu. But the other thing I want to mention is that you need to check out their podcast. It's my friend, his name is Pete Roberts. He's the founder of Origin. His podcast is called Hands and Daylight. I was looking at their statistics the other day. I think they were as high as number seven in all of business. I mean, the stories that these guys share and the values they adhere to and the conversations that they're having, they're absolutely incredible. And their conversations that I believe in, that I adhere to, that I try to live in my own life. And of course, that I'm sharing here with you on this podcast. So again, it's Origin, Maine is their site. And then Hands and Daylight is their podcast. Now, if you do want to pick up some of their training gear, rash guards, compression pens, geese, if you're interested in their nutritional supplemental line that I use, which is by Jaco. So it's the super-crill. It's the joint warfare. And then their pre-workout called discipline, head to origin, Maine.com slash order of man. Again, origin, Maine.com slash order of man. And then use order, O-R-D-E-R. Make sure you use that because you're going to get a discount at checkout. So again, origin, Maine.com slash order of man and then use O-R-D-E-R at checkout for that discount. So guys, with that said, I want to introduce you to my guest today. A lot of you are probably familiar with his work and his books. His name is Dr. Leonard Sacks. Again, I was introduced to him through my wife. She picked up a couple of books several years ago, I want to say on her pursuit to more effectively raise our boys. I've got three boys and a little girl. And of course, we're always interested in learning new information that we can help raise our children right. She came across the books, boys adrift and why gender matters. And after she got done reading those, she asked if I would. And from the opening remarks, I knew that this guy had some of the answers to the challenges that I as a father seem to be facing in raising my young boys. And I'm sure, because I've gotten messages from you, that you have as well in raising boys and being involved in the community and in our young men's lives. Dr. Sacks is a MIT graduate. He's a physician. He's a psychologist. He's been practicing for nearly 30 years. And he is well versed as you're going to hear today in very, very important gender issues. And the crisis, our young men and women seem to be facing today. Dr. Sacks, thanks for joining me on the show today. Excited to have you on. Thanks for inviting me. Yeah, I've been following your work. I was actually introduced to your work through my wife who's read all of your books. And she got me turned on to those books as well. And I'm really excited to have this conversation specifically about boys adrift, because I think there really is a struggle with men in general. And I think we've begun or maybe it's been going for a while to lose our way. So I'm anxious to have this conversation because it is a critical time for boys. And you seem to be the subject matter expert on this stuff. Thank you. So talk to me a little bit. I mean, as we as we create the framework for the discussion today, talk to me about generally the struggles and the challenges that boys are facing. And then we can get a little bit into the specifics about why that is and how we begin to address these problems. Well, you know, this topic can be controversial. And I've done this in a debate format with professors of women's studies at various universities. And they'll often say, what are you talking about? You know, look at the Fortune 500 CEOs are still overwhelmingly men. Look at the world's wealth. It's still overwhelmingly controlled by men. So where do you get off saying that boys are having problems? So I think it's important to start by looking at the data. Look at how kids are doing in school. There's a growing gender gap in academic achievement across the United States with boys falling farther and farther behind girls. And this is true across just a very wide range of parameters in the school who's earning the best marks, who's the valedictorian, who's editing the school yearbook, who's graduating with honors. And in most cases, the gap is widening, not because girls are doing better, but because boys are doing worse compared to how boys used to do. So I'll give you one example. Way back in 1980, National Endowment for the Arts surveyed a large sample of American teenagers, coast to coast, and asked them, what do you like to do in your free time? Like to play outdoors, play sports, read books. They were especially interested in who's reading books for fun. And they found in 1980 that there was a slight gender gap that girls in 1980 were a little bit more likely to read books for fun in their spare time than boys were. But then more recently, two researchers, Mark Bareline and Sandra Stotsky went back and did the same thing. Once again surveyed a large and demographically representative sample of kids across the United States and asked them, what do you like to do for fun? And they found, and I'm quoting now from their report, that the gender gap has become a chasm, that reading for fun has become a marker of gender identity, that girls read and boys don't. End quote. And that's not true because girls are reading more today. Girls are not reading more today. Girls today are reading a little bit less than girls were reading in 1980. But American boys have stopped reading altogether. It's unusual today to find an American boy who reads for fun in his spare time. And as I said, this is true across a wide range of parameters. Look at who's graduating from university in the United States. 40 years ago, men outnumbered women. Today, women outnumbered men, 5743 last year, bongos who graduated from four year universities. You look at who's graduating with highest honors. You find that women now outnumber men three to one. That's a huge change compared with 40 years ago. 40 years ago, men were overrepresented among those graduating with highest honors. 40 years ago, women were more likely than men to drop out of college, often because they were getting married and starting a family. Today, young men in the United States are much more likely to drop out of college than their sisters are. And it's rarely because they're staying home to raise baby. More often, it's because they're going back to their parents' home to play video games in their parents' basement. So you look at who's taking advanced placement exams, who's earning the best marks, who's editing the school newspaper. You know, I graduated, I attended public schools in Northern Ohio, K through 12. I was editor-in-chief of my high school newspaper. editor before me was a boy. The editor before him was a boy. I can't remember a girl being editor of a high school newspaper. It was always a boy. My high school newspaper has three editors this year, all girls. I was on the debate team. Most of the kids on the debate team were boys. My high school has a debate team now. It turns out they're all girls. You know, when did boys decide that arguing is not something boys do? There's been this massive exodus from of boys, from academic achievement, working hard to get a better mark. You know, 50 years ago, Sam Cooke had a number one hit song in the United States. Don't know much about history. He's saying, now, I don't claim to be an A student, but I'm trying to be because maybe by being an A student, baby, I could win your love for me. He goes in and mentioned French geometry and trigonometry as subjects in which he's going to try harder to earn an A instead of a B. That wouldn't happen today. It's impossible to imagine a con M&M 50 cent Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake singing about how they want to try harder to earn an A instead of a B. The culture has shifted and working hard to get a good mark is now seeing by many boys as uncool, as unmaskulent. Why is that changed? Is that changes in the educational system and the way that we are being taught as boys? Why did that happen? So that's a major focus of my book Boys Adrift. The subtitle is the five factors driving the growing epidemic of unmotivated boys and underachieving young men. And those five factors are education, video games, stimulant medications for attention deficit disorder, endocrine disruptors, which are lowering testosterone levels dramatically, and the revenge of the forsaken gods. So those are the five factors. When I speak to parents, I usually talk about factors two, three, four, and five. I just did this talk, let's see, two days ago in Silicon Valley, among you Los Altos. Incidentally, that was a repeat. They had me do the same talk there 10 years ago and invited me to come back and do it again, because the superintendent, Dr. Harding, told me that he's just seeing this problem getting worse, that boys have no interest in earning top marks or earning academic honors. And he's a father for boys. I think he wants to know more about why this is happening. But very quickly, that first factor after you listen is again, I do one in two day workshops for schools, sharing what I've learned. I visited now more than 400 schools over the last 17 years. And I've learned a lot about how you make school friendly to boys without making it unfriendly to girls. But let me just give you an example of that first factor, changes in education. American education changed in some big ways over the last 30 years that have the unintended consequence of disengaging boys. And one of those changes, one of those four components of that one factor, is that school has become unfriendly to boys. And I'll give you a very concrete example of what I mean by that. If your listeners are in the northern United States, my question is, does your school allow kids to throw snowballs at one another on school property during school hours? The answer is no. And I've found this to be almost universally the case in the United States. And that's a big change. As I said, I grew up in northern Ohio. We got a lot of snow off Lake Gary, Lake FXNo. And during the winter months for recess and lunch, we'd put on our coats and go outside on the playground and throw snowballs at each other. And the teachers would come out and join us. Students against teachers. I remember Mr. Albers was a great shot. Get you right between the eyes every time. And that's very common. You'll hear stories like that all across the United States and Canada. But today, if two boys go out on school property during school hours and start throwing snowballs at each other, it's very likely that teacher or administrators going to run and say, what are you guys doing? Not allowed to do that. Can't throw snowballs at each other on school property. You want to do that? You got to go somewhere else. Any unintended message that boys are getting is that school is not the place for you. That you don't belong here. We don't want your time. A boy's are getting that message loud and clear. There's a better way, which I learned when I visited St. Andrews, the boy's school, North of Toronto in bounds versus out of bounds. At St. Andrews, if you want to throw snowballs, go to the football field. You are allowed to throw snowballs at one another on the football field, but not elsewhere. And that works. You create a space. Look, boys doing things that boys have always done. Winning fingers at one another saying, bang, bang, you're dead. Throwing snowballs at each other, drawing a picture of a knight decapitating another knight. Boys doing things that boys have always done now gets you in trouble. I can give you examples, many examples of American schools where boys doing things I just described. Those boys were disciplined, suspended, threatened with expulsion. Medicated like you talked about. Well, medicated is a different issue that we can get to, but one example I've given boys a drift. This fifth grade boy, one of his friends pretended to, it went bang and pretended to shoot him with his finger. And the other boy pretended he had a bow and arrow, drew back the imaginary arrow, and when Tling and pretended to shoot the boy with an imaginary arrow, the boys were holding nothing in their hands. This was make believe. Both boys were disciplined for violent behavior and threatened with suspension. Actually, I think the one boy was suspended and he was threatened with expulsion if he did it again. This is psychotic. It's completely detached from reality. And the school districts will say, well, we don't want to condone violence. We are concerned about school violence. Look, we've got good evidence on this point. Prohibiting boys from pointing fingers at one another saying, bang, bang, you're dead does nothing to prevent actual school violence. This is not a guess. We have good studies in which researchers have compared districts with so called zero tolerance policies, where kids are not allowed to point fingers at one another, saying bang, bang, you're dead, with school districts demographically similar, which do not adopt such policies adopting a policy where kids are not allowed to point fingers at each other, saying bang, bang, you're dead accomplishes nothing in terms of preventing actual school violence. But it does greatly increase the number of discipline referrals. More and more boys getting in trouble for this imaginary, pretend sort of behavior. But it has another bad consequence, which is that when a boy gets in trouble for pointing his finger at another boy saying, bang, bang, you're dead, he's getting the message, as I said before, that school is not for you. And a lot of those boys conclude, yeah, school sucks. I'm going to go home and play grand theft auto. That's the unintended consequence. And it's so easy to fix this. In two days with teachers, you can turn this around. And the boy who hated school last year, loved school this year, they create a snowball tournament, where your pair kids off, it's voluntary, could sign up, you pair kids off and you throw snowballs, each kid gets five chances to throw a snowball at a target. In each pair, whoever hits the target more times advances, and whoever doesn't sits down. And at the end of the day, you've got a grand champion. And that boy who last weeks had school sucks is now staying after school to participate in a school sponsored activity, namely this snowball tournament. It costs nothing. It's easy to turn this around if there's any interest. Unfortunately, most school districts, most administrators have no interest in this topic. Indeed, when you even present this, I had a teacher who went to her professor of education. She's earning a master's in education. And she showed the teacher my book, just showed it to her and said, I'd like to lend you my copy of Dr. Sex's book, Why Gender Matters. And the subtitle is what parents and teachers need to know about the emerging sciences, sex differences. As professor looked at it, didn't touch it, looked at it and said, I have no interest in such sexist rubbish. For many professors of education, the notion that we should consider what boys need and how that might be different from what girls need is regarded as, as another principal said to me, he said, Dr. Sex, after you're looking up on Google, I've concluded you're either an idiot, a Republican or both. The notion that boys might need something different from what girls need has become politicized in this country. And if you suggest such a thing, people assume that you're a Republican and before you know it, they're talking about Donald Trump. And I say, wait, wait, stop. This is nothing to do with Donald Trump. We're talking about evidence, scholarly papers, what boys need to be successful in school is different from what many girls need to be successful in school. Why are these administrators and these educators who are supposed to be there for our children having such a hard time recognizing this understanding and at least considering that this might actually be true? Well, unfortunately, I think politics has infiltrated the school and the district. To be concerned about boys means for many people, they assume that you are right-of-center, that you are Republican. And people who are concerned about girls, likewise are often assumed to be Democrats, left-of-center. Well, I'm concerned about both. Girls are not the winners here. Girls today are much more likely to be anxious and depressed than girls were 20 years ago. And there is no taper in that trend line. About 400% more likely to be anxious or depressed compared to girls 20 years ago, I wrote a book about that called Girls on the Edge. So both girls and boys are losers here. Many schools that are very welcome to the issues of how we can help girls to be less anxious, how we can help girls to thrive in computer coding and physics have very little interest in how do we get boys excited about creative writing, expository writing motivated to do their best in the school? I'm completely shocked. And I certainly see that because I've got three boys and a girl. And I can certainly see that for my two oldest who are in school right now. In a way, it seems like they're completely set up to fail. But I do want to move on because I want to try to get through as many of these as we can. I want to talk about this second factor, which is video games. Now, I will say we don't even have video games in our home. We watch very little TV. But I am really interested because I think technology is important and understanding technology is important. But I think it gets taken to the extreme. You know, when I talk to parents over 40 about video games, some of them are thinking about Pac-Man. Sure. It's a little bit different now than it was then. Yeah, they haven't played Grand Theft Auto Call of Duty Assassin's Creed. They don't understand. This is completely different from what you can grow up with. This is very realistic. And the engineering is very good. So when you're playing Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto has one of the best helicopter flight simulators that exists. When you play that game, you feel like you're in a helicopter. Some kids will just go and play the helicopter part. You don't have to go around shooting people. You can just stay in the helicopter as long as you want to. It's realistic. It's immersive. And for many boys, it's addictive. And a lot of parents are like, you know, my son's playing World of Warcraft. He's got his headset on. He's collaborating with his guild members in the Philippines and in Liverpool, England. And the parents are awed by the technology. It's like, wow, you know, he's really getting tech savvy with his headset, giving commands to his guild members in Johannesburg, South Africa, all in real time. And the parents don't realize that the boys are coming to prioritize the video game over real world experience, that getting to the next mission in Call of Duty for many of these boys is more important than getting an A instead of a B on their Spanish Isam. They also are, the parents also are often not aware of the research, showing that the more time a boy spends on video games, the more his social skills are undermined. Learning how to talk face to face with a human being, how to listen, how to use tone of voice as a clue to meaning. None of those skills are innate. They have to be learned and they're learned by practice and they're maintained by practice. And the more time a boy is spending on video games, the less well he develops these social skills. Yeah, it's amazing to me how infrequently that I see boys in the neighborhood, for example, that they're even outside playing. You know, my boys, I kick them outside. I remember when I was little, my mom would literally lock the screen door to our house and I would go out first thing in the morning on Saturday and I didn't come back in until my mom yelled for us for dinner and everybody started going home because it was dinner time. But you just don't see boys out in the neighborhood playing anymore because they're trapped inside on devices and electronics, video games, TV. And I can definitely see that being a real problem. Well, and this is why it has to be the parents job to limit, govern and guide what video games your kid is playing and for how long. And in the book, I provide very specific guidelines, no more than 40 minutes a night on school nights, no more than an hour a day on weekends, and your minutes do not roll over. So if you go three weeks without playing a video game, that doesn't mean you're allowed to spend seven hours on a Saturday playing a video game. This has to be the parents call because when he's online and the boys now very often are playing online with friends, it's very hard for a 12 year old boy to say, well, I'm going to sign off now because research suggests that spending too much time on video games may undermine social skills. Come on, that's ridiculous. No 12 year old is going to say that. You have to be able to say, hey, my parents have installed this app on my console. It's going to lock me out in two minutes and I won't be able to log back on for 24 hours. You have to be willing to be the mean parent. You have to be willing to take the blame when your son says this friends, well, I'd like to play for the next four hours, but my parents won't let me. That's your job as a parent. It's amazing how much power I think generally in society we give our children. I think that's the premise of your book, The Collapse of Parenting, is that we're more interested and concerned with being friends and being liked than being the structure and the discipline that kids need. I mean, they don't know what to do and it's our job to help foster healthy parameters and guidelines for our kids. That's right. And the culture has changed in a way that undermines the authority of parents. I mean, you look at the most popular TV shows for kids 50 years ago, shows like Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, The Andrew Griffith Show. Those shows were teaching kids that your parents know best, that your parents have the right and the duty to limit government guide, what you're doing. But the most popular shows for kids today, whether it's American Idol or ICarly, The Voice or Survivor, those shows either parents are absent or parents are projected as clueless out of touch, shows like Modern Family, even on the Disney Channel. Jesse, Dog with a Blog, Liv and Maddie, those parents are out of touch and clueless about what kids do. Completely oblivious. Yep. What we're talking about today with Dr. Leonard Sacks is such an important issue, so much so that I have decided to throw my hat in the ring with what I think has the potential to become the next evolution or a next component of the Order of Man experience. It's called Legacy. All right. This is a three and a half day father and son retreat in the mountains of southern Utah. I just released the dates last week and we've already sold out a third of our slots for this event. The dates are September 20th through the 23rd, 2018, and we only have 14 spots remaining. This is only the second time I've really announced it. Over the course of three days, you and your son are going to develop more skills and forge new bonds between yourself. Create the framework for success and growth as men and in a way, create your own rite of passage. I've talked about this in previous episodes of the podcast and I get so many questions about creating a rite of passage and we want to be able to help give you the tools and the assistance that you need not only to do it here but then to go out and do it in your life. Now, guys, the age range for the boys is between the ages of eight to 15. Again, it's for ages eight to 15 with your son. So if you have a son, whether that's a biological son or an adopted son or a step son, maybe it's a nephew. Maybe there's a neighborhood boy that you have a fatherly role in the life of that young man, then please join us in this life-changing experience for you and also for him that I think will set the course for the rest of his life. If you are interested in learning more about the event and the activities and how this will work and you want to lock in one of your seats, head to orderofman.com slash legacy. Again, it's orderofman.com slash legacy. Now with that said, let's get back to this conversation with Dr. Leonard Sacks. Well, let's for the sake of time move on to this third factor, which is medications for ADHD and those types of things. What do you see here? What's the research and the trend showing? Okay. So let's talk about the trends. In 1979, about 1% of American kids were diagnosed and treated for attention deficit disorder. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most recent data, 20% of American boys, one in five, now been diagnosed and treated for ADD. And I compare the numbers across countries. An American kid is now 14 times more likely to be on medication for ADD compared to a kid in the United Kingdom. I wrote a book for a French publisher on girls and boys in France working with French colleagues. And working with French colleagues, I learned that in all of France, there's fewer than 6,000 kids on medications for ADD. I just came from speaking near San Francisco. I can tell you, there's more kids in San Francisco alone on medication for ADD than there are in all of France, a nation of 65 million people. Why did this happen? And why did it happen here and not elsewhere? Well, it happened because medication became the first resort in this country and not elsewhere. It's very common for an American physician to say, well, let's try Adderall. Let's try Vivance and see if it helps. I spoke at Harvard on a conference on learning and the brain. And I would love to tell you my presentation was the buzz of the conference, but it wasn't. The presentation everybody really got excited about was a presentation by Dr. John Gabrielli. Dr. Gabrielli somehow got permission to give Adderall a very popular medication for ADD to give Adderall to normal kids and withhold medication from kids who truly had severe ADD. And then he studied the ability of kids in both groups to learn on and off medication. And he found that medication helps kids who don't have ADD, helps normal kids as much or more that it helps kids who have ADD. That's a really important finding because so many times parents will say, well, you know that Vivance has been so helpful. Dr. Sacks, how can you say my son doesn't have ADD? If I've really helped, the parents are using the response to medication as though it had some diagnostic significance. Vivance was prescribed for my son for ADD. It's been immensely helpful. Therefore, my kid must have ADD, right? Bzzt. Wrong. Dr. Gabrielli's research and other studies like it show these medications are not specific. They help normal kids as much or more than they help kids with ADD. These medications help everybody. Why not just put everybody in medication? So I saw this appearance brought a boy to me. A child psychiatrist had diagnosed him as having ADD. It was off the chart on the counter scale, inattentive in all classes. But they brought him to me because now he's on Vivance. He's getting palpitations. He's got a tremor. He's anxious. And they feel correctly that this is due to the medication. So they saw something I wrote for the New York Times about how these medications were overprescribed. And so they brought him to me for a second opinion. So I did a careful sleep history. I said, when do you go to bed? When do you wake up? And before the son could answer, mom said, well, he's in his bedroom by nine o'clock. We wake him up at six in the morning. So that's nine hours. I said, all right, you have a video game console in your bedroom. And the boy's very friendly and forthcoming. Yeah, he's got a video game console. Yeah, he plays it. Yeah, he's up till 1 a.m. two in the morning, typically playing Assassin's Creed, Fortnite. And he's getting three, four hours asleep a night. He has sleep deprived, sleep deprivation perfectly mimics ADHD of the inattentive variety. There is no observation, no counter scale that can distinguish the kid who's not paying attention because he's sleep deprived and the kid who's not paying attention because he has ADHD. And the medication was tremendously helpful. Why? What's five ants? What's Adderall? Their amphetamines, their very powerful stimulants, they compensate for the sleep deprivation. If you got four hours of sleep at night, but you take 30 milligrams of Adderall, you're good to go. But the appropriate remedy, the appropriate remedy for sleep deprivation is sleep, not scheduled to amphetamines. And I said to the parents, get the console out of the bedroom, no devices in the bedroom. Incidentally, that's not just my opinion. That's the official guideline of the American Academy of Pediatrics. No child under under 18 should have a video game console in the bedroom or a smartphone in the bedroom because they're going to be playing games on. I met two in the morning. So no screens in the bedroom. As again, those are the official guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics. And this boy did fine. He got his sleep. He doesn't need medication. He needs parents who understand their job. It's really interesting you bring this up and it really comes back to this other book that you've written the collapse of parenting. And I think just for the sake of time, we'll have to have maybe a secondary and a follow up conversation because I think it is very easy and we'll use the word convenient. I think that's probably the best word to prescribe medication or to try to put band-aids on the symptoms when the real problem is, like you say, a collapse of parenting and a collapse of involvement in the family. From my perspective, is that accurate? Yes. But if we're focusing on boys and motivation, we need to tie this up. Why are stimulant medications a problem as far as boys and medication and motivation? The problem is that stimulant medications, at or all, by-vance, concerted, meditate, focal ended, trana, ritalin, turns out they damage the motivational center of the brain, the nucleus accumbens. And I now cite 15 different scholarly studies in which this has been demonstrated in humans and laboratory animals. The damage, the motivational center of the brain, this nucleus accumbens, has nothing to do with learning or memory. These kids can learn fine. They can remember fine. Has nothing to do with affect. These kids are smiling and happy, but they're not motivated. So I'll give you one quick example from my own practice. A mom is getting very frustrated with her son and she confronts someone the day and says, you know, what's your problem? You're a lot of bed late every morning, you work a few hours a week at the coffee shop. You're 28 years old. You don't have a career, you don't even have a girlfriend. And he laughed. He said, well, I used a girlfriend. And she found out I only work a few hours a week at Starbucks. She dumped me. Mom is pulling her hair out. Son's totally fine. He's happy. She insisted he come see me. He was okay with that. And he made some very negative comments about this young woman who had dumped him. He said, she was fat. And she wanted me to take her places and do stuff. He said, 1995 a month. I said, wait, what do you mean, 1995 a month? I don't understand. And he mentioned a porn side, a pornography side. He said, yeah, and the girls are way prettier. I said, wait, those aren't girls. Those are pictures on a computer screen. They're pixels. Wouldn't you rather be intimate with an actual woman? And he said, no, look, for many of these boys, the pornography is so good. The video games are so good. They would rather spend their free time in their bedroom with the door closed than venturing out into the real world, which costs more money. And where the risks of rejection are much higher. That's the end result. This boy was on Ritalin and other stimulant medications for ADD from age 9 to age 17 prescribed by other doctors. That's the end result. He's funny, he's friendly, he's good looking, but he is completely unmotivated. Interesting. Does this tie in then to that fourth factor of endocrine disruptors where it's medication or these other chemicals, things that we're putting into our bodies? The five factors are logically not connected, but they've come together in a perfect storm because they all have the net result of disengaging boys from the real world. The fourth factor is completely separate. The fourth factor is endocrine disruptors. Water in a plastic bottle. That plastic is made from polyethylene terephthalate, P-E-T. That bottle was shipped in a truck. Even when it's cold outside as it is today, that truck was sitting in the sun and the temperature inside the truck can easily rise above 110 degrees Fahrenheit. When that happens, chemicals in the plastic, specifically diaphthalate and antimony, will leak into the water. Those chemicals act in the human body like female hormones. It's not just bottled water, it's soda, it's condiments like ketchup, vinegar, pasta sauce, foods and beverages that we consume are now filled with these endocrine disruptors that mimic the action of female hormones. Now, what happens when a child drinks bottled water or consumes ketchup or pasta sauce from a container that is a plastic bottle? Well, the answer varies depending whether you're talking about girls or boys. If you're talking about girls, the result is an earlier age of onset of puberty and a higher risk of anxiety and depression. If you're talking about boys, the result is a drop in testosterone levels. In the United States, there's been a continuous drop in testosterone levels over the past 60 years. Testosterone levels in the United States for young men have dropped by about half over the last 60 years. And of course, that affects fertility just five months ago. The study was published showing that the average total sperm count of a young man has dropped by more than half since 1971. We're seeing a dramatic plummeting decline in testosterone levels and sperm counts across the United States and indeed across the developed world. It is not at all true in Sub-Saharan Africa where people are not drinking water out of plastic bottles. This phenomenon is confined to people in developed countries. Why is it a problem? And why does it affect motivation in boys but not in girls? Well, again, I cite many studies in which researchers have studied young men who are driven and hardworking and compared them to men who are less motivated, lazier. And they find consistently that the driven hardworking man has higher testosterone level than the lazy less motivated man. But this is not at all true for girls and women. That driven hardworking woman does not have a higher testosterone level than the less motivated lazier woman. Women do not rely on testosterone for drive and motivation. But men do. And when testosterone levels drop, drive and motivation drops. And you know, some of the factors we talked about are not easy to fix. You cannot change your child's school. But this factor turns out to be real easy to fix. Don't buy anything that was shipped in a plastic bottle. Don't carry bottled water with you or allow your son to pour tap water into a steel canteen as we do in our home. Don't microwave anything in a plastic bag. Use metal or ceramic, excuse me, not metal, use ceramic or... That could get interesting really quick. That would be pretty interesting in a microwave. But you can carry it in metal, but microwave in a glass of ceramic container. And when you do this, within a few weeks, hormone levels normalize. So the fourth factor, not well known among Americans, but actually a real easy one to fix. Interesting. Yeah, sounds like a quick fix. Let's move into this fifth factor. That one's actually really interesting to me, which is the revenge of the forsaken gods. I'm really curious what you have to say on this. Yeah, so that title came from a conversation I had with one of my patients, Anders Eklof, who's an amateur anthropologist. And he and I were talking, we both read about Sub-Saharan Africa and South Pacific Islanders. In those cultures, boys do not become men as a matter of mere maturation. For that boy to be recognized as a man and to earn the privileges and prerogatives of an adult man, he must earn that right. And that transition is not automatic. And the parents will often make sacrifices to the relevant gods, to propitiate the gods, to improve the odds that their son will make that transition into manhood. And as my patient was pointing out, we don't pay any attention to that. And the result that we're observing is, he said, the revenge of the forsaken gods. And I like that phrase so much. I used it as the title for that chapter. But what that title means in more accessible terms is the decline and disintegration in our cultural construction of masculinity. So again, you look at the most popular shows and movies. From 50 years ago, movies starring men like Gary Cooper, Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, those movies, those shows taught boys. That being a real man means being courageous, being knowledgeable, being honest, being thoughtful, being kind, being productive. Fast forward to today, I've reviewed the 150 most popular television shows in writing my book, The Collapse of Parenting. Not one of them consistently or even often portrays a father as knowledgeable, competent, caring, productive. On the contrary, what's much more common in this country is Homer Simpson, who's a bum, an idiot. In one episode, we get to see his brain. His brain has three major drives, sleep, donuts, and beer. Modern family, the straight dad, is consistently an idiot. And his stupid antics are the butt of the joke. His children, especially his oldest daughter, are consistently wiser and more insightful than the father is. The idiot out of touch, clueless dad has become a staple of American comedy. And the knowledgeable, courageous, productive father is now unknown. And this has consequences. I'm not just talking about the media incident. There's lots of more habitants that boys had no idea what it means to be a man. They have to be taught, and we no longer teach them. And so they look to the marketplace. And the marketplace has changed. You know, 1964, The Beatles had a number one hit song, I want to hold your hand. Oh, please say to me, you'll let me be your man. And please say to me, you'll let me hold your hand. That was a number one song in this country. More recently, Acon had a number one hit song, I want to F you. Okay, I'm not gonna say word on the air, but he says it. It was a number one song in this country. He's addressing five strippers who and he says, I see you winding and grinding around that pole. I see you looking at me and you already know, I want to F you. And he talks about I'm going to take it to the motel wholesale. He clearly is offering money for sex. Bruno Mars January 28 2018. One six Grammys, more than any other artist, all of which were based on his album 24, most of which were based on one song from that album. That's what I like. He's speaking to a young woman. He barely knows. And he says to her, you baby girl, you and your ass invited, turn around and drop it for a player pop it for a player. He's offering money for anal sex because that's what I like. That's the title of the song. And this is the best song of the year, in the opinion of the recording Academy. You know, imagine a young man at work going up to another co-worker, a young woman, and saying, Hey, baby girl, you and your ass invited. I'll give you diamonds and money for anal sex, which is exactly what happens in the song. Well, that young man would be disciplined. He would he would talk that addressing the girl as you and your ass is objectification, and that it's never acceptable to offer a co-worker money for sex. And yet, a song in which that happens is celebrated as the best we have to offer. That's the culture in which young men are growing up. And how are they supposed to know if they have received no instruction? They are adrift in a culture that is teaching them that this is what real men do. This is what's cool. I don't think we can have this conversation without addressing some of the situations, for example, in Florida and active school shootings. We actually had a situation here just in the last couple of days with a young man who brought a bomb that he made in his in his home to a school. Fortunately, it didn't it didn't detonate. Is this a symptom of the five factors that we're addressing today? Yeah, I think that this all ties together in every culture, boys want to know what does it mean to be a man? And we no longer give them any consistent or meaningful instruction. And as a result, many boys now construct masculinity negatively. In other words, being a real man means not doing what girls do. If girls care about working hard and pleasing the teacher, then I don't. If girls want to be kind, then I'm going to be mean. What does it mean to be a real man? Well, it means racing my car 140 miles an hour on a city street, getting totally wasted, taking whatever girl I want without asking. And for some boys, it may mean getting a weapon and firing that because then they'll all see, I'm a real man. So on that note, then, Dr. Sacks, what what is your definition? What does it mean to be a man? Well, you know, I meet with middle school and high school boys and we talk about this. And the definition I guide them towards is a definition I've learned from a number of boys schools that I visited. And that is being a real man means using your strength in the service of others. Being a real man means using your strength in the service of others. That works pretty well as a definition. And it's certainly a great place to start the conversation with boys and young men. I wholeheartedly agree. I really, really appreciate that response. And certainly something I subscribe to as well and try to instill in my boys. This has been a really fascinating discussion. Obviously, we could talk so much more about it and sounds like we may need to have a follow up conversation. But for now, I'd like for you to share with us how we connect with you, learn more about your work, and then of course, pick up copies of your books. Well, if you go to my website, Leonard Sacks, L E O N A R D S A X, Leonard Sacks.com, and just click on contact me, I try to answer every email I get, give me a couple days sometimes, but I will try to get back to you. Right on, we'll make sure we link all that up and connect the guys with what you're doing. And I can tell you, I've read your books. My wife and I have both read those. They've helped us when it comes to parenting and understanding what's going on, specifically with our boys and our daughter as well. So I want to let you know, I appreciate you. I appreciate your work and really, I'm grateful that you spent some time with us today. Thanks for coming on the show. Thanks for inviting me. Gentlemen, there it is. My conversation with Dr. Sacks. I know this was very, very powerful for me. I've been trying to schedule a conversation with him for some time now, and I was so honored to be able to get on the phone with him and have this conversation in a society that frankly just needs to have it. There's big announcements with the boy scouts dropping the name boy from their title. And of course, that's probably going to be changing some things. Again, masculinity needs to be defended. It's being dismissed. And I think we're doing a huge, huge injustice to our boys, which there will come a point in time where we ask them to lead us. And if we don't adequately prepare them for that responsibility, we're going to be in a world of hurt. And I think we begin to experience some, just some of the problems that we will continue to experience as we neglect our boys and we forget to take care of them the way they need to be taken care of. One symptom I can see from this is active shooter type situations. A lot of these kids, they don't have father figures in their home and they've never learned what it means to be a man. And so it's automatically dubbed toxic masculinity when it's not masculinity at all. It's something that hasn't been developed and shown through other men. So we have this responsibility, this obligation to help these young boys. And of course, Dr. Sax is doing great work. And then we've got our legacy event, which is our first experience, if you will, in dipping our toe into the water of helping fathers be able to go out into their families and their communities and raise boys the way we know they need to be raised. So guys, make sure you connect with me. Make sure you connect with Dr. Sax. If you want to learn more about our legacy event, order of man.com slash legacy, drop me a line drop Dr. Sax a line.
