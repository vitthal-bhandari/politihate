    "text": " Happy Monday, folks, packed show today. We're going to talk about everything that's going on the inflation expansion act passing the Senate by the vote of Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. We're also going to talk about what's going on in Ukraine, CNN redefining the word groomer and outrage as ballistic missiles fly over the island of Taiwan. You're going to want to hear this. We're also very excited to announce that we are starting to partner with RAV as of today. But first, we need to talk about the college scam. Yes, that's right. The new book out Charlie Kirk College, Gam.com. How America's universities are bankrupting and brainwashing away the future of America's youth. And it's very great because all proceeds from book sales go to Turning Point USA. And guess what? I did get a copy of the book when I visited Charlie last week in Phoenix. And yes, it is the one he spelled coffee on. Well, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard today's edition of human events daily powered by Turning Point USA. Today is August 8th, 2022. And a domine, very excited to be here on Real America's voice. First story today, inflation expansion act. That's what I'm calling it. The IRS agents are set to double. And yes, they are armed next Ukrainian women and children refugees sold as sex slaves in the UAE, third CNN redefining the word groomer and finally worldwide outrage as ballistic missiles fly over Taiwan. All this and we're ahead human events daily. To take a moment to say a few words about the so called inflation reduction act that we are debating this evening. And I say so called, by the way, because according to the CBO and other economic organizations about study this bill, it will in fact have a minimal impact on inflation. On this vote, the A's are 50, the Nays are 50, the Senate being equally divided, the vice president votes in the affirmative and the bill as amended is passed. Well, late last night, the United States Senate passed another 700 billion plus dollar spending bill. Here's what's going on. We're now at the point where they're basically just looting the treasury before this entire thing falls apart. They know they don't have the money. They know they're going to be printing for this. They know there's no $700 billion. And they're calling I love the name the most Orwellian thing you've ever heard the inflation reduction act. No, I'm going to call it the inflation expansion act because we know we know at the end of the day that all they're doing is printing more money. And they're going to get it off the backs of you. But oh, wait, there's more because what are they also doing? They're doubling the number of IRS agents and specifically the 80 nearly 90, 90,000 87,000. I'm looking to hear we've got the story on post millennial 90,000 new armed IRS agents. That's double. We're now nearly going to have 170,000 IRS agents. And who do you think they're going after? Do you think they're going after the 1% as Bernie would say the millionaires and billionaires? No, this is the ruling class set on you. They're going after the middle class. They're going to be going after small and medium enterprises. This is exactly what they've wanted for a long time and they don't even care. They don't care anymore because they are going to loot every red cent they can out of the treasury before this thing falls apart. That's why you're seeing it right now. They know midterms are coming up. They know where the polls are. They're thinking of doing anything they possibly can to get more money into their coffers, to get more money into their sinks. And it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that your inflation is going to continue to rise. Your prices are going to continue to go up. There's nothing being done, by the way, about crime in these cities the massive waves of homicides shootings every single night. Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit. It's like a meme at this point, Los Angeles. The open air drug dens that are going on at Kensington and Allegheny skid row is basically the entire city of Los Angeles at this point. So this is your government and they'll sit there and they'll tell you that you have to go worry about a long standing conflict that took place in the blood fields of Eurasia. And that's what you should worry about. Not what's going on in your own country, not what's going on in your own home, not what's going on in your backyard. The floods that are going on across the Midwest, the devastation, it's not even there. It barely even makes the eating maybe local news. It might make local news, but you have to understand. We are now seeing the collapse of the entire international system. They call it the liberal world order. And this thing is not going to go far. It's not going to go without a fight. Why? Because we're in the fourth turning. And when you're in the fourth turning, that is a period of collapse, of decline, of decay, of rot. And then eventually great tension and great strife and great conflict. The fourth turning is when the great conflicts arise. And so our question is, are we going to let our leaders be so stupid as to take this, take this money, deny it to the American people and the children of the United States. And instead use it to expend blood and treasure where in the Middle East again, in Asia, in Europe, Eastern Europe, or are we going to look at ourselves in the face, look at ourselves in the eye and say, you know what, we have so many problems here at home. We know there's issues in the rest of the world and our heart goes out to them. But we have to fix our home first. The United States of America is our home. We need to protect it. We need to defend it. And we need to preserve it. That's what the new right is all about. And I just gave a speech at CPAC explaining that in great detail this last weekend down in Texas. And let me tell you something, if we can't get it in Texas, we're not going to get it anywhere. That's what this mission is about. And every single one of you is part of that mission. Are you sick of world corporations as I am? I hope so. But we are now learning and we have learned that it's economic warfare that will change the way the marketplace works. Vote with your wallets. These corporations divide us. Banks frees the accounts of people who disagree with their political views and our supply chain is dependent on countries like the People's Republic of China that actively work against our values. It is time for a change and that change starts with you and your wallet. That's why human events daily is proud to partner with Public Square. Public Square is the largest directory of freedom loving businesses our nation has ever seen. Public Square is the first app to connect freedom loving Americans with their local community and the businesses that share their values. Whether you want to support a restaurant that only buys from local farms, a coffee shop that took a stand against the COVID mandates or a bank that would never cancel you for your political views. Public Square is your guide. Public Square, it's super easy to use. Just go to the Apple App Store, Google Play, download the app. You can then start your free account. You start searching. If you have a business yourself, you can list that for free. So your local community or anybody else can find you today. Just download the app Public Square. That's Public SQ. Well, he's fueling the foreign the Ukraine for a start. That is a huge crime. Why weren't the United States of America encourage Cilensky, the president, to negotiate the need for this horrific, horrendous war that is killing your blouse? We don't know how many you've been. But you're blaming the party that got invaded. Come on, you've got it reversed. Well, that's you know, any war, when did it start? What you need to do is look at the history and you can say, well, it started on this day. You could say it started in 2008. Okay, it's basic. This war is basically about the action and reaction of NATO pushing right up to the Russian border, which they promised they wouldn't do when Gorbachev negotiated the withdrawal of the USSR from the whole of Eastern Europe. So identified over the weekend that you're starting to see a narrative shift in the mainstream media when it comes to the coverage of Ukraine. Take a look at that piece that we just aired. That was on CNN. Yes, it was Roger Waters and Sperkhanish. Long time post no listeners might remember, by the way, that years and years ago, I was an intern for Sperkhanish when he rained his radio show when he pretended to be conservative at W Ph D 12 10 a.m. The big talker was a CBS radio network in Philly. But have you ever heard that CNN ever had that opinion on air before? I don't think so. I don't think they ever have talking about deescalation. And that's what I've said from the start. You can have escalation now or you can have deescalation, which camp are you going to be in? All right, we don't have to agree on all the root causes. We can debate those until the cows come home. But at the end of the day, there are people, there are men, women and children caught up in this, losing their lives. And in some cases, even worse. And so you note that CNN is now starting to air that CBS ran a report talking about 30% of the arms and the aid that's being sent to Ukraine isn't actually making it to the front lines. That's something that Kevin and I discussed in great detail multiple times here on this program when we went to Ukraine, when we went to Odessa to Lviv to McAlliah. But now there's a new report, another new report that's just come out from the New York Center for Foreign Policy Affairs and the Washington Institute for Defense and Slavery titled Modern Slavery in Dubai. And what does it say? Ukrainian women and children refugees are being sold as sex slaves in the UAE. Florian Schmitz, the author of the report, according to Post Millennial, says given the large scale movement of vulnerable women and children from Ukraine into Russia, since the beginning of the war, sometimes under duress, it is highly likely that a good number of them will end up being trafficked to the UAE and other countries. In August of last year, a similar situation occurred after America's withdrawal from Afghanistan. numerous incidents reported at intake centers in the UAE of young girls from Afghanistan being presented to officials the wives of much older men. The problem of slavery in the UAE has worsened, as that's the UAE, by the way, right? This is happening all over the place. It's worsened after Russia's invasion of Ukraine as women and children will be prime targets for traffickers. The international community cannot and must not turn a blind eye to this problem. It's the international community that's exacerbated this problem. If they wanted to do something about the sex slaves, then they would have set up something and they would be trying to deescalate the situation on the ground in Ukraine. They'd be trying to do anything they can to bring this to a stop. They'd be doing anything they can to provide peace for the region. Yet we don't have that. We don't have international organizations. Everything that everything just take the exact opposite. The inflation reduction act expands inflation. The United Nations divides nations. The Security Council does not provide security for anyone. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defensive alliance, has invaded country after country after country. And even on the flip side of that, I'll say the Warsaw Pact was made at the end of a bay a net and at the end of a tank. It's all lies. International law doesn't exist. The international community does not exist. It's escalators and deescalators that's all it's ever been, that's all it ever was. And you've got people, actual women and children from Ukraine that are now being sold as sex slaves, the same way that Libya ended up with open slave markets after Hillary Clinton and NATO were involved there. Did you know that Starbucks has started providing baristas with active shooter training because our cities are not safe anymore? That's how bad crime has become in the United States. And while the Supreme Court has made it easier for you to conceal carry for protection, it's your responsibility to be properly trained. That's why I personally endorse iTarget Pro. And by the way, guys, I love my iTarget Pro. I actually use this product all the time at home. My wife, Tonya Tae uses the product, my dad, my father-in-law, even my mom loves this thing.

So just another incredible example of the double think and the new speak that we are all forced to live with today. And of course here at human events daily, powered by turning point USA, now so excited to be carried on real America's voice to the real America's voice audience. You know that the reason that you are watching us or listening to the podcast right now is because we don't play those games and we're not going to. We will not abide by your speech codes. And so CNN is out there and they're trying to redefine the word groomer. And I've got an article here to explain what they're trying to do. We're not going to let you. You can try to redefine words as much as you want. You can go and alter your Wikipedia pages to say whatever you want. We are not going to apologize for speaking the truth. And we are not going to abide by your smears, your lies and your misrepresentations of this movement. And by the way, what you and your people are doing to the children of this country. So according to Postponio, Tara John, a London based reporter for CNN wrote an article on Thursday covering the protests of a drag queen story hour in England. Here's how they portrayed the protesters of the so you got a drag queen story hour and they portrayed the protesters as far right extremists who are importing, you know, US hate and redefining the word groomer as an anti LGBT slur. That's interesting. So if you're opposed to drag queen story hour, guess what? You're now part of the far right. You may never have voted that way. You may never have have supported anyone on the far right before. But if you oppose dry quit, that's how far the overton window has been pushed on the left that if you do not come back. So when I talk about this is the way cults operate, by the way, that if you don't operate, if you don't ascribe to every single facet and tenant of the cult, even when they introduce new things, then you are a far right extremist. You are labeled a suppressive person. You're labeled a narrative well. We're going to go edit your Wikipedia page. What does it say? What does it say? Hold on, let me pull it down here. Here's the sentence that is going viral, according now to CNN, because in the middle of the article, they just slip it right in. And this is what they do. And they act like it's completely normal. Don't ask. Don't question it. Don't question it, folks. The term groomer is a homophobic stereotype. You sue falsely smear queer people and their supporters as child sex abusers. Wait, I'm sorry. What? First of all, the word groomer doesn't even necessarily refer to members of the LGBT community. All right, you can be heterosexual and be a groomer. Like, Oh, I don't know. Jeffrey Epstein, Galain Maxwell. Okay. We know that that's what grooming is. Grooming refers to the sexualization of minors of targeting children for sexual campaigns. In addition, by the way, to all of the other things they're doing, but groomer is a broad term and we're not changing the definition of this. So they are trying to make this word into a slur. And here's the issue. You've got people now at CNN, media matters, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, you can be banned for saying this. Drew Hernandez just had six videos taken off a YouTube. This is why you have to support rumble because he used the word groomer. James Lindsay, Dr. James Lindsay permanently banned from Twitter for using the word groomer. We are not going to stop using the word groomer. I will not comply. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the double standards and I'm absolutely sick of the double speak. We're not doing this. Words mean things. And if words don't have meanings, then the entire language is meaningless. Have you heard about the parallel economy? Well, there's a whole new economy being created right now filled with patriotic companies that've had enough of cancel culture and the left. One, you can support every day. And all you have to do is get dressed. I am talking about under attack boxers. I love my undertacks. I wear my undertacks all the time. They are in the rotation and they are in the rotation Tuesday. These have to be, I'm telling you, the greatest boxers ever made probably because they have literally been tested by special force operators.

What was she doing in Taiwan? Oh, she was China's dream. She gave them an excuse. They've been looking for that excuse she gave and everything she touches turns to you know what. Two failed impeachment. Remember that. And in our final story today also from the post millennial by the way, did you notice that all four stories today from the post millennial? If you guys are not following a post millennial, what are you even doing? Why would you follow anyone else? If the post millennial doesn't have it, it's not news. Okay, maybe there's a little bit new outside, but for the most part, all right, worldwide outrage as ballistic missiles fly over Taiwan for the very first time. And look, I don't even know what to say at this point. The People's Liberation Army is firing ballistic missiles over the island of Taiwan for the first time ever. 11 missiles were fired in total. And it's believed that five of them had trajectories that actually over flew Taiwan Island. I said months ago at this point, the Taiwan might as well just start mining the straight right now a little bit fishy, seriously, but you have to understand those shipping routes through the Taiwan Strait and then to the east of the island in the east China Sea. That's 80 to 90% of the world trade is controlled by these maritime shipping routes. It's also Silicon Valley West, 65%, 15 out of 18 of the most highly powered and sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing plants are there on the island of Taiwan. I wish they were here. I wish those were on short. I wish that the United States of America had those, but we don't. So things are just going to happen now. Speaker Pelosi went over. And if you thought that she was going over for some rah, rah, let's get out the pom poms. Let's show how much we love democracy. That was a swindle. It was a semiconductor swindle and President Trump called her out. That also gave the CCP the excuse to start these operations. I don't for a second call them drills. How many months have I been saying here on humid events daily that it would be a blockade? Guess what? If they're announcing drills on every corner of the island, guess what that is? That's a blockade. Don't be fooled. Don't fall for their little nomenclature, changing the words of things. A blockade is a blockade is a blockade. Missiles fired over the island. They're sending a message. They're sending a message to Japan, to South Korea, and certainly to the United States. This island is ours. The CCP is saying, and you know what? At this point, if the Biden administration and Speaker Pelosi, if they're not going to do anything, if they're not going to fix our Navy, if they're not going to do anything to deescalate these tensions, what do you think is going to happen next? What do you think as we've driven in what is going to amount to be the worst foreign policy blunder in modern history, driving Russia and China together deliberately on purpose at the same time? Who do you think is going to stand up against the United States? It's going to be this axis against us, against globalism, and setting up their own form of authoritarian globalism. Great job. Great job, diplomats, great job, State Department, great job, US Chamber of Commerce. You brought this on yourselves. And if we lose Taiwan, if Taiwan is taken over, this is on you? It's as simple as that. And we'll be happy to be here and discuss it and expose your lives the entire time. And that's it for those of you who this may be your first time watching human events daily. This is what we do here. All right, because we have something that we call our promise, our oath, and our solemn vow to all of you. And that's something that I learned all the way back in Navy intelligence training. Be good, be brief, be gone. But we also have our homework. So what I ask you to do is go download the podcast or the clips from the show and then share this out with one just one of your normie friends and then go leave us your five star review Apple's Spotify wherever you get your podcast content. What did we talk about today? First, the Inflation Expansion Act, passing the Senate armed IRS agents to double next Ukrainian women and children refugees being sold as sex slaves in the Middle East. Third, CNN redefining the word groomer very Orwellian and finally worldwide outrage as ballistic missiles fly over Taiwan, the Biden administration, they're sleeping, they're weeping, they're busy raiding the treasury. They're not doing anything to actually help because you know, at the end of the day, look, when I was in Davos, getting detained, by the way, by the world economic forum assigned police, the word Taiwan was not mentioned once at Davos. And you know why? Because the deals already been made. But one thing we like to do here at Human Events Daily and longtime listeners will know this before we go. It's time for today's history break. On this day in 1786, US Congress unanimously chose the dollar as the monetary unit for the United States of America. This past weekend, Stephen K. Bannon down at CPAC declared that it's time to end the Fed and give the American people back control of their money. Get rid of the central bank. Let's go full Andrew Jackson, folks. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay ashore."
