    "text": " You're listening to the Fucks Exten Show Podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Team welcome to the Freedom Hut Friday, September 23rd edition of the program. We have stock market dropping the economy about to get really ugly friends and it is being reflected in the polls that people are realizing these Democrats not good for your 401k, the price of food, the price of gas, your bottom line, big problems ahead for team Biden. If this continues, we can only hope got some of the latest polls in places like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada to break down for you. Super important Senate races. So we will dive into that plus James Bond going to get kind of a remake here, they say with a softer, kinder, gentler, nail feminist James Bond, something along those lines. I have thoughts on that, my friends. And then also do a lot of culture on Friday here. The woman king movie and the truth of the Dahome tribe of West Africa that is depicted in the movie. There is a reason that there is now a boycott the movie movement underway right now, even though it's supposed to be pro woke and left wing and it's about a minority female in the lead and doing amazing things and all this stuff. The wokeness has a problem here because of the history. And I will tell you some of that history coming up. We've got an amazing show of you. Oh, and then Vivek Murphy, the surgeon general with the weirdest thing that he has ever said, I think ever. What is it?

Look, the economy is in bad shape. There's no way around it. I mean, just imagine here is Corinne Jean-Pierre telling everybody that Biden, don't worry, he understands how much everything sucks right now for your family when it comes to the economy. So the president understands that when it comes to the economy, he understands how much that's crushing families. He gets it that people are sitting around their kitchen table and trying to figure out how are they going to pay for their groceries. And so that's why he's- Yeah, okay. Imagine just taking that as a sound bite. And if you're offering this up as, hey, compare that to what Biden promises. Her middle class inside out, up, down, all around, you know, do the electric slide, macarena, whatever, right? Imagine what Biden was saying back in the day, hey, macarena. That was for you, Mike. I'm having to throw back a moment to the mock. Remember the macarena was all the rage and you did the thing with the, you know, now, I don't know. I think you've only, I think maybe on a seniors' cruise, they'll rock the macarena. You don't see a lot of macarena anymore. Anyway, Biden was talking a big game back in the day and he's not really talking a big game so much anymore. In fact, his chief spokesperson, the press secretary, Crijont Pierre is saying, you heard it. I mean, Biden knows it's hard for you to pay for your groceries. Biden knows that, you know, things suck right now. Oh, and Democrats are realizing. You know, their whole thing about how they're going to lie about abortion and the reality of abortion in a post-obstops world. And that was going to deliver them the election and there was going to be no red wave and all this stuff. The economy, immigration, crime, say it with me, everybody, the economy, immigration, crime. We absolutely have to hammer home those three issues. Those are weak points for Democrats with good reason. They have made crazy, crazy decisions that have resulted in a lot of suffering, a lot of the destruction of wealth, a lot of misery, a lot of unsafe, a lot of unsafe neighborhoods and the spreading of lawlessness. So, and then there's the border, of course, and all the fentanyl coming across and all the illegal migrants and everything that's going on. And this Biden administration has nothing to show for two years other than what? The vaccine mandates that were heavy handed beyond belief, authoritarian, unnecessary, didn't even work. You might have seen this actually. Rochelle Walensky, I got to find this one actually, Rochelle Walensky, who is, who is the head of the CDC is out there and this is amazing. She, she took a photo of herself kicking an old school. First of all, she's masked up. And I'm going to say this, any medical practitioner right now, any medical practitioner who tells me to mask up or is wearing a mask just for a normal interaction, a doctor's office or whatever, or when I go to the hospital, it is to me the same thing as if they were saying we're going to go get a bowl of leeches or we're going to go make sure that we clear the myosmatic air, which was the bad air that they thought caused. It was like bad smells basically that they thought caused things like cholera. No, it actually was in the water. But the top scientists in the world for a long time believe that it was bad air that was causing cholera and other outbreaks in cities in the 19th century in particular. And no, so yes, get the leeches and put a mask on. That's how I feel about that. But she's got a mask on her face. And she said, today I received my updated COVID-19 vaccine. And she wrote laboratory data, suggests these updated vaccines provide increased protection against currently circulating variants. If you receive your last COVID-19 vaccine over two months ago, I encourage you to get to join me and get your updated vaccine now. Okay. So much here. First of all, if you got a shot more than two months ago, she is essentially telling you these things are good for about two months at best, at best two months. She is on shot number five, count them. One, two, three, four, five. She's on shot number five right now. This is the head of the Centers for Disease Control. You know, they're always the good guys in the zombie apocalypse. We have to get to the Centers for Disease Control and they're going to figure out a way to turn around the zombie apocalypse. Let me tell you, if humanity is going to rest on the CDC scientists, figuring out how to defeat the zombies, you better learn to start speaking zombie. It's all over. CDC is going to lose that one. Yeah, no question about it. Zombie flicks are always fun. So she said, but there's something else very interesting I want to point out here. She says laboratory data suggest these updated vaccines provide increased protection against currently circulating variants. Oh, hold on a second. What does that even mean? Because they actually only have antibody elevation that they have shown in mice, no human trials. Now keep in mind, they can't even show that in mice, the elevated antibody protection would stop the mice from getting COVID or having a severe reaction to COVID. They aren't actually telling, they're making this decision and I am not exaggerating. I'm not making this up. This is the exact, this is the truth. They're making a decision. They're saying we tested this in mice in mice. It caused elevated antibodies. Therefore that is the laboratory data that suggests these updated vaccines provide increased protection. I mean, think about where they are now compared to what 18 months ago was you won't get it. You won't spread it 95% effective. Now it's yeah, we shot some mice up with this stuff. The mice didn't grow two heads, you know, about a bing time to get your shot. Oh, oh wow. People talk about a, you know, abolish their defund the FBI abolish the CDC. The CDC is the absolute worst. James Bond, they're going to ruin James Bond. I'm telling you, they're going to do it. But we'll get there in just a second. Look, this is a hard turn. There's no way around it, but this is absolutely essential. It is critical. It is a mission that I want you to join me on. And it has to do with actually saving lives, saving the lives of preborn babies, babies in the womb. You've heard the rhetoric you've seen with Stacey Abrams said recently, it's not a heartbeat. Places like Colorado have passed laws that say all nine months of a pregnancy. Tim Ryan is running for Senate in Ohio, all nine months of a pregnancy. Stacey Abrams said the same thing. They are pushing for this still. Don't think that because of the Supreme Court decision, this battle is won or over anything like that. No, now the battle for hearts and minds and saving babies lives is underway.

The new James Bond situation. I think James Bond is one of the most amazing fictional characters created in the 20th century and Ian Fleming. It's really a work of creative genius. Now people don't know this. I think you Fleming worked in the Naval Intelligence Service for Britain in World War II. He was a part of Operation Men's Meat, which they just made a Netflix movie of, which was pretty good. A little slow, but pretty well done, I guess, for what it is, where they floated to dead body for with this information to convince the Nazis they were going to invade Greece and not Sicily. This is the Brits, the British invasion of Sicily in World War II. And actually he was a part of, meaning Ian Fleming was a part of Operation Golden Eye. I remember the Golden Eye movie with Trevalion and the guy who was in Game of Thrones. I forget his name right now. But there was a real Operation Golden Eye in World War II that Fleming was a part of, which was essentially a leave behind sabotage operation in Spain. So he understood that world, that secret intelligence world very well. And in fact, the American CIA, which I used to work for, the American Intelligence Service was built on and even borrows words and structure from the British Secret Intelligence Service. So they were really the first in this. They were really the pioneers in the modern espionage, modern intelligence service world. And James Bond is just an awesome character. Why don't I bring this up? The next James Bond they're saying is going to be more sensitive and have bigger roles for women. Look, this could be relatively minor because they're talking about Tom Hardy, who I think is one of the best actors out there on the scene these days. They're talking about Henry Cavill, who's like so handsome, and everyone's like, how is it possible to be as handsome as that guy? They're talking about some good options to play that James Bond. But you know, for all I know they could decide that James Bond is actually non-binary and goes by they. The women, the Bond girls have been a thing for decades. Some of the most beautiful women in our western world or around the world, I should say, some of those beautiful women have been Bond girls. That was a big career moment for you know, Halle Berry was a Bond girl. So Fila Ren was a Bond, I mean, I can't remember all the Bond girl. Charlie Sheen's ex-wife, I can't remember all their names. The woman who plays Jean Grey in the X-Men franchise, Phamka Johnson. Apparently, my knowledge of Dutch models was better than I thought. So yeah, they're Bond girls. Is the next Bond girl going to be along the lines of what you're seeing in sort of Abercrombie ads these days with not just body positivity, but the bigger the better is effectively the movement now. Like the more heavy a person is, the more attractive the person is supposed to be. I don't think that's going to work very well. But wokeness, wokeness comes for all of our cultural icons at some point. It's a question of do we push back? Do consumers make decisions based upon their desire to stop this madness? Or do they do they just go along with it? And then with that, speaking of wokeness, the woman king is a movie in the theaters right now. Speaking of Ian Fleming and his background in government as well, when I first arrived at the CIA, there's a period, it's effectively CIA 101 indoctrination to, I mean, indoctrination sounds bad, like they're brainwashing us. But you know, like, what are you doing here? Where are the bathrooms? How do you find your way around the facility? Ethics courses, things like that, very basic stuff. Probably do this in a lot of government agencies. And during that period, which was a few months, they said, well, you know, we might have you work, I ended up working the Iraq account. They're like, just familiarize yourself with West Africa. We might have you working West African political issues. And first of all, I'd studied the Middle East all through college and it studied Arabic before 9-11. So to be told, classic government, you may become a West Africa specialist. I was like, what? Like, I mean, you know, I've arrived. I've got a top secret security clearance. It took, you know, years basically to get into this place. And now they're like, yeah, you might do West Africa ended up not being a West Africa. But the point is, I did just say, okay. So while I was kind of waiting and going through these rudimentary classes on ethics and financial disclosures and whatever, I was just reading about West Africa all the time. So when they brought up, you know, the history and the background of West Africa too, because I didn't have a specific account. So I wasn't even at that point working on anything that was sensitive, you know, government sensitive. And when I saw that they're doing a movie about the Dehome Tribe, I thought you guys are going to be kidding me. You're going to do a movie about the Dehome Tribe or the Dehome Tribe are, in this case, the good gals because it's actually based on the women, the agogie female warriors referred to as the Amazons of the agogie by the European colonists, European colonial authorities. But this is made, we actually have part of the trailer for this movie, which is out in theaters right now. Viola Davis Oscar winner is in the lead role. It's a big budget major Hollywood film. And here is what part of the trailer sounds like. A naval is coming. That threatens our kingdom. Our freedom. But we have a weapon. They are not prepared for. My king, the Europeans wish to conquer us. They will not stop into the whole of Africa is theirs. Ah, the evil is the Europeans are coming. Put that aside for a second. The Dehome were very wealthy and powerful as a tribe in West Africa in the 17 and 1800s. Do you know why? Because they were the most vicious, aggressive slave, slave capturing and slave trading of all of the West African tribes. They made their fortune in slaving fellow Africans, other tribes and the agogie, the female warriors that are portrayed in this movie, the, the woman king, the agogie were these female, they were, for them as these very fierce female warriors, they would be head people for fighting against their slaving missions. They would actually come into villages and in order to, this is by the way, all in the historical record, they would go into villages of fellow Africans and in West Africa. This is, this is based in Benin, by the way, Ben is the French. Benin is what we say in the West, which is just next to Nigeria. So on the West coast of Africa and they would go into the village and anybody who fought against them, they would, they would be head. So they would be head the elders right away, old people, because they weren't worth anything in the slave trade. So they would just be head all the old people in the village and take everybody. And if you fought against them, they would be head you to and then they would bring the heads, the severed heads to, to their king. Now the Egoji were a female warrior unit that were initially the bodyguard of the male king of the Dahome who also had exclusive sexual rights to these female bodyguards, by the way, that was a part of this as well. And the Egoji would also capture people for the purposes of human sacrifice. They would capture slave, they would capture people as slaves. They would also capture people and then execute them as part of human sacrifice. And there's some people believe in the historical record. I mean, there is a here, there is a, there is a in the historical record, a French naval officer witnessed a teenager who had to execute a, this is one of the Egoji women. She was a teenager. She executed a condemned prisoner and quote, a swung her sword three times with both hands calmly cut the last flesh off of the part of the head attached to his trunk and then squeeze the blood off the weapon and swallowed it. So there were, there were stories of cannibalism or near cannibalism as well. They were head hunters, essentially. They were slavers. They would enslave their fellow Africans and they're making a movie about how they were great warriors. And even that's not true. They were fighting against villages with no standing army, no defense force whatsoever. Who wants to guess what happened to the fierce Egoji female warriors when a French colonial military expedition showed up? It's the reason you don't hear about the Egoji anymore wiped out. I mean, there was not even close. You're talking about, you know, casualty rates of, you know, 40 or 50 to one where the French would lose one and the, the Egoji would lose 50. I mean, it was not even close. And they did, they had muskets and they had weapons that they, because they were trading with the Portuguese before the French came along. The Portuguese were the original. They were the ones, you know, you go back, Vasco de Gama and all this stuff. They were the ones that initially made inroads in Africa for a colonial trade. And then the French came along later and actually colonized Benin. But yeah, they've made a movie about this. I can tell the woke impulse behind this is a powerful black female leader and warrior. But in making this movie, they are elevating the tribe that was the most number one, the most associated with the enslavement and mutilation and decapitation of fellow Africans for centuries. Oh, well, you know, you would think, you would think that this history would be something that they would take into account beforehand because they say inspired by true events. So I'm not, they can't pull the, all this is all fiction inspired by true events. The left has actually started a boycott movement against this movie, the left has because even they know this is just indefensible. What are you doing? You know, we're, we're always being told all the time. By the way, what this has really done is it's going to elevate the consciousness in the west of hold on a second. You mean there were, there were, there were African tribes who for centuries built their entire wealth and their societies by enslaving other Africans? Yes. That is the actual history. This is the thing when you start to learn history. Oh, it's so much more complicated than just the history of white colonialism is the most destructive force in the world ever. And it's so terrible and all sorts of stuff. Okay. But a lot of people when they crew power abuse it, every society when it could has oppressed and even enslaved other societies. There were in, in America pre pre-Columbian America, there were tribes, Native American tribes that were enslaving other tribes. The Comanche were infamous. Comanche, Native American tribe for enslaving other Native Americans. The Aztecs built an entire empire of millions of people, slavery, all slave based and human sacrifice based by the way. So we're going to talk about these things. Let's talk about them. And you know, so, so who has, who has responsibilities? Is anyone in Benin, you know, apologizing for the historical legacy of the Dehomei tribe? You know, you know, no, they've got other problems. Here we are. Wokeness, my friends, it always runs into self contradiction because it's not actually rooted in truth or principle. So that gives it a lot of leeway, but it also means eventually it just collides into itself. But I guess now I'm going to go have to see this movie, which I don't really want to have to go and say, I haven't seen it. I'm always very honest about this, but the history of it is the history. I mean, there's unless, unless Viola Davis and all the Dehomei tribe members that she's done, the Goji females, she's with, unless they're the bad side in this, I don't understand how they can, I don't know. There's a reason why there's a boycott movement against it. And trust me, they're not the bad guys. They're the protagonists. So we shall see my friends. Oh, one thing before you go home for the weekend, the Vek Murphy is a, an appallingly bad public health official. He's the surgeon general under the Biden administration. But he recently tweeted out himself saying that he loves ice cream. He loves to go get ice cream cones without the ice cream. He will actually go up to the window of a Dairy Queen or a whatever and say, I just want a cone. I don't even know what to say about that other than is there a better example of why we don't want Democrats in charge. Just the cone. Just the cone. I don't know what to say. Oh, but what if he was a dairy allergy? Well, then get some dairy free ice cream for heaven's sakes. But I mean, come on, just the cone. That's crazy talk. Go get yourself some ice cream, whatever kind you like. Have a great weekend, everybody. Shields high."
