    "text": " I want to fly back to take me one of my first great world together. You're listening to the Fucks Exten Show Podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. The Walt Disney Corporation has been vocal in its opposition to Florida's parental rights and education bill. Their opposition could just be chalked up to corporate virtue signaling. But recently leaked video from a meeting about the bill shows the degree to which sexuality and gender theory have become an obsession for those working behind the scenes and at the very top of the House of Mouse. We have the videos for you and my reaction in tonight's hold the line. Welcome to Hold the Line. I'm Buck Sexton. They oppose the parental rights and education bill. That much we know. They call it the don't say gay bill. They had to come up with a new name for it because if people just read the bill they might say this doesn't seem extreme at all. But now we know this isn't just the company best known for creating timeless classic family friendly fare, whether it's Sleeping Beauty or Aladdin or you name it. Obviously Mickey and Minnie Mouse. No now this is a company where they don't just bend the knee to the wokeness. They are taking orders at the very top from woke corporate officers. Now there are a bunch of videos that have come out in a hat tip to Christopher Rufo for finding and sharing them online. Just from inside a Disney all hands meeting about the parental rights bill and this is some of what you see here. Here's Disney corporate president Carrie Burke who has promised quote more queer leads in Disney stories. Watch. We have many many many LGBTQIA characters in our stories and and and yet we don't have enough leads and narratives in which gay characters just just get to be characters and not have to be about gay stories. And so that's been very eye opening for me. And I can tell you it's something that I feel perhaps had this moment not happened. I as a leader and me as my colleagues would not have focused on and and going forward. I certainly will be more so. I know that we will be and and I hope this is a moment where she the 50% of the tears. Sorry coming. We don't we just don't allow each other to go backwards. You have the chief presidents of content entertainment at Disney a massive and storied American company that's created some of the most beloved programming particularly for families and children of all time saying you know it's really time to have more LGBTQIA lead roles as part of let's be honest here a political agenda to push these ideas to push ideas of transgenderism for example on kids because that's what this is really about worth noting that Burke claimed in the video as well that she is the mother of one transgender child and one pansexual child which I'm sure was a term that got a lot of googling today pansexual what the heck is that 99.9% of Americans thought but remember Disney thinks that this is completely normal in fact this should be celebrated that pan sexuality something your child should know about and perhaps consider down the line as they become adults or their own possible gender identity or their their gender preference in seeking a partner or or whatever and then there was this executive producer LaToya Raveno saying her team has implemented a quote gay agenda and is regularly quote adding queerness to children's programming watch the show winners were super welcoming Meredith Roberts and like the our leadership over there has been so welcoming to like my like not at all secret gay agenda and so like I feel like I felt like it was I mean like maybe it was that way in the past but I guess like something must have happened and the last like they are turning it around they're going hard and then all that like momentum that I felt like that sense of I don't have to be afraid to like let's have these two characters kiss let's in the background this like I was just wherever I could just basically adding queerness to like the if you see anything queer the show from Brown though but like I just was like no one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me huh so this is the Walt Disney corporation and they as you see here having this meeting because it's not that they really think that you can't say gay as a result of the law in Florida that's just the that's the propaganda talking point that's just what they say to justify the hysteria to mobilize people to turn people against this and to create the perception that if you support this bill which by the way 52% of Democrats let me repeat of Democrats in the state of Florida support the parental rights and education bill and huge majorities of Republicans do so here we have a moment where you'd say wait a second this isn't just about the the lie of the don't say gay bill there really is an agenda and Disney is pushing this agenda in every way that it can that your children should be exposed to very complicated and often politically divisive gender theory things like and sexuality cisgender heteronormativity etc all these concepts should be things that little kids not talking about adults here folks little children should be seeing in their programming brainwash them get them while they're young it seems is the Disney mantra about this here's Disney production coordinator Alan March saying his team is committed to quote exploring queer stories and he's created a tracker to make sure there are enough gender non-conforming characters I've had the privilege of working with the moon girl team for the last two years and they've been really open to exploring queer stories and part of I'm on the production side part of the work that I feel like I can put in is making sure that we take place in modern day New York so making sure that that's like an accurate reflection of New York so I put together like a tracker of our background characters to make sure that we have like a full breadth of expression especially with like trans characters you can't see if someone is trans there's not one way to look trans and so kind of the only way to have these like canonical trans characters canonical asexual characters canonical bisexual characters is to give them stories where they can like be their whole selves I mean there's so much going on here but let's just go back to this for a second you know how they used to start out ladies and gentlemen boys and girls in theme parks they have people in Mickey Mouse costumes you know announcing this well their diversity and inclusion manager Vivian Ware has announced that because they want to be more inclusive they'll no longer say ladies and gentlemen's boys and girls because you know there are other options out there watch last summer we removed all of the gendered greetings and relationship to our live skills so we no longer say ladies and gentlemen boys and girls we've trained we've provided training for all of our cast members in relationship to that so now they know it's it's hello everyone or hello friends we we're in the process of changing over those those recorded messages and so many of you are probably familiar when we brought the fireworks back to the magic kingdom we no longer say ladies and gentlemen boys and girls we say dreamers of all ages we don't want to just assume because someone might be in our interpretation maybe presenting this female that they may not want to be called princess so let's think differently about how do we really engage with our guests in a meaningful and inclusive way that makes it magical and memorable for everyone it's really just stunning stuff isn't it this is Disney this is the leadership of Disney these are the people that are making determinations about this company and you see the agenda very clearly at work we're not exaggerating the agenda it's very real and this is also why Disney has canceled Disney or boycott Disney trending today all right we'll continue to talk about this comment up here in a moment with my friend Rob Smith of the first TV but first you know we're living in chaotic times and identity thieves abroad in particular love all the chaos American homeowners are a big target for criminals and it's not just your credit cards and bank accounts thereafter that's small-time stuff these hackers want your home crime is home title theft it's exploding in the US and no you're not covered by homeowners insurance or common ID theft services the problem is the title to our homes are kept online and identity thief knows his big payday is as easy as forging a signature stating you sold your home to him now he'll take out loans after your home on your home and you won't know into the collection call start and you get an eviction notice how do you protect yourself from title theft go to your county recorder's office every day check the home's title or just register address now at home title lock calm see if you're already a victim this is how we protect our most valuable asset our homes go to home title lock calm again that's home title lock dot com the first TV's Rob Smith stops by when we return there's a battle going on right now that may be the most important fighter countries had since the Revolutionary War once again it's about our freedom people like you and me are being canceled our speech increasingly censored by big tech and corporate media can't let that happen time to fight back please stand with us and support the first TV be a part of our team dedicated preserving the very essence of who we are free Americans the hashtag boy cat disney was trending on twitter today after videos of the companies all hands meeting about the florida parental rights bill leaked online videos featured employees discussing sex and gender in disney programming and one company executive saying she wants half of all characters to be lgbtq ia plus or minorities by the end of the year earlier this week disney published an open letter in which the executive promise executives promised to work for the repeal of the bill which prompted this response from florida governor ron desantis for disney to come out and put a statement and say that the bill should have never passed and that they are going to actively work to repeal it i think one was fundamentally dishonest but two i think that crossed the line this state is governed by the interest of the people of the state of florida it is not based on the demands of california corporate executives they do not run this state they do not control this state amen to that joining me now as the founder and president of the Douglas society mr rob smith rob good to see him it was saying about i mean i just saw the governor last night here in telehassie we had dinner and we're talking about this and he was on a talker's show last night as well talking about this issue it's amazing to me i shouldn't say amazing um it is noteworthy certainly that uh the theme park operator uh operators here of disney in florida seem to think that they get to call the shots the governor is telling them not so fast yeah and you know look good for governor desantis for standing up to these woke corporations you know we have this conversation a lot about these corporations and at some point they're going to have to realize that the woke twitter mob doesn't represent the vast majority of the american public and when it comes to the parental rights and education law there's this really interesting poll that um 57 percent and this is of registered democrats and florida actually agree with this law so when they're open and honest with people about exactly what this law says most sane people whether they are you know heterosexual or sane gays and lesbians if there's a few of them left um agree with what this law is saying so i think what we should be asking ourselves is why are all of these alphabet soup activists some of which who have obviously infiltrated the uh executive board and a lot of the creative people at disney why are they so obsessed with the idea of inserting the far left alphabet ideology into programming that is geared for children why is the left so obsessed with teaching five to nine year olds and this is what we're talking about when we talk about this bill we are talking about five to nine year old children why are they so obsessed with teaching them um far left alphabet soup ideology why are they so obsessed with teaching them 100 genders and yet another in uh disney diversity person whatever was caught on another one of these videos talking about her pansexual and transgender child i mean this is utter lunacy and good for ron desantis for standing up against it this is what i really do think i think that there's going to be a lot of lip service from hollywood in the left and a lot of these activist organizations but i think if disney really wants to stand up against this i really do think that they will lose and like i said good for disantas for not backing down and i want to make one more point i don't want to go go off on a tangent for too long i'll go for it this is one of the rare occasions and this is why governor disantas is so good that the left is actually responding to legislation that was passed by a republican except you know instead of us always um responding to things that the left are putting forward they hate ron desantis because ron desantis plays offense and offense is how you win the culture war so every week sauce republican governor um including that uh that republican governor that sort of vetoed uh this women in sports bill that came up a couple of weeks ago so every week sauce of republican governor across this country needs to be taking notes from ron desantis because that is what we need moving forward speaking of ron desantis he also pointed out that somehow disney is so upset about this bill but as it was passing through the floor of the floor of legislature and as this was being publicly discussed and debated in the florida state house they didn't seem to care at all watch i talked to the speaker of the house yesterday afternoon and he said disney never called him while they were putting us through the house they didn't seem to have a problem with it when it was going through this was such an affront why weren't they speaking up at the outset and yet they won't and then for them to say they're going to actively work to repeal substantive protections for parents as a company that is supposedly marketing its services to parents with young children uh i think they crossed the line on a santa's not pulling any punches there it is interesting though isn't it that the activist's name at the don't say gay bill which is not in the bill in fact the word gay doesn't even appear in the bill so how could you ban the word gay if it doesn't actually show up anywhere uh but beyond that rob it seems like the activists of the lgbtqia plus community on the left got upset and disney all of a sudden decided this was a big deal well here's the thing the reason that you know there was no issues with this while i was going up to the legislature legislature is because the left had in their activists on the left hadn't had the chance to sort of um you know pervert what the bill was and to kind of brand it as something so that they can launder this stuff through the mainstream media what happened was that you know like you said gay is not in the bill and we've been talking about this for the past couple of weeks but what happened is the far left alphabet soup activists you have to understand that there are no gay and lesbian pro-gay and lesbian organizations in this country anymore these are all trans organizations and these are all qiat alphabet superstitions that have very little to do with the lives of actual gay and lesbian americans right so they found out about this legislation they said that we are going to brand this bill as this we're going to lie about it and we are going to launder that lie through the mainstream media who dutifully carries the water for this from the uh abc news to msnbc to the associated press all of them did this and by the way even some conservative outlets and conservative outlets need to get a little bit better about this stuff as well and so that is why disney didn't have an issue with this until it was laundered through all of this stuff people are lying about this and then of course the far left woke twitter mob and all of their you know alphabet soup woke execs decided to say oh this is the next battle and when you have to understand is that this is all about and tucker made a really good point about this on last night's surprise that you brought this up because the human rights campaign and all these organizations generally only something that you know gains and lesbians in this country really paying attention to is that these are not getting lesbian organizations anymore they are now pro trans organizations and they need something to keep the gravy train rolling they need for people in this country to continue to be more and more oppressed so that they can launder their donations through the democrat party which is exactly what is going on right now it is all fake it is all ginned up um sort of outrage and people shouldn't fall for it and ron DeSantis should continue to stand up for it because if he does not back down from this i believe that he will win lewie de santis also called out disney's hypocrisy comparing their response here to the issue of weager slave labor in china watch this people ask me you know kind of about you know their posture on the bill i said you know what if we would have put in the bill that you were not allowed to have curriculum that discussed the oppression of the weagers in china disney would have endorsed that in a second and that's the hypocrisy of this and um you know we're going to make sure we're fighting back when people are threatening our parents and threatening our kids real quick rob real real quick rob what do you think um again i think he's absolutely right i know this is sounding a lot like the governor de santis fan club coming from one one end right here but i'm telling you he plays offense and we need people to play offense because let me tell you something these people the the left is losing right now okay so all of they have are these petty culture war issues because their guy in the white house is screwing things up in some very fundamental fundamental and very easily recognizable ways to average americans so all they have are these silly little culture war things but ron DeSantis plays offense he makes it about his citizens he makes it about the parents and disney is just really being put in a bad place and these far left uh alphabets who back to this they're really choosing the hill that they want to die on is teaching comprehensive sex education alphabet soup and sanity um in 100 gender trans radical nonsense to pre-k through third graders it's absurd rob always illuminating thanks for being with us thanks bud u.s border patrol is warning that the country's on track to pass one million migrant encounters for the first half of this year a clear sign the Biden administration has been ineffective to say at least in stemming the tide at our southern border center for

25 percent off we'll be right back with more hold the line the u.s. border patrol chief warned tuesday that the country is on track to pass a staggering one million migrant encounters for the first half of this year the crisis at our southern border could get much worse though as agents there are bracing for a massive influx if the Biden administration decides to end its covid policy lots on pack here let's get right to it with the executive director at the center for immigration studies mark the core and mark thanks so much thanks for having me mark seems like the numbers are pretty staggering here one million migrants in six months puts us on track to shatter it seems every border crossing apprehension record at the southern border for what over 60 years or so and we'll put these numbers in context for us now these are historically high numbers what we're talking about when you maybe the way to kind of look at it in a more digestible sense is that over the past six months the border patrol is averaged five thousand arrests per day on the border and that the obama's head of homeland security j johnson who you know was a democrat but he was serious about his job he said if you get much above one thousand arrests a day at the southern border that starts to get unmanageable we've been at five thousand a day for the past six months and the administration has announced that they're going to lift a particular policy it's in the shorthand they call it title 42 which lets border patrol just bounce some of those people back with no hearings once they get rid of that policy dhs is actually preparing for a possibility of as many as 18 000 arrests a day triple what they're dealing with now and even if it's only double it's already completely unmanageable any increase will make will essentially erase the border i want i want to ask you more about title 42 and a second but i just want to know mark who is when i was down at the border in nacalintexis about 18 months ago if every serve something like that and it was these family units mostly that were showing up there uh women with small children sometimes adult males with small children and and so that was the that was a big part of the influx of the five thousand arrests a day this the year so far that we're seeing are are there a lot of single adult males i mean who's coming and how many of what percentage are being allowed to stay as of now and we'll get to title 42 in a moment uh over the past six months um the majority but not that big a majority have been single adults but what that means is you've got a huge share of families and what's called unaccompanied minors who really aren't on a company and sometimes they're not even minors but that's what they call them and the fact is that the only people who are being turned away under this title 42 mostly are single adults so so i looked at it and it was close to half of all the people arrested over the past six months that's the first half of the fiscal year we're in some way or another led into the country uh some of them were detained briefly and then let go somewhere just just plain let go dropped off at the bus station others were these minors who were delivered to their illegal immigrant parents who paid to have them smuggled delivered at taxpayer expense so close to half were simply let go and if this title 42 change happens uh which is supposed to be in may then the the majority large majority would probably just be let go and and i'm just it's fascinating that this continues to play out there's so little media attention on this um but let's get to title 42 for a second under title 42 authorities are allowed to turn away asylum seekers as part of an effort to combat the spread of covid earlier today the white house communications director kate bedington suggested that biden is not in charge of his own border policy saying they defer to the cdc and then the administration has every expectation there will be influx of people to the border when title 42 is eliminated let's watch this mark how we react to it this is a decision that we have long deferred to cdc title 42 is a public health directive it is not an immigration or migration enforcement measure so the decision on when to lift title 42 we defer to the cdc um that being said of course we are planning for multiple contingencies and we have every expectation that when the cdc ultimately decides it's appropriate to lift title 42 there will be an influx of people to the border and so we are doing a lot of work to plan for that contingency yeah that's uh betting field the white house comps director there so what happens when title 42 goes away as it looks like it will you said there'll be thousands and thousands of people that could come over all at once there'll be a big surge of a where where are these individuals we're going to surge across the border i mean tell us more about how this is how this shaping up they're waiting in mexico uh some of them in fact are they know all about title 42 because the smugglers know more about immigration policy american immigration policy than most americans and in fact there's a journalist who is in contact with one of my people who is in mexico and he says every time he says that he's a journalist and is interested in immigration issues what have he he gets mobbed by people you know from central america africa the middle east whatever mobbed by people who are waiting there for title 42 to end and they're like pressing in for information you know when's it gonna end when's it gonna end i guarantee you that by the time people see this program everyone in mexico who's interested in sneaking across our border is already knows the date of when title 42 will end which is may 23rd supposedly and i don't believe for a minute that the white house is just deferring to cdc i mean if you believe that i have swam plan to sell you because they're ending it on may 23rd but that's almost the same time as a new asylum rule goes into effect which will in essence in essence allow the homeland security to just rubber stamp every uh supposed asylum seeker run the spot right at the border meaning there wait to tell us more about that that's really that's really noteworthy mark i haven't heard about that i haven't seen it reported a new asylum policy goes into effect tell us what the news called how this will work it's a new asylum rule which frankly may be uh i guarantee you it's going to be challenging the courts and it may get held up but instead of having to go to an immigration judge this rule would let the bureaucrats in homeland security just interview you at the border and give you asylum right there without um the government you know any other part of the government presenting counter countering information so what that means is and i guarantee this is the whole point is to dramatically increase the percentage of people getting asylum and to speed it up so they get it right there my point is if you have these people crossing and you let them go but before you let them go you give them asylum they're not illegal aliens anymore this is the way they're solving the problem by defining a way illegal immigration rather than actually protecting the border i'm with the surge in migrant encounters comes in influx of illegal drugs coming over the border as well take a look at these pictures mark last week cbp officers in arizona found over 130 000 tablets of fenthano hidden inside a crock pot uh fenthano overdose deaths in the u.s hit an all-time high last year i mean the border is porous not just from an illegal immigration perspective but also from drug smuggling isn't it yeah and those are related because remember the border patrols job is to stop anything from coming over between those legal ports of entry well under this administration the border patrol has been turned into kind of like wal-mart greeters where illegal immigrants are coming over there's a big group all the border patrol agents on the line have to be taken off to process these people well then there's nobody patrolling the border and guess what that's when the cartels move their drugs across move people that don't want to turn themselves in whether they're terrorists or criminals or who knows what the so the point is these are intimately related if the border patrol wasn't playing that wasn't on diaper duty with all these illegal immigrants it would actually be able to patrol the border nothing would be perfect but they do a much better job of stopping this fenthano and everything else from coming over the border and just so i'm clear mark real quick i mean without a change in policy and effectively in the enforcement of the law even if you had sent down even if we sent down a lot of national garbage bides not going to do it would help a little bit with the problem you just addressed about patrolling the border when it comes to crime uh you know it to uh the influx rather of of drugs but it wouldn't do anything for the people who are apprehended right because they're just surrendering themselves yeah it wouldn't actually help much i've talked to border patrol guys on the border and they can't arrest anybody really and even if you know what they do is they basically their eyes and ears they have binoculars and phones and what have you but if there's no border patrol agents to respond to somebody that the national guard sees something they can do about it they're not shooting people so uh really the national guard thing i mean i'm not against it but there's a limit to how much good it's more yeah marginal marginal benefit that's what i saw when i was down there too exact same thing mark it's going to be interesting in the months ahead appreciate you joining us we'll talk to you soon thank you with crime in the big apple continuing to rise new york city mayor eric adam's is calling the city a dysfunctional laughing stock apparently forgetting that fighting crime is his responsibility we have more on that with former m yp detective harry howl when we come back sexton available right now only on the first tv app with new york city crime up nearly 60 percent from this time last year mayor eric adam's has some harsh criticism for his own city adam's ran his campaign on the promise to slow down and defeat the crime surge and yet assault robbery and larceny still remain a huge problem today in a statement by the new york city mayor he said quote anything goes in the city of new york the most important city on the globe has become the laughing stock of the globe and the dysfunctionality of our entire city has cascaded through the country joining me now to discuss former n yp d detective harry howl kerry appreciate you being with us i'm good so what what happened here man i mean so all of a sudden the new mayor is figuring out oh there is a big crime problem it wasn't just covid causing some spike in these numbers and the city's a mess well if you read that article on the new york bloke he claims is a wartime general now but it looks more like a russian general is losing to the street thugs um is in general without air support superiority artillery which means that the perps are released without bail to commit crimes almost instantly all right he doesn't have the courts behind him so uh you know law and order is not a one-way street here you know the cops can do their job but if the courts don't do their job and these people are released again it's going to go get another gun to go and commit a crime and they're laughing at the police police officers out there who are putting their lives in danger all right and the punishment doesn't fit the risk of police officers putting to stop the crime week to date by the way we've got a chart that shows the crime rate in america's biggest city the percentage rise over 2021 robbery is up 48 percent felony assault up 22 percent burglary 39 percent grand larceny up 33 percent i mean i feel like those we're talking about year over year here harry that just seems staggering to most people when you've got uh 48 percent increase in robbery and what is going on isn't that's been uh has been four years in robbery in the east village in new york let me tell you a 48 percent increase is astronomical i mean a lot of people think robbery somebody when they break into somebody's home no that's when somebody comes up to you on the street puts a gun in your face or a knife in your face and says give me a wallet that's a robbery all right and that is that's what's making duke city so damn dangerous because not only that when you when you're a victim of a robbery that you've got a good chance of being killed or shocked so they really need to do something about these robberies and if you don't put people in jail for robbery they're just going to go out there and keep on doing it anytime they want to so yeah tell me this how how can you actually start to turn those numbers around specifically on robbery i know you said you worked in the east village of the of new york city on that specific issue so what do you do i mean when you got you got a robbery problem the mayor says all right harry i want you to run a task force i want you to bring the robbery numbers way down how do you do that well based on the environment that we're seeing today uh you know you're a robbery detective you investigate a robbery or you go out there looking for robberies in progress you catch a couple guys you lock them up you put them in jail you got a good case what happens is though if these guys get out right away you know if they're not uh you know if they're not have you know have bail for like a half a million dollars uh you know these guys aren't staying in so what what happens is these guys go back out and come in another robbery and come in on the robbery and come in the robbery we have revolving door justice like we did back in the early 80s and we're back to that now the cops can do only so much buck you know we can keep on making a rest we can keep on the rest of the guy you know five six times in a seven eight month period but if the courts don't keep them in jail all right and if they don't pay for their crimes there's nothing police can do it's a joke here's mayor atoms and i think this was a surprise to some folks that it's already gone to this point he says that the state level is doing their job on violence but they need federal help here federal government help to deal with violence in the city of new york watch this one we're dealing with a sea of violence and many rivers are feeding uh you know this sea we're going to do our job but we need help on the federal level and harm in our federal entities assist we're dealing with the first law are you surprised that he's saying well what's he talking about i mean you must be wow what do you think about this we're dealing with the sea of incompetence based on the democrats he's not saying that his people put this uh that the democrats created this problem in new york and like i said you know it's a sea of incompetence you know back in the early 80s when uh or actually when julie and he came in we didn't need the feds to come in to change things all right all we need to do is be able to have a government that back the police courts that back the police all right and we took care of the problem we took care of it pretty quickly i don't know what he's talking about and wanting federal aid or federal help for this because we really don't need it we need competency is what we need do you think that adam's is he's only in the job a couple of months so far he's the new mayor what do you think is his process his thought process is here because he came in and there was a lot of fanfare around how he's gonna turn things around but now it sounds like he's almost surprised to find out what bad shape the city's in which to everybody's like you're the mayor and you ran for mayor how is this a shock to you oh yeah you know i'm shocked i'm shocked to see that the crime rate is so high in new york even though i was a cop there for 20 some years and the fact that the last mayor totally destroyed the city how was it a shock to this guy you know why will he point the fingers at the city council why doesn't he point the fingers at the courts you know why because they're all democrats and there's buddies he is slowly becoming a politician a democrat politician and if you're so worried about six and seven-year-old kids getting shot out there like happened last week all right then you better get the courts behind us and bring in that district attorney and give him a good talking to because he can put the blame on the courts and he can put the blame on the city council and that's why the crime is so high in new york do you think harry going forward this year it's going to at least start to level off and maybe start to get a little bit better or do you not are you not seeing the moves necessary for that now like i said you know there's a general without power you know he's out there um you know we can make all the arrest you want we can take we can take 500 guns off the street tomorrow all right the fact is there'll be 500 more guns on the street and they can go out and buy another gun right away and come in another crime uh it's it's becoming wallace new york city and if you don't take it into hand and the city council don't take it on the hand and the courts don't take it seriously i don't see any changes none buck until the courts and the city council and the state are behind him none harry appreciate you joining us thanks for the perspective thanks for having me buck today president biden said that access to monoclonal antibodies isn't partisan it's medicine remember when republican governors pushed this life saving treatment earlier this year and biden revoked his use what's going on here we'll get into that and more and quick hits dr fauci is out of hiding and coming in hot with bs like americans must be prepared for another round of restrictions oh we also said there's no doubt covet lockdowns work uh yeah there's tons of doubt actually they didn't work totally false but we'll get into all this and quick hits look i told you little tyrant fauci isn't done with you and i wasn't kidding he's now emerging again with the same broken bull crap ideas and you see that there's covet cases there's this new ba2 variant of omicron and cases are rising fauci is out there saying americans need to be prepared for another round of covet restrictions watch we need to be prepared for the possibility that we would have another variant that would come along and if things change and we do get a variant that does give us an uptick in cases and hospitalization we should be prepared and flexible enough to pivot towards going back at least temporarily to a more rigid type of restrictions such as requiring masks indoor ridge restrictions like masks indoors which have never worked and never worked this guy is a lunatic what's he gonna say his entire career came down to this one big challenge and he failed miserably that he's the worst public health bureaucrat in the history of possibly the world i gotta say that no instead he's gonna say do more of what i've already told you even though it didn't work because i said so fauci also said this that there's no doubt that covet lockdowns worked watch this one do you think two years on that they were worth it or were they too severe you know i don't think we're ever going to be able to determine what the right balance is i think the restrictions if you want to use that word which i tend to shy away from lockdown there's certainly prevented a lot of infections prevented a lot of hospitalizations and prevented a lot of deaths there's no doubt about that no doubt no there's actually tons of doubt because people have done real studies of this looked at the data and there has been no discernible benefit really whatsoever from the lockdowns they were never even full-on lockdowns there were partial lockdowns a lot of people were considered essential workers continued to go about their day-to-day lives and still contract the virus bring it home to their families look at the numbers of infections of seniors including in nursing homes look at all these different things and to believe that lockdowns work is to live in a fantasy land and that is what dr anthony fauci wants you to continue to do or you can accept you can see the reality here which is that the fauciites were wrong all long about everything and that they have been absolutely unwilling to be held accountable for those failures and now they want to do more they're not done they want you to suffer more mask up peasant even though the masks didn't work and then there's the big lies that are being told by the democrat aligned corporate media and they well they lied before about hundred biden's laptop and here's uh what the reality is right now the washing post this is their headline here's how the post analyze hundred biden's laptop two experts confirm the veracity of thousands of emails but say a thorough examination was stymied by missing data yeah this is another way of slow walking toward reality here with the laptop was real everything on it now they're saying all we can only tell some of it's real all this stuff on there is real okay there's no reason to believe otherwise they have hunter biden's laptop and there's real corruption there hunter is under serious federal criminal investigation right now and there are some people who say he could even face criminal charges it looks like he may have engaged in tax evasion money laundering failure to uh to register as a foreign agent these were all remember that last crime too doesn't sound like a big deal it's a big deal under trump they went after anybody in trump's orbit for fair of violations for an agent registration act so will hunter biden's son be treated to a different standard of justice i think we all know the answer to that joe biden says access to monoclonal antibodies is in partisan it's medicine watch this one the monoclonal antibody for example they've helped save lives this isn't partisan it's medicine but congress hasn't provided enough money to keep purchasing these monoclonal by uh by anybody remember there's some republican governors who are pushing monoclonal antibodies and biden actually revoked their use earlier on now exchange is tuned on that no doubt because you know who cares about what actually happened they've got a narrative to run that's ever since i told the line the no spin news is up next shield's high so there's a battle going on right now that may be the most important fighter countries had since the revolutionary war once again it's about our freedom people like you and me are being canceled our speech increasingly censored by big tech and corporate media can't let that happen time to fight back please stand with us and support the first tv be a part of our team dedicated preserving the very essence of who we are free americans"
