    "text": " Welcome back. Joining us today is former police officer and author of Beet in Black and Blue, being a black cop in an America under siege, Brandon Tatum. And to keep them in line, we have political commentator, mother, and wife of Brandon Tatum, also a savage on Instagram, Corinne Tatum. And makeup artist and photographer responsible for my billboard. You may have seen it across the city, Austin Ride. All right, guys, we have a lot of topics to get to. I want to jump right into this. I did my monologue on vaccines and kind of this weird push. Always somehow ends up with children needing to be inoculated. Tell me you saw the story of this woman Marabelle Duarte. We're going to watch her giving this interview. Imagine your kid just comes home and he's like, yeah, they offered me pizza and they gave me a shot. Like, I just don't know where this happens. Actually, I do. It's Los Angeles. And we can watch the video of her speaking about the incident. The lady that gave him the shot and signed the paper was the one that told my son, please do not say anything. I don't want to get in trouble. LAUSD says student matters are confidential and wouldn't comment specifically, but did say it's safe schools to safe steps incentive program is meant to ensure several steps are in place for vaccinated students to receive prizes. Duarte says she's not against the vaccine. She's vaccinated herself, but it's different with her son. In regards to my son's health, I am against it. Because he's got some underlying conditions that concern you. Yes. He has problems with asthma and allergy problems. I mean, I'm just going to talk about are we in control of our own children? I can't even imagine my reaction. I'm so happy this did not happen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. If that happened, it would be like Armageddon. All of LA would be in the ocean. The whole city would be toast. There's no way. If my mother was that mother, I always say the scariest bear is not a brown bear, black bear. It's a mama bear. 100% true. That would be terrifying. For pizza. There's something that's so predatory about this because it's like when you're told, like, oh, if a stranger is on the park and offering your kid candy in exchange for something, this is a bad thing. And now you have people at school saying, hey, I have some pizza, but don't tell your mom knowing that this is wrong. Don't tell your mom or I could potentially lose my job. Right. I think a more compelling prize would probably be video games at this point. I think my oldest son wouldn't go for a piece of pizza. But I think that I would be very upset and I would go down to that school and they'll get it for me because there's no way in the world that you should be pushing this on children. There's no reason. The parents should be in full control of what happens to their children at the school. And if they cannot uphold that, then I'll have to take my kid out of this school for sure. Yeah. And I think just increasingly what we're seeing is just that the system, like they really do want full control of your children. And as I mentioned in my monologue, even New York City attempting to pass legislation that would give the teachers rights, saying to a child, you're not old enough to decide. And then you know that child is not old enough to decide at 12 years old. Their mind thinks like this, I want a piece of pizza. I want a piece of pizza, so I'm going to get this shot and be fine and bring it home to my mother. It's really, really scary and parents have to pay attention to this because we always talk about LA and New York and they're extreme examples. But really, this is the mold for what they want. This is the mold for what the left wants all throughout the country. Of course, Republicans are fighting them on this, but they basically see these cities as model cities. Oh yeah, I mean, I live there in LA. What? I know. What? What? I'm trying to get out. But I tell people all the time, if they think that I'm irate or angry or too passionate on my social media about what issues are going on in the world today, I think it's because they don't live in New York or LA. And if you were there, you would probably be just as angry and upset as I am. Yeah, it's ridiculous. I'm so sorry to hear you live there. I know. Maybe we can rescue you. All right, guys, we happened to an update on the story. Since I acted it out last week, it turns out shockingly that the jury found Jesse Smolik guilty. I'm really surprised, which is like crazy. What are you? What are you racist clapping about? This man was abused by two giant black Nigerian men who looked white at nighttime while he was trying to get a sandwich. With a maga hat. I mean, obviously we don't know what time they're going to give him. I think he needs to see jail time. Absolutely. He should get the maximum penalty. I think it was three years or something like that. It could be the max. I think that should throw the book at him. It's nowhere in the world that a grown man in 20, that's just in 2020-2018, should be promoting fake hate crimes. That tells you, in my personal opinion, that the state of racism in our country that racism is such a dying sport that people have to recreate it, and especially an unbelievable story. How could you be more stupid? Nobody's two white guys. At least he could have picked white guys to beat him up. He picked the blackest dudes he could find. Let me just get some my skin brother or something. I know, I know that's so true. The more African accents. The worst part to me is that he didn't apologize, and he's still doubling down that it wasn't a hoax. That's the only reason I think he should see jail time. He had come clean instantly. It was like, listen, man, this was a bad idea. I want a backpedal here. It didn't happen. I don't know what I was thinking. I would be so much more lenient and be like, listen, actors are crazy. He got a little fired up. He held on to this to the end. The acting on the stand of still saying, I'm the black, I don't forgot what he said. I'm the black, this and that. As a gay man in America, I don't want this to happen to me. I was like, he's still trying to push this racial narrative. He should pay the price not just for his lies and his actions, but for the damage he's done long-term with racial issues. He's making things so much worse, and this has been going on for three years now. You know what I did? I actually came out of the bathroom the other day and I said to my husband, I just wanted him to know because I looked at this picture and I was just like, look at the mother and his sisters holding. If my husband ever baked a hate crime, I am not holding his arm into the car. I'm going to be like, lock him up. Lock him up. He's a liar. That's a famous actress, by the way. His sister, Journey, she's a very famous actress and she's very respected. I respect her. I've seen tons of her movies. It's like totally embarrassing what he's done to this family and people should not be standing by him at all. But I want to remind you guys of the part that no one's talking about, which is that before he faked the hate crime a week later, a week prior to he wrote himself a letter to the set-up empire and this is the letter. Okay? Oh, I remember that. First off, the fake postage stamp in the corners has a madah. Right? Justice Smolt. Look at how he, this is like crazy. Look at how he wrote. Like, just he's small at empire. We're in like a six-year-old. He drew a penis on the right hand side and it says like you, dub, black, you know, expletive against gay people and a gun pointing to his head. Like, guys, this is not normal behavior. An adult sat down and did this and mailed it to himself. This is some like Whitney Houston. Like the zodiac killer. He sat in front of a magazine and cut out the letters and mailed it. This is not, he should have put insanity and I would have believed him. Was that on like BLM's Pinterest page? I don't know what's worse. You know, him actually doing this of being so bad at it, man. I mean, it's unbelievable. No racist is going to do this kind of stuff. I'm honestly shocked they didn't take the celebrity route of like he's dealing with mental illness and he's checking himself in because he's going through some things. He's just doubling down. Like, no, I'm a victim. Right. No, I'm a victim. Right. I hope they have arts and crafts in prison. He seems to enjoy it. He's good at it. And we have to do this flashback of the celebrities who walk into this ridiculous story. Let's just watch them. Let's just watch celebrities be celebrities. This is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred, racism, and bigotry. In this situation, hate won't win. It will not. You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck. He had bleach poured onto him. This needs to stop. He will forgive these people for what they did. And, but he won't. And we cannot forget their actions. And hopefully, this just opens up, opens up people's eyes. That's just what needs to stop, man. Damn, why are we going backwards? But I don't like that it's being put out there in the media that this is a possible hate crime. I think that even so is a seed that makes people feel like, well, is he making this up? Well, what is this about? I don't like that. Like, don't put that in people's minds. This man was hurt. He was injured and he needs justice. We have a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not what just happened to Jesse Smalllet is a hate crime. It's absurd. This is a debate. Ow. I just want to say this in case anybody has missed it. It's 2021. Anytime somebody tells you a noose was used to kill someone, you can just assume it's a lot. I mean, if this just doesn't happen, kids are not tying nooses. This is like the smartphone generation. Like, nobody knows if it's a tie a knot or their own shoes. Anytime. You know what I mean? Like, Sweet. You didn't need to take a mental health day? I almost did. I almost did. That noose triggered me. The attacker. The sous string around his neck that they call the noose. It's just so ridiculous. I know we're all getting so sick of the news. Every day, the left is trying to make another money grab. Whether it's looking at your accounts or taxing your unrealized gains, there's no shortage to their creativity when it comes to taking your hard earned money to fund their expensive, radical agenda. I've been telling you guys for a while now, you are making a mistake if you are not diversifying your savings. Start taking control of your savings by holding gold in a tax sheltered account or holding gold in a safe at your very own home. Get it from Birch Gold, the only company I trust and recommend. When you buy gold from Birch Gold by December 23rd, they'll send you free gold for every $10,000 that you purchase. With thousands of satisfied customers in A plus, rating with the Better Business Bureau, you can trust Birch Gold to protect your savings. Text Candice to 9898 to claim your eligibility for their free gold with purchase offer by December 23rd. That's Candice to 9898 and protect your savings today. By the way, that last actress Ellen Page is now Elliot Page and which reminds me of this next story that I want to get to, which has me infuriated. Pennsylvania University of Pennsylvania transgender college swimmer, a man, dominates the competition. He woke up one day and realized he was a woman and he has broken every record instantly. Just every record instantly has been broken. He dominated the 500 yard freestyle preliminaries and he set a new Ivy League record, set a new program, meet and pool record in the 1650 yard freestyle, finishing more than 38 seconds ahead of the second place contender. 38 seconds ahead. I was a competitive swimmer for 14 years. I don't know if people know this, but 38 seconds is unheard of. If you break a record, it's like by milliseconds for a second. 38 seconds just shows there's a biological difference. This just doesn't happen. And so the school has been telling the athletes, the women are very upset. The young women are upset, obviously. Imagine working your entire life toward a sport and then it just gets completely dominated. And they've been saying, hush, hush, don't say anything, but these girls are actually speaking to the press and saying, this is ridiculous. The coach just wants to win. And the transgender athlete is just doubling down being like, no, I've been taking some pills and it's making me not as fast as I used to be. Not as fast as you used to be as a male, but 38 seconds faster than all of the women. How is this okay? It's not. Right. And it flies in the face of these people saying that when you take, I don't know, whatever hormones, whatever that diminishes your physical ability by a lot. If you look at his records as a man, I think in 2017-18, I think he was competing as a man, you look at his numbers as a woman and they're not that different. I mean, he was, he still is a competitive person. He's been living his life with testosterone flowing through his body and competing in training. And then all of a sudden he tries to be a woman. It bothers me that people are so selfish. If I was a man and I wanted to be a woman one day, I would, if a man, I would play on a stage now. But now, if being a man, if I wanted to be a woman for some odd reason, I would respect women enough to say, okay, I have an advantage. Let me sit this one out. I chose- And don't get into sports. Just don't get into sports because you know you're going to dominate in sports, especially because you dominated as a man. Yeah. I'm impressed that the women are speaking out because we saw Harry Potter. I want to bring that tweet up. I want to take a roll up. Yeah, bring that tweet up. She's the only one who's spoken up about this stuff and she's been canceled. So I'm very impressed and I'm glad that these women are, and these schools are finally speaking up because in these college campuses these days you'll get kicked off. So kudos to them for speaking up because this insanity won't stop until real women speak up and say, no, no, no, that's not a woman, that's a man. Right. Who thinks he's a woman, which is fine, but you cannot compete with women because you are not a woman. Right, exactly. So good for them. But they're having to speak up anonymously because they're in fear of losing their college career in sports and that's terrible. Yeah, they shouldn't have to be anonymous. Yeah. This is crazy. And yeah, JK Rowland had this tweet, wars piece, freedomously, re-ignorance is strength. The penis individual who raped you is a woman and she's referring to an article in the UK that says that police are now logging rapists as women, like women raping women when it's actually men that identify as women that are raping women. And this is like this is peak lunacy. And I always say to this, like where are the feminists on this? Like the whole idea of feminism, oh my god, men are trying to erase women. You quite literally have a circumstance where men are actively erasing women. They get rolling, got canceled. And the people that she made multi-millionaires, the women like who claimed to be feminists, and I called out Emma Watson this weekend because Emma Watson, oh my god, is she a feminist? She's written articles about how she refuses to let a man pay for her meal on a day and everything she does is about women, women, women. The very first second that the trans men came out and just attacked JK Rowling, trans women. I don't even know, I can't even know, men came out and attacked JK Rowling. She instantly took their side and said, oh my gosh, she's transphobic. No, she's standing up for women and shame on you. And every single feminist who self-proclaimed feminist who is silent on this issue when real women are being silenced and being threatened having their entire livelihoods destroyed in this mort's category because of men.

Speaking of frauds, Corinne, would you like to tell us what happened with Project Baratas this over the last week? This is my expertise. Yes, Project Baratas did some undercover videos and exposed a fraudulent candidate. I guess we can say he was running for Congress in Arizona and they went undercover and he just let it all out about how he really felt about it. Let's show it. Let's show it. So what are your thoughts on the election then? Do you think that Trump won? No. Do I think there was fraud? Yes. Okay. But not enough to overturn the election. But I'm not going to broadcast on everywhere. I'm a Republican moderate Bible policy. I'm not part of the country club in the Pino gallery. Have no intent to be. Guys, we need guys that are going to or girls to implement policies and bills that are going to make America stronger. Continue what Trump's starting. More than Michael will endorse me, but I'm not going to publicly advertise it. People didn't like it. Not in Arizona. In private, Alex has no problem. Not only lambasting the party and the views he claims to associate with, but better yet, he still takes their money. What I say with my own campaign is different. Granted, I don't want to seem arrogant. That's why I listen to what my counsel tells me. That's when they say go get an endorsement from somebody and say, all right, cool. No, I don't have respect for Canada. Someone's anymore. Well, I take her donation and take her donors absolutely, but it goes no further than that. Yeah. I would never invite her to a Christmas party. So sad, so sad. I know update. I literally have no idea who he is. And I had other Christmas plans, but this is this is something that I have been talking about. This is literally your work on Instagram. This is what Corinne does if you follow her. She just takes you through every candidate that is a fraudulent Karen to show you that Republicans are giving money to all of these candidates. And lately, they do a flashy ad. They're walking down the street. They say, I'm going to fix this neighborhood. They know they have a virtual 0% of winning, but they're able to basically afford their lifestyles in the meantime. And this has been this is what the whole Kimberly Clasek thing was about when I was trying to tell you guys look at her FEC filings. This is absurd. Money with all of this $8 million that she raised went somewhere to defunct LLCs. I mean, it just looks completely shady. And she then put together a entire, what is it, when read? What is her? A pack. Red Renaissance. Red Renaissance is the pack that she put together of which Alex Stovall was a candidate in the Renaissance Shocker. And I've been telling you, this is a new Republican scam. Black candidates that are running in districts that they cannot win who are taking your votes because they go, oh, I'm a black person. So you must want to vote for me because I'm saying all the right things. Yeah. And this whole messaging thing, these are the same cowardice people that say, run and take them. And Ken is on his message and his off. They didn't. Well, have a message. I have a message. I believe in what I'm saying. This fool comes on this on the stage and doesn't even believe what he's saying. One minute he's behind the scenes having a certain mentality. Then he comes out in public and lies to the public. I cannot stand people like this. And that's why I haven't decided to run for office because I feel like I'm going to go too hard. And people are probably not going to vote for me, which is fine. But at least I would be honest about my affairs and about the way I think and not try to create some image so people can like me and not be a real person. We have too many of these politicians like this out there. First of all, Candace, you're definitely always invited to our Christmas party. Thank you. I'm just looking for somewhere to eat Christmas. Yeah, I'm glad Project Veritas outed this guy. And there's so many more Republican candidates. And we hear all the time about the Major Williams. Oh, yeah, I do. Yeah, I was I do this so much and I enjoy it that I was actually sued for defamation. It was a frivolous lawsuit. He dropped it a month or so later because it was ridiculous. But we complain all the time about rhinos, rhinos, rhinos, that when people such as myself or Candace expose them before they're in office, we get so much flack for it. Oh, we're all on the same team. We're not on the same team. Yeah, we're not on the same team. They are not on our team. We need to expose them. So we know who to donate to, who to support, who to vote for. So check FEC reports before you donate, before you support. You want to check FEC reports with the fine tooth comb, follow their social media. We need to vet these candidates. I'm so glad. Also, check the candidate viability. I mean, if they're running in a district and you know that this district has been Democrat for the last 3000 years, right? And you know, by 95%, you know, 95% Democrat, this is likely a scam meant to just get you to fund their lifestyle for a little bit. And we need to do better of communicating on that. I do want to get to Hillary Clinton because she is a sad human being. She had a masterclass and I actually honestly can't believe this. I really, I can't believe that she did a masterclass and she actually decided to read her would have been presidential speech if she had won. What is the masterclass? I have masterclass losing. Yeah, exactly. I mean, what is the masterclass? The masterclass covers the power of resilience. She is resilient. She is a cop. She is a master at resilience. Not let's go away. And let's just watch a little bit of her her class. No. This was what I intended to say if I had been elected in 2016. My fellow Americans, today you sent a message to the whole world. And she cries and she reads her her speech, which I'm surprised she hasn't thrown out yet. It's a lot of years. Austin, you're in. A burning ceremony. Yeah. You're picking Austin on Hillary Clinton. I kind of thought that you guys maybe made that little video montage because it was so comical. It's not actually going to get people to sign up. But I think that was the actual masterclass video. Yeah. It's kind of weird now. Yeah. I forgot about her. You're still out crying about your loss. You lost a long time ago. Yeah. We're thinking about another election, but I'm never going to let this go. At my funeral, I want y'all to talk about Hillary Clinton should be in prison for what she did with those servers. I don't. I do not understand how you have a server in your house. You know, I'm a former police officer. There's no way that anybody else in the general public can send and receive classified information on a private server that the government didn't know about and don't go to jail. So she can forget about her little masterclass. I want to see her go to jail for what she's done. I think we should watch. Yeah. I think we should see more of it. I think let's watch more of her class. Didn't, as you know, write a concession speech because even though we had a lot of bumps those last 10 days, I still thought, you know, we could pull it out. So I worked on a speech that really was about my journey and had a real emphasis on my mother's life and journey. I dream of going up to her and sitting down next to her, taking her in my arms and saying, look at me. Listen to me. You will survive. You will have a good family of your own and three children and as hard as it might be to imagine. Your daughter will grow up and become the president of the United States. God. I honestly think Trump broke her. Like, I actually think like Trump legitimately broke Hillary Clinton. Like, I don't, I actually buy that she's not over it. I actually buy that she reads that speech at least once a week. Yeah. And Jack and so, because I've been reporting that she's calling around donors talking about whether or not she should run in 2024. So this could potentially be a lead up. Because suddenly she's like back in the press and she's kind of talking about the bat. She's in the press talking about how Trump is dangerous. I don't know how he's even in the White House. And we know that Biden is not going to be their candidate. Obviously, he's completely senile and they can't fake the COVID thing twice. They can, but they won't fake the COVID thing twice in terms of not seeing their candidate. Are they potentially considering getting behind Hillary Clinton for a third time? I think it'd be smarter than that. Well, I hope they do. I just want her to disappear like the Clinton Global Foundation disappeared. Yeah. That's exactly right. They did something. I'm going to go away. They did something going, I don't know. You know what? I think I like her. She's grown on me. You know, she just, she won't go away. Now she's a part of me. And I want, I would like to see her lose a third time. You know what I mean? And I'm totally for it. Do you want to be a hero for the holidays? How about getting your loved one a new iPhone?

And I asked him about her and Hillary Clinton and potentially running away. And that was actually off-camera. He said he'd love it. He would absolutely love it. If she ran again, if he's running. So first, I want to show you guys a brief clip of that amazing interview that we got to sit down, which we'll be premiering next week. Trump, like you've never seen him before. Take a look. Welcome to a most special episode of Candace. Each time that I've interviewed President Trump, they have never told me that I am not allowed to ask him anything. And today, I want to talk about some topics that are on I think everybody's mind. Where do you stand on these vaccine mandates? What's going on there? You talk about mass, you talk about mandates. Julian Assange. Edward Snowden. I mean, you could have had a chance to part in these individuals. You have two sites out there. Anything that looking back, you think, I got that one wrong. Did you get COVID? Uh, no. Did you have the vaccine? No. No, kidding. I'm very impressed with you. I don't know. Alec Baldwin. Is he going to get arrested? I think he's crazy. This is the toughest question I could possibly ask you. Tell me one good thing Joe Biden has done in office. She's done this before. Right. He is completely unscripted. It's one of the things that fascinates me about him. What you see is exactly what you get. All right, Mr. President. Conversation was amazing. I don't think anyone's ever asked him those questions. I was really intent on not having it be an interview where I was fawning over Trump because I was saying like too many people understand what Trump are just like, I love you when you're coming back. And I'm a left. They're just trying to like smear him and liable him. And I wanted to ask him some really tough questions. And then at the very end for funsies, speaking of Hillary, I got him to sign this Newsweek. Not him president. You remember they went to the press early and because they knew she was going to be president speaking of fake news and they printed these. And so I got my hands on one and I got Trump to sign it and he chose to sign it directly on her forehead. I love him. He's a savage. I love him. I think you should send that to her. I know I should know. I'm going to frame it. I can't send it to her. So very quickly, guys, in terms of the candidates that you're seeing that could potentially be running the 2024 field, who would you like to see Ron Austin? I will start with you. Oh, I mean, it's not. Would you get behind a president? Hillary, would you get behind a dead Joe Biden? Well, definitely. I would always love Trump. I mean, things were great. But Ron DeSantis is a great option. I love DeSantis. Make America Florida. I just want to know when the Democrats who claim to be the party of diversity are going to stop running old white people? Yeah. They tried Kamala. Give them a break. They tried Kamala. Oh, she'll be useful. And now they're trying to get rid of it. Yeah, I don't know. Trump always loved Trump. But same if not Trump, someone like DeSantis. Maybe who's a little bit more refined that the media can't fool everyone with. I mean, maybe. Yeah, but sure. Yeah, I have to say DeSantis as well. I really like Trump, but I think he served his purpose. I look at Trump as the battering ram on the SWAT team. He rammed the door, caused chaos. And everybody else needs to come in and smooth. There's a couple things that I didn't like that he promoted. I don't like that he promoted these vaccines. It really bothered me. I don't like the way he went out of the Oval Office. I felt like he kind of went out with his tail, took between his legs. And so I want to see a new candidate. I want to see somebody that's a little more balanced. It's not arguing with people, arguing with the media during the pandemic, things like that. However, if he runs in 2024, I'm voting for him. So, you know, these are my suggestions. But if the man runs, I think he did a tremendous job as president when he was in office. I really would like to see his policies move forward. And I think that may be possible with some ideas. Yeah, I actually asked him about the vaccines. It was actually really funny. He was like, are you vaccinated? I was like, no, he was like, oh, give the program. I mean, yeah. And I did. I pushed him on that. I asked him about the vaccines. What do you think about the vaccine mandates? I mean, these were questions that no one was asking him because there was just too much fawning over him. I totally agree. I think Rhonda Sandis has been amazing, but I am I would never want to lose him as a governor. I think that he has done more for the country as the governor of Florida than he would do if he was in the White House and didn't have the House in the Senate. And when we see this amount of federal overreach, actually, we understand how important that gubernatorial powers are and what they've been able to block on the federal level because the states are in check. So I'm like, very invested in the gubernatorial races now realizing that that that is why the Constitution works. The states rights are our guard against a corrupt federal government, which is what we have right now. So yeah, it remains to be seen. We will see who runs in 2024. I think we can expect a few people. I mean, I think we will see a Nikki Haley run in 2024. I don't think she will get. I'm not crazy about that. Yeah. I don't think many people are, but I think she'll run. And other than that, it's kind of going to be a surprise. Did Trump tell you if he was going to run or not? He did. And you will have to watch the interview. And I will say that there are election laws that guide when he's allowed to officially say he's running because then they start to watch how your campaign spending and everything. So they have to be very careful and healthy. Keep your MAGA hats ready to. Yeah. But I would say, I would say keep your MAGA hats because it looks like maybe potentially he's definitely not not running. Thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace.
