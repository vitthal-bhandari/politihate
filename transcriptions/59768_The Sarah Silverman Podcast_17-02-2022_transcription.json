    "text": " Oh! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, I wanna see. Hey. Hey, yeah, fuck up. Hey. Hey, hi everyone. It's your best friend, Sarah. You know, we did a final workshop, or fourth workshop, of the musical, The Bedwetter, before we start rehearsals in March. Just to see it on its feet, you know, with actors and everything, and figure out what we need to cut, and what songs we need to change, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it was really good. And it's just so interesting, because the characters in it are, I'm not in it, you know, it's about the year I'm 10. So it's a little me, and a little Laura, and my mom, you know, at like 40, and my dad, and my nana. And it's weird, because I'm doing research on my mom, my own mom, to like fill out this character, make her three-dimensional, and you love her, and real. And to do that, I have to depend on a lot my memory. And my sisters help with their, you know, what they remember, and it's just so interesting how siblings have just completely different childhood experiences, and that our memories, all of us, are distorted, you know, because they're a child's perception of what happened. And then kind of interpreted through our now adult eyes. And it's some things we see things more clearly, you know, as adults when we look back, like for instance, when I grew up, and I was little, my friends' parents would always assume I was from New York, or ask if I was from New York, and I'd say, what's New York come from here? You know, New Hampshire. And as an adult looking back, I know that that's because in New Hampshire, you know, young parents just thought like, oh, Jews are from New York, and they're not wrong entirely. Most Jews in the world, I think, live in New York. So it's not like anti-Semitic, but it's a little bit, you know, maybe ignorant. But it's just funny looking back on it and realizing, oh, of course, that's why they thought I was from, we were from New York, even though, you know, my family's from New England all the way, my mom and dad. And sometimes our memories are just completely warped. Totally, total cognitive distortion, you know, just by the time that's gone, the, the emotion connected to it, the dynamic of the relationship you're remembering, all that stuff. So all of this to say, one of the actors in the workshop who was playing my mom, a wonderful actor named Donna Vivino came to the first day of the workshop and she said, I was researching your mom. And I found this video of her receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award in theater as a director. And I went, oh, God, oh, that's online? Like I couldn't believe it was online. But my memory of it, because my sister, Susan and Laura and myself went, flew home to New Hampshire to surprise her and to present this award to her at the Palace Theater in Manchester, New Hampshire. And she won this Lifetime Achievement Award for directing, you know, like 50 plays in over 25 years. And we presented it to her. And so when I'm talking to Donna, my, my historical reaction, you know, if it's hysterical, it's historical, I learned that from my shrink, um, was, oh, God, oh, God, that's on the Internet. Like, that was so awful. She was awful. Like my memory of it was that she went on stage and was gracious for about maybe a minute. And then the rest of the speech was like this bug that was in her head from something she was rehearsing currently that she was directing where like some actors showed up late. So she was like, you know, if you're fifth, if you're not 15 minutes early or 15 minutes late and what you're telling your fellow actors that your time is more important than their time. And like she went off an insane tangent when she should have just been like, Oh, thank you so much. I appreciate it. And I remember standing behind her and just with my sisters, just seething, just going like, say thank you and get off stage. But at the time, you know, growing up, I had in, I was an adult. I was a young adult. I was already a comedian at the time. I was my dynamic with my mom was very strained. I mean, we were close and yet we were there is just a lot there. Like I would take Klonopin to fly and to see my mom, you know. So I had a lot of shit there, you know. And I knew I, my mom was became sick in the mid 90s and was sick for 20 years and finally succumbed to her illness. And over those years, I would think I know that when she dies, all the wonderful things about her will rise to the top. And I was right. But before she died, I tried imagining that she died so that I could get all those good things that about her that rise to the top and cling to them. And it just doesn't work until it's really true. It's just terrible. Anyway, now I'm digressing because I've become my mother. But here's my point. A couple of weeks later, I looked it up on YouTube and it was there. Beth Ann O'Hara, you know, whatever receives lifetime achievement award or something. And I watched the whole thing as a matter of fact, Rory, who's never met my mom, was so excited to watch it and he cast it on the TV, you know, how you can do. And it was. God. It was amazing seeing her so alive and so with it and funny. And my memory of it was totally wrong, totally distorted. She was, yeah, she talked a little bit about, hey, you know, when you go to rehearsal, you got to be responsible and be on time. But for the most part, she was gracious and she was funny, really funny and off the cuff and loose and it was incredible. And I know that not many people have that opportunity to get to see a memory so that was so distorted and to see it and realize you were so wrong. What other memories have I totally distorted? I know that just must be being human, but I what a rare opportunity. It was just, it was very profound for me, kind of, you know, that's why I'm fucking videotape your parents, videotape, get a VCR tape and videotape them and find a camera that takes that. No, but record your parents all the time because, um, well, I'm from a generation where I don't, you know, I have like two videos of my mom and I fucking cherish them, you know, so anyway, my mom was a character. She was very, she was a perfectionist. She was a great director. I really think she could have been if she was supported, if her art was supported in any way, she could have directed on Broadway, you know, she really was, but she was such a perfectionist and it almost, you know, to it to almost like a horror movie degree, you know, she was always, you know, this is a mom thing, but always correcting my grammar, always correcting my diction, which is probably why I overdiction overarticulate words sometimes. But I fought it too. But really like a horror movie, she would correct things, you know, like, um, she had a, like any book you would open, there were like corrections in pen, really like a, it felt like a horror movie. Like she had a, um, you know, a guide to Santa Barbara. I mean, in pen, she had corrections, grammatical corrections, you know, it's wild, but this was her. She couldn't help but she corrected everybody. She felt she was helping. I remember it. I would only, my best friends were twins, Lori and Amy Martin. And I would go, well, me and Lori and Amy are gonna, and she'd go, it's Lori, Amy, and I, and I couldn't stand when she corrected me. And I would fight it. I would find very creative ways to fight it. Like I would say, me and Lori and Amy and she'd go, Lori, Amy, and I, and I'd go, me and Lori and Amy is a friend of mine. She has a really long name. She's a foreign exchange student. Me and Lori and Amy and I are going to the mall. And at least she'd laugh. But then I learned about the notion of poetic license. And then every time she corrected me, I'd be like, that was poetic license. I'm choosing to express myself that way. I constructed that sentence specifically to express the way children of my age speak. Art, I'm an artist. It's poetic license. Anyway, let's take some calls. You left me a message. Now I'm playing it for the world. Let's hear some voice. Hey, Sarah. My name's Angie. I'm Australian, but calling from my home in Dubai. I have loved listening to your podcast and keep thinking that I have to call to ask you a question. But the one thing every week that just makes me smile and laugh is when you say the word Rory, which is like obviously quite tricky for you to say or, yeah, just like seems to hold some challenges and you repeat it again and again. But I just wonder if Rory has a name for you at home, like when you're around the house, or if you call him something else when you're at home, or do you like make your way through the word Rory like a hundred times a day? I'm just really interested in you. Make me smile and laugh every week. Okay. Love you. Angie, it's pretty boring. I think if anything, we call each other baby or I call him roar, but it's not easier. Rory is hard. Roar. Roar. But I do it. I like it. Roar. He calls me Sarah. He just calls me by my name. But to me, it's so exotic because he's got that long island accent. He says Sarah. It makes my heart skip a beat. Sarah. The only one. I'm sorry. I burped a little bit when I did a burp pickup. The only what? The only one in our household who has a nickname is Mary because when Mary sometimes Rory will make her like a whole meat meal, like he'll make her turkey or he'll make her chicken or something like and he'll she'll just pound it. And then she gets really lethargic and like because we'll have a hike and then he'll feed her. And that's when we call her meat meat. You okay over there? Meat? She's like in a meat coma. All right. I'm sorry. I can't breathe out of my nose. I must sound extra extra nasal here. Some ads. Churology. I've had issues with my skin. I have terrible melasma.

What I really love is how reflected you are and I think that leads to really wise decisions and wise ideas and I could really use some wisdom. Okay. A little over a year ago my husband and I split up and we're in the middle of the divorce and that's fine. That's all behind me. But when we got together 10 years ago, I was seemingly healthy and in the middle of the relationship I ended up being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. So now I'm in the dating world and I've never had to come out to anyone before. He was there and he was part of everything that was happening and anyone knew who comes into my life isn't. So I just have to let them know, hey, this is a part of my life and it will affect our relationship but I don't know how to do it. It's not something you spring on someone on the first date. The same time I have scars. So if it's not winter, people are going to know that something's up. So yeah, maybe you have some ideas or a little bit of wisdom for me because right now dating kind of sucks. Thank you. Hi, you know, I'm guessing that you have since figured out your meds, you're on some kind of regimen that you're handling it. So I'm going to base this answer on that assumption. You know, hey, some people need insulin for diabetes. Some people need lithium for bipolar disorder. There does not have to be shame around this. And here's the upside dating wise, I think. I feel like kind of stuff thins out the dating pool and that that's really a good thing. I think you want a dating pool made up of people who are going to love you warts and borderline personality at all. You don't have to tell them on the first date. You can. You could. Because it shows them it doesn't have to be a big deal and it gets it out there. Listen, being a vegetarian is a deal breaker for people sometimes, you know, like everyone's got a right to be like, I don't want that. I'm a big meat eater and I don't, you know, I don't want to have to adjust my eating habits for this check. Fine. You want the people who are like, yeah, okay, bring it on. You want to narrow it down. I think is this analogous Rory and I were watching a episode of Golden Girls. And on this episode, Rose was dating a man who was a little person, but she was like, it doesn't bother me. I love him. I think he's going to ask me to marry him and I'm going to say yes. And I think she was probably feeling herself like I'm, look at what a good person I am that I see through his little person. Yes. And I love him. I'm going to marry him. But then he doesn't ask her to marry him. And she doesn't know why. And she asks him and he said, uh, you're not Jewish. Everyone's got their things. I think you're perfect the way you are. You're taking care of business. You're taking care of yourself. That's big stuff. Maybe you'll find someone with a similar condition. Maybe you'll find the perfect yin to your yang instead. I say narrow it down right away, but also do what you got to do. You know, you can, you can dip your toe in first. I don't know. You know yourself better. And by the way, you're not alone. There are a lot of people in your position. Don't feel alone. Okay. Do that for me. Don't feel alone. You got a lot of people who deal with mental health shit and I'm one of them. Good luck.

My name is Zach and I'm calling from New Jersey. I am a huge fan of the band Frightened Rabbit. And I remember exactly what I was doing when I found out Scott Hutchison had passed away. And man, that was very sad. But soon after that, I discovered an album called Tiny Changes, which includes a roster of brilliant artists. You among them performing covers of their favorite Frightened Rabbit songs and your version of My Backwards Walk, which is one of my absolute favorite songs, is so beautiful and haunting. I was just wondering if you would be able to speak about your relationship to the band and how you got involved with that project. Thanks. There is a whole story. When I was at the Sarah Silverman program, one of our writers, the brilliant Harris Whittles, would make me mixes and music mixes, iTunes mixes. I don't know what comes after CDs, whatever. Yeah, iTunes mixes. And he introduced me to so much great music, including Frightened Rabbit. I mean, I'm trying to think of Whittles, Mates of State, Stars, tons and tons of music that I really love. And I just fell in love with Frightened Rabbit and especially this album, Midnight Organ Fight. So anyway, I'm sure many of my listeners know about Harris Whittles and he died. And I ended up becoming a little bit friendly with Scott Hutchinson from Frightened Rabbit. Not really close, but he would come and play songs at my monthly show at Largo and we just liked each other and I'm a big fan. And we bonded over depression and stuff. And you know, everyone's in a while, if I'm in a really dark place and I feel just completely alone in the world, I will send a kind of ominous flare out, you know, on Twitter or something. And he always picked up on it. And I did that and he had he direct messaged me and sent some beautiful things and I should look it up, but it's gonna make me sad, but I won't cry because I'm on Zoloft. So yeah, that was the March 3rd, 2018. I had written something and he direct messaged me and he said, just saw that sad song post. Hope you're okay, Sarah. And if not, well, it's okay to not be okay, right? I said, yeah, I'm okay and not okay. It's heeding on the edge, but I will be fine. Thanks, friend. He said, I know that place. People can say all the nice things they can think of to you. Or really, we're just waiting for that morning where we can pull our socks up extra far and stroll out the door grinning like the boss of a nut milk company. Take care of yourself. I thanked him. That was March 3rd of 2018 and then on May 9th of 2018, he sent up a flare, but I didn't see it in time. And then when I did, I direct message to him and I said, Scott, are you okay? The whole world is worried. Please be okay, my friend, because his brothers were looking for him. And then I just, you know, I was like, please just have unplugged for a few days. I'll show you my boobs if you're alive and okay. Both boobs in one labia majoras. Or is there only one blah, blah, blah, whatever. I'm like, I'm going to read what I, but anyway, is this corny that I'm like reading a back and forth or I don't know, but this is where I was. And he had died, you know, in just the most poetic and least poetic way because he in midnight organ fight, he has a song floating in the fourth, which is just beautiful and sad and heartbreaking and then back to beautiful. And it's about, it's about kind of fantasizing about just jumping fully clothed into the fourth, which I believe is like a river in Scotland. And then that's what he did. Anyway, so before that he had reached out to me somewhere between those texts and he said that he was, they were doing us like a celebration album for the anniversary of that of that album Midnight Organ Fight. And would I sing this song and I said, could I sing backwards walk because it has a special meaning to me because my friend Harris who died is the one who introduced me to the band and with that song on a mix. And he said, yeah, you know, my friend Katie Harkin is doing it, but she said that you could sing on it with her. And I was like, amazing. Like, I just want to be on it. You know, you know, and so I, it's really Katie Harkin in the cover album version of backwards walk. It's her sound and her vibe. And then I'm kind of doubling her voice and like harmonizing in certain parts, but it's really, it really sounds like one voice. And it's, she's amazing too. You should check her out. Katie Harkin. Uh, what a jumble of words and a messy answer. And anyway, I will always feel guilty, really guilty for him reaching out and picking me up and me not getting to him in time. You know, everyone, when a friend dies, kills himself. Um, you know, the, your instinct is always that you could have said something to keep them from doing it. But I really feel that way. And so anyway, poor me. No, but, um, but that's that story. And thanks for calling it. And I, if anything from this mess of an answer, um, please check out, um, frightened rabbit. And I love that album. There are so many great albums, but just start with, here's some songs, Modern Lepper. You know, the thing about his songs, they sound, they're, they're small and intimate. And then they get, they feel almost, and, and themic. Is that a word? Some like, you know, that big kind of like marching through the streets of Scotland with your boys kind of, I don't know. I've never been to Scotland. That's what I imagine. But I love that kind of Scottish, uh, folk rock. I don't know what you'd call it. It's so fucking good. Anyway, uh, sorry for that mess of a response, but there you go. I got through it and let's move on to another call. Hi, Sarah. This is Sarah. I'm calling from Salinas, California. I'm calling because I saw an ad, um, for an upcoming show you're in where you're the only woman comic out of eight. And I just was a little bummed out by that. And I was wondering what your reaction is when you see, um, a lineup where you're the only woman comic or where there's where you're far outnumbered by men. Um, not nothing gets the men. I'm sure they're great, but I was wondering what your take is on that. If you're so used to it by now that it doesn't even phase you or if you ever speak up about it or, um, just wanted to get your take on that. Um, a big fan I met you a few years ago after a show and you were like the sweetest, nicest person. So big fan of the podcast and see you later. Bye. Uh, I didn't even realize that. I think I don't really see, you know, if I'm like available to do a set, I just write it down in my calendar and I, I don't even know what the lineup is, but, um, or I'll like retweet the lineup, but I'm not really looking at it. Um, you know, my instinct is like, that's rare. There's usually more than one woman on a show. I, I notice more if there are no people of color on a show, that's really rare now. You know, and I, it, it sticks out more like a sore thumb to me. Um, the only woman out of eight, uh, yeah, I, you know, a part of my instinct when you're talking was like, yeah, I don't know. It happens sometimes, you know, it's, I don't think it's not like how it used to be. But then I think I guess it would never happen haphazardly that seven women are on a show and one guy. So that's probably a very good point you're making. And, um, I don't know. I, I do, you know, I do like to speak up when I see things, uh, arrive, but I, I really didn't even, um, pick up on it at all. I don't even know which show that was, you know, I come in around the time of my set. I go up, I do my show and I split unless I have friends there and then we hang out because I, that's my favorite thing. But, uh, lately I, you know, just kind of go in and out. I'm not really looking at the lineup, but yeah, that shit's important. And, you know, I think of women comedians as like kicking ass right now and for the past, you know, like 10 years, but I also could be a celebrity ignorant, you know, like, um, I, maybe I'm not seeing it. Like I know when I was starting out and there, I would know more famous comics and they were it's like being a pretty girl or like everyone's so nice, you know, so I'm kind of uber aware of that maybe being the case, you know, but boy, it's, it's definitely different than when I was starting out, you know, um, when I was starting out, it felt like being a woman on, on a comedy show felt like, um, when you're a woman joining a pickup game at the Y of basketball, you know, that you get, you can feel the guys like rolling their eyes and thinking of you as a burden instead of an asset and just needing to prove yourself so much more than the others, you know, and, and the pressure you put on yourself, it's like, you know, you miss a basket. I'm talking about both things at the time. But it's like when you're a woman playing with guys and you miss the basket, it's like missing a million baskets and, you know, you forget, I try to remind women when I play pickup games and there's another woman on there, I go, just look at all the shots they're missing before you worry about your own playing, you know, be less hard on yourself. They're not, they're not hard on themselves. They, you know, they, you know, they might get mad if they miss a shot, but they keep shooting. I feel like women, you miss a shot and you go by probably shouldn't shoot for a while. And that's not how you get better. That's the same with comedy. Um, and, you know, so when I was starting out, yeah, if there was a woman on a show, it'd be like, who's ready for a lady's perspective? They would definitely not have two women on a show. And if they had to have two women on a show, they were definitely not allowed to go back to back. They would have to have some buffer of real comics between them. My, my truest answer on this is, I'm not sure I have a beat on this. Um, I might be out of touch. Um, I don't know what it is to be a woman starting out in comedy today. Did I use that right? Bead. I, cause I, it's, I, my instinct would be I don't have a beat on this, but something in my, if I take the limitless pill right now, there's something in my brain saying it's like bead or can someone look that up? I want to know this once and for all. I have a beat on this. I have a bead on this bead. What does that even mean? I'm, I'm seeing it's be a T beat. I have a B really? According to, you know, just googling. I think you're right, Sarah. I see a to get a bead on means to thoroughly understand, appreciate or comprehend someone or something. Be a D. Oh, like a bead. I get actual bead. To have a be a D on get a bead or draw a bead on it. This in this expression, the term bead comes from the former name for the little metal bump on the end of a gun barrel. Oh, which helps the shooter aim. Oh, that's what, that's what that is. It's the little gauge, the little bead on the end of your gun so that you can aim. I was right, kind of right. I was right, kind of right about the word bead. It's not beat. You were wrong, Raj. I was right. I was right. Raj was wrong and Diana corrected both of us. I feel like I've done all I can on the answering your question. Are we still talking about this? Oh, yeah, we were, you know, we were talking about this too before like, they'd have all women comedy nights or like all black comedy nights like freaky Monday with all black comics or, you know, different names that were just like instead of just all sorts of comedians, like, I don't know, there was an all Asian show at the improv years ago and I was there just watching and I can't remember what they called it. It was something silly, but Kevin Carioca, who's a comedian from San Francisco was there and he goes, why don't they call it improv is Asian? It's at the improvisation. They could call it improvisation and I, for some reason, always remembered that because I thought it was genius. Oh, sir. I was remembering like you told me about some 90s themed woman show you did that had like, so while ago, it had like the dumbest name and I cannot remember. Oh, that's in New York. This is a very old reference, but it was an all women comedy show. You know, you just feel like it's a freak show. Like it's anyway, it was an all women comedy show. Otherwise in today's days would be called a comedy show, but it was called. Okay. It was called leave it to cleavage, which is a play on an old black and white TV show called leave it to beaver. You don't even have to change it. Leave it to cleavage. I remember one time at Largo, there was this comic from the 80s who was huge in the 80s and he hadn't been around in a while and he was in town and he asked to be on the show at Largo and Flanagan was like, sure. And I don't know if it was my show or maybe it was TIG's show, but it was just all women on the show. It wasn't an all woman show. It just was like, you know, it was just mostly women on the show. And I don't know, he seemed really taken aback by something and I couldn't figure out why. And TIG was like, he's from a time when it feels really weird to be on a show where the comics are mostly women. And I was like, oh, yeah, like that must be odd for him, you know, because he's from such a different time, you know, I mean, so I think it's gotten leaps and bounds better, but it's it's probably still worse than what I see. Try to be aware so I can help make things right. I prefer being on shows with women, but I love my fellas too. All right, what else? Hi, Sarah. My name is Daniel and I'm a huge fan. I love you so much. I think you're absolutely brilliant. I was hoping you might be able to clear something up for me because I think I might be wrong about something. So the other day my boyfriend and I were talking and we were talking about how to us, it seems like all of the comics who've really made it in the industry that use their platform in an activist kind of way for like the greater good tend to be more of the female comics. And we were talking about people like you and like Kathy Griffin and Margaret Cho and Janine Garafolo, just to name a few. But when we were talking about the male comics, the only name we could really come up with was of course George Carlin. So I don't know. I mean, I thought I hope we're wrong. I mean, and I hope it don't sound sexist by saying it, but it really feels like to us that the female comics tend to use their platform for more good and the male comics are just, I don't know, they don't seem to be as interested in using their platform in an activist kind of way. So I don't know. I thought, well, Sarah knows everybody because you're a comedy legend. So I thought you would have an interesting perspective and if I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong. But I don't know. Can you help us out? Are we wrong on this? I'm just not sure. Thank you. I love you so much. Bye. I don't know that that's true. It's very interesting observation. I suppose you could say, you know, in some ways, women comics, non-male comics are braver because they have to kind of endure more, maybe not so much anymore, you know, hopefully to break through or to stay. But I don't know that that's true. Just off the top of my head, I could think of Patton Oswalt, certainly Judd Apatow, Rob Delaney. I mean, that's just off the top of my motherfucking head. I think there are a lot of, you know, Gee, Russell Brand, John Stewart, you know, watching him speak at Congress on behalf of the firefighters from 9-11 who were getting very ill and sick and had no support. That was that's really something to see. You could probably watch it on YouTube. Wow. But those are the names that just pop out of the top of my head if I took a few minutes. I'm sure I'd think of more. There we go. What else? Okay. So I love your show. I remember one of your jokes, right? It was about how squirrels often lose their nuts. And I thought that she was so hilarious. And I'm just imagining like all these squirrels in the forest, like gathering nuts and trying to find them and then hiding them and then losing them. And I just thought those hilarious. So I'm sitting here watching this nature show and coming to find out is true. I know. Watching these squirrels as they gather their nuts. And he can't find the nuts that he left over the damn, you know, the autumn and I was spraying it. He's looking for them and he can't find them. You know why? It's because they turn into freaking flowers and trees. I know. Yeah. The show is called Tales of Nature on HBO. First episode. Check it out. Love your show. Thanks. I fucking love that. Ugh. Amazing. We do these things in our lives that we just, you know, we think are like that our lives are about like love and job and, you know, or legacy or this. And, you know, we, I think that we're, this sounds religious. Well, we're serving a bigger picture, you know, like, like how squirrels are planting trees. They don't know they are. They think they're keeping you from stealing all their precious fucking acorns as if anybody wants their acorns. No one wants your acorns. And then they, when they look for them, they can only find like two out of every 10 acorns because their real purpose is not stockpiling acorns. It's planting trees. I love it. This must be the case for us too. It has to be. We must have like some macro purpose to the micro things we do. This is, it's very interesting. You know, we've been watching this series called Tiny World and it's about all the teeny, tiny, sometimes even microscopic animals on earth and it's unbelievable. And Paul Rudd is the voice over on it, the narrator. And then I realized, or I didn't realize, Rory was like, they had Paul Rudd do it because he's Ant-Man. And I was like, oh yeah. But he's great. It's so fucking unbelievable this thing, Tiny World. The world they live in is so different from us, but like, is it really? There's this teeny, okay, there's this teeny tiny kind of bee, like way, way, way smaller than a bee, like almost, you can't see it. And it goes into a flower and it takes the pollen and rubs it all over them. Why? Because it attracts the female of that species. So it's like cologne, they're smearing all over themselves. So while they're doing it, they're doing it to get laid slash find a partner or whatever. And then they fall into the flower, like deep in and they have to like squeeze themselves out through a tiny hole. And by doing that, pollen like sticks to their back and then they go to the next flower and they're fucking pollinating. But that's not their intention. Their intention is bee pussy. I just love it. They think their purpose is bee pussy, but it's pollination. Like squirrels planting trees. Humans must also be servicing something beyond what we know, you know, unbeknownst to ourselves, bigger than ourselves. You know, we may think that we're here to create a family or procreate or to fall in love or to have a legacy, you know. But really I think we're here to just like take dinosaur bones and turn them into fuel and have the industrial revolution and create machine and robots and then go extinct. So this is me saying dad, I'm winding down this is the end of the show. Subscribe, rate and review wherever you listen to podcasts. Check us out on YouTube. If you like watching with your stupid eye holes and you can see my pretty outfits. All right. Bye. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Fuck up. Hey."
