    "text": " Thank you for listening to this podcast one production available on Apple podcast and podcast one Your life your country your listening to the Laura Ingram podcast This economy has got to work for everyone and right now We know that it isn't and it's gonna take all of us coming together to make sure that it does necessary to almost include God of persona and a legito the state economy But I see it almost as a result necessary to most include God of persona in West Road democracy okay that among many moments in the Democrat presidential debate was Revealing on a whole host of levels. We have Beto O'Rourke Talking about the economy as if it's I don't know if it's like 2001 or 2000 after the You know internet crash like what economy is he talking about? It's not working for it's working at every Level for every ethnicity at every part of the United States the economy is on fire So what exactly is he talking about and and then the Spanish? I'm sorry if you're gonna speak Spanish At least sound somewhat native Your Spanish is terrible. Corey Booker's look at Beto O'Rourke Was like the most searched look Single freeze frame of the entire debate hilarious But I mean Beto Rourke's not gonna be president. It was just embarrassing Do any of you find yourselves? wondering How is it after two and a half years of Donald Trump is It that the Democrats have learned nothing they're not even trying to Move a little bit to the to the middle or to the issues that people care about There's not even a glimmer of recognition as to why they lost in 2016 in fact They're running the other way. They're running further away from the type of common sense practical more economic nationalist view of Thinking in my view Would your plan cover abortion mr. Secretary? I guess it would I don't believe only in reproductive Freedom I believe in reproductive justice And You know what that means is that just because of woman kill the baby or let's also not forget No, just for the baby community a trans community Core doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose and so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion Lee and Castro hearing the audience Whoop and holler again for abortion Think of a doesn't remind you of the New York vote for Late-term abortion when they gave Cuomo the standing ovation Cheering what they used to say should be safe legal and rare But now they're cheering for abortion Reproductive justice That's a chilling Crazes it not when you're talking about no rights at all for the unborn But god, this is where this is where they are. This is who they are. This is this is what they are all about I mean the only one who is somewhat interesting is Tulsi Gabbard and she should just be a Republican. I don't know why she's up there as a Democrat I mean she has some liberal views. She just have to change her mind on those views and become a Republican because she's actually an attractive Anti military intervention military vet With a little common sense just a little common sense. I'm just looking for a little common sense at this point My plan and I'm glad to see that senator Booker senator Warren and governor insley agree with me on this My plan also includes getting rid of section 1325 of the immigration and nationality Yeah, I'll go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation to treat that as a civil violation and Pay a fine for a citizen challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of second 30 So just so you understand this means Coming into the country illegally Means you essentially pay a fine So we're giving away residency in the United States For a de minimis fine. That's it So that's the cost of citizenship now that's the privilege of us citizenship residency all the people across the globe who worked for years To play by the rules and apply legally Okay, they're out of luck or they're made fools of I should say it that way They're just made complete your you guys are complete fools Julian Castro would make this like J. Walking J. Walking across the border improper entry by illegal alien any alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time replace other than designated by immigration officers eludes examination by inspection or attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation shall for the first commission of any such offense be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than six months or both So it provides for a fine or as much as up to a six months imprisonment as it stands now Which in my mind, this is too light the statute that exists is too lenient in addition to that he ends up clarifying that everyone I mean everyone Should get a pathway to citizenship you talked about putting people in a path to citizenship We're here without documents would that be something immediate are you saying those all people in that category should be given a path to citizenship? If you have not committed a serious crime then I think that you should be put on a pathway to earn citizenship If somebody has committed a serious crime, of course, we should punish that. Thank you. This Means that any someone who commits let's say to DW eyes or let's say you got into a simple bar fight, okay bar fight maybe a knocked a guy unconscious Maybe hit his head. Maybe you can't move now That's not a serious offense. That's a first time misdemeanor assault Now you had couple DW eyes until you have the third when you get seven people dead in New Hampshire See in any more interviewer or any host worth his or her salt any moderator of a debate Said would have said what do you think about the guy who ended up killing seven people in New Hampshire over the weekend? He wasn't deported after two misdemeanors and a class a felony Do you think that was wrong? What about the girl who was raped and repeatedly in Alabama? The man was arrested had deported been deported twice came back into the country illegally. What about him? Yeah, the moderators were just it was embarrassing no one answered questions for the first hour Every time a question was asked There was just a stump speech There was no answer to most questions It was bromide after bromide after bromide after cliche after bumper sticker out of statement That was out of touch with reality. I want to thank all of our great sponsors including GenuSell Delta animal rescue and sheaks because they help provide this podcast to you free of charge Every week you're listening to Laura Ingraham podcast and I'd have to say the race to radicalism on the left and last night was quite something and I think the interesting thing that emerged is that a non interventionist former military that Tulsi gabbard ended up being the most searched name During the debate according to google Someone that most people don't know Who came across you know, look, she's not conservative But she came across on a few issues as somewhat reasonable and she didn't come across as anti-american or negative on american history or the american understanding So what does this tell us join joining us now as pat b canon conservative commentator columnist author? um pat uh your quick take on last night Well first you've taken my quick take My title my column tomorrow working title which I just started on It's memo to trump trade bolton for Tulsi I thought You know, they kept her out of her first half, you know, and I was I had predicted to newsman That she would make a real splash here and she would take up the foreign policy issue With her unique perspective from the democratic party standpoint And she hadn't had a chance and then in the second half I thought she did remarkably well with the time she was given and she introduced the uh the whole idea of foreign policy, which was pretty much Eliminated from the debate, which is crucial. So I think what she's done She won the washing examiner bowl the drudge bowl a lot of folks have praised her performance And I think she's achieved the key thing that she had to achieve law Which is move herself up from 1% or wherever she's at To 2 3 or 4 so that she gets into the next round of debates And I think she's accomplished that and I think she's going to get a real response It's only a partial slice of the nation, but she impressed an awful lot of people Right. I thought it was a good debate. I I was interested in it and told us a lot about that party I'd hate to be a hedge fund operator up in New York if they did elected Oh no, this is they all go to the wall That or or they they they they free the illegal emigrants from the detention facilities and put the hedge phone Fun people in the detention camps. That's kind of exactly right and there it could be any blankets No, no blankets. No, no aluminum foil blankets for them. This is Tulsi gabbard. Of course from hoye last night We have to bring our truth home from We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives We've spent so much money money that's coming out of every one of our pockets money that should be going into Communities here at home meeting the needs of the people here at home We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began She sounds like trump sounded in 2016 unfortunately trump didn't pull the troops out Well, exactly right. I think see I think she's done it. She's got a number of things that Again, she she put herself on the map. She there's a lot of comments about her People are saying she did it. She's one of the big winners, but she's got a unique position She's introduced foreign policy into the democratic debate I think they're gonna folks are gonna have to talk about it more And I think she's gonna get even if it's not majority support even if she doesn't win I think she's gonna influence the debate so it was a great victory for her But I should mention there are others and i'm not big fans of them I thought did pretty well from there standpoint and one was married to blasio I would have the first question I would have asked a blasio Now, now you know why you know why I I I guess it's colored by the fact that when I go to New York and these Blocks that used to be clean and safe When Rudy juliani was mayor or even bloomberg was mayor are filthy filled with human waste and You know disgusting and the pot smell everywhere. So I you know The first question I would have asked him is why do new yorkers hate you? That's what I've asked I would have asked him so yeah, he blow vated on and he's you know He's he's a he's a big guy in a in a tough talker But I don't know I found always focused on people have a chance of winning and and he doesn't he has no chance of winning But yeah, I mean I think you know the one that gives an awful lot of talk and I think more than anyone else Was beta and cori booker But you know cori booker is I mean he seems like a nice guy But you know, can you remember exactly what he said What the exact point he made? I mean he goes on and on and on and then you in and then better. I thought was on defensive all night long And but I do think lisabeth let me talk about the number one folks That's a lisabeth one. I mean she dominated the first half hour of the debate. She made her crisp responses She's energetic. She's she's got her lines down It has a real appeal to the left of the party But I will say this is a general election candidate And she has the best chance to be there She lacks feet if you will the extra dimension I mean of course trump had this extra dimension from the apprentice and from being a character and And a big figure and everything and she seems like almost pure ideology an extractive ideology And you need some persona personality And range I think candidates do we all for me I mean when ronald ragan walked in the first time he was elected I mean he came to a governor's conference and his cowboy hat and boots and all of this You know, and he just made a tremendous splash And for a candidate to succeed To be elected president united states I think they need something of that extra dimension You know, I think you're right Donnie dohich from msnbc. You remember him pat he was on donnie Yeah, he they he was on last night after the debate and said this I do not believe lisabeth warren on stage with donald trump eats him And I think if we're honest with ourselves and we look harder ourselves I think a lot of people agree with me When he can blanket lisabeth warren as a socialist and he's on stage with her The democrats lose I still in my heart of hearts don't see any of the united states tonight. That would be trump You know, I know donnie pretty well. I mean I worked with him up at msnbc for years Uh, and I don't usually agree with him, but I think he's I think he's dead right here I mean i'm looking at the state. This is why let me go back to to the de Blasio Whatever you think about it. He's a big presence on stage. You know, he's angrized committed And and and there's a difference to their size of a guy. I'm not He's What he's popular figure in new york city perhaps But you know he's somebody who would when he came out on stage, he would say this is going to be a heavy white fight And I think if you that's lisabeth warren as I say, you got to get beyond the you know the neo socialist ideology You know government we're going to do this. We're going to pay for the kids. We're going to take care of this We're going to tax the rich all of these things. She doesn't go beyond that and this again Let me get back to tolsea gabberd who is physically a very very attractive woman And she looks like you know and it looks very bright and she's crisp And she's talking about different things. No foreign policy getting our troops home from war She's been a you know an officer over there and uh kuayd and iraq And so she's got that she has an extra dimension. I know she's a started at 1% But I hope for the sake of a you know a really interesting election That she really rises up and is in the semi-finals if you will the democratic nomination run Well, I think again. I said to my producer this morning tell it tells a gabberd should just be a republican I mean she just she should just say you know, hi And a lot of these other issues the the democrat party has gone so far left. I can't really Can't really relate to them. I'm I'm seeing where the country is and I'm gonna run as a republican or I just don't see her as a democrat today. I really don't I don't see her as a You're getting a nomination now No, but I do see me in terms of the debate which I'm interested otherwise, you know, we're all I mean there was no at the end of the debate They asked everybody what was a great threat and I think the majority said china and climate change Although de Blasio said Russia because they're interfering with our democracy Which wasn't much of a good answer in my judgment. It was different And the one fella said trump and things but they talked to me when you talk about charlie you're talking about foreign policy And there was really there was really no focus on it last night But again, I think if there's a focus on it tonight, it will be because of her By the way, we have other news that we're gonna get to pat the supreme court with john roberts voting with the liberals Held that the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 census Um does not violate the constitutions in numerations clause or the sensus census act But that did the district court was warranted in Remanding the case to the department of commerce to provide a non-pretextual explanation for adding the question Um, so in other words, it's not a it's not a it's not a victory for the conservative juris. It's not a full victory for the left but john roberts voted with the liberals on this so I think the effect of the decision. I think the census I think the question regarding citizenship cannot go in and Uh the july 1st. I think is when the the census has to be printed So the census questionnaire has to be printed or something's going to the printers probably july 1st It was a defeat for trumped in the colors department. Yeah. Yeah, so we got I mean, how is it that the liberals never ever They never evolved to a more originalist understanding of the constitution But our people always except for the stars like justice thomas Um, they you know, our people now, you know, just seem to one after the other uh evolve to the left You know, I wrote something on that. I went back to all the supreme court justices appointed by democrats and there weren't that many it was goldberg and fordus And then you get up to uh all the way up to Carter. I don't think got any you get up to clinton you get uh, you get roost pader ginsburg and you get kagan and you get uh, Sort of my or It was not a single democratic liberal who moved away from the liberal position But you get the republican appointees three of nixon's four nominees voted for ropey wait We know about suitor, you know about the the other republicans uh john paul stevens and the others who have gone south It is remarkable. You're right some of ours a significant slice cars turn into moderates like with like uh saner deo connor and some of them go left flex like sooter And john paul stevens And it's it's remarkable. I I think it's so you effect the culture which is clearly moving lefward And uh and the starry decisis the you know take the warren court Decisions and make sure those stand but you're right the uh the supreme court has moved the country steadily Loughward and we've had many great justices appointed or not many a number of them Like scalia and thomas But overall elito but overall Uh, that's not the case. This is the disappointment with the supreme court on the part of conservatives There's been In effect since we used to since uh since we had all uncle or a warren on the bench No, it's it's and and brett kavan on a number of decisions has been a complete and utter disappointment Uh, you know, it's look. I think it's the human condition, right? It's it's easier to be liked Then to be friends. You're in this city and uh You don't want to you know, so you don't want somebody throwing a salad on there or something when you're going into the breast You know when I say pat if they throw food at me. I always like Please do you remember i'm gluten-free. Could you make sure that? I told that to niele forage pat I told that to niele forage and when I was in london Uh for the d-day stuff I I met with him at a pub and I said next time they throw a milkshake with you Brat you should have a straw in your in your coat pocket pull it out and sip it Sip a little bit of it from your lapel and say I really prefer strawberry I mean, it's just you just have to laugh like the trump baby balloon if I were trump I would say I love the baby balloon because I love trump and I love babies So I love the trump baby balloon. He should just adopt it at his own as his own then they won't fly it anymore And it be put up on his foreign trip, son. Yeah. Yeah, he should just he should fly his own trump baby balloon It'd be hilarious that I would just because they're also ridiculous They're not these are not serious people that the power of satire and ridicule as pat knows because he's so funny Uh, it's just you know, there's the awesome. Anyway, I want to get back to the democrats for a moment because uh, of course, um The democrats have to say That the economy Is no good despite the right track wrong track numbers which just came out that show incredible improvements since obama Um, with people more people thinking now that we're going on the right track than the wrong track as compared to obama So this is what some of them said about today's economy. Let's listen When you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else That is corruption pure and simple. We need to call it out We have people that work full-time jobs and still can't Off make a living wage. It is about time that we have economy that works for everybody Not just the wealthiest in our nation right now. We have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes Uh, what are they talking about the economy after the internet crash in 2000 like march 2000? Kids unbelievable when you get Hispanic unemployment and african-american unemployment and white Unemployment at their lowest levels almost in 50 years And you've seen the steady growth of the economy under trump And he to talk about it as though we're in you know, 1931 or something like that is just preposterous But again, this is what you know, it's what speaks for the democratic part is this ideology I mean the the anti-corp. I mean look i'm not you know, sometimes you know, i'm You've got a populist streak in me and and i'm not i'm enthusiast to these transnational corporations But they act as though the the capitalist system is somehow the enemy of the american people and the american nation and those who succeed most are the worst enemies And it's it's remarkable, but i think again When will this before and does that in the context of a democratic debate and a democratic audience? That may come off very well But when you go out into if you've been into a debate with trump and you studies and she starts that and And his answers about the unemployment numbers and how well we have done And the american people i think will understand that is the polo show You know that this is not this is not 1929 Yeah, he did that on sunday with uh steffin opelous i believe it was or was it chuk-tah i guess And he's like like look at this chart the chart shows that the economy this is a chuk-tah the economy Has been improving since obama and trump this is like stuff trump knows okay trump looks and goes oh really where's that chart for Gdp and where's that chart for confidence and right track i mean Where the other charts and actually matter and you know chuk-tah's like wait is there a producer in in my ear can give me give me a rejoinder to that They know they don't have they again these aren't serious people these are people who google before they You know get on air and and they They're going to try to tell us that up is down and left is right and it that just doesn't resonate ultimately But i think what does resume back resonate back to tulsi gabberd pat Is this idea that america is funding the world As we have men and women Deficating outside about 200 miles from 200 miles 200 yards from the capitol, which is what we have So what what what's going on here with that? Well, this is this is something this argument's been going on since Since the end of the the end of the cold war about america's foreign policy having won the cold war Why didn't we just and having seen the soviet empire? Collapse in the soviet union breakup art into 15 pieces Why didn't we tell the europeans look our job is done? We've defended you for all these years Now europe is your responsibility many times more richer and potentially more powerful than russia So you're going to have to undertake this and tulsi gabberd has reignited that debate i think and moving frankly with the trump presidency There's a mean while trump speaks correctly i mean we got as many troops in the middle east now as we'd had when he took office And more are going there and we're we're very very close to some kind of collision with iran Which i don't think trump wants and the iranians don't want and we don't want So i think kulsi gabberd is really reintroduced this issue uh from the side of the democratic party and and again trump the president has sort of having it both ways he's got the the the bellicosity And he's got the he's got no war new wars, but he had the bellicosity And we have these issues sitting out there on the table afghanistan iraq Syria yemen Libya all of these what exactly are we going to do are we going to pull out? And uh, i will say that uh that guy who was there with the ohio congressman was arguing with tolffy sim ryan You know we've got to remain engaged and there are no data about it if you pull out about Understand the teleband are very likely to take over after a so-called decent interval But we can say that always every time america leaves another person's gonna take over. Yeah, well, okay, so then we're never gonna leave anywhere Well, I think that's exactly right and and you know, this is it goes back to the situation We can front it when we would mix in in vietnam You say if you pull the american troops out That you've got to you're taking the risk of having a holocaust there in kambodia, which did occur And i'm having a just a massive takeover and murders of all our friends and allies And south vietnam and in laos Which is what happened in a million boat people in the south trying to see and people look at the consequences of pulling the plug And there's a real hesitant to do it And I think that affects the pentagon today in the state department Everybody knows the risk you're gonna take if you pull out And they're not willing to pull out No, every day they don't and no one wants the narrative to be You know the last helicopter Yeah, the last helicopter out of cobble Under x you know under what whatever president they just they're petrified of it Um, if you could give trump advice pat in the next you know this next year and a half before the election Uh, just campaign advice. What what would it be? Well, you know I think the I think first is I mean, and this is more tactical than strategic Well, strategically, I would say you know stay out of a war if you can avoid a war And I don't think the Iranians want a war but the country doesn't want to want another war and I would stay out of the war Technically, I would just let the democrats drift further and further to the left You know collect the string on what they're saying and what they've got in mind Put it all down on tape And then as he kind of it emerges, I think really zero in if it's a this is a referendum Of versus trump versus no trump. That's the real risk for the republicans given the controversy surrounding the president His poll numbers and he's not gotten over 50 percent, but if it's trump versus You know socialist Elizabeth Warren, then you got Donnie Donnie George Donnie george's thesis becomes operative So if you get down to if I think trump can beat any one of the candidates. I've seen it's out there right now And so I think it's going to have to but it's going to have to wait till the wait I think until somebody emerges And then really as I say Collect all the things they've said and promised so that you make it a contest between what we've got And the socialism and all the rest these people are promising And what they're going to do leave them the borders wide open And what they're going to do to the economy and what they're going to do to tax rates for corporations going back to 37 And what they're going to do to taxes on the well to do a successful america And do all and I think you've got a tremendous case But it's when you got us versus them other than us versus us That I think you'll do better And pat I I have to say when looking at the you know the field and listening to them last night I I harken back to trump in the debate with hilary where there was just a few moments I think that defined the whole thing It was the one he said you want to rip the baby right out of the womb and kill the baby Like when he looked at he won I think he won the election just when he said that and in You know exactly writing wouldn't be and now they're worse. That's my point Now the party's even gone further than that. That's what I'm saying the democrats haven't learned much If anything, I think you're that's exactly When they're in their own group they can sit there and talk with each other and each of them moves further and further to the left And the boldest one pulls them further But they don't realize they're being pulled out of the center of politics Further and further outside the mainstream of america there with their own group And this is what happened to the democratic party in 2016 when they suddenly went to middle america They said wait a minute all these folks who used to be with us are gone And they thought they were doing a wonderful thing And so I think the same thing is happening now I mean it's every time somebody comes through and what they say open borders And we're not going to arrest anybody coming in and it's a civil offense not a crime just break into the united states And we're going to abolish ice And you get to me and we got this border is not simply going to be this tragic situation Of this man and his daughter by the time you get there you're going to be talking I think in 2020 about the Being survival of the united states is one nation and one people or whether we got wide open borders and anybody can walk in Yeah, I mean again Trump has like three points to make you know You would turn crossing the border into a civil J walking offense. Okay, it's basically jaywalking across the border number two Yeah, yeah exactly number two you want to kill even children who are already born and number three you believe in massive wealth confiscation including taxes on personal property federal Wealth tax on personal property, which is what they also We're trying to you know unpack after the debate in various interviews Like how would you do that would you go to people's houses and look at their sculptures or like I think most people just see this pat they're like Yeah pat they'd be going after all of your political memorabilia with ragan and nixon If it's 50 million, I don't quite reach the cut off Exactly all these all these people like soros and uh, uh, you know the disney the disney eris and they can go get all his stuff Yeah, exactly, but all these people say we need we want to be taxed more There's a provision in the tax code that allows people to actually write bigger checks to the irs So there these people are all big talkers, but they'll never just do it example for the rest of us Yeah, you go first how's that you go first pat you can and it's always great to talk to you Uh, thank you so much for joining us and we'll have you on soon in the laura engram podcast got a lot of people on the line Let's go to daren in florida who watched the democrat debate daren Tell us what you thought well I I don't really know how to explain it except for I just saw circus bus showing up and um I can I can I can tell you that I think the footrunner That's reviewing the show cori burka with the deer and they had like well this was more as i was such The boss.

This is kind of scary She's going to end up like Hillary with one of their commissioners on our back. She's not careful. Yeah, something Something I don't know she just hits it's the way she talks.

We're going to get this technical Situation fixed we will be right back That was right as my show was starting we were so happy. Sorry Happy that the shoot that our show was starting and everyone's flipping away from there to watch the engram angle Oh, no, that's that's I mean look technical things do happen and I'm not We shouldn't gloat about anyone else's technical problems Yeah, well, it could have been a wink a little wink from from up above a wink guys Gonna keep a check on you Let's see if you're on your toes But it's it when stuff like that happens as it has happened to me as a host There's just nothing you can do. I mean you're not the technical person. You can't hand I mean you're the host so you're assuming that everything is going to work out So I actually felt bad for the msm PC people they can't do anything about it's not their fault But I'd hate to be that technical director when that happened that would not be A good situation. I kept thinking of astro from the Jetsons rut ro Joe the mic The mic is look you're imagine if imagine if they said something really juicy that would have been that would have been really fun Joining us now is Byron, New York chief political correspondent for the Washington examiner fox news contributor Byron the left listening To this debate on radio and watching on television They had they probably got a little something a little taste of The issues that they liked and there was something in it probably for everyone But the commentators afterward There was a lot of negativity toward the toward the stage This was Stephen Colbert Talking about Booker and some of the others speaking in Spanish One the topic turned to the border crisis Booker took betto spanish and raised him mucho mas So it was a twist you on a order is in except out S day president. They are attack avo Ah demon avo los emigrances is in except out late where come the address there. Oh snap It is It is on it is an espanor off Or as they say in spanish group or de yviotas Oh, it wasn't that was embarrassing. I mean is it a telamundo debate or is it an emissant bc debate uh, Byron york your reaction to the pandering fest that we saw you know actually on that very issue that the spanish issue i believe Julian Castro who most people thought had a pretty good night Uh and did speak like a little bit of spanish like my name is hulian Castro and i want to be president Um, he I believe by all accounts first of all he's the only Hispanic Uh candidate in the race and he does not speak spanish So a message from hulian Castro Losing thing it's fine to speak spanish, but the language of success in the united states is english Learn it be proficient in it It will help you through your life to succeed in the united states I mean that would have been an amazing message wouldn't have been very popular in the room But it would have been true What I found sad about this whole extra entire exercise is that so many of them were making Obvious grammatical errors in english. I kept saying to my producers Could we could we master the subject verb direct object thing in english first before we venture into the world of spanish? Because that just didn't uh didn't really hold up Uh, this was a moment with elizabeth warren that's gotten a lot of attention. Let's listen Senator warne you signed on to bernie sanders medicare for all planet would put essentially everybody on medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president? So yes, i'm with bernie on medicare for all and i understand there are a lot of politicians who say oh, it's just not possible We just can't do it. It's have a lot of political reasons for this What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well health care is a basic human right and i will fight for basic Thank you Your reaction to that fire. Well she will fight to take away the private insurance of millions of americans who are happy and satisfied with that Insurance, you know later in one of his mini interruptions build a blofio Was saying that the private insurance system doesn't work for tens of millions of people well It does work for tens of millions of people and and the uh, candidate who's named gosh his name just went out of my head Um, you said look we should not be the party of taking things away from people That's not a great idea Um, you have to give elizabeth warren credit I guess when they were asked for a show of hands like who would Uh put an end to private health insurance in this company country and she raised her hand very quickly shot up Absolute shot oven most of the others did not Um, so even among this group of democrats and they you know They did go so far to the left. I mean any time you hear somebody say oh, you know Just talk about how far the democratic party has gone to the left. That's just an exaggeration That's just about the part that's gone. No, it's really true that they were there But even they would not go as far as her on that health care issue and brian it we said we said before when papi can and It seems like Literally the democrats have learned nothing since 2016. I mean Other than tulsi gabord who was good on the non interventionism and focusing on america She was doing kind of america first a version of that Last night, but other than she I don't i don't see a lot of glimmers of recognition as to why trump won and they were talking about an economy that doesn't exist They were saying they're talking about the economy like it was 2000 march 2000 when the internet crash happened I know well first of all, it's just very common for democrats to to say whatever the economy if there's a republican in the white House to say whatever the economy is is the worst economy since the great depression And that's and the thing is is that you know in 2008 that that worked 2008 and 2009 and barack obama had to do a bit terrible economic downturn But it doesn't work Now And so I think I think they're having A difficult time with this. I think there's a theme that we we will see more about when we finally see joe biden Appear and that is there is this tension in the democratic party between a desire to Restore that is just go back to the way things were before donald trump and just say oh that he's such a terrible man We made a terrible mistake electing him where it's just awful. Let's just go back to the way it was before Or we want to fundamentally transform america And there is this it's just this democratic impulse to say they want to fundamentally transform america They want to take all your guns away. They want to raise your taxes to 80 percent They want to take away your private insurance. They want to open the borders up I mean they just just want to do all this stuff and again help themselves and the It'll be interesting to see how much biden or how he balances This idea of restoration because he is the physical embodiment of restoration these barack obama's vice president Let's just go back to the way it was before january of 2017 That versus fundamental transformation Yeah, it's it's it's wild. I mean it'll be interesting to watch of what happens in this second debate, but I didn't see anyone on that stage who I think had an real chance of Being the nominee. Yeah, what beating trump? I mean trump has an answer for literally every single point that they're making I have an easy answer. I think Maybe the more I do this. I mean a lot of my political analysis becomes so incredibly simple. Yeah, and My my analysis of this race right now is trump is big and they are small and Maybe that will change with you know trump versus one democrat the democratic nominee But right now I mean the president is just so much bigger than any of them are and I think that that voters would probably on the whole Decide to keep the president in office in that case. It's it really really Overshadows Everybody in this race right now. No, and I'm I'm imagining the debates You know, I'm imagining the debates and you know unless there's a catastrophic economic collapse. Yeah um the debates I just I think of Hillary and The moments that really stood out in those debates where he just flattened her And I think it's even easier now because the stuff he's done has worked for the most part And we don't he does have a record. I mean that's what happens when you're president and you're right about the economy. I mean if first of all democrats are going to be Just bending over backwards to talk down the economy next year to tell us that we are headed for a recession um to tell us that that Wages and income and everything's going down and that we're headed for disaster if we stay on this course and they'll they'll get a lot of Megaphoning Um in the press as well. I mean who knows maybe some indicators will go down We don't we can't tell the future but if the economy stays in good shape as it is Uh right now the president has this record and with republicans Uh, the his record on judicial nominations is you know very very strong. I mean there there You can't even find any never trumpers who disapprove of what he's done on judicial nominations, so You know, I think that um, I think that he'll have a very strong case to make yeah, and uh, we should also mention that The issue of russia didn't come up russia wasn't mentioned till a hundred minutes into the debate Yeah, so I thought that I thought russia was the big threat to the united states and china was mentioned only in passing So the biggest threat to united states were asked they were asked the old question that it's kind of the mid-romedy thing Which is who is the biggest geopolitical? adversary of the united states and most of them said um China uh one very clever one said donald trump um a number of them said climate change and I believe One maybe it was bill the blasio said russia because they're attacking our democracy so uh, russia in the sense of Um, you know fixing the election to install donald trump just didn't come up. Yeah, this is again the the word I would I would use to describe it other than circus is um disconnect It's a disconnect to the way most people live and think terry mccaulff former vajinia governor. I guess he's gonna be running again for governor Uh said this let's listen. I'm a little disappointed Uh, I think we needed to have more discussion on those issues that actually affect americans every single day We spent a lot of time at medicare for all but people sit in home and are sitting right now They're worried about their prescription drug costs They're worried about getting in a car and you know driving to spend an hour and a half to go see their kids play a ballgame We needed more discussion on those issues that affect americans Wait, I first I don't understand the ball game people are worried about driving to the ball game because of gas prices Well, I don't understand that but his point about the other issues is probably correct President himself talks about prescription drugs Yeah, yeah, and he's they just lowering the prices with the transparency provision they just did so i'm not getting that at all Yeah, so the president actually has something to to talk about on on that front and Here again, he's got Uh, he's got the economy. He's got and the interesting thing about the economy not just the ggp But he has wage growth that is so important in elections. He has wage growth really for the first time in a very long time plus judicial nominations for republicans plus tax cuts and deregulation for a lot of people in business and then we'll see what the world looks like Totally unpredictable. We'll we'll see what the world situation in north korea The middle east china etc. It looks like Byron york Fascinating. Thank you so much for your perspective From fox news in the washington examiner. Let's go to mike in georgia mike is a small business owner He watched some of the debate last night mike go ahead alaura They give a ways that they're talking about as a business person. I don't see how they're going to fund all the giveaway programs and reducing Uh the student debt and just wiping that out I've got a mens clothing store in georgia. We've been here for 45 years and i'm sure you small businesses Or benefiting from the local economy locally and nationally Wow 45 years. God bless you. That's fantastic. Uh, well, we want small business I'm i'm the biggest champion of small business in the united states big business They are going to be fine, but small business is the backbone of the united states of america and when the economy is strong For small business, which it is right now Sky's the limit for this for this great country of ours.
