    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in congratulations everyone you have made it to Friday and you may get off Monday I'll be back. I think Buck will be back early next week as you well know he is on his honeymoon with the lovely Carrie right now I will be with you on Monday even though it is a holiday for many people out there Presidents day in fact, I think we're the only show in all of iHeart that will be live basically But we will be here you may have a three-day weekend coming up I hope all of you are in fantastic moods as we roll through February. We've got a lot to discuss we will be honoring the memory legacy and impact of Rush Limbaugh during the course of this program as two years ago today He passed I know that is still a very difficult Moment for many of you and then many of you including both Buck and myself miss Russian Limbaugh every single day We will have a very timely tribute to him during the course of today's program East Palestine, Ohio continues to grow into more and more of a calamity We talked with the congressman there on Wednesday I thought we had a really good discussion with him about the absolute latest on the ground, but the response so far Definitely begs the question of what in the world is the Biden administration doing we will discuss Ron DeSantis has been branded as the new Trump even worse than Trump as we told you would likely be the case And there's some interesting data out on where people have moved basically since COVID started and I think it's incredibly telling But I wanted to start with a story that is very much a positive that I bet you're not gonna hear anywhere else Probably in media today unless a lot of people listen to this open and then they say oh wow This is a big story now. We're gonna cover it. So we're number one in Salt Lake City I love the state of Utah. I appreciate everybody out there listening to us right now. It's a fabulous place This weekend the NBA All-Star game is coming to Salt Lake City Congratulations to people in Utah getting to host a big event like that where they love their jazz It's the only major pro sports franchise in the entire state of Utah What's interesting about this is? There have been two bills passed in the last year in Utah directly related to transgender related issues I agree with both of them, but the state of Utah has passed a bill saying kids in high school Have to pat have to play against kids on the birth certificate in other words If you are born a boy in Utah you compete against boys in athletics for your entire high school career If you are born a girl you compete against girl this girls. This shouldn't be wildly crazy Right we have all sorts of designations and sports But it's designed to keep a boy from deciding that he identifies as a girl And then thanks to boys being bigger stronger and faster than girls That boy going and playing in a girls high school sport dominating potentially winning a state championship I think it's an imminently reasonable bill I think every state in the united states should have passed this same bill many have But not surprisingly many left wing blue states have not But Utah has so I agree with that bill. It was somewhat controversial. It got a lot of attention Also, I agree with this other bill that Utah recently passed Utah recently passed a bill that I believe every state should also pass if they haven't already banning gender transition surgery for minors This isn't really that radical of an idea in many states for instance, you can't get a tattoo If you can't get a tattoo Why in the world and when you're under 18 why in the world should you be able to for instance? Have your breast removed because you have decided that you are no longer a girl and you are now a boy That is mutilation in my opinion. It's certainly child abuse If after the age of 18 you decide that you want to do that as an adult Maybe you make that decision I don't think it's a smart decision for young people to do period, but That's a choice that an adult can make But banning that sort of treatment for children Doesn't seem to be ridiculous at all. You shouldn't be able to get puberty blockers for instance When you are 14 years old to try and keep you from becoming a boy or a girl as you go through puberty There is much data out there that suggests actually that if you get puberty blockers You are likely in later in life to have issue with for instance brittle bones because your bones as an adolescent Develop a tremendous amount of strength as you come through puberty and become Uh move from a boy to a man girl to a woman These are very reasonable rational. I think bills that should be passed in every state in the union So congratulations to utah for getting it done What's interesting about this however Is it wasn't very long ago that the mba pulled its all-star game And some of you will remember this pulled its all-star game out of the state of north carolina out of the city of charlotte Uh and they did it Because north carolina had passed a bill that said you need to use the bathroom of your gender Now How would you enforce that bill? I wrote about it at the time It's not as if there is someone who is standing outside of the bathroom doing genital checks Uh to see whether or not you're using the right bathroom, but the nba in 2017 Was so woke that they made the decision to pull their all-star game out of charlotte over this Uh and they released this statement While we recognize the mba cannot choose the law in every city state and country In which we do business. We do not believe we can successfully host our all-star festivities in charlotte In the climate created by the bill was called hb2 Uh, they said that they would as a result move the all-star game to a new site back in 2017 um and Uh, there were all sorts of comments that were made Uh about what a brave action that was to undertake by the nba The reason why I want to bring this up is Sometimes we don't count our victories And sometimes those victories don't even get an ounce of media attention I haven't seen anyone Writing and arguing the nba should pull its all-star game out of salt lake city over the two bills that were passed in the state of utah And I would argue that those two bills Are far more extensive in terms of their impact certainly in the world of sports since one directly involved sports Then the bathroom bill in the first place So what's going on here Why in 2017 Was the mba so bill that exists in north carolina Remember all that bill said was hey, you should use the bathroom of your gender If you were born a boy go to the boys room. You're born a girl. Go to the girls room, right? That's all it said And there was no mechanism really by which anybody was checking to see oh what genitals do you have In order for you to use the bathroom So it was primarily just a statement of hey, we think gender is is real right in the state of north carolina That doesn't seem to me to be a particularly offensive bill to be passed It doesn't seem to have some amazing amount of enforcement mechanism or anything like that yet the mba pulled its all-star game So what does it say now About how much the nba is in default Not publicly but in quietly acknowledging that they were totally wrong In that decision that they are showing up in salt lake city in the same year where two very restrictive bills That basically do the same thing if not more than what was passed in north carolina and they aren't even saying a word about it They're not protesting They're not demanding that the bills be repealed. They didn't threaten to pull the all-star game out of utah over The fact that the bills might be passed No player to my knowledge has spoken out about this at all. No owner. No commissioner No one in the mba is even mentioning the laws that were passed in salt lake city Now again, I 100 agree with what salt lake city did but don't mistake what's going on here Because on monday we had a conversation where I said look what you have to recognize out here Is that many of you don't have an issue with sports You have an issue with the media that covers sports and some of the executives that make decisions Associated with sports those people are woke Most athletes by and large are not woke because sports are the opposite of woke It's a meritocracy best man or best woman wins. It's highly competitive. There is no equity There is no equality The goal in sports is to be better than the other person to beat the team or individual that you compete against and athletes understand that And this is make no mistake This is a major win in fact. It's such a major win That there's not even any media that i'm aware of That have even written about this Not anybody in the entirety of the spoke sports media They're all i think finally aware That the vast majority of sports fans rejects this and this is a default acknowledgement for all of you listening in north carolina That the mba got it wrong when they pulled their all star game out of charlotte in the first place Now part of this is hypocrisy Right the mba is fine playing games in china where they have actual concentration camps The mba is fine going to the middle east where you can be beheaded if you're gay and playing games there So they're finally recognizing that as a global company Getting involved in state law issues in a woke perspective is awful for their brand and also extremely hypocritical, but it's important sometimes to notice When we get these wins The media doesn't even acknowledge it I bet Every single one of you and we're number one in salt lake city. Is this being covered in local salt lake city? I know it's not being covered nationally How many of you even knew about this? How many of you were even aware that the mba is basically tucking its tail between its legs and acknowledging that four or five years ago They were completely wrong to have gone woke and pulled their all star game out of charlotte because they're rolling into salt lake city Which has more restrictive laws directly related to sports on the transgender issue and they ain't even saying a word to anybody Sometimes we think we are losing Because we don't take the time to recognize when we win because the media by and large Doesn't tell us when we win because that requires the media acknowledging that they were wrong in the first place This is a big win I would argue it's a monstrous win for those of us out there who have been fighting back against woke sports for years and years And the odds are most of you have never even heard about this story and didn't even know what was going on Because our wins don't get put on the front page of the paper Sometimes they get buried to the extent that we don't even know they happen open phone lines 800 282 2 882 friday edition of the show as always Wanted to start off with something super positive there that again I bet almost none of you have even seen which is pretty crazy to think about look here's the deal Want a better night's sleep?

This is a fun one um tiger woods playing at the genesis open out in uh Out in l.a Uh is playing against uh another golfer named justin thomas and and I also don't know By the way, how many of you have seen this new netflix show? I know netflix has been doing different sort of dives deep dives into sports leagues documentary style where they interview everybody they did the f1 Uh series. I'm not a huge racing fan But buck has been talking talking about how awesome the f1 series was and I know it's exploded The amount of interest there is in f1 well, they're doing one Uh now on the pga And it's really very well done Uh a lot of close-up features on different golfers behind the scenes the season on the road with the pga Uh, well tiger woods obviously had a devastating uh accident in l.a Uh just uh where he'd been nearly died frankly, he's an incredible comeback He's back out on the course and on the ninth hole yesterday He's playing against justin thomas justin thomas one of the best golfers in the world He's featured in this new pga netflix documentary And uh tiger woods coming off of I think tiger woods is 47 years old now coming off of a near death car accident experience He's playing against justin thomas who's 27 28 years old as we said earlier in his prime For don lemmein out there don lemme in by the way not on Uh the cnn broadcast this morning evidently after Saying niki haley was not in her prime yesterday We're going to be joined by niki haley at one o'clock here in about 30 minutes Also, marty mccary's going to be with us uh who doctor from john's hopkins at one 30 that's coming up in the next hour But tiger woods out drives justin thomas And as he is walking down the fairway 47 year old tiger woods coming off of uh a uh devastating injury slyly slips justin thomas a tampon Making a joke about how how in the world justin thomas could you not be able to out drive me here's a tampon for you Um, and I think it's really funny and anybody who has ever been out on a golf course Especially in a group of men knows that the golf course is one a really fun place But it is a lotta locker room material going on out on the golf course on a day-to-day basis and predictably Many in the woke sports media are outraged, but I just saw this headline from usa today reacting to what tiger woods did uh according to christine brinon Tiger this is a headline from usa today sports tiger woods's tampon stunt was quote a bizarre thing for a girl dad to do Did woods think of how demeaning it would look for the athletic daughter? He says he loves that's literally the headline of usa today sports now What I would point out here is first of all There are tampons in a lot of different men's locker rooms now So how does christine brin and know that justin thomas doesn't identify as a woman and that he might have actually needed a tampon During the round today. I mean seems very sexist of her to identify Uh the gender of justin thomas without him having addressed it secondly Men can hit the golf ball farther than women. That's the joke This is not some like there are some women who can out drive men the red teas exist for a reason The red teas exist because men are bigger stronger and faster than women So when a man Is out driven by a woman then it's probably assign one that the woman's really good. Also the man's not very good So tiger woods is mocking justin thomas for being out driven by him Waitelch christine brinen finds out what happens if a man doesn't drive the ball past the women's teeth Whoo, she wants to be outraged look out Um, I got to tell you as we roll into this friday edition of the program Pillsdale college is doing an incredible job They are making sure that our freedoms are defended and they've been at this since they're founding in 1844 And one way they do it both on the campus and off is they share their education with people everywhere k through 12 education They're trying to help kids in schools and they want to make sure that you are able to see What is actually going on?

Uh has been with us quite a lot of late the new senator from ohio And if you dive in and check out what is going on It's very strange the way the biden administration is responding to this train derailment and the resulting pollution that has uh occurred there In fact, uh, here's transportation secretary mayor peat budge Downplaying the derailment and what has happened in ohio. Listen while this Uh horrible situation has gotten particularly high amount of attention. There are roughly 1000 cases a year of a train derailing Yeah, thanks. Thanks mayor peat And uh, so the downplay they won't give fema assistance Uh, they are refusing to give every bit of help that they could on behalf of the federal government This comes of course while we're sending a hundred billion dollars to ukraine You would think maybe we could help out ohio and make sure that the drinking water that goes into the ohio river And then spreads across the entire uh valley there in the watershed in general is safe and not an issue Uh, this is jd vance Testing water in a creek and we'll put this video up on clay and buck.com so you can see it Uh because part of this is something that you need to see visually But he basically has a walking stick and he's out in a little creek bed And he walks out and just stirs the water And you can immediately see the oil that rises up as soon as he stirs this water So i'm trying to describe this video to you, but i want you to play it So you can hear ohio's new as senator jd vance as he's out doing his own investigation surrounding east palestine I'm here at lezley run and there's dead worms and dead fish all throughout this water Something i just discovered is that if you scrape the creek bed It's like chemical is coming out of the ground completion You come here and let me just show this to people i don't know if we'll see this in the camera, but watch this Just see that chemical pop out of the creek This is disgusting And the fact that we have not cleaned up The the train crash the fact that these chemicals are still seeping in the ground is an insult to the people who live in east palestine Do not forget these people. We've got to keep applying pressure. That's how we're going to fix this problem. Thank you Yeah, and look here's the challenge i think in general We talked about this yesterday when joe biden came out and it looks like by the way We might have shot down Some random hobbyist balloons I feel i can't believe i have to say this Uh weather balloons that they had sent up into the sky I'll i'll share some of those details with you in the next segment because it's just so laughably absurd um, but when you know That the biden administration and the quote unquote experts Have been wrong on so many different things You can't trust them anymore And I think that is the biggest issue going forward with our government is Why would we trust that they are actually being honest with us when every single one of you out there? Has heard dr. Fauci and all of his acolytes caught time after time in lie after lie So even for the epa When they have this uh, this epa administrator michael reagan Visiting east palestine and he tells residents to trust the science I'm not sure there's anything I could be told that would make me immediately question things more Than trust the science after the past several years here's cut four. I don't blame the ohio residents for being extremely uncomfortable with what's going on there If those homes have been tested by the state and given a clean bill of health Yes as a father I trust the science I trust the methodology that this state is using and as a parent I would but if those homes haven't tested or if they're on private well water I would advise that they get those homes tested Yeah, I don't frankly trust the science and I think the vast majority of you out there don't trust the science either And what's really going on here? Why is the biden administration so quick to visit every disaster when it's politically expedient But when it's in ohio and these are people who did not vote for overwhelmingly joe biden and they aren't democrats Biden doesn't care He doesn't have any interest at all in their challenges and this is important because coming up in 24 Biden's gonna try to walk around saying oh i'm scranton joe Nobody understands the problems of the white working class better than me All you midwestern swing voters out there in pencelevania in michigan in wisconsin and ohio All you big 10 fans I know exactly what you feel like i'm just like you i grew up in scranton sitting around a kitchen table Why won't you care about those people then? These are the people joe biden that you claim to care about so much people in the industrial heartland backbone of our country in the midwest dealing with a toxic spill And you can't even be bothered to send your transportation secretary there may or p can't even be bothered to pick up the phone and make a phone call To the congressman that represents that district And When he's asked about he doesn't put out any statement when he's asked about it. He says well, we have like a thousand train derailments every year Minimizing what exactly is going on look i'm not an expert Certainly so i'm not telling you to trust me based on the fact that i'm an expert but i can see that video And when jd vant stirs the creek bed and oil residue comes up immediately in the creek bed That doesn't seem very safe to me I wouldn't want my kid bathing in that i wouldn't want my kid drinking that And when you tell me to trust the science i actually want to run in the exact opposite direction and i bet a lot of you do as well We come back again nicky haley gonna join us top in the next hour i want to discuss The new york times defending jk rowling the author of the harry potter series I saw it this morning and i'm not gonna lie. I was stunned beyond belief Talked about wins to start off the show Is this another wind? Is the new york times actually acknowledging that men have penises and women have vaginas But that basically it's crazy to say but that basically qualifies as ert shattering news given what The new york times has been running out on a regular basis Over the past several years in fact it's created a huge uproar We will discuss next in the meantime lifelock by norton provides you and me with something essential in this digital age Online identity theft protection Stop and think about it for a moment how many times you enter your name password confidential information credit cards Now ask yourself if you're just blindly trusting every entity you share that that information Won't be lost that it won't disappear that it won't be stolen a lot of people out there are Maybe if they're not already certainly vulnerable to becoming victims of identity theft now That's why you need lifelock by norton remember no one can prevent all identity theft or monitor all transactions at all businesses But it's easy to help protect yourself with lifelock Sign up today and save 25 off your first year with my name as the promo code clay You can call 1-800 lifelock or head to lifelock.com use that promo code clay clay y for 25 percent off welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show Um, let's save jk rallying because I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this in the first hour You know yesterday joe biden came out and we carried him live And he was discussing what the three objects that were shot down might have been And he basically said yeah, we don't think they were chinese. It sounds like they weren't really a threat And I saw this story up yesterday Um, and this is I can't believe this is from aviation week Hobby clubs missing balloon feared shot down by united states air force Uh, and this is really crazy. I'm reading directly from this article. What did your commander in chief dean? Such a threat that we had to scramble jets and fire 400,000 missiles to take down Uh, a small globe trotting balloon group Uh declared this is an illinois based hobbyist club They believe that one of the three objects shot down May have been theirs They are the northern illinois Bottle cap balloon brigade. I can't believe that this is this is potentially real The club Uh is the northern illinois bottle cap balloon brigade this may be what we spent 400,000 dollars to shoot down They say there is circumstantial evidence The clubs silver coated party style pico balloon. I don't know what any of that means by the way Reported its last position on february 10th at 38,910 feet off the west coast of alaska And a popular forecasting tool Projected the cylindrically shaped object would be floating high over the central part of alaska's ucon territory on february 11th That's the same day That we using an f 22 shot down an unidentified object of a similar description and altitude in the same area Uh, they also uh in this ballooning community They uh, they use ham radio and high altitude ballooning into a uh relatively affordable hobby They have reached that. This is so crazy. This is a direct quote I tried contacting our military and the fbi And just got the run around to try to enlighten them on what a lot of these things probably are And they're going to look not too intelligent to be shooting them down Said ron meadows the founder of scientific balloon solutions A silicon valley company that makes purpose built pico balloons for hobbyist educators and science These balloons wait for it cost between 12 and 180 dollars each We may have shot down a 12 dollar balloon with a 400 000 missile Uh, i'm guessing they were pico balloons said a retired fedex engineer and the co-host of the amateur radio roundtable show He this guy currently has three pico balloons in flight in the northern and southern hemispheres Uh And when this aviation week group Contacted the fbi to ask them about whether it might be these balloons The fbi and norad said they have no updates So these pico balloons, uh, are i've never heard of them before And some of you may be an ex if you're an expert in pico balloons Call into the show and explain whether or not you buy into oh, yeah, this could make sense as to what we are shooting down Uh, but they literally can cost 12 dollars And they can go high altitudes and this group is nervous about the negative attention. They're now getting Uh, these pico balloons weigh less than six pounds They're exempt from most faa airspace restrictions And they uh, what is a pico balloon? I've never heard of this before They're typically about three feet in diameter and then as they ascend they go all the way up to 20 to 50 000 feet Um, and they keep track of them the owners do Through hf and vhf uhf radio links and they have small gps tracking devices attached as well And the balloon will broadcast its position to let you know how exactly they are, uh, how they are moving This uh, this author by the way steve trimble covers military aviation missiles in space for aviation week Uh that i'm reading from right now But given where we are It feels like this might well be what occurred and that the biden administration was so embarrassed By the chinese spy balloon coming into our country and traversing it that they updated their radar In an aggressive way So that maybe they started to pick up some of these Hobbeous balloons and then they scrambled their jets and went out and shot them down This also would tie in with okay. Why would they stop? Because probably they recovered some of the materials here and they were like We just shot down a 12 dollar balloon That some hobbyist in ohio put into the sky And that would also explain why they're not telling you what these objects are because it's so humiliating to the biden administration That we used a 400 000 Missile and that we scrambled jets To shoot down 12 dollar balloons that were set up from hobbyist to see how wind currents work Yeah, that's uh, I mean if you start to piece all this together, why are they being so circumspect? Why are they not telling us very many details about this? Why are they claiming that it's so hard to recover these things? What one I would bet that I would hope that a 400 000 missile would probably obliterate a 12 dollar balloon just tossing it out there And how humiliating would it be after all of this attention? For the biden administration to have to come back out and say yeah, well, uh, yeah, it's definitely not i'm chinese origin No, of course not. It's just some hobbyist in the united states who decided to send their 12 dollar balloons into the end of the Into 50 000 altitude 50 000 feet altitude and it's not tracked by the faa So if it showed up on radar you're thinking oh, this is maybe a chinese spy balloon Because you're embarrassed at the way you responded to the last chinese spy balloon But in reality, it's just hobbyist balloons if you know about this let me know you can call us 802 to 2 882 Producer alley said the doos are about to go up a lot on the uh on the aviation groups Um, and if you're an expert in these pico balloons, I would actually love to hear from you Do you buy into this as a theory for what might have occurred in terms of the biden administration shooting these down? All right, we come back next hour. We got a couple of guests for you. We're gonna be joined by niki haley She announced just a couple of days ago officially that she is running for president of the united states She also was attacked as being outside of her prime by don limon who was not on the air I don't believe cnn this morning. What does niki haley think about all that? What does she think about this race and What does she heard if anything from donald trump since she officially entered this race as a former member of his administration? How will all of that play out plus? Dr. Marty macKerry is going to join us. We've been talking about the fact that there is a 30 percent increase at heart attack deaths For individuals age 25 to 44 Does dr mccary believe that is connected at all to the covet shot When if ever will we get official news about whether there is any connection there? We will discuss all of that and more this of course is the friday edition of the play travis and buck sexman show We appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Hope you were having fantastic fridays up next former south carolina governor niki haley. She's running for president"
