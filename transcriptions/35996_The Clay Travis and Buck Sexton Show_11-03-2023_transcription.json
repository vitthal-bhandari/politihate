Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in, Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. It is the Monday edition of the program and we have got an absolute cornucopia of stories for all of you to experience with us. Encourage you as always. You like the use of the word cornucopia there. SAT word right out of the gate, Mr. Clay. I think it's important to educate, illuminate and elucidate for all of our crew out there how spectacular we are when it comes to word choice at times. And we got a bunch of word choices to dive into. Trust the same, not pronunciation though, apparently, based on the emails we get. I have never done any show and I've been doing shows for 20 years now of radio. The number one thing that people email me about on this show is the pronunciation of words and it's like not words that are used every day. It's random words that are said, you know, maybe once a week, once a month. It's unbelievable and evidently I talked to producer Ali about this and she was she said, Rush used to talk about this all the time too. One of the number one things he would get is pronunciation emails. And so I believe the staff is putting together a best of of Rush reacting to all. I don't know what it is about this audience. Just absolute sticklers for the pronunciation of words. So we'll see if we can get them to write today. But the Trump, the Santas Cold War, I think it's fair to say that because the Santas is still an unannounced candidate for the 2024 Republican presidency nomination. It is going to be an absolute war. Trump's still trying to go to men feels like the Santas is going to announce around June when the 60 day legislative session ends in the state of Florida. And then the Donnie Brook, as I like to call it, will officially be underway between now and when the caucuses begin in early January, which honestly is not that far away, particularly when you consider summer, oftentimes everybody out there knows goes by very quickly. And then you get into the holiday season before you know it. And so this thing may well be decided by September, October in terms of who's likely to vote how things are going to look in Iowa. Sonu knew came out. I'm sure you saw this, the governor of New Hampshire, Buck and basically said the Santas is going to win New Hampshire voting. We're going on right now. That means Iowa is a toss up. Then we'll see what happens in South Carolina with some particular unique regional variety there because Nikki Haley and Tim Scott may both be on the ballot in South Carolina as well. So this thing is underway. But I think Buck, the continued fallout of the lab leak theory and everything that it has represented with the Department of Energy and the FBI, both putting their full weight now behind the idea that COVID came out of a Chinese lab, which you and me and anybody out there in our audience who mentioned for several years. Oh, it was a far right wing conspiracy. It was racist in origin. How dare anyone be able to mention it stories out now saying CNN in particular, Jeff Zucker, their diminutive leader was demanding that no one at CNN even cover the idea of the COVID lab leak because Trump had said that he believed that's where it came from alongside of Mike Pompeo. And Trump was right again on this. And the body blows that are getting delivered to MSNBC and CNN, Buck, because their brand had been during the Trump era were the truth tellers, even though COVID collusion lie with Russia, even though they have overwhelmingly those two networks. I believe been the foremost purveyors of misinformation anywhere in the media ecosystem and a guy like Russell Brand, who is really funny. And I don't know him at all. I've never done any of his shows, but he is a persuadable person who seems to be sane. And I would tie it in Buck with I'm seeing a tidal wave now of people who are in the comic space who are just so fed up, even Chris Rock over the weekend. I watched his special. There is a great deal of hate right now. I would say in the entertainment comedy space over this ridiculous woke agenda that Democrats are foisting out there and Russell Brand on Bill Maher's show Friday just absolutely eviscerated and MSNBC contributor to his face. We got grabbed a cut of it. I think you guys will enjoy it. Here it is. You're an example. The ludicrous outrageous criticisms of Joe Rogan around either met in deliberately referring to his a horse medicine when they know it's an effective medicine. All right. So we could unpack it. It is. It is the best thing that Russell Brand has done since he played Aldous Snow and forgetting Sarah Marshall. Such a good movie. A great date or with the with the wife movie to watch if you haven't seen it really really holds up pretty well. Definitely not not for the kids. It's 18 plus but it's a good movie. Really funny movie. This is the best thing. Also, he gets more attention than his ideas to do because he's going like this crazy accent and his voice is up here. He sounds all crazy and he's like, oh, but we're just going to speak really fast and talk about the corporations. And OK, fine. He's a socialist from what I understand. So take everything he says with the grain of salt. I would add two things in this because, yes, Clay, I liked it too. Like, I liked what he said to MSNBC. Of course, he's also he's hitting Fox as well there. So it's not forget. It's not like he's, you know, he's all of a sudden he's not a conservative. He's not red-pilled, but he's a guy who understands the position of the institutional left on COVID specifically, but on a range of issues. I think increasingly they're seeing on the transgender agenda as it pertains to drag shows for small children can't defend it. Can't win. They're trying. They're pulling out everything. They all the stops, Clay. They're losing on that issue. They're losing because of state legislation. They're losing because the work of some of our colleagues in the right wing space. OK, so it's that he's recognizing that the left is indefensible on these issues. And that is helpful for a man of the left to say. But I also was always his party. And it says, where were these people two years ago when you were doing interviews and going on shows and saying, this is crazy. Where were these people when it mattered? You know, and so this is also why, look, I like that Bill Maher, I would go on Bill Maher. I've been on before. You would go on Bill Maher. It's one of the few places where you have actual, I wouldn't even say left, right clashes, but you do have some iconoclasm. You do have some clash of ideas and sacred cows sometimes get slaughtered on Bill Maher show. Fine, which is, which is important. But I feel like for a lot of these individuals, they were there cheering on this monster until it became clear that the monster was completely insane. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, there are people on the left who are waking up now. And I'm always caught between, great, the water's warm, jump in for Team Sanity. And well, I mean, are you still like a climate change lunatic and believe all the other insane stuff? But you realize this is too much like stopping Novak Jokovic from coming to the US Open this summer. As we talked about, that is too much. It's crazy. It's crazy. And he can't come into Indian Wells for our listeners down in South Florida, who may be tennis fans. Why I welcome it is we have to, and this is a big part of just reaching out to audience and trying to broaden the tent. But there are still so many people out there who don't know the truth about COVID. There's still so many people out there who don't know the truth about Russia collusion. And I get that Fox News gets attacked. I mean, they're in the political space. Everybody's going to get attacked in that respect. I can't speak for everybody that has worked at Fox. I mean, I sold out kick to Fox two years ago. In the two years that I have been a contributor to Fox News. No one has ever told me anything about, Hey, don't talk about this topic. Now, I wasn't there during the fallout of the of the 2020 election. And all of the allegations surrounding what was said and what wasn't said and what did happen. I've said for a long time, I believe the election was rigged by big tech, big media in favor of Democrats in Joe Biden. I don't think there's any doubt at all about that. But nobody has ever told me, Hey, don't talk about this. You can't talk about this. And so when I see CNN and Jeff Zucker it coming out now. Oh, Jeff Zucker just said, we're not going to cover in any way with all of the resources that we've done. I think it's very important for people out there to understand that at many places in media narrative trumps facts. And buck, what you and I try to do on this program. I've come out and said like, Hey, I'll get some things wrong. I'll adjust my opinion as the data changes. One of the things that I got wrong back in March of 2020. I wish that I had not trusted the data that China put out about COVID and tried to extrapolate from that what the impact would be in the United States. And I went to my audience and I said, Look, I whiffed on this. And we didn't have a lot of data in March when the first numbers were coming out. When China shared all those numbers, I tried to look at it and analyze it from that perspective. I wish I hadn't done that. It's the only thing I've ever said during COVID that I wish I could go back and change. But that's honest, right? Like be honest with your audience. None of us are going to bat a thousand. None of us are going to make every shot we take. And you should be willing to adjust your opinion as facts change and be open-minded on all of these things. You can't treat somebody as an honest person if they won't admit and correct mistakes. You can honesty is not I thought what I thought when I thought it when I thought it and I said it and I never go back and I never corrected on it. I never address it. I've said one of my regrets is that I really thought that for those who were at high risk, the vaccines would probably for at least that variant that season be be effective for them. I told our parents to get them based on the data that was out there at the time. I didn't think that it would be effectively worthless. I mean that yes. I knew that we shouldn't have mandates. I knew you and I didn't need it. I knew that people that because I already had it and I believe the natural immunity the whole time didn't just discover that in the last couple of months, like apparently the CDC and the NIH have. But yeah, I thought it could. I underestimated how much of a cluster the Fauciite regime could actually be. Like I thought it was going to be a nine out of 10 and awful and they actually turned the dial up to 11 for those of you who are spinal tap fans. And I think that with Jeff Zucker and CNN, I mean what you see is somebody who I mean Trump, he was a have and Trump was the white whale. I mean nothing. Nothing else mattered. There was no other consideration other than mobilizing a Democrat aligned cable news network to destroy. Yes, an individual also a movement, but it was deeply personal between Trump and Zucker. They knew each other in the past. They had worked with each other at NBC. So you have to remember that too. And until there is a full accounting for that until there's a full accounting, you can't assume that these entities have any interest in even trying to get it right because they're not being honest about what's happened up to this point. And you know, another thing that comes up now, I think a lot of players is people ask me, they'll say, you know, do I think there was cheating and what cheating was there in 2020. I'll say, oh, I'm, I'm highly confident there was cheating. I can't say how much. I can't say what necessarily can be proved. But, you know, my gut instinct tells me, and why, why do I feel so free about sharing that even though it's not precise. I'm not saying it's scientific because they spent four years saying that Trump was a Russian asset. And that he stole the 2016 election. So, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Like, why is it that one side is able to get away with the most massive obvious fraud and leveraging the federal government, the FBI and the DOJ to do it. But we're supposed to sit around all the time and just say what the acceptable talking points are on election security, the most secure election in all history. No, I don't think we have to play the game by the rules of people who have shown us, they have no honesty and no integrity to this day whatsoever. I think that's well said. We'll continue to break this down. 800-282-2882. You can always weigh in as well as we roll through the Monday edition of the program.

My dad, Mason Sexton, who famously called the 1987 stock market crash, went live with his first public prediction in decades. He warned the top was in and revealed his unique framework to take advantage of the falling market that would follow. Right on cue, the market peaked exactly when he said it would. Those who listened to his unusual prediction, what some called his prophecy, were richly rewarded. But now my dad is coming forward with the next part of his prophecy, his second insight that will catch even the most sophisticated investors by surprise. On Tuesday, November 14th, he's sharing all the details in an online event, including why the next six months could make or break your portfolio. I followed my dad's work for years. He's been right so many times. I urge you to heed his latest warning. Simply go to the second insight 2023.com to sign up for free. That's the second insight 2023.com paid for by new paradigm research. The larger problem with all of this is the inability to discuss things that are within the realm of possibility without falling into absolutes and litmus testing each other for our political allegiances as it arose from that. My bigger problem with that was I thought it was a pretty good bit that expressed kind of how I felt and the two things that came out of it were I'm racist against Asian people and how dare. I align myself with the all right. So there's John Stewart also talking about the lab leak thesis and how he got into trouble for saying the obvious, which is the Wuhan Institute of Virology being a few miles away from the first cases of where this thing happened seems to be an indicator of something. It's a big world out there. You know, this didn't break out in East Hampton. It happened next to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And so again, I am Clay looking at this as the honesty is welcome. The timing of it though is not great. Where were these people who are now saying we should have free debate and open exchange of ideas and we should question assumptions and it's almost year three here, right? Yeah. It's been a long time. Most people are cowards. That's one of the disappointing things to come out of COVID because if you run through all of the different things that had to happen, you can just pick one example. But even in my own neighborhood buck, they put up crime scene tape around an outdoor playground to keep kids from going to it. And I live in Williamson County, Tennessee as red of a county as exists in the country yet in March of 2020. So many people in this entire country were cowards that even in a rock ribbed red part of the country, kids couldn't get on swings in my neighborhood. And they put up flipping crime tape around it. Now, it didn't last very long, but this was all madness. And you and I were talking out about it then, but we got vociferously attacked. And I do welcome the fact that some people are now saying, Oh, well, this can never happen again. But I think we have to ensure that that occurs. And the only way to ensure that in my mind is with a true reckoning. If you want a small business out there, you know the value of time. Get refunds.com does too. That's why they've made it easy.

So many different stories that are out there for us to catch up on. We've been talking about the fallout as everybody now tries to recognize, oh, wait a minute. Yeah, we did get everything wrong on COVID. Buck, one of the stories that's coming out, and I really, let me just say this. We've been saying it for a long time. I do believe that the next president of the United States, presuming he is a Republican, needs to open an investigation into Dr. Fauci's testimony that he gave for Congress over the past two years because I think there's pretty clear evidence. If you go back and look through what, for instance, Fauci told Rand Paul, Senator from Kentucky who absolutely grilled him over many of these issues. I think Fauci purged himself in front of Congress. And one of the stories that's out there as the fallout of the COVID lab leak becomes more pronounced, Buck, is the idea that Fauci tried to cover all this up by making it seem like a scientific that this could have never occurred. And there have to be consequences. We went to break. I said there has to be a reckoning. There, there needs to be, I believe, some people basically duckwalked frogwalked, however you say it, and charged with crimes relating to COVID. And I think Fauci is at the very top of that list. Now, would it be hard to get a conviction? Certainly. But are you sending a message about what is acceptable in terms of trying to silence your critics in what should be a major issue of national debate? I also think all these people who got it right with a great bearing in declaration. And you know, you and I came out and said, yeah, this is all reasonable. This is all rational. There should be plotted rewards, significant attributes given to them for getting the biggest thing in their career. 100% correct despite the consequences. I don't trust doctors who still say that masks are an effective. You shouldn't means of stopping COVID in any capacity. I don't trust them because they have bad judgment. They're judgment, even if they're brilliant, I don't care what their MCAT score was. I don't care how long they've been in practice. If they're judgment, is that flawed because of their political allegiance? I don't trust their judgment on anything that has to do with health. And this, you can, you can extrapolate this all the way up to the CDC and take this all the way to the top. Right? You know, Fauci, as we know, was the director of Nia. This is the perfect bureaucratic maneuver. He had his own little kingdom that was an offshoot of a massive bloated bureaucracy with NIH so that he wasn't really ever the head of either the CDC or the NIH, but got to act like he was the head of both because he had been around so long. And the vile little tyrant Smurf was able to get his way with so many of these things. But how can you trust this? These organizations going forward? I mean, the fact that the Democrats are always pushing the CDC to do more studies on gun violence. Here's the study. Lock up criminals. Gun violence is bad. The end. Like, what, what do they really think is going to be accomplished? But as we know, it's putting a science hashtag science behind assault rifle ban, you know, handgun ban in the future, universal registration, et cetera. That's why they want to involve the scientists. And this is what you saw all along was that they use science as a political tool. And in doing so, they bastardize science in a way from which it may never really recover, at least not in our lifetimes, you know, meaning the science or the people that are in charge of this that we're all supposed to trust. And, you know, I don't think it's an accident that we've entered this era of Fauci and the mask, lockdown fanatics on the one hand. And you may have just seen Clay. I mean, this is this is in your world. They've now decided that the USA powerlifting competition is going to allow athletes to compete in the women's division after losing a discrimination case. Okay, everybody, let's play a game. How many MDs or research PhDs in some kind of biology related for how many of them are willing to come forward and say this is crazy? Very, very few. And yet how many children in the third grade, if you said who are stronger, boys or girls would get that right. I mean, unless they've gotten brainwashed already by the, you know, woke propaganda. But if you just asked somebody who hadn't been told one way or the other in school, they'd say boys are strong in the girls. So, you know, a trans power lifter is now going to become the female powerlifting champion. And again, this is because the fundamental lie here. It's not about politeness. It's not about letting people live their lives as they see fit or any of that. That's all fine. Let people live their lives. But they can't live their lives a certain way if that requires you to lie and you to change your life. That's a different thing. This crosses over from, don't hurt me. Don't take my stuff to, oh, no, you're actually hurting me too. This is about other people as well. It's not just about the extreme narcissism and delusions that are at the heart of the trans agenda. At some point, tolerance becomes destruction. And I think this is important for people out there to recognize because most people didn't really care about any trans related issues for decades, right? Somebody decides in 2004 they want to be a guy instead of a girl or vice versa and they go through that process. What it becomes, when it becomes a big deal is when you start demanding that I change my behavior in order to fit your lifestyle choices. And I don't know that there's any more perfect illustration of this occurring than sports. And to me, the sports is kind of the canary in the coal mine here. But the fastest woman in the history of womanhood is Shikari Richardson. I believe I got that right. She is the fastest woman to ever live. She holds the fastest recorded time for any women. That's a really badass thing. Congratulations to her. Every boy who won a Texas state high school championship is faster than the fastest woman who has ever run. Bigger, stronger, faster is the rule for men compared to women. Now, there are lots of super strong women. Buck, if you and I went into a CrossFit gym down in Miami where you are or here in Nashville where we are, there might be a couple of women who are a lot stronger than you and me. Right? That can, that are in better physical condition. That can deadlift more all those things. More power to all those women. But they're outliers by and large. And the strongest men are going to crush the strongest women. So when you allow a man to go through all of male growth, biology, testosterone, it's the Leah Thomas story all over again. And then you allow them to compete for Olympic medals. What is happening is the erasure of female athletics. So, so to bring this back, I mean, the science as in the harnessing of pseudo consensus among left wing Democrat aligned MDs and PhDs on these issues is such that not only do they go along with this and say things that they know to be untrue. They demand that others in their profession at a minimum shut their mouths if not go along with it. Because right, there is not an MD in America. There is not a gender expert in America who call into this show and explain how it is not just patently unfair and absurd to let men compete against women in powerlifting of all things. This is completely insane. And, and you know, you get to a point where you really have to start asking the even more extreme questions. You go beyond this, you say, why not trans age ism? You know, I clay. I think I'm a third grader and I want to go compete against third graders in dodgeball. And you know, little third graders getting carted off because I'm headhunting and smacking them as hard as I can the face with a dodgeball too bad. I think I'm a third grader. You wonder on what basis am I to be told if I really feel that way, if I'm living my truth again. If I want to walk around and tell people I'm a third grader, it's a free country. I can tell people that they might think I'm crazy. But if I then want to compete against other people in the third grade, that is the line. And that is the line that the trans agenda has crossed. Don't fall for this. If it's so rare, you know, why are you so focused on it? If it's, you know, it doesn't happen that often. Why are you exaggerating it? What's the big deal? Why are you big at it? These are all the things they say when they push it everywhere. It's being pushed in every sport, all over the country, high school, all the way up to the pros. At some point in the next five to 10 years, if you have kids or grandkids, there is going to be a trans kid in your daughter's sports. It's going to happen. Just is. At some point in the next five to 10 years, doesn't matter where you are, there is going to be this issue arising. If it is allowed. Now, I think a lot of states are passing these bills, which make total sense, which say you compete against the biology on your birth certificate. I'm concerned that some left wing states are going to respond to this by saying, well, let's just take off sex on birth certificates. Right? Like you think I'm crazy when I say that, but I feel like that is probably going to be a response. It's not going to. It's not crazy to think that in California, Buck, they'll just say, well, why do we even need to know if it's a boy or a girl on the birth certificate? Let's let them decide later. You know, what, what could be a more. I can't believe this, but yes, that's where we're headed. What could be a more extreme form of stateism of the all powerful state that must be worshiped in place of God by people than a state that insists that you not recognize the difference in men and women? I mean, I just keep telling everybody if they can get you to admit that or rather to profess that to to celebrate that, they can get you to say anything. Yes. And that's what you have to remember. If you're going to say, hey, that 250 pound guy who's been, you know, a male his whole life. He's 25. Now he's 26. Now he's a woman. Yeah, he's a woman. No different than the women that you've known your whole life. If the state can force you to say that the state can force you to say anything. You have no basis for truth. You have no basis for discernment. You have given up that most basic of human faculties, which is the ability to see what is right in front of your face. My friends, there are a few things you can do that have greater impact right now that helping to save the life of a preborn baby, saving that child from abortion and getting the mother, the love and support she needs during a difficult time. That's what the preborn network network clinics nationwide are doing each and every day. This is a nonprofit organization that focuses on saving the lives of unborn children. Over the last two decades, they've accomplished that over 200,000 times preborn seeks out women who don't think they have options, but are considering abortion, but they haven't made that decision before they make that choice that can never be taken back. They're introduced at preborn clinics to the life growing inside them through a free ultrasound. It is donations from you and me, the pro life community that make this process possible. Once that mother hears that heartbeat, sees the precious life growing inside her, the majority of the time she chooses life for her unborn child. Each ultrasound costs just $28. $140 provides five ultrasounds. Think about that. You could say five tiny babies lives. You can make a life changing donation today. It's as simple as grabbing your cell phone and dialing pound 250 and saying the word baby. That's pound 250 say baby to talk with someone to preborn right now. They've got a really easy to use helpful website too. If you want to donate there, go to preborn.com slash buck. That's preborn.com slash b u c k sponsored by preborn. Sunday hang with clay and buck. A new podcast. Find it on the iHeart app or wherever you get your podcasts. If you have a lot of money riding on the AI boom, then I urge you to listen to my dad, Mason Sexton. You see, my dad famously called the 1987 market crash almost to the day. He called the exact bottom of the COVID crash and the exact top in 2022 and many more major market events. But earlier this year, he went live with his first major public prediction in decades. He warned the market would top out in late July right on cue the market peak. Those who listened to his unusual prediction, what some called his prophecy were richly rewarded. But now my dad is coming forward with the second part of his prophecy. Specifically, he believes we're entering a six month make or break period. On Tuesday, November 14, he's sharing all the details in an online event, including why AI stocks are especially dangerous.

It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine Capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one staly, and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings, or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects, including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems, and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles, or problems thinking as these may be life threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Ask your doctor about In Gresa, or learn more at In Gresa.com. That's I-N-G-R-E-Z-Z-A.com. I had a lot of friends there, and they were telling me about it in real time. We'll discuss some of what Trump is promising for his voters, including that he will be their retribution, I believe, was the phrase that got a lot of attention. There we'll discuss that. Plus, it's so interesting, the timing of this. Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida is not running for president yet. Maybe he won't run at all. I mean, he has lost about 20-25 pounds. By the way, Clay, since I've said that on this show, other people have noticed this guy is under a regimen right now, man. You could do Rocky Montages of Ron DeSantis if you were seeing what's going on, because I assure you, my man is watching his macros, getting his steps in and doing some strength training. I'm just putting it out there. You're not going to hear any meatball or heavy D-jokes about Ron DeSantis, which is two things that people have called him in the past. But he's running around the country or going around the country for a book tour, including in California, which is interesting because it is not Florida and it is quite far away, and had some things to say about that state. So we've got some political heavyweights here, perhaps a midweight in the case of Ron. But I'm just saying, we've got some big names and politics we're going to discuss in the next hour. Clay, you have a quick update for us on a fact issue, and then we want to talk Chris Rock. What is the fact check, sir? People are pointing out, and I'll wear this one, uh, Flojo. Florence Griffith's Joyner has the fastest time in the women's hundred. From back in like 1988, I forgot I thought she had been eclipsed. Point still stands. Texas Boys state champions are all today faster than the fastest women's ever. More than the fastest woman in the history of the world, but I got the fastest woman in the history of the world wrong. Therefore want to get that correction props to Flojo from back in 1988. No one has yet broken that record, I believe. I'm not an expert in women's track and field, but the point is, as we were saying earlier, male athletes, even at a high school level, are faster than the fastest woman who's ever lived according to recorded track time. Right now, I watched the whole Chris Rock special over the weekend. I watched it close to live. It was a Netflix live comedy event. I thought it was really pretty funny. Um, and I think the opportunity here, Buck, and I've been writing about this in my book. Republicans should become the party of comedy. Embrace jokes, even jokes that make you cringe, even jokes that make you uncomfortable. Embrace the idea of jokes. There's a huge opening here because most of what Chris Rock said was anti woke and the entire concept of his discussion, his stand up act was selective outrage and he opened talking about people who will play Michael Jackson songs, but won't play play our Kelly songs. Like, who do you decide to cancel and not cancel. So now I tried to watch it with Carrie over the weekend and I got, I watched the end because of the Will Smith commentary, which I'd heard so much about. Um, I couldn't get more than 15 minutes into it. Honestly, I'm not a, like, uh, I'm not a problem. I don't have a problem with salty language general. I just thought too much cursing too much shouting. It's just not my thing. It's just not my style of comedy. Um, but the, the line about Michael Jackson, R Kelly was very funny because it is true. Michael Jackson's music is some of the best pop music ever recorded by most people's, but. Whereas, you know, R Kelly really has one song that everybody remembers. So, and you can argue R Kelly's been convicted. Michael Jackson was never convicted, but it is selective outrage. Here he is though. And by the way, he does use the B word. Just be prepared. It is in this clip, play clip 12. Will Smith practices selective outrage? Because everybody knows what the **** happened. Everybody that really knows knows I had nothing to do with that ****. I didn't have any entanglements. His wife was **** her son's friend. Okay. Now she heard him way more than he heard me. Okay. Everybody call him a ****. They call his wife a ****. Everybody call him a ****. Everybody. Everybody. And who's he hit me? There you have it. That's pretty much the, at the end he gets into some of that. We're going to get into DeSantis, Trump, Biden, by the way. You may not know this. Biden says he was a hero of the civil rights movement as a student, and you may not know it because it's not true. We'll talk about it coming up. Lucky Land Casino asking people what's the weirdest place you've gotten lucky? Lucky in line at the deli, I guess? I'm in my dentist's office. More than once, actually.
