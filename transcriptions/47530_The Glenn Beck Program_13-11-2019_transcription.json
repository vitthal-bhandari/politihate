    "text": " Hey, welcome to it. It is the Wednesday podcast. It is a big day around here. If you're listening to this before 5 p.m. We have some behind the scenes and then the news and why it matters on Blaze TV. Then at eight o'clock on Blaze TV, also free for any of your friends or if you're not a subscriber, make sure you're at Facebook or YouTube at 8 p.m. Eastern, the Democratic Hydra. And that's exactly what it is. The impeachment hearing started today. And I have to tell you, if we cover any of this, maybe there'll be some places that you will hear my frustration beyond frustration because I know what you don't know, but we'll at eight o'clock tonight. And I couldn't even listen to these guys in the impeachment hearing because it's so incredibly dishonest. We'll have that. Sarah Gonzalez joins us. And also Pat joins us. We have an impeachment update with Kellyanne Conway. And we begin where all good shows begin. The non gender gender bread person. You're listening to the best of the men back. This is the way that what I find fascinating most about that is the way it's communicated in like legitimately a really loving, explaining way like that is that you could you could convince a child of anything in that tone of voice. Actually, I did you know that that evolve us for boys? Let me let me go upstairs and get to the German textbooks for teachers on how to explain how your friend who was here yesterday is now gone because they're the enemy of the state. I have that. I can show it to you. You can make anything look great in a classroom. Why not? I mean, this is crazy. Play the audio of who is it that was on the campus? Will Whitten, right? And will was out and he's he's asking people how many genders are there? How many children? Prager you. Here it is. I mean, I've been talking about Ukraine for a year. How many genders are there? Infinite. Infinite. Why do you say that? Because I think I don't know you can't put things in boundaries. You can define yourself as whatever you want. And I don't have a number for it. So it's infinite for me. What do you identify as? I identify identify as male. How many genders are there? God, I don't know. Like, I identify as a guy. But if someone's going to be happier, not following that binary thing, do you? How many genders stop stops stop. There's a spectrum of them. Stop. None of these people none of these people would have said this four years ago. Also, I've just did a quick edition. None of these people believe none of what they're saying. Nope. They're all like, wait, what am I supposed to say? Wait, what is that? None of them believe this? This is like a or they I think the first person kind of believes it because she wanted to be she wanted to show off. She wanted to virtue signal. You know what I mean? The guys, especially the guys are like, I don't know what gets canceled. I mean, what will get me closer to the hot girls here? I mean, I don't care. I'll say anything. That's all that is. None of these guys would have said this until they go to a university where they are teaching them. You're going to you're a moron. You're an absolute moron after you get out of college. Don't send your kids to college. I just had a conversation with somebody who runs a college, a university, prestigious university, just left and said, I got to the point where I can't look at I can't look at parents anymore and say, yeah, no, this is this this money well spent. He's like, we're indoctrinating your kids. It's awful. It's awful. What's happening and the price keeps going up and up and up and up and up. We're more and more and more of your soul. Who do you think it has the time to go? You know what? We need to take on gingerbread men people in universities. Yeah, right. And what it is taking advantage as well of people's good nature, right? Like the reason why I think 99% of people that they could ask these questions on the street would add would answer this way is because they see it as something. Well, I don't really understand it, but I don't want to judge somebody else and like be a jerk. So yeah, there was a million genders. Yeah, because I've, you know, people say that they want another gender, right? Like it's like a it's like a polite sort of thing. It's in a way you used to describe this with political correctness generally, where people would say, Handy capable instead of handicapped and be like, well, yeah, I guess say Handy capable because it's nice. So here's so here's the thing. The guy said, I don't know that I don't know the number. It's limitless, I guess. I mean, I identify as a guy, a guy, but you know, do you. And that's that is America. Do you just do you, man? But different that's not available. Like you can't overwhelm facts with your feelings for good, right? To say like, Oh, well, look, I just think that, you know, that team one instead of lost is not is not a thing you can do yet. It's something we continue to attempt here in this country. And it's not the right road. Okay, let me look at this. Tim Robbins has now taken on Ellen DeGeneres because Ellen has developed a friendship. I mean, not they went. They went to a, they just sat next to each other at a football game and spoke kindly to each other. Yes. She he said that Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush is not cute. He is now calling her out for making peace with the former president. How dare you. Listen, I'm all for going across I was in making peace with people, but there are certain people that are walking around right now that are responsible for a lot of death. That is for me, something Bush has never reckoned with never taken responsibility for. He said that Bush and Ellen live in an elite bubble where you can do whatever the hell you want to in life and pay no ramifications. Excuse me. I believe this is the yes. I believe this is the opposite of what Tim Robbins used to say when George W. Bush supporters, not George W. Bush George W. Bush supporters were like, dude, shut up. Just shut up about this. You didn't talk about it on your own time. Don't talk about it in in this particular setting. When he gave this, there's a chill wind blowing in the air. There is a menace that is trying to shut people up at Cooper's town and clear channel. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Blame me because he got canceled from the Hall of Fame or something because people found him too annoying. Yeah. There's a chill wind clear channel and Cooper's town silencing people. What the hell are you talking about? That's what you're doing. The left has just become everything they despise. Why are we even talking about this? Because I just wanted to do something. I mean, all I wanted to do is just a quick thing on cut the Christmas balls off of your gingerbread. I know. And then we got into the nine million genders. Here's the thing, Glenn. You've got two straight weeks of nonstop impeachment fun. We're talking about the impeachment. You say it that way. Super exciting and really honest debate about whether the impeachment is is real and whether these charges are serious. And you know who's going to lead the seriousness of that Adam freaking shift. That's who's going to do it. So you've got two weeks of Adam's shift telling you what's important. We might as well start out with a little gingerbread story because it's going to be now a lot of cookies for the next couple of weeks. Well, okay. Now if you're looking for impeachment coverage, we're of course going to carry the impeachment hearings for as long as I can possibly stand it. Okay. So I might have to take a break from time to time. I might have to just blurt something out from time to time. I I where is a we have any rope to make a noose. I might have to fashion a noose for myself at some point because this is nothing but a show today. And it begins in 42 minutes. I'm pretty excited about it. I can't wait to see what they have you on tap for today. I wonder if any of them are going to make speeches before they ask any questions. Some of them may even get to the level of exasperation over all of this. They can't believe what the president has done. But they just want the facts Glenn. That's it. Not that fact. Not that fact. Not that fact. Don't say that. Oh, you know what? That's right. Shift came out yesterday and said there will be an ethics probe into anyone who tried. I hope all of them do. I hope every Republican starts with. Sure. I'm a lot. This is a good point. Rand Paul came out in the hallway and said, look, I mean, this is not the law. The law is not that the it's about the IG releasing the name and they need to be protected in their jobs. It has nothing to do with whether a congressman or a regular citizen can say the name. And while I think that's true, it's my reading of the story as well. Why haven't any of them had the balls to actually do it? Why are they all hinting and linking to other sources and coming? Why not come out and do it? If you believe it's true, which it doesn't seem like there's any denial that it's actually true that this is who the whistleblower is. I think they're going to say it. I think the reason is nobody wants to go through all of that hassle and just tie their office up with that. But if they all do it, if they all do it, what are they going to do? You're going to ethics probe half of the house. We have added. I mean, they will. But yes, but have at it because we're all in it together and we'll all go. If it's one person, but I think every I think every Republican should say today in the hearing, and just get it out there. Must they opera sing it? Yeah, they must. I think it's right. Yeah. I mean, what's the problem with that? No, I think it's better. They could say, Hey, are we going to break for lunch? Because I'd like some Laguini. Charamel. I would. Oh, I paid big money to hear them work. Charamel in in different ways. Yeah, they tried to go them into saying it in the testimony. If you read the testimony, there's a couple of times Republicans are like, who's that guy that used to work with? He was in this position and it was like three months. You are not going to go the witness into saying Charamel. Oh, so tonight we have our impeachment special. Yeah, you can watch all of this stuff all day and make your head explode. Or you could watch our special tonight and figure out why this must go to the Senate. I think you're going to like it. Well, you're going to actually hate it. What I tell you, you're going to hate, but it's going to be so deeply satisfying. Watch it with your gingerbread man. The best of the Glendbeck program.

Ultimately, Ukraine is on a path to become a full security partner. Which they didn't get from the Obama administration. This is so important for you to understand. They didn't get any of this stuff from the Obama administration, particularly the missiles to take out the tanks. They were not, they were, they were neutering and they're begging for it back in those days. And all of these people that are going to testify today have admitted on the record that the Trump policy toward Ukraine has worked out better than the Obama administration policy. What is it they're changing? They're changing. The main thing was, can you make Ukraine stronger to stand up against Russia? Yes, Trump did it. He did it. He gave that stuff to them. So what is it that they're arguing about? They're arguing about what the policy is and what the state department was doing in Ukraine. But Schiff will not allow any of that testimony in because he says that's all a conspiracy theory. No, it's a conspiracy fact. You go to jail on conspiracy to commit crime. You go to jail. That is a crime. But it has to have facts behind it. And we have the facts. By the way, watch that.

I found that really interesting but only because I know the special tonight and I don't think I can sit through it. That's supposed to be his defense. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program.

Tonight at eight o'clock, I'm going to teach you the difference between conspiracy theories and conspiracy fact. You know, you go to jail for the conspiracy to commit murder. Well, that's not a conspiracy theory. That means you were a part of a conspiracy to commit murder and here are the facts that show you knew exactly what you were doing and you colluded with others. That's conspiracy fact. That's sent you to jail. Conspiracy theories are something that somebody else can do. Tonight, the conspiracy we call the democratic Hydra. Tonight at eight o'clock yesterday, we were on the news and why it matters with Sarah Gonzalez and I asked her if she wanted to read part of the script for for tonight's program to get a handle on it and she said, yes, please. And she's here now. We haven't spoken since you read the script. What do you think? It was unbelievable. Glenn, I I sat at my house last night going through all of it and I, you know, my husband is the director here. And so he's been working with you on getting this all together. And I just kept turning to him and asking him, we really have this. Do we really really have this? Are you kidding? Are you sure? Because what you have is just where we show the evidence, but you don't have the actual evidence. Right. I didn't see it on the page. I just have the words. I don't have the actual evidence here. So it was just truly shocking to know that all of this information is available if you just look. Yeah, it's some of it is kind of hard. Some of it had to come from Freedom of Information Acts, but a lot of it is out there. We have video that they made of it. We have we have letters from the principles written by them that admit to all of it. And you're I'm I was shocked. I was shocked. And that's not all we have. Yeah, that's not all we have. I mean, even even with the Freedom of Information Act, you would think if the media and Democratic lawmakers care so much about influence and interference in the United States elections, that they would be wanting to go to those links to find out things that happened in Ukraine, things, you know, because I mean, we we know already that people were arrested in Ukraine or interfering. You would think that the media might want to go to those links to find out more information about it. So I keep coming back to not in my name, that our money is being used the way it is. And the State Department is is doing what they're doing in our name. I am disgusted by it. Well, you know, the interesting thing to me is there's a whistleblower for Donald Trump, Donald Trump's phone call, right? But there was not a whistleblower on any of the things that you've uncovered that have been happening in the State Department for so long. How is it that we have so many people involved in all of these corrupt dealings that are going on? And we don't have a whistleblower on any of it. So, you know, it's crazy as listening to the impeachment. And this is why it was driving me crazy. I could just couldn't listen to it because they are framing this as Donald Trump who gave them the javelin gave Ukraine the javelin. That's what they have been begging for for, you know, about a decade. Help us. We need tank killers because of Russia. Obama wouldn't do it. Obama wouldn't do it. He was giving him blankets and band-aids and, you know, all kinds of that, you know, that stuff. But what they really needed was a strong military. So Donald Trump comes in and he gives that they all say that was good. This much better than the last administration. He was really helping them. But as soon as he starts to get into, you know, but wait a minute, I thought we weren't nation building. I thought we weren't doing all the things that always get us into trouble. Then they all circle the wagons and they all start to come after him because they've got a good thing going on. And it's not just in Ukraine. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's why, you know, it's it's mind-boggling to think you have this entire group of people working, you know, in government in the state department who it makes you wonder, do they go into it because they're already corrupt? Do they get corrupted when they get there? Are they all kind of brainwashed? You know, it makes you wonder how are they all in on it? I think some of them are brainwashed. Yeah. I mean, it's just the progressive thing. Some of them really, truly believe that this is the right thing because they believe in that one world government and but but to to to really look at it, you know, if they if they weren't involved in it, they would watch tonight's show and they would look at it and they go, could God, that's not good. Yeah. You know what I mean? But it's just normal for them now. What happened with Clinton and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, what they set up is is is insanity. It really truly is insanity. If you think America is the place that is just, you know, look, we want to be there to help people. We want to be there to support people, you know, but we don't want to get involved in your politics. We don't want to start revolutions. We don't want to do that because that has always that that's Bay of Pigs. That is the Shaw of Iran. That is Benghazi. That's Libya. That's the all of the Middle East. That's Iraq, Afghanistan. Tell me where one of these has worked out well. Right. And we're doing it. Even it's not it doesn't stop in Ukraine. Yeah. It's going on not only in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. It's going on now in South America. There were two revolutions going on right now. What a surprise. They were governments that were very pro America, very, very pro free market, you know, conservative really nations. And one of them, one of the leaders just had to leave to Mexico and be granted asylum. Guess who was there stirring it up? Our state department. And it's happening here. It well, you know, the interesting thing to me too, reading this was they come off like they truly are passionate about these causes that they promote, right? Climate change, you know, the border crisis, all of these, all of these issues that they want you to believe they're so passionate about because they care. They're the ones who care. And you look at all of these things that you're going to lay out tonight and you're like, they don't care about any of it. They are using all of these people. Yeah. I mean, you want to talk about useful idiots. They are building an army of useful idiots all around the world, all around the world. And you know, I'm convinced that that's why the whistleblower is not coming. I mean, did you see all the stuff with the whistleblower? I mean, the whistleblowers, his fingerprints are all over everything. He's like, he's not a, he's not a kingpin. He's just, he's like, he's al Capone's accountant. He just knows where everything is. He's involved in everything at a lower level. He's not the idea guy. But that's why they can't have him testify at all. You'll understand why this thing is so scripted and so tight. And no one is allowed on the Republicans side to ask certain questions. And it's because it all leads to this. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's interesting. We are now in a world where you're not supposed to believe your eyes or your ears. You're just so Adam Schiff is going to be there and tell us the truth. Right. But we've got all of this evidence. No, no, no. Adam Schiff will tell you what to believe and what not to believe. They are, you know, I don't think it's a coincidence that you had the whistleblower. It had to be heard. And then five days after our first special, all of a sudden, no, the whistleblower can't be heard. No, we got to protect the whistleblower. I don't even know who the whistleblower is. Said Adam Schiff just a little while ago. Really? I thought he met with you. Yeah. That's insanity. It's insanity. And so they all of a sudden spun on a dime. And I've been watching because I haven't said certain titles and names and things like that because I know what's going to be said. And I am watching what the New York Times, what Adam Schiff and everybody else has put out in the last week. They know exactly what we're on to. And they are laying this groundwork down for the counter attack. And I'm telling you, don't buy into it. And the only way you will buy into it is if you don't watch the special, if you don't see the actual documents, everybody who I have told, you're the second person that's been allowed to see the script. Everyone that I have told, and I mean people in Washington, DC, they've all said the same thing. You can prove that? Yeah. Yeah, I can. It's a conspiracy theory unless you have the documents that prove it. And we do. And it really, it puts into perspective how untouchable these people think that they are, that they would have this sort of a paper trail and not think that they will ever, you know, pay for it. Yeah. That is that that was we looked at documents where and I said, okay, I know this is marked, you know, marked secret or marked, you know, from this person, or it's marked from a FOIA release. Are we sure that that's this this is the actual document? Because it's it's so crazy. It's so crazy that they would write this stuff down. But they think they're right. And they think they can get away with it and who's going to stop them. And that's what they're pro that's what they're showing right now. This is why I say and I mean this sincerely, you have to watch tonight's special because we must insist that this goes to a full open hearing in the Senate and the Senate calls to to witness Chalupa, the ambassadors, the whistleblower, and a few others that you will understand tonight. And they must be called because I swear to you, not in my name, this changes my relation. If this is what America is going to be, then I don't want to be a part of it. I'll go back to the Constitution and I'll live my life. But I'm not answering to a government that is doing this because it's everything that the Democrats say we are. Well, yeah, now we are that. Now we are that. And it's not just our country that's in trouble. It's the entire world. It's the entire world. It's entire world. Okay, so Sarah, we'll be on your show. And I think you're going to help me on my show today at five o'clock and we'll go over some more of this.
