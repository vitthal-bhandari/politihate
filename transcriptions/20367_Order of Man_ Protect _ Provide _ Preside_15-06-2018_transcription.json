    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged. New zealied. Strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on? My name is Ryan Mikler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast. And this movement, the order of man, whether you're new or you've been listening for a little over three years now, I want to welcome you to what I consider to be the best resource when it comes to becoming a better man. My job is to equip you with the tools, the guidance, the direction, the skills, the resources, and through this podcast, the conversations that are going to help you and me and everybody else step up as better. Fathers, husbands, community leaders, business owners, wherever it is that we show up, that's what this podcast is all about. And guys, I've got to tell you, before we get into the show today, I just want to thank you. I could not do this show without you. We could not have this movement without you. The way that we are growing is, it's a testament, a testament to how much this movement and how much this message is needed in society. And again, that's one of restoring and reclaiming what it means to be a man in a society that seems to push that away a little bit or a lot bit. And at a minimum, just seems to dismiss masculinity altogether. We're actually going to be talking about that today. This one's titled, The Systematic Softening of Society. And we're going to be covering that. Now, before I get into the meat of the discussion, I do want to share with you a really quick resource. This is one a little different than I've done in the past. It is through my sponsor's origin main. And I know a lot of you guys have heard about them, looked into their geese and rash guards and training gear and nutritional supplement line. But one thing I haven't talked about is their immersion camp in August, August 26 through September 2. They've got their week-long Brazilian Jiu Jitsu immersion class. I'm going to be out there all week. We've got another half dozen and probably a dozen by the time all of a sudden done. Guys from Order of Man who are going to go out, spend some days out there learning more about Jiu Jitsu. And of course, their story. Jaco's going to be out there. Pete Roberts, the founder and Brian with Origin are going to be there. It's going to be a great week. You can do a week-long or you can split it up. You can do the first half or the second half. And one thing that's really, really cool is we are going to be doing a custom rash guard. And that's going to be an Order of Man rash guard for anybody who shows up and signs up that's part of this movement. So if you head to Order of Man dot com slash immersion. Again, that's Order of Man dot com slash immersion. You can get signed up there again for the first half or second half or all week, which is what I'm going to be doing. And we'll get you a rash guard and we'll roll. And we'll get to know each other and learn how to be better men. It's going to be a great event. So I hope to see you out there. Alright guys, with that said, let me just jump into this. Again, this is titled the Systematic Softening of Society. And it's critical. I mean, critical that we talk about this. Everywhere I look, I see that society is becoming softer, society is becoming weaker. And I think this notion is perpetuated by much of society. That's the school system. That's through the media. That's through entertainment and Hollywood. And I think that we are doing ourselves a huge, huge disservice when we overlook the importance of being strong and tough and gritty and resilient. And all of those things that we would traditionally think of when we think of how a man shows up. Now, I will say this, I'm not suggesting by any means that a man can't be loving and supportive and open and vulnerable. Of course, he can be those things. And I believe that there's a time and a place. But to say that that's always the case. To say that we need to do that more at the expense of these other virtues is again doing ourselves and society in general. Whether that's our families or our employees, our businesses, our neighbors. It's doing all of us a disservice because there will come a point in time where those quote unquote traditional masculine virtues are to be used in order to produce productive outcomes. Typically, we see this in some sort of negative situation, whether that's something in the family like a divorce or the loss of a loved one or being laid off from a job. But it also goes up to natural disasters and emergencies. I think of Hurricane Harvey in Texas was a big deal. Last year also the fires in California. We saw countless men step up and do what it is that men do best. And we also see why this is important in the global arena as well when it comes to conflict in the Middle East or wherever it may be and why it's so important that we learn to harness the power of being tough, resilient, gritty, etc. All right, so we're going to talk about that today. I want to talk with you about some of the consequences and symptoms, I guess you'd say, of this softening of society. I'm going to address that. And I also want to talk about why this is why I believe that this is the case. And I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything like that. But I do think there's some factors at work here that are promoting this idea of clinging to these softer virtues at the expense of the harder virtues. And of course last, we're going to talk about how we can become tougher, how we can be more resilient and more strong. Because the last thing I want to do is have this to be a podcast where I'm just complaining or whining or nagging about a certain topic and not really provide any solutions. So we'll get into that as well. But let's talk about the symptoms first. The first thing that I see is this idea of participation trophies. All right, we've talked about this before. We've had conversations about this before. So anybody who's hearing this podcast and hearing me right now knows what I mean when I say participation trophies. It literally is participation trophies for our children. When they show up, we reward them. We pat them on their head. We tell them they do a good job just simply for showing up as if that's become the new standard of excellence. And every time we reward a child or an employee or a family member or whoever it may be for simply showing up, we actually undermine the standard. We need to be elevating the standard. It's not enough to show up. It's not enough to do the bare minimum. It's not enough just to get by. We need to elevate the standard. So why don't congratulate people like my employees when they show up on time? That sounds absurd. Congratulations. You did your job. That is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not saying we can't acknowledge the behavior, but we certainly don't want to celebrate the behavior because that becomes the new standard. So guys, let's stop giving away participation trophies. Let's stop giving our children gold stars and what little pizza parties and all the stuff that they want when they do something that they just should be doing by default. Let's instead celebrate real victory. Let's instead celebrate real effort so that other people can look at that and say, I want to be recognized. I want to be noticed. Therefore, I'm going to work harder to achieve that because right now you can get the recognition. You can get the praise. You can get the accolades. You can get the positive benefits that come from excelling by doing nothing. Simply doing nothing. That's a huge problem. And along those same lines, and this is point number two I wanted to make, there are no consequences for our decisions anymore. We have absolutely stripped away any consequence of any behavior. And therefore, there is no real problem with just showing up. There's no real problem with just being mediocre. There's no real problem with just being average. I don't want to be average because I know that I'm meant for something more, but there's millions and millions of people out there who are just getting by because they can. Simply because they can. And then when they're presented with a real problem, a real challenge, they don't have the fortitude. They don't have the physical and mental resilience and fortitude to be able to address that real problem. This is a real disservice that we're doing for people here. There has to be consequences for our decisions. It happens at the level of our children. Certainly. We see that. Parents who have no level of structure and guidance in the discipline that goes with raising children. But we also see it as adults. We see it in colleges who don't want to hand out grades. Instead, they just hand out passes. We see that when it comes to maybe somebody being laid off. Instead of being financially destitute, what happens? We give them unemployment benefits. As if they don't have to go out and earn their own way. Now, I realize there's a place and a time for this thing. But again, if there's no consequence for what you're doing, how sad? How sad that we have robbed people of the instant and immediate feedback that is required in order to succeed next time. If there's no consequence to your poor decisions and your poor behavior, can you really say that you'll ever learn the lesson? No. Of course, you'll never learn that lesson. You'll keep repeating the same mistakes over and over and over again simply because you can. So that's point number two, no consequences. Point number three is this attack and it is becoming more apparent that masculinity is under attack. And if not, and I've said this before, at a minimum, it's being dismissed. It's looked down upon. It's frowned upon. It's mocked. It's belittled. It's ridiculed. But nobody does it when men are needed. It's only when times are good. I'm going to talk about that here in a minute. But I want you to look, for example, at the court system. The court system is absolutely stacked against fathers in a situation of divorce and separation. And sure, there might be some reasons for that. And there might be some men who need some of that and women who need to protect their children, of course. But if you look at how stacked the system is against fathers, you begin to see part of the problem. But then we also have this thing called toxic masculinity. As if somehow masculinity or men just because they are, are inherently bad or wrong or evil or whatever it may be. Now I realize that there have been some horrendous, horrendous atrocities in our history on this planet. And without having the specific data in front of me, I would say and be willing to bet that the majority of these atrocities are perpetuated by men. I get that. I understand that. I am not dismissing that. But what I am saying is that just because a man is a man does not mean he's inherently bad, evil, wrong, or whatever the term is that's popular to use. There is an attack. There is a dismissal. There is a belittling and a putting down of masculinity. My job is to raise myself up to raise good, strong, noble, virtuous boys so they can step into what it means to be a man. And of course, equip you again with the tools and resources that you need to do that for yourself and your family and your neighborhood. So again, let me recap those real quick and then we'll get into why I think this is the case. Number one, participation trophies. Number two, the lack of consequences for our choices and number three, this attack and dismissal of masculinity altogether. So let's talk about the reasons for this. Again, I'm not a conspiracy theorist kind of guy, but very simply I believe that we are being led to believe and lead these lives of mediocrity. And I think part of the reason is because we are so weak and pathetic that we refuse to allow anybody to feel bad. That is a problem. So we can't let anybody fail and in order to keep people from failing, we then cannot let anybody succeed. We have to make sure that everybody is at the same level because if everybody is at the same level, then there will be no losers. But guess what? I've got news for you. If you don't already know this, if there's no losers, there's no winners. And if there's no winners, then we are living life significantly less than we are capable of as a society. It's a shame. I hate to see that people will fall behind. I hate to see people in poverty. I hate to see people who have lived with horrible medical conditions. I hate to see people have bad things happen to them. But a lot of that is because of their own choices. And a lot of that is because going back to what I said earlier, we have robbed them of the consequences of their decisions. So they keep making the dumb mistakes over and over and over again. And rather than let them learn a lesson, what have we as a society tried to do? Save them. We've tried to play the superhero. We've tried to come in and rescue people. The problem is, is you can't rescue anybody who doesn't want to be rescued. And when you do rescue people, you rob them of the experience that they need in order to develop the skills to be stronger and tougher and more resilient next time. I'll give you an example. I was at the pool this weekend with my children. And I took my seven year old son who is learning to swim. He can swim, but he's not strong yet. And I took him and I literally threw him in the deep end. Now most people will hear that and think, oh my gosh, how could you as a parent do that? Well number one, I'm not going to let the kid drown. Number two, he can swim. He knows to swim to the side. Number three, I'm right there. So I threw him out into the deep end and I saw him doggy paddling and kicking and fighting and paddling his little legs and his little arms as hard as he was. His little arms as hard as he could and he went under the water and he came back up and he took a breath. I mean, he was really struggling. And I almost went over and swam to him to rescue him. But I said, you know what, he's okay. He can do this. And he was. He swam over to the side. He struggled. It was hard for him. He swam over to the side. And guess what? Now he's stronger. All right, he's stronger. He's more equipped. He's more capable of doing it next time. Very small example. But I think it illustrates perfectly what we've done in society today when we rob the people of their consequences and we allow them to be weak. We allow them to be mediocre and we allow them to continue to make the same mistakes over and over again. Now the second element of this, you guys, is that weak people are easier to control. Think about this. Weak people are easier to control. Why? Because they're more dependent. More dependent on their employers. More dependent on their family. More dependent on society and government subsidies and handouts. And so weak people are more easily controlled. They are the cog in the wheel. Men represent the last line of defense against any possible threat to ourselves, to our families, our businesses, our communities and our nations. If we are weak, we are more easily controlled. We are more easily manipulated and we are more easily put into position to allow the higher ups or the powers that be to do what it is they want to do. Again, I'm not suggesting there's some grand conspiracy here. But what I am suggesting is that there are some powerful people who wish to remain so powerful that they will do and say whatever they can in order to keep everything the same, to maintain the status quo. And part of that is ensuring that the people who are serving them are weak. Again, men represent, or they should at least represent the last line of defense. This requires us to be independent. It requires us to think for ourselves. It requires us to be physically and mentally tough and capable and strong. And it requires us to break away from the dependence that so many of us have been living on for so long. All right, with that said, now I've spent the last 20 minutes or so telling you about the problem. We've talked about the symptoms. We've talked about why I believe this is the case. And if you agree with me, great. I'd love to have a discussion about that. If you disagree, great. I'd love to have a discussion about that. Let's really figure this out so we can create some solutions moving forward. I've proposed for here that I've got that I want to share with you here today. All right, number one, I believe it is a man's responsibility to become physically fit. Obviously, building muscle, building strength, stamina, all of those things is going to help you become physically stronger. But all of what's required in order to become physically stronger, discipline, commitment, sacrifice, all of that is the same thing that's required to build up your mental fortitude. You cannot make decisions in a vacuum. If you improve in one area of your life, in this case, physical fitness, then you will naturally and inevitably produce and be better in other areas of your life. If you are physically strong, you will also be mentally stronger. And that will then come into other areas of your life, like your fitness, your relationships, your business, every area of life. Number one, become physically strong. If you are weak, if you are out of shape, if you are overweight, you are more dependent on factors that you cannot control, whether that's medication, whether that's the doctors that you have to go visit, whether that's worrying about does your insurance pay for x, y, and z. But guess what? If you're healthy and you're strong, you don't have to worry about that stuff as much. And you can focus your time and your resources and your attention on things that should be more pressing as opposed to your physical health. Number one, become physically fit. Number two, do things that scare you every single day. Every single day, you should be doing something that pushes you outside of your comfort zone, that makes you feel uncomfortable, that makes you feel out of place, that pushes you, that tests you, the more that you can do that, the stronger that you're going to be. I'll give you a couple of examples. About four weeks ago, I started taking jujitsu, never done it before, walked into the gym, felt completely out of place, awkward, uncomfortable, and I dove right in. Why? Because I know that if I try these new experiences and I do the things that scare me mentally, emotionally, physically, then I will be stronger than I was before. And that's important for me. Also, just last week, I committed to doing a marathon. I hate running. I despise running. I've probably never ran more than five or six miles at any given time in my entire life, and I committed to running 26 plus miles. Why? Because I don't want to. Because it scares me. Because it's going to push me outside of my current comfort zone. It's going to be painful. It's going to be uncomfortable. I probably won't enjoy a lot of it. But I know that I'm going to come out of it a stronger man than I was before. So as I go through these solutions for you, I want you to think about what you can do in your life to produce similar results. So with step number one, where I said to become physically fit, I want you to write down the things that you can do to be physically fit. Is it working out? Three times a week? Is it getting up and drinking more water? Is it getting more sleep? Is it going for more runs? Is it getting a coach? What does that look like? Number two, do things that scare you. Get a piece of paper out. Write down the things that you know will push you outside of your comfort zone, public speaking. Going into a new gym, participating in a new hobby, asking that woman you've had your eye on out on a date. Make a list of all the things that scare you and literally start checking those off. Alright, so number one, become physically fit. Number two, do things that scare you every single day. Number three, spend time around masculine men. Alright, if you're hanging out with women and you're hanging out with boys and you're hanging out with immature men, you're never going to build up your strength. If on the other hand, you spend time around guys who are physically strong, mentally tough. The guys that are doing the things that we traditionally think of when we think of manly, and you do more of that, you will inevitably have a desire to be more like that. It's always been said and I hate using the adage, but it's an adage because it's true that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. So if the people you spend time with are weak and cowardly and soft and pathetic, it's likely that you'll start to exhibit more and more of those characteristics. If on the other hand, the men that you hang out with and the people that you spend time with are tough and gritty and resolute and strong, you are more likely to exhibit those traits because you will see what they're doing. You'll see how they're behaving. You'll see the way that they interact and that will be attractive to you. You will want to be more like that. You will do the things that they do in order to achieve those type of results. And number four, and this can be so comprehensive. I can talk about this by its own podcast and maybe I will down the road. But number four is become independent. In February of this year, I wrote a book and finished the book called Sovereignty, The Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men. That's what this book is all about. It's becoming sovereign. It's about living by your own rules. It's about being fully capable of taking care of yourself. It's about not being subject to anything or anyone and becoming completely independent. Wrestling back the control that you've been giving to your spouse and your boss and your friends and your parents and the government and this and that. And you do that when you make excuses and you make little lies and you fabricate stories in your own head to justify your softness and your mediocrity. We've got to strip away those lies. We've got to reclaim our sovereignty. We've got to be, again, physically strong. So we're not beholden to an insurance company or a doctor's office or a medication in order to live the lives that we want to live. We've got to get our financial house in order. If you're in debt up to your eyeballs, you have subjected yourself to the financial institutions that would love to keep you enslaved. Get your financial house in order. Develop a new skill. Make some more money. Pay off your debt. Stash a little money under your mattress. Put it in a savings account. Invest your money. Be wise and be financially free. Sovereignty also comes into play at your work. Whether you're an employee or whether you're a boss or entrepreneur or a business owner, you need to maintain your sovereignty. How do you do this? By making yourself indispensable. Learning new skills, developing new skills, making your boss look good, spending more time, getting there early, leaving late, skipping the lunch break, excelling, doing the things that nobody else wants to do, signing up for new projects, getting new degrees and designations so that you can learn to make more money. You can learn to be more valuable to your coworkers and your boss. And that way you put yourself in the position of authority rather than giving the authority that you should maintain for yourself to somebody else. Step number four, guys. Become a sovereign man. Do not live beholden to anyone. These are the ways that we develop our strength. This is the way that we wrestle back the strength and the fortitude and the grit and the resiliency and the resolve that we need to display. I'll tell you what, on our final note here. It's easy for people to mock and ridicule and be little and put down these masculine virtues in times of relative peace. We do. If you think about economically, if you think about from a safety standpoint, we are pretty secure, which is why people can complain about masculinity. But I'll tell you what, there's going to come a point in our lives, each and every one of our lives, whether it's a divorce, a bankruptcy, a job loss, a disability, a death of a loved one, a lawsuit, a natural disaster, an emergency, a car wreck, a potential military conflict where we as men will be called upon again. And those people who are complaining about masculinity and belittling what it means to be a man are the ones who at that point are going to call on you to do what you were born to do. The question is, will we be ready to do it? Guys, we live in an era where being soft and being weak and being pathetic is accepted and not only accepted, it's encouraged. We can do that because again, we live in a time of relative prosperity, but there will come a time where you will be called to be the man you're capable of being. And that's going to require you to be strong and tough and resilient. I hope that I am adequately prepared for that day. And the best way to do this again as a recap is to become physically fit. It's to do the things that scare you every single day. It's to spend time around other strong and masculine men. And it's to become independent, to become that sovereign man. So guys, I hope that helps. I would love to hear what you think. If you believe in what I believe, if you don't believe in what I believe, I would love to have a conversation with you. You can do that on any of our social media profiles. You can go to Instagram at Ryan Mickler. The other one I'm very active in is Facebook. So go to facebook.com slash groups slash order of man where we will continue this discussion. Until next week, gentlemen, take action. Become strong, become tough, become resilient, become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
