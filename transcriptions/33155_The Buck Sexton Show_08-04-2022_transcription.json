    "text": " You're listening to the Fucks Exten Show Podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Team welcome to the Freedom Hut Friday, April 8th. My other time flies down here in West Palm Beach. So much to discuss today. We have the CEO of Disney, Chapak, Graveling that he has not been enough of an ally to the LGBTQ plus plus community. New Jersey it turns out is going to require second graders to learn gender identity stuff, including just because you have boy parts. Maybe you're a girl to second graders. So this is actually happening, folks. This is a real program of the left and Pelosi blames AOC and Jayapal in Congress for trying to be queen B of the left. And this has negative consequences. Of course, the Democrat party because turns out people don't like when everyone is insane and things are getting ruined all around them. Cities are going to hell, all of that stuff. So we'll get into it in a moment. For Deputy U.S. marshals deployed under president Trump to protect and defend a federal courthouse in Portland during the riots of 2020 are being sued by the ACLU. The Department of Justice under the Biden administration will not agree to provide an attorney to defend them from these outrageous allegations. These brave officers withstood physical harm repelling riders. You remember the images of salts, fires, flying objects, noxious chemicals and explosive devices with a liberal media on the offensive against the police. Learn about these family men with stellar service to country at police defense dot org. The law enforcement legal defense fund at police defense dot org educates the public on the risks and threats associated with being an officer today and raises funds to alleviate financial burdens. In this case, hundreds of thousands in mounting legal fees and at risk of losing their homes. Help these officers today donate at police defense dot org. That's police defense dot org. People should understand that the left is not upset that they're, uh, that they're being misrepresented here. It's not that they are having their agenda misrepresented. It's that parents are finding out about the agenda. That's the big change here. And here we have Disney CEO. This is just an example of it. Okay. Disney is the company that most people would think of maybe PBS with Sesame Street. But Disney's is the company that most people think of as safe for kids, all American as American as apple pie, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, you know, it's, this is supposed to be American dream land for little kids and families. And there's something else going on here for sure. The Disney CEO is relatively new CEO, Bob Chappec. He is doing what, what in communist countries, they would call a a struggle session. Right. He's groveling. He's apologizing. He's pledging to be a better ally for the LGBTQ Q plus community. Here is play 18. I pledged to be a better ally for the LGBTQ plus community. Apologize for not being the ally that you needed me to be and committed to ensuring that our company lives up to its values. I know that we've got work to do and that work starts with listening. I understand that we've made mistakes and the pain that those mistakes have caused. And I know that our silence wasn't just about the bill in Florida, but about every time an individual or institution that should have stood up for this community did not. We know the moment requires urgency and words are not enough. So we are taking some actions right now. Oh, words are not enough. We're going to take actions. I'm so sorry that we haven't done everything necessary to make the activists left in the transit agenda. They represent feel like we're bending the knee fast enough and deep enough. Hmm. It's pretty pathetic. Isn't it? This guy's a CEO of Disney. Not a good enough ally. The law is the law, folks, and state law just passed in Florida and Disney has to abide by it too. And I do think that Disney should lose the extended patent protection that it keeps getting on Mickey Mouse, for example. It's been over a hundred years, folks. Should pass into the public domain. I've been seeing some conversation about this people say, well, you don't support intellectual property. It's not of course I do, but there are limits to it, just like there are limits to every right. There are in fact limits to it. And it shouldn't just be that corporations get a special carve out if they make enough money and have enough political influence to keep on using the intellectual property law in a way that others cannot because they're influential. So, you know, take away that. I mean, it's time to stop extending their special protection for intellectual property. But beyond that, beyond that, I think what we see here is that it's never enough that what's going on with the Disney CEO shows you that even when you do what the left wants, then you've just admitted that you can be a pawn for the agenda. Then you've just told them essentially, hey, next time you want me to do something, I'll jump even higher. I'll run even faster. Whatever you say, sir, that's what will go on here. The point is it's never enough. It's never going to be enough. They're never going to be satisfied. And you will only you will only be telling them that you are a pawn for their agenda. Whenever it is that you are, you know, ready for their usage, right, that they will deploy you again because it's impossible. You cannot placate the woke monster. It's not enough. It's never enough. And then on this, I mentioned this New Jersey. New Jersey, for example, is a place where they're going to, for second graders, teach about gender identity. Starting in the fall and the 2022, 2023 New Jersey state sexual education guidelines. This is up on Fox News right now. One lesson plan, purple, pink and blue instructs teachers to talk to their first graders about gender identity. And its first objective is to have the students be able to define gender identity and gender role stereotypes. The lessons second objective is to have students name at least two things they've been taught about gender role stereotypes and how those things may limit people of all genders. Gender gender identity is that feeling of knowing your gender. You might feel like you're a boy. You might feel like you are a girl. The lesson plan states. You might feel like you're a boy. Even if you have body parts that some people might tell you are girl parts. You might feel like you're a girl. Even if you have body parts that some people might tell you are boy parts. No, it's not that people are telling anybody that they're boy parts. They are boy parts or girl parts. This is reality based. This is objective truth. This is not opinion. And anyone is as well. But what about the, you know, one in a hundred thousand people that are intersects. That's not what they're talking about. And they don't want to teach kids about being intersex because that's such a small portion of the population intersex used to be referred to as being a hermaphrodite. That's where you have some usually vestigial components of a female or it's essentially a little bit of a, of a crossover within the, between the two genders at some level. But that's not what transgenderism is about because almost always people who are intersex choose to live their lives as either one or the other based upon what is predominant in the characteristics, the physical characteristics that they have. And usually it's much more one than the other, so to speak. But now we're getting down into scientific anomaly. Really, we're getting down into the scientific rarity. You know, at some level, it starts to get into crazy town. At some level, it's so silly that why are we even talking about it? For example, should we have, should we have different seats on all airplanes because there, there is such a thing as conjoined twins. So you can have people that have to sit together and can't sit at a normal airline seat. Why are people so bigoted against conjoined twins all over the world? Say, well, that's, that's very, very rare. I think conjoined twins is like a one in a million, maybe even less than that situation. Well, why, why aren't you catering to the needs of the conjoined twin community? You see how they do this? They take what is anomalous and what is rare and then use that to batter down reason, logic and reality so that they can get a whole other wave of concessions that have nothing to do with the initial issue that they were discussing. And this is what you see with the, the phenomenon of the trans agenda. And they really are pushing this stuff on kids. I'm, it's remarkable. I'll be honest with you. I'm surprised at how open they are about this. I thought they would do. What the CRT debate, what they did was they retreated a little bit. They retreated in the CRT debate so that they would say, oh, it's not really CRT. You don't know what CRT. They tried all these different games. They really didn't come out right away and say, yeah, we're actually teaching white kids that there are pressers, you know, in the first grade and black kids that they're victims in the first grade and making them do privilege walks and all this stuff. They didn't come out and say that. They tried to hide it with this, with the trans agenda, what you're seeing, I guess the activists either can't help themselves or the Democrat party can't actually get them to come in line on this issue because the activist community is essentially saying, yep, that's right. You're seeing more and more of this. That's right. We, we do want to talk about pansexual and transsexual and I just by romantic asexual was the latest thing I saw from Disney, a by romantic asexual. I'm going to tell you something. I have, I had a pretty big vocabulary in my academic days and rarely did I come across a word or a phrase that I was entirely unfamiliar with. And I had never heard that one until yesterday. A by romantic. So not even a bisexual, a by romantic asexual. I mean, I understand they can, you can figure out what the term kind of means, but so, so we're supposed to talk about this as some, these are fringe psychiatric theories essentially that only exist in the far left and on, on very kind of wacko out there, left wing journals of psychiatry or whatever. And we're all supposed to be held to account for not understanding or catering to these things by romantic asexual. Does, does anyone listening to this? Have you ever heard that term before? I'm going to guess not a single person right now listening has heard that term before, but this is the left is they're going for it. This is the agenda. They're, it's not that it's being misrepresented. It's that people know what the agenda is. That's why the left is, is concerned, but they're also unwilling to hide it. It's why there's so much anger. It's why they get so angry about the term groomer being used as well. We're going to talk about the border here in a second and Pelosi throwing some, some shade at the far left of her own party, throwing some, some stink eye at Democrats who are making it hard for the Democrat, for the big Democrat party, big D Democrat party to fool enough Americans to keep them in power.

Got a piece up at Fox news dot com, which I hope you will take a moment to read. It's pretty, pretty important stuff. And it's that the Biden border policies are going to make, are going to make this the worst, the worst border crisis of all time. You're looking right now, you are looking right now at the worst border crisis ever. And the Biden administration has no, has no plan to stop this from happening. Here's Secretary of Mayorkas trying to tell you, Oh no, we don't know if lifting title 42 will make it worse. Play clip, play clip three. It's very difficult to predict what that migration will be, but we are planning for different scenarios. We are then at the border, surging resources, what distinguishes us from the past is the fact that we will not implement policies of cruelty that disregard our asylum laws. We are rebuilding a system that was entirely dismantled. But you acknowledge you're likely going to see a surge. We very well could. And our job is to be prepared to address it. They're definitely going to see a search, a huge search. And they're not going to address it. If by address it, you mean change the incentive. That is the key. Change the incentive structure for people who want to come into the United States illegally. If they know they can easily come here and stay here, that's it. That's the end. If they know they can come here and stay, that will be how they make the decision. And that is currently the situation is going to be even more so the situation when title 42 is lifted. It's outrageous, outrageous that this is what's going on right now. And they know it's going to happen, but they have to pretend like they're not sure because when this crisis blows up, they're going to say, Oh, who could have known we could have never understood. Oh my gosh, I had no idea. They know, they know it's crazy what they are doing right now. It's absurd what they are doing right now. But the alternative would be to go back and say, to go back and say that they want an open border, they want illegality and they don't care and they won't admit that. They won't admit that. So they have to play these games where it's like, Oh, we're trying asylum. The people coming to this country are not legitimate asylum seekers in over 90% of cases, probably 95, 99% of cases, but they're just pretending so they can get into the country. Right? I mean, this is the equivalent of, you know, if you showed up to, you know, a fundraiser and they were, you know, and you said, well, hold on a second, they're going to check you in. They're going to check to see if you have a ticket. Did you pay to get into the fundraiser for, you know, some charity and you go, no, no, no, hold on a second. I'm just going to let me just walk in. I just want to say hi to a friend and they go, okay, well, I'm not going to tell you can't. And then you just walk in because you don't have a ticket. That's basically what they're doing via silom says, Oh, yeah, no, no, I want to, I want to get asylum. And then they never actually show up to see if they can get asylum. They're just waiting until the moment that the federal government's head is turned, so to speak. And then they just, they just go. They're gone. Why even have a legal immigration? If this is such a good thing, if the Democrats want us to have millions and millions of people just coming into the country, no process, no vetting, no nothing, why don't they just advocate for that? Why, because they know the American people aren't with them yet. It's just about power. Why don't they have the courage of their convictions to make the case? You'll hear Democrats say, well, I think everybody should call them. We're a nation of immigrants. Okay. Put that case to the American people. Do we think that anybody should be able to come and go as they please? By the way, when should they be able to vote? Why shouldn't people be able to vote the day they get here illegally, legally? Right? I mean, really start to think through this stuff. What does sovereignty even mean? What does citizenship even mean? Democrats are eroding all of this. They're destroying it. They don't care. They don't care. Look at how crazy the left, which is the Democrat party. Now they're one on the same. Look at how crazy they've been in recent years over COVID over spending over the transgender issue. By the way, I wanted to play this before. I wanted to get to this. You have I've told you many times that what they say in the past is, you know, they're not going to do. It's crazy. You fast forward and sure enough, that's exactly what they do. Here was on HBO's Bill Marshall, the formidable and esteemed Dennis Prager is telling Bill Mar the truth of the left. And here's how Bill and the audience reacts. This is back in 2019, not long ago, play 15. You say that men can menstruate is a lie. And that is now that is what it said. Check it out, folks. Check it out. Anyone who says men will not menstruate is considered transphobic. I missed this whole story. Are you kidding? I'm not telling me where you're getting this. So where are you getting this? Just Google it. Can men menstruate? Who is saying this? You're saying it very small. Not really. That how do you allow men, biological men, to run against women in the races in Connecticut and set all the high school records? I know. You see, I wouldn't say they're women. But I would agree with you on that. The way you've framed it is nonsense. This is a far cry from saying men can menstruate. I agree. No, it's actually not. It's not where anyone else is. That's true. You said that we think that men menstruate and no one does. I would make a friendly bet that the LGBTQ normative statement is men can menstruate. He was 100% right as we all know now. But notice how that audience of idiot lives in California. He's so dumb. No, he was right. He was right then. Now, that is the idiotic claim of the left. Men can menstruate. They say it all the time. You see it all the time. That is what the left believes. This is also why I'm not going to get into this that much now. But Nancy Pelosi is saying, you know, even she's saying, you know, trying to, trying to fool the simple tins into thinking that the Democrats aren't a radical left Marxist insane party now. It's getting too hard for her. She's complaining. AOC is making her job too hard. You know, Pelosi with her Chanel scarves and her, you know, $15,000 pearl necklaces and everything else. She's, she's trying to make people think, Oh, it's all fine. It's fine. We're just the nice people. We're the Democrats. But AOC is like, no, we're a bunch of Marxists who want to support the trans agenda as it pertains to children. I mean, they, they say this on the left out loud now and I, and even Pelosi's like, you're making my fraud much tougher. You're making the con much harder to pull off. I got to leave it there today, folks. Hope you have a great weekend. Thanks for hanging out with me. I will talk to you on Monday. Shields high."
