    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks sexton show podcast second hour of the clay Travis and bucks sexton show is here and Biden Finishing up here is addressed to the nation about the recession that we're in but they just want to talk about legislation a whole gosh There's so much to be said about this. I've been watching all. Let's join the Biden speech in progress here if we can bring it up there Mike. I hope that the housing is fastest bill today My plea is put politics aside Get it done We need to lower the cost of automobiles appliances smartphones consumer electronics and so much more And you can't do it all of these things are powered most everything is in our lives of power by these semiconductors and tiny computer chips The size of a fingernail tip Look we should pass this today and get moving. I Know the compromise on the inflation bill doesn't include everything that I've been pushing for since I got to office For example, I'm gonna keep fighting for in the future to bring down the cost of things for working families and middle-class families that matter By providing for affordable accessible things like affordable childcare Affordable elder care preschool call the cost of preschool housing alright, we get it we get the idea I just I Took some notes while we were in a commercial break there Biden got into most of what he's talking about let's all understand this for what it is folks. This was all planned This legislation and this was the plan all along obviously This has been the plan for days if not weeks that on the day The the Biden recession is official Joe Manchin suddenly caves and they have this scale down build back a little bit better a version of the build back better bill Which is exactly what this is and the fact that they're calling it an anti the anti inflation act or something like that is absolutely absurd the inflation reduction act of 2022 This though is an important moment because as you hear Biden Blathering on about this and let's let's all be very honest The only jobs Joe Biden really knows how to create are for family members like Hunter who are selling Influence to countries like China and to corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs. He's not really a job creator. He's a lifelong bureaucrat so He keeps saying we're gonna bring down the price of we're gonna bring down the price of it's actually not the job of government To set prices that's called price controls and it is really bad for an economy and it creates all kinds of distortions in the market and This is what I mentioned Venezuela in last hour One of the one of the worst things that they did a lot of bad things in Venezuela Remember it went from a pretty wealthy country third wealthiest in the Western Hemisphere in the 90s to a place with true hyperinflation And people losing weight because they can't even get enough calories because there's no food on the shelves What do they do there? Well, they obviously made a lot of poor decisions. They ran a an economy rooted in social justice and not functioning markets You know they decided to become truly socialist in so many of the ways that they approached everything but they set price controls They said okay, this is no longer the price of of bread the price of milk The price of a washing machine is what we say it is. You know what that results in? No washing machines. No bread no milk or the black market Then actually has people paying the real price for it So this idea that Biden at a time of inflation which is caused by Government monetary policy should just be telling us that they're gonna set prices lower for things Which is a huge part of this they're saying oh, they're gonna have a a cap on the price of prescription drugs $2,000 a year for those who are in Medicare Obviously, this is meant to get seniors who are getting crushed right now by the Biden economy by the Biden Recession to say oh well hold on a second at least I'll be saving on your on my prescriptions first of all You're not gonna be saving anything else even with this bill and second of all well What happens to the actual price of those of the pharmaceuticals now? That's the thing that they're going to focus on That's what they're going to tell you is a place of of real benefit. They're gonna spend a lot less time on the 125 billion dollars that they think they're gonna get from increased IRS enforcement They're going to sick the tax man on you That's the plan they're gonna squeeze more at it. We're in a recession and the Democrats just passed a or are passing a bill That is gonna have the IRS Go after you much more aggressively than they have in the past So that's a part of this that I think everybody should be aware of but but they're really insane stuff And isn't it all just so clear right that they knew they had to throw something together They had to pull something together. So on the day we are in the Biden recession They pass this Biden legislation through reconciliation mind you Which is really a Budget gimmick it shouldn't be used for things like this, but that's what they do You will call they even use reconciliation to get a part of Obamacare through not all of it But a part of it through And and this is now a standard that they've said in DC where the Democrats when they really want something They just change the rules or find some loophole find some way To sneak it through and then they tell us how popular it is and how everybody wants it Well, why why can't you get more votes for it if it's so popular if the American people? want it so badly but The climate crisis component of this I Just want every person in America to know that at a time when you're paying record high gas prices We still have not caught up to our domestic energy production That we had before the pandemic we have a Democrat party that is ludicrously opposed To fossil fuels and to the reality of our need for oil at natural gas to have a modern economy to have a high standard of living To be energy independent to have more leverage Around the world when it comes to national security and comes to international commerce They hate this stuff because it's yucky because co2 is so bad They have convinced themselves of this and we are all supposed to go along willingly with the 360 billion dollars they're gonna spend Biden said in his speech this now the most Consequential he called it or significant rather the most significant bill in history to address the climate crisis 300 and something Billion dollars 360 plus billion dollars of spending and even said the words, you know what's coming wind solar This is a religious belief for Democrats. They they will invoke the Defense Production Act in the Biden administration for solar panels But when it comes to gas every gas company CEO you speak to Everybody who understands the international energy markets will tell you that the Biden regime is Psychotically deeply ideologically opposed to fossil fuels and we are all poorer as a result as a country are National security and economic status is harmed by this It just is they can tell you as much as they want but all we're gonna have the clean energy of the future They're talking about on this bill You know a huge reduction in co2 by 2030 and and carbon zero by 2050 These people are out of their money these Democrats and these are senators They are out of their minds if they believe this it's just really tough to tell are they that reckless? Are they such frauds that they pretend to believe this stuff while they purchase beachfront property? While they make sure that they live as close to the water as possible even though hmm I thought we're supposed to be under the water even got a shout out in that Biden speech to Al Gore Even Al Gore says it's good. Oh well, then you know it's crap if Al Gore likes it This is a whole bunch of taxpayer money going toward Green New Deal boondoggles This is gonna be Cylindra on steroids you remember Cylindra? That was under the Obama administration. It was the loan guarantees courtesy of the taxpayer for a solar Panel company that was losing money on every unit it sold There's an old joke that they were losing money on units, but they'd make it up on volume You know that's the plan of a bad business. That was what Cylindra was doing they were selling solar panels at a loss and the federal government Backstop this company under Obama to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and For what well because it makes them feel like they're doing more to doing more to stop all the co2 emissions Notice how Tesla Elon Musk's company and Elon has said this if you really are opposed to co2 you would constantly be touting How Tesla has really revolutionized the electric car market made them Things that people want to drive not that they drive so they can say to the neighbors look at me I'm stopping the global warming and you're not They're actually cool vehicles that function well that go fast that have good electronics, etc But they hate Elon Musk why he's Elon Musk isn't one of these climate drones who wanders around Bemoaning how everybody else Needs to be riding on a bicycle and needs to be eating eating worms and insects Because beef creates too much co2 you may not have seen this but The tyrant to the north Justin Trudeau up in Canada He saw what's going on in the Netherlands with the farmers there remember Netherlands is second biggest exporter of agricultural products in the world it's a tiny country It's a pretty amazing statistic isn't it? And the so the farmers are a big deal there big deal for the economy big deal globally At a time when we're already worried about the supply chain and how it will affect Food wheat prices and all the rest of it Trudeau saw what's gone on over the Netherlands. He goes. Oh wow. That's great. Yeah, let's do that in Canada And now he's pushing to have a similar Mandate in Canada that would essentially put a lot of farmers either out of business or dramatically reduce their ability to produce why climate change Don't forget for one second And I was saying this in the beginning those of you who were listening to the bucks accident show back in 2020 when I was doing radio Before I teamed up with clay. I know this The whole pandemic lockdown listened to the science emergency emergency shut up do what we tell you movement that they created under the broad rubric of fauciism They Aren't gonna just stop with The virus and of course they're trying to resurrect that plan right now with the next variant They also want to do that on climate. This is why they use phrases constantly like an existential crisis an Existential crisis is something you can effectively do anything to address because nothing could be more important than that Nothing could be more important including the u.s. Economy Including your ability to pay your bills Including growth productivity prosperity economic freedom none of that To a true believer Democrat can get in the way of the green new deal agenda because they are in their minds saving the planet and If you think that's any kind of exaggeration at this moment in time We have just entered 0.9 percent for the second quarter down 1.6 percent down in the first quarter We are in the Biden recession and what do they do in this moment? They try to buy off the votes of seniors with a promise to reduce their their prescription drugs while you're everything else is more expensive Your mortgage is more expensive everything else is is getting is getting worse right now the cost of groceries cost of gas You try to buy off seniors with this prescription drug plan While they also spend three hundred and sixty nine billion dollars on completely worthless and absurd climate pet projects That's how devoted to this they are in this moment This is what the Biden regime does Look we have to absolutely crush them in the midterms Take away Biden's ability to continue to do damage Because a reasonable person would see what the Biden policies have done up to this point and change course You know what today was? Hey, yeah, we're in a recession. You know we're doing doubling down on Biden is impesence deal with it Doubling down right now. That's what they just announced you. That's what they're doing and all that stuff about Joe Manchin being saying it all West Virginia. What are you doing? And no West Virginia should ever cast a vote for Joe Manchin again. What are you doing voting for that guy? You're a red state.

How many Eagles have you gotten so far so far no Eagles? Nor have I killed anyone which was the the gold buck the best shot I've had Was an approach on nine that I just hit Downside is the approach on nine came from the fairway on one so I was not exactly in the prime golfing position I have one part through the first nine. I'm at the turn. This course is amazing. I mean just absolutely fantastic And I'm playing with Brooks kept gift Which is pretty fantastic obviously You know you can see the guys crush the ball in television But standing in the tee box and watching them crush it is a different world and also a different level of pressure Because you're not just out playing with your buddies. You're out playing with pros not that they care where I hit it But them standing over your shoulder is definitely a different dynamic Is it a best ball situation or are you are you doing your own thing? He's doing his own thing He's doing his own thing But if we par the Amateurs so I'm here with Chris Harrison who you coached hosted the bachelor and the bachelor at forever Charles Barkley's out here I think I'm gonna have some of those guys Talk to us at the end of the round and break this all down We should have some fun audio tomorrow and for people out there. We're gonna be live with President Trump tomorrow And he's out on the course right now And it's been a lot of fun, but it is his game by the way is he a big hitter of the Trump He's a pretty good player And he plays a lot so he's got a great deal of talent. So it's a it's a lot of fun And I can't wait tomorrow. I think you're gonna love it out here. I believe we're starting off the show with President Trump That'll be fantastic Clay Travis needs to focus on his game. He's gonna win this program out live in Bedminster clay if you want to call back in later give us a ring and I'll see you tomorrow Yeah, for sure. I'll give you an update when we get to about four or five more holes in hope everybody's having a fantastic Thursday I'd be playing on this course Fantastic Clay Travis everybody out there Doing the golf thing. I wish I could I don't I didn't even play golf, but I'm working on it Clay is surrounded by very talented athletes on that golf course is you know There's no shortage of energy and if you're running with that crowd today, you're gonna want the benefits of relying on chalk for their supplements They're made with herbal ingredients that improve energy and testosterone levels. Give you the benefit of increased focus You don't want to be hitting them from the close tees, right? You want to be while upping that ball Chalk will help with that chalk is determined to help men and women in America Maximize their everyday experience with clinically proven formulas start with their everyday male vitality stack It's a combination of three daily supplements that work to make you feel your very best Just the replenishment alone of testosterone and men in this country makes all the difference average testosterone levels in this country down over 50% of the last 50 years with chalk you can improve your testosterone by 20% In just three months time get yourself set up with a subscription to chalks products And you'll be setting new records out at the golf course and other places to go online to chalk calm that CH O Q Dot-com use my name buck and the number 95 for 95% off that CH O Q comm promo code buck 95 for 95 percent off both chairman Powell and many of the significant banking Personnel and economist say we're not in recession Let me just give you what the facts are in terms of the state of economy number one We've a record job market of record unemployment of 3.6% today We've created nine million new jobs so far just as it become president Passing the chip bill is going to put another 72 billion dollars for incentives and tax credits to expand semi-conductor production and the Inflation Reduction Act will add another 370 billion dollars in clean energy tax credits in Reconciliation Including incentives to accelerate domestic production of solar panels wind turbines batteries and critical materials Processing that doesn't sound like a recession to me Well, it is a recession there Joe You can spin it as fast and as hard as you want. It's still gonna be a recession No one believes is nine Million job figure. I mean this is just ridiculous I created our million jobs Yeah, really You mean you're counting jobs that came back online because you were no longer Like a maniac shutting down businesses with COVID lockdowns and COVID restrictions that did nothing to help Anybody when it comes to the actual COVID virus you're gonna you're gonna count those as jobs created At least in the Obama administration you all probably remember this they came up with a brand new metric jobs created or saved That was what they were always saying because you'll note in the first couple years of the Obama administration It was a bad economy too and it led to the Tea Party wave in 2010 Because people were like, oh, this isn't going the slowest here's what they had to deal with the slowest recovery out of a recession since the Great Depression that was the the salient that was the the critical statistic the central truth of Basically a increasingly socialist Democrat Party in charge just makes everything go more slowly less prosperity less growth Less wealth to go around for everybody What's that old Churchill line that capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings that socialism is the equal sharing of misery? That's really the ethos of the of the Democrats especially the very rich Democrats They want the system for everybody else as long as they get to stay Shielded from it all as long as they get to remain part of the elite and then then the peasants can eat their bugs and You know ride their bikes and save up one day, you know 10 years from now from now for a Electric vehicle that doesn't work very well, right? This is this is their vision of the future for you. I mentioned to you the the truth about Canadian Trudeau's plan for farmers. They really want to do this They want to artificially Limit the things that we need and want and make us rich and Prosperous and free they want to control you and they want to force you to do things That have no attended benefit whatsoever There there is not one part of me that sits around saying I'm worried about the co2 emissions But hey, you know if you just stopped the co2 and You know planets not gonna melt who actually no one believes this really but they pretend to believe it That's the part of it. They don't actually I guess there are people now that are truly and I tweeted something out about this There are people that were standing on ice blocks in London with nooses around there next to make some point about it Was there were climate change activists and the reality is that climate change activists have a very? Close correlation with severe mental illness. I Don't say these people are craziest and ha ha you're being crazy. I mean they're actually not of sound mind They need help But they're cluing themselves to paintings and all this stuff Biden They're a key constituency The the maniacs who are doing those things there are key constituency for the Democrats You know they they really both they I can't tell who's cynical and who's the true believer among the Democrats That's where it's so difficult to separate it out. I also want to get on on to this topic for a second here Chris Rufo Does Phenomenal work. I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with them I think he was on Laura's show last night on Fox by the way I think I think I'll be on Hannity show tonight on Fox and maybe on Jesse's show tomorrow, so that'd be great But you know they change that stuff changes up depending on the news cycle I'm not an econ guy so I might get bumped that happens always appreciate being on either of those shows though great shows huge ratings Millions and millions of people watching Sean millions of millions of people watching Jesse But I saw Chris last night. I think he was on Laura's show and Chris Rufo does great work and you've got to hear some of this this is from his Twitter thread a thread because This is yet another area. I know we're really hyper focused on the economy right now as we should be But there are other places Where I think people have had enough of the lunatic Democrat Party I think the commies have run rampant Enough without the pushback that we can give with a unified voice as the American people at the polls in this upcoming midterm Here's Rufo on this. This is stunning. I'm gonna read you about a little bit about this as you know, there is Gender identity indoctrination going on all over the country in the school system Ron DeSantis in Florida is fighting against this I've started to see some Glenn youngkin stuff where he might be fighting against There are some people that are pushing back on the indoctrination We should check in I haven't heard from youngkin or wow we should get it back on the show see what he's up to in Virginia but in Portland as you can imagine Things have really gone Gone over the edge when it comes to the brainwashing they are doing of children there This is from Rufo's thread Portland Public Schools is teaching elementary school students That white people have used definitions of gender as a way to lift up whiteness and oppress third world peoples Who have transcended the gender binary in Mexico? Asia and Africa and Quote they have five genders Okay, you see this and you say How how can they be teaching this to children and then turning around and telling us? That they're not doing gender identity and indoctrination Training but they are doing this they're teaching little kids. There are five genders in the Portland Public Schools and The problem that you face with this I would also note is that even I can tell you in New York City which has super expensive private schools They're doing a lot of the same thing there in fact a lot of the private education Options are even more woke because you see they're terrified. They feel all this guilt Oh, I'm wealthy enough that I can afford to send little Susie or little Timmy to this this rich school this rich seat place So we have to allow for the for the woke gender identity training of our children That's the idea and of and the administrators The people that are calling the shots at these places at these private schools specifically I mean you expect what do you think the the chancellor of schools or whatever the term is in Portland, Oregon If that individual does not have You know like a blue mohawk and face tattoos. I'll be a little surprised. I don't know But I'm just saying you're expecting very left-wing Very left-wing school bureaucrats in the Democrat cities to be making those administrative decisions, but even in the private schools are doing this and I note this and I point this out because see all Rufo does is Find the receipts he finds the proof he finds the reality of the teaching materials and shares it and the left hates him for it because what they want is That they want that parents in America to be complacent over this because it's a little bit of shocking right? It's jarring It's jarring when you hear from people or when you see that children perhaps in your school district Certainly in your state are being taught that there are five or fifteen or thirty genders are being taught about white colonialism and white supremacy, you know when they're six I'm pretty sure that it'd be better a better usage of time in the schools To have kids learning their ABCs the basics of addition and subtraction You know maybe sing some songs work on some hand-eye coordination, you know, I'm not an educator But I think that stuff would be important. I think that would be a good focus of time and energy Instead you have this radical left It's a fringe in terms of American society, but it's not a fringe in education because they now control so much of education They have seized the commanding heights of our educational institutions whether it's preschools or Ivy League universities. I mean University of Pennsylvania just put up a man for the woman of the Year Award for the NCAA If you would said that ten years ago if you had made that joke people would have said come on That's too far. Well now we're there she He did not win by the way a she did actually get the Get the nod for NCAA woman of the year so at least they picked a woman so that's good news because Leah Thomas is not a woman and They can shout and scream and yell at us and call us bigots and do all the things that they've been doing it will not change that fact I Will not bend the knee on issues of objective reality. It's just not gonna happen They can scream and be irrational and live in their delusions as much as they want But they want to make your kids delusional see that's where you have to understand that it's not enough to just Live your life with principles and truth. You got to watch what they're doing They are coming after kids with this stuff this indoctrination all across the country They are doing it and when they get caught, you know what they say? Oh That's not that's not right. That's not happening. Yes. It is don't believe them They are lying to you and good work again.

Do we have mark mark? What's going on buddy? Hey buck. I'm here. Yes, sir. Thanks. You guys you guys have a great show I'll get right to the point. Thank you, and I've I've been I'm in a local elected official in my little hometown here outside of Rochester New York And I've been listening to this stuff for the last 60 years in the 60s I remember they told us that oil would be gone in 10 years in the 70s They said there was gonna be another ice age in the 80s They said acid rain was gonna wipe out all the crops within 10 years in the 90s the ozone layer will be destroyed the 2000s It was the glaciers will all melt in 10 years 2010 the east and west coast Was gonna be underwater from rising sea levels in 10 years and now in 2020 It's the great climate change none of these things have occurred it was nothing but fear mongering and It's really about income and wealth distribution and but the one thing That did happen and every one of those 10-year cycles that they promised us all those negative things We're gonna happen to our climate our taxes were raised. Oh Yeah, oh no, it's it's a great mechanism For taxing people and controlling them which is why the collectivist left is so obsessed with the climate change narrative mark in New York Man, thank you for calling in I went up. I I Spent some I went to Rochester when I was in college for the first time I went to a place I think it's still around called Nick Tahoe's where they had the the dish that they were famous for well known for Was called a garbage plate Which is a a giant styrofoam plate really it's like a two-hander almost like a platter plate filled with Hot dog eggs hash browns Hot sauce bake it. I mean it I think it must be in the like three or four thousand calorie range as a dish Probably up there with the blooming onion which I think in an analysis of fast casual restaurants was the Among the single most calorically dense. I'm thinking about these things these days This guy's I gotta be up. You know, I gotta fit into a suit. I don't wear suits very often anymore I don't even get a bathing suit. I mean like a men's suit I'm gonna wear in my wolf and shepherds at the wedding and I gotta be able to fit into a suit So I look at these things now and producer mark I don't know if you notice it turns out that like I love Alfredo for example. It turns out Alfredo Not really diet food I find which is really sad to find out, you know, I may have been told by my trainer recently No late night gelato which also felt a little bit like what is the point that you know like what am I getting up for every day? I get through a hard day and Ice cream. I feel like it sounds less indulgent if you call it gelato because maybe it's I don't know There's more egg in it or something. So there's more protein But you get through a hard day so that it's nighttime you sit there you flip on your Netflix I throw on alone Which is just phenomenal because I watch these people who are trying to make half a million dollars by winning the contest Out there in the woods and no matter what kind of a day you've had I'm gonna say this to all of you Listen, no, what kind of a day you've had you you haven't had It's 30 degrees outside You haven't eaten real food it over a week and while you were out there in the woods doing your business a grizzly bear Decided to come visit like you haven't had that kind of a day So I will say that there's a little bit of a you know Whoo man There but for the grace of God go I you're not in the middle of the the Northwoods in Canada hoping you Don't upset a hungry grizzly bear a great show to watch But yeah, I got to cut down the ice cream a little bit and if you ever go up to a niktah who's the garbage plate? It's quite delicious. Yeah, probably worth it even if you're getting ready for for wedding season I think there's also wedding wedding crashers to clay mention this. We'll have to talk about this tomorrow Maybe we'll ask President Trump what he thinks about wedding crashers because we are gonna be joined by President Trump in the First hour of the program, which is gonna be a lot of fun Probably I don't know how long he'll stay with us riskinna hang out. He's gonna be coming off the golf course He will probably make fun of me for not being a golfer, which I guess I deserve Tennis though. I do play quite a bit of so I like the tennis. All right third hour the border crime and oh so much more Stick around clay and buck buck rolling its solo today talk to you in a minute Clay Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth"
