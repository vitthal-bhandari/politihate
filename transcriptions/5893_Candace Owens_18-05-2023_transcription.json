    "text": " All right, it's Thursday, everyone. Let's jump right into the question of the day, because I need to know why are there so many conservatives out there that support Caitlyn Jenner? I'm seeing Caitlyn Jenner on conservative networks. I'm seeing Caitlyn Jenner used to parrot Republican and supposedly conservative talking points. I have a lot of questions about that because it seems blatantly hypocritical to me. What do we actually even stand for as conservatives, if not for family values? Plus later on in the show, we have to talk about Adidas. They are now also being accused of trying to erase women by using a biological male model with a hairy chest and a bulging crotch for funsies for their women's swimwear line during Pride Month. Yeah, he's almost proud of him. So excited sprinkles and everybody rainbow. It's going to be so much fun. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. All right, so there is no question that the Kardashian Empire has brought with it a lot of societal ills, a lot of things that we're fighting today. Things that used to be considered taboos, but that they somehow took and were able to enter into the mainstream. Essentially, they normalized extremes. I'll give you just a few examples that we're not going to cover too extensively. First and foremost, sex tapes used to be a taboo, but look at Kim Kardashian's fame. I would say she provided a very good incentive for a lot of other women to make sex tapes and for their moms to maybe sell those sex tapes to their friends to make their daughters more famous. Of course, with that nudity, and I think that we used to think of it as a taboo, we used to consider the sub-soffcore porn. And now we've all pretty much become desensitized to it, thanks in large part to Instagram and the presence of the Kardashian and Jenner plan. Another thing, plastic surgery, that used to be a secret. Women used to not talk about the plastic surgery that they got well. The Kardashian Empire has made it cool and relevant to tell you all the procedures that they are undertaking to fight off age. But I would say that their most twisted contribution, perhaps the greatest evil that the Kardashian Empire has ever brought forth with it, the cultural virus that is now plaguing our society is transgenderism. Once a taboo, the Kardashian family exploded and then glamorized the topic, giving it the sympathetic Hollywood spin, that only someone as cunning as Kris Jenner could figure out how to monetize. I mean, who among us could forget the famed Diane Sawyer interview with then-Brush Jenner that we all watched with Bated Breath? Don't remember? Let me jog your memory. Take a listen. Are you a woman? Yes, for all intents and purposes, I am a woman. People look at me differently. They see you as this macho male, but my heart and my soul and everything that I do in life, it is part of me. That female side is part of me. That's who I am. Now, I don't think that there is anything blatantly wrong with somebody talking about their internal or their external struggles with somebody. But then, of course, came the glamorization. How do we make this look like fun? How do we make other people want to aspire to this? How do we hand this individual awards introducing to the world Kate? Vanity Fair was the first to jump at the opportunity to give him a front page spread. Do you remember these pictures? Let's take a look at them. Here is Caitlyn Jenner on the cover of Vanity Fair dressed in what looks to be a boostier. Really? I mean, garments. He's wearing agent, provocateur, very, very expensive brand. Here he is in a luxury car and a red skirt, a very tight red skirt with sunglasses, again, selling you luxury, wealth, and status. And here he is, again, sitting in a makeup chair wearing what looks to me to be some sort of lingerie, a core set of some description, how glamorous. Another shot this time wearing a little black dress with a zipper in the front. And here is a final shot of him wearing a gown, a badgy knee shka gown looking out over the pool. How could you not love that if you're a person watching this? Wow, Bruce Jenner came forward and said that he was actually a she that deep down he was a woman. And then Vanity Fair called and put him on the cover. So amazing, so iconic. If you're a child watching this, you might be thinking this, if you're a young person thinking, how do I get attention? You might be looking at this, but that wasn't it. That wasn't it. Then he got his own show entitled, I am Kate. Take a listen to him speaking to his now ex-wife, first Jenner. I said I had a condition that I'm dealing with forever. I said that it was on hormones. And that's the reason it might be tough to get pregnant. And my friend said have a bottle of wine and go have great sex, and we did and we have Kindle. And then a minute later we had Kylie. But none of that was I want to be a woman. I certainly told her what was going on. So there you have it. Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, destroyed his own family on reality TV, mutilated his body and ushered in the era of cultural transgenderism that we are fighting day in and day out today. That our kids are now going to have to face in the classroom. But somehow conservatives have developed amnesia about all of this. And they have just been embracing Caitlyn over the years because Caitlyn says he's a Republican, yay. And maybe he is a fiscal Republican. And maybe that's why he aligns with the party. Miraculously, these individuals think it is okay to use Caitlyn as a Republican spokesperson against transgenderism in sports. I mean, the reason I've talked about this today is because I was completely shocked by this Newsweek heading, which reads Caitlyn Jenner says transgender population is growing at a disturbing rate. The article opens up with this. Caitlyn Jenner has said the number of people openly identifying as transgender is skyrocketing at a disturbing rate blaming indoctrination and an oversaturation of the topic. I get it. So transgenderism for Kate, but not for everybody else. It wasn't an oversaturation of the topic when Caitlyn agreed to go on the cover of Vanity Fair when Caitlyn wanted to have his own reality show when Caitlyn wanted to become the face. When Caitlyn wanted to take space from women, let me talk about Marie, Caitlyn Jenner won Woman of the Year and showed up and accepted the award. But none of that was problematic. That was fine. But now that other people are doing it, now that other people are in women's spaces and in sports spaces, he's saying, that's where I draw the line. Okay, Caitlyn, I guess that somehow makes you a conservative. You know, I would say that my colleague Matt Walsh responded to all of this in the same way that I've been responding to it. He wrote this on Twitter. Your position is completely unintelligible. You assert the validity of transgenderism. You claim that you are a woman. You accepted the Woman of the Year award. And yet you declare that trans women in women's sports are actually men and don't belong there. Total incoherence. Yup, well said, total incoherence and hypocrisy. And is that what the Republican Party is becoming? Is that what conservatives are becoming? Are people no longer able to distinguish the difference between what it means to be a Republican and what it means to be a conservative? Because at the core of conservative principles is protecting the family unit. It is not parroting around people that just agree with us on fiscal points and then do everything to show that no, they are happy, happy to usher in the ruination of society. They are happy to usher in the breakdown of the family unit, sitting more and more control to the state necessarily, of course, of course. How do people think it's acceptable to keep giving Caitlyn a platform just because he says a few things that you agree with. Caitlyn was the gateway drug for everything that we are fighting today. He and the Kardashian clan are omniscient to me of the billion dollar pharmaceutical companies that get millions of people hooked on opioids with their pills, but then turn around and say, we have to do something about these drug dealers on the streets, these men on the corner that are selling heroin. You know, this is because of you, right, that these people are on the corner selling heroin. It is because of your influence. It is because of the influence of the Kardashian empire glamorizing transgenderism that we now have all of these micro influencers talking about how they're also taking pills and they are also going to change their gender. I think probably Norm Mcdonald speaks to the incredulous nature of it all when he interviewed Caitlyn Jenner. Take a listen. I am firmly on the side of womanhood now, but I am not a woman, nor will I ever be. Three sentences later, I use the woman's restroom because I am a woman. I change my gender. I'm a mercursivity female because I am a woman. So it's a little confusing there, right? Not for me. What's wrong with that? Well, here it says, I am not a woman. I am a woman. Okay. That. Absolutely makes entirely no sense. So I want to be really firm in my position here. If you are a person who claims to be a conservative and yet you are willing to bend and say that somehow no Caitlyn standing up to this makes sense because you want to score a point against the left, then you are not thoughtful in your assessments about why you are a conservative. You are not ideologically consistent. You have no idea. There's probably just one or two things that you think make you a conservative and not want to sit down and do the work to figure out what it is that we actually believe you shouldn't have a platform. Caitlyn Jenner is not a conservative and that it's all that I'm going to say about that. Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like checking your baggage at the airport without a lock.

Okay, now it's time for some topics to draw. So Adidas is now being accused of trying to erase women because they have just released their pride edition, pride 2003 collection of swimsuits as part of their campaign. Obviously, we are just around the corner from the month in which sex and debauchery will be thrown into our face. So this pride swimsuit was released under the women's section of their website. Let me just show you this model, which is obviously a man rocking this swimsuit with a giant bulge. It's really disgusting to take a look at, of course, because it's a perversion. We are having a reaction to this because it is perversion. At least the news was smart enough to put a black man though, so they can accuse us of racism if we say that it's positively disgusting to see a man's bulge like this in a obviously pretending to be a woman, a woman and walking sexily wearing a button, right? He's got hair on his chest. This is the kind of it's just sick. It's absolutely sick. He's very muscular. He's got hair on his chest. And again, his crotch has a bulge. Additionally, there's another biological male model that is posed in a sports bra, which costs around $50. The models are described as they in the online campaign. And of course, this was supposed to get your attention. They want you to react to it so they can accuse you of homophobia and racism. I'm all for your accusations. Come at me, Adidas. The design was created by South African designer Rich Nesey with Adidas championing the suit as a celebration of self-expression, imagination and the unwavering belief that love unites. Shut up, Adidas. Honestly, shut up. You know exactly what you are doing. You're trying to contribute to the perversion our society. You are trying to grab headlines. And this is the direction that everything is going toward, right? We don't care if we're erasing women. Men are better at being women. We are going to put men now under the sections that are entitled women. And the reason why I am so passionately outspoken against the LGBTQ alphabet community is because they are so passionately outspoken against women. They don't care anymore, right? They're just collecting letters. They act like a mafia. They think that their smears work, that they can libel and smear people to shut up. And I'm just not actually one of these individuals that's going to shut up or pretend that I am not offended at every single thing that they are doing or pretending that I don't actually view them to be sexual predators because they are. If you don't believe me, just wait a couple of weeks until we're in June and they're marching down the street in their assless chaps telling you that if you're looking at them, it's because you're problematic. Well, color me problematic people because I am going to forever comment on this debauchery and forever state that I would never allow my children to go around these perverse sorts of individuals that are intentionally taking things that are supposed to be innocent, taking things that are supposed to stay into a women's space, and trying to reintroduce them to society under the guise of love and light when it really is sick and twisted and meant to again be an absolute perversion. Had a real chuckle when I saw this list that was released, a friend of mine retweeted that Lauren Chan, we've had her on the show before, and she said that she does all of these. Take a look at this LGBTQ list, which I guess is supposed to allow us to know if we are a bigot. So this list was published by Pink News and it is entitled Examples of Microaggressions Against LGBTQ Plus People. First, using terminology like that's so gay. Yeah, I probably do that. Second, deliberately not using someone's preferred pronouns. I definitely do that. Third, making assumptions about someone based on their sexuality, gender identity, or ethnicity. Definitely gender identity. You tell me that you are non-binary. I will call you an idiot. So I definitely do that. Next, suggesting that a person is not a real man or woman. I do like myself a little bit of biology. Check for Ken Sowans. Excluding people from discussions. Nope, I am not guilty of that one. I welcome a discussion and a debate with any trans individual who would like to sit across the table and explain to me how they are definitely the opposite sex, even when I have two eyes and can see and understand that there are only two genders. Third, accusing people of being over sensitive. Guilty is charged. And saying I'm not homophobic, transphobic, but I'm just patently not homophobic or transphobic. Why would I be fearful of a man like we just saw someone that is wearing a woman's bathing suit and walking like a woman? I think that that person is a freak, but I'm not scared of that person. Who's afraid of a man in a dress? I want to keep him away from my children because I think they're perverts, but no, I don't know that person. Lastly, keeping quiet when a microaggression is directed against someone else. Yeah, I'm pretty guilty on all fronts. It's a great list. You should definitely take the test to see if you are guilty of LGBTQIA microaggressions and then you should probably not care about the results because they don't care when they're aggressive. You definitely should not care when you are aggressive them. All right, guys, moving on to this story because I call BS. I know radical feminist BS when I see it. The story just seems so incredulous. So as a Tennessee meteorologist, who has recently been fired and she is trying to suggest that she was fired for having curly hair and not being a size two. I don't know if you believe a story is right. I mean, just doesn't even pass the sniff test, but let me go ahead and give you a few more details. So she's a meteorologist working at an ABC TV affiliate here in Tennessee and she tweeted that she had been fired from the local news station, but then posted this to signal that it might have been about something else. Her name is Tabitha Bartow and here was her post on Twitter. It says, to my viewers, many of you have been asking me numerous questions and I feel you deserved to have an honest answer about where I've been. I wanted to thank you for being here for me and supporting me for months as I began my career in the news world. I feel I never was able to introduce myself and magically appeared on your screens one day, but I was a student that had graduated in December and this was my first job out of college and I was extremely excited to know you all. When I went to college, I was told that you will hear negative things about you and you have to ignore it, but I never once heard anything negative as for my viewers because you were also kind no matter where I went, you all made me happy to be a Tennesseean. The sad news, my time at WATE has come to a close. I'm so appreciative at the storm team, digital producers and the rest of the on-air talent and everyone in the control room. They were the ones that kept the spirits lifted and things positive even if the circumstances with management were not as great. One thing I will say is that I hope in the future, we all learn to appreciate and accept people for who they are, for their appearance, for their style. Everyone is beautiful and professional in their own ways. No matter if you have curly hair or you're not a size two but a size 12, you matter and people's comments should not let you down or it should not play as a large circumstance in your job. If you have natural curls, embrace them and be proud of your natural hair, it is professional. As Frank Sinatra says, the best is yet to come and I can't wait to share with you my next adventure. So she obviously is trying to imply and here's a photo of her in case you are watching this and you are not just listening to it. The photo of her with curly hair, she's trying to imply that because she was a size two and she didn't have curly hair that there were issues because she had curly hair rather that there were issues in management and I'm just going to call BS on that. Sounds absolutely fraudulent. I'm sorry, did what she a size two when she started working there a couple of months ago and then what she ballooned and then they suddenly were like, no, she's probably in the size the entire time and because people are no longer allowed to look at their performance, no longer are being told that when something goes wrong, it might be because of you. They are always trying to look for an ism that they can blame. So in this circumstance, she's not a black person so she's not going to blame racism at management. So she's instead going to lean into this idea that it must be because I'm a woman who's not a model size, which I mean because what you're supposed to be a size two in order to work in the news industry, I mean, I study journalism college and never remember hearing that as an implication. Are you expected to look professional? Yeah, I'm sure. That's everywhere. By the way, as a general rule, if you are working in an office space, you are expected to look professional, but the idea here is just to murky the water and to get people talking about why she was fired and to really poison where she used to work at. That's the idea is to say the climate that I worked at is what's wrong and not me because we no longer live in an introspective society. Everyone wants to blame something else. Everyone wants to blame the external for something and not believe that there's anything that they can do internally to correct themselves. So more will probably come out regarding this, but I'm going to bet that if she got fired from not being a size two, she would be suing them, not just rushing to Twitter to put out a statement. Speaking of fraudulent feminism, hi, just I could not believe this story yesterday about Harry and Megan just honestly stopped the presses on this because I know I have been saying from day one, I want my credit where credit is due. I saw her coming before they even left the royal family when they started dating. I said she's going to get him back to LA because she's always been a deeless actress and what she wants to do is live in LA and be famous. And she made up the whole racism, schtick, because that is what was selling at that time during Black Lives Matter, even though nobody can look at her and tell that she's black and she never wore the idea that she was black throughout her entire career. She never tried to play a black role. She always tried to make herself look white, straightening her hair. So this is absolute, it was always absolute yes, but what I also said, and again, let the record show is that she is cosplaying Princess Diana. That I said that she has basically, she's provided for 40 in transference. Like she has convinced Prince Harry that she is Princess Diana and this time he could save her. That's how he agreed to leave the UK. Remember, she was pregnant, she was crying and she said she was going to kill herself and the media was so horrible to her. Obviously triggering to him, giving that his mother died being chased by paparazzi. This is the most disturbing story. If this does not make everybody agree left and right that these two people need to go away, that they are both discussing. I don't want to just say Mega Markle because Prince Harry, you are so fundamentally disgusting for harnessing your mother's death for riches and fame. That's what he's done the entire time. His book Everything was all about saying, my mommy died, give me money, I'm going to sell out the rest of my family. He sold out his dead mother, he sold out his brother, he sold out his father, he sold out his grandmother as she was at her deathbed because he wanted to have millions and millions of jobs coming in. He's a sick person as well, but what they did yesterday really, really shows you how much they are trying to convince the world that she is. Mega Markle is Princess Diana. So their publicist released a statement and I wanted you to read it in its entirety because it's very important. The statement reads, last night the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Raglan were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit lasting over two hours resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road pedestrians and two NYPD officers. While being a public figure comes with a level of interest in the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone's safety. Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all involved. A near catastrophic car chase because of a ring of paparazzi. If you cannot see the emotional manipulation and the mental illness that these two are suffering from from attention, essentially purposefully trying to be evocative of what happened to Princess Diana. We almost died last night on a two hour car chase running from paparazzi. I call bull. Okay, I have lived in New York City for seven years of my life. You are not able to be on a high speed chase for two hours. If you first off, New York City is 13 miles long, okay? Two hours you were on a high speed chase away from paparazzi. Are you guys kidding me? And a near death, what going one mile per hour as the city traffic permits for, especially where they were in Midtown, which is exactly where my office used to be located. Absolute BS, everyone knew it was BS the moment that they that they stated it. And if you needed it further asserted, well, they took a taxi and the taxi driver says, yeah, no, wasn't really that near fatal. Take a listen to their taxi cab driver. You know, I was crossing on 67th street and then the security guard hailed me and next thing you know, Prince Harry and his wife were hopping into my cab. And as we went to block, we got blocked by a garbage truck and all of a sudden paparazzi came and started taking pictures. And then instead they were just about to give me the location where they were going to go. But then they told me to circle back to the precinct. So we circle back to the precinct. Nice people. They look nervous. I mean, I think they were chafing chase the whole day or something. They were pretty nervous, you know, but the security guard he was on it. And what did you think about the description of this, you know, the near catastrophic event? Oh, I don't think that's true. I think that's all, you know, exaggerated and stuff like that. So don't read too much into that, you know. I bet that as far as you were concerned, when they were in your taxi, you know, what did you feel like you were in danger? No, no, New York City is the safest place to be. Right. There's police stations with cops on every corner. So there's no way to be afraid of New York. You didn't see any cars going over curbs or people bang on the window. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that must have happened earlier if they were being chased before on like 57 like Mira Adam was saying, but not with me. Yeah. But they did seem nervous they just seem nervous. Yeah. Was it good to go? Yeah, it was great man. 10 minute drive, $50 or so. Yes, for right. You can't read that. Wow. He sure doesn't sound like he almost survived a near fatal car crash. So what actually happened by the way guys is yes, there are paparazzi in New York. We know this somehow these paparazzi have never almost killed Taylor Swift who was there just a couple of weeks ago. These paparazzi have not almost killed every major A-list celebrity that descended for the Met Gala a couple of weeks ago, including the entire Kardashian Empire with their global fame and recognition. None of these people almost died when the paparazzi were there. None of these people were involved with a ring of paparazzi that wanted to kill him. In fact, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber live in New York City and the paparazzi have their addresses. Yet they've never tried to kill any of these much more famous individuals, but of course, Prince Harry and his perpetual victim wife almost died. The paparazzi almost killed him. Instead of just saying, oh, there were paparazzi that has followed us out of this building and wanted to see where we were going. Obviously, the paparazzi would have continued to take pictures and try to follow them as is the circumstance that happens when you are a celebrity. They needed to make people think that they almost died because they have over and over again tried to evoke his mother's legacy and his mother's death for their own power. It's sick. It's absolutely sickening. And any person that stands by this couple after this, you have no moral compass, right? You just love the idea that they're just a couple in love and not a psychotically manipulative couple that want to rake in millions and millions of dollars by continually stepping on his mother's tombstone. That is the truth about exactly what Prince Harry and Meghan are. Still don't believe me? Well, even the mayor of New York City is calling into question their little narrative. Take a listen. I would find it hard to believe that there was a two hour high speed chase. That would be a finding hard to believe, but we will find out the exact duration of it. But if it's 10 minutes, a 10 minute chase is extremely dangerous in New York City. We have a lot of traffic, a lot of movement, a lot of people are using our streets of any type of high speed chase that involves something of that nature is inappropriate. You know, police do it under limited circumstances when they're going after violent people, but to do it because you want to get the right shot can turn out to be a place where people can be harmed in a real way. So watch the real narrative. Well, Prince Harry and Meghan left an event where paparazzi were waiting for them. Paparazzi didn't get a shot of them because they entered in through a back entrance because Prince Harry and Meghan basically want the paparazzi to follow them when they want to make money, like when he's selling his family down the river, when he's selling his book, when they're doing the Oprah interview, paparazzi come in, but then some nights they don't want them. And when they left this event, they were going to a mysterious friend's house and they didn't want the paparazzi to follow them or to know where that mysterious friend was. So they told their security detail, which they were in originally in a black SUV, to circle the block a few times. And they were in traffic. So of course, the paparazzi were able to pop up by cockroaches and continue to take pictures of them. And so they said, oh no, what are we going to do? We don't want to go to the friends. We don't know where we're going. So what should we do? So they pulled into a police precinct and said, we're still being followed by paparazzi. And what do we do? And so they hailed them a cab, they got in the cab, and then they got to their friend's house that anybody recognizing, no person was harmed, no person was fouled. But then in their demented little heads, they said, hmm, how can we be the victim of the story? Why don't we say that even though we've pretty much only been across 10 blocks for the last hour and a half, we'll say that we almost died like mom, like my mom did. Absolutely sickening. Stop supporting these people. Honestly, do them a favor and give them the privacy that they demand at random points while they ask for the exact opposite at other points. I can't say I'm a scouple. That's all I'm going to say about that. Okay, it's time to get into some of your comments. First couple of comments are regarding yesterday's episode where we discussed birth control. Melissa Bichkowski says, I found it incredibly odd that when I was 24 hours post partum recovering in the post-natal ward, doctors were coming in to talk about birth control. I went into the six week checkup with my doctor thinking it would be about the recovery of my body. Instead, it was about birth control. Yes, there are always kickback from insurance companies and more of they can get people on certain drugs, new drugs that are coming out. And it very rarely seems to be about the health of the patient anymore. And again, I do still believe that there are good doctors and good nurses out there, but they are just a part of it. And they don't realize they are because they go to medical schools. And you want to believe that they are doing no harm. But I think that in a post COVID America, we do know that doctors do what they're told and are no longer being guided by a moral compass. This next comment is from Lauren. She says, birth control made me absolutely insane. I started getting my period when I was 11 years old. I'm 23 now and it was always irregular. So my mom took me to the doctor and I got prescribed birth control to regulate my period at 12 or 13 years old. I was on it for about nine to 10 years before deciding to go off of it in January of 2022. Within a week, I felt like a completely different person. Someone else described seeing the world one dimensionally when they were on birth control. And that was exactly my experience. My entire world view changed for the better. Once I cleared that poison out of my body, everyone in my life noticed how much happier I seemed when I went off it. Not to mention, the period you get isn't even a real period. It's just withdrawal bleeding that happens when you take the sugar pills that mimic superior, but it's not a legitimate period. When I realized my body wasn't doing what it was supposed to do naturally, I knew I had to make a change. I can't recommend ditching the pill enough. That's always been my view is that if it doesn't feel like the natural order, I don't like it. When I hear about people inserting devices inside of themselves and not being able to menstruate for a year, I'm like, when did something come online in your body and say, that doesn't sound normal. I'm just not going to do that. I don't know. I don't want to put a device in myself and make me stop being a woman for a year. I don't know. I'm very weird, but you know me, guys, I'm super crunchy and pyratine and going more and more organic by the day. All right, you guys, it's all the time that we have for today.
