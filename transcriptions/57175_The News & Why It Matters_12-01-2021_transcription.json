    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Parler Souss Amazon, after being suspended from their web hosting service, also is President Trump getting impeached again, even though he is about to leave office. It's a Monday for you, ladies and gentlemen. Buckle up, it's going to be a big ride. A little bit bumpy and it starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Monday. I am Saragansales. Today, joined by the one and only Eric July. Eric July, BlazeTV contributor who I guess is, he's repping Ron Paul today. Yeah, they locked my man's out of Facebook today, so I'm representing OG Ron Paul today. Well, we've got an opportunity to get into that because we are talking all things, the purge going on on social media. Also joined by my good friend, Kazia Shafer. Kazia Shafer, host of CrocsOn podcast YouTube. Are you still on YouTube? Have you gotten banned yet? I am still on. I'm still on. Okay. All right. Well, for now. I'm pulling a race card if they give me. Oh, that's so smart. That's so lucky. I'm pulling far in a car. Yeah. Yeah. I want a woman car to you. You got a couple up here. Yeah, yeah. Up here, please, if you need a user. I mean, who knows? We'll see. Oh, yeah. You had a few of us. All right. So speaking of the conservative purge going on, it just seems like one thing after the other over the weekend, Parler actually got suspended. So what happened was they, their service was suspended by Amazon. Now Amazon has a web hosting service and Amazon decided to take Parler off of their web hosting service for violating their terms of service by failing to effectively deal with a steady increase in violent content. This is of course what Amazon said. So they said Parler presents a quote, very real risk to public safety. And they said, we're hosting your services. No more. We're taking you offline. So Parler has now sued Amazon. They filed a lawsuit against Amazon claiming that Amazon's suspension of Parler violated antitrust laws and breached the contract between the two entities. Now they went dark earlier this morning and their CEO said that the site would try to get back online as quickly as possible, but they said that they could be down for as long as a week. So we will see. Now, this is of course after who else has been censored. I know y'all. I just sat there and watched my Twitter account just go, I mean, in real time, it was nuts. Yeah. Nuts. And then so now you're saying, recall for no reason had no strikes or anything like that. He was locked out of his Facebook this morning. For no reason. No reason. I mean, I'm sure that they have a reason. Yeah, well violated community standards. Right. Right. Which is whatever they want to be. They can pull that car whenever they want. I will say this and this is what this is the direction that I've been telling people be a conservative or not that that should be the approach when it comes to combating what we're seeing right now when in regards to like big tech. Look, they have contractual obligations. They need to be held to those. Right. So if they breach the contract for whatever reason, that's the fight. That's why you've never heard me lead with this free speech or 230 that right there to me is the approach or at least the mindset. Not necessarily dealing with it in course, but the whole idea is that you are breaking a contract with us being in the term of service or directly right there with Amazon Web Services. And they're going to only keep them down for so long. This is why I'm a little more optimistic. We've got technology is forever advanced. So you see what they try to do these other sites, the gaps of the world, which still was able to get around all of that, get their own servers. And now they're still existing and people like, how do we get them down? It's only so much that you can do. But what I want people to more so pay attention to out of this whole entire story is how the wording in which they say that, okay, you were inciting violence, violence, we have had this amount of stuff happening or we see this. Real risk to public safety. Right. Okay. Let's let's backtrack. We're I'm pretty sure you have and I know I have gotten all kinds of ugly things sent to us about people who still exist on that platform. All kinds of things that violate the services of videos and what have you, our term of service excuse me, are all there. But hilariously enough that we just fall asleep for the last five months as we know that these groups went and burned down entire blocks, cities looted everything out of there. We know objectively speaking, again, America, this isn't my opinion, more people from the post George Floyd violence died from that. More more damage was done to both federal, beloved cathedrals that you guys care so much about. That was damaged for more of that was damaged. And you look at the fact that you got $2 billion or plus worth of damage being done to people's businesses and what have you more violence, more salt, yet they allow all that to go together. And instead of the the the the the groups coming together and saying, okay, this is a problem as blue check marks, Democrats, economic academic elites sit here and authorize that bad behavior. They excused it and they justified it. It was never ever a call for them to be taken completely off of the platform. And this is why I'm trying to tell conservatives guys, libertarians as well, you are playing a rigged game. Then they're not fighting fair. They're Eddie Guerrero tactics, low blows when you're not looking loaded gloves, buying off the ref, buying off the judges. Why y'all trying to fight these guys straight up? I have absolutely no idea because they have no desire to do that. They know the game is rigged. They know that basically an extension of them that's left this sort of authoritarianism is these economic tech elite. They know that and they have no desire to play fair. So Trent carefully. Kazi to to Eric's very well stated point. Parler says this in their lawsuit. Amazon just last month just inked a deal with Twitter to host their web services. You see what goes on on Twitter. I know Antifa's I mean they plan all of their stuff on there. The amount of violence I've seen on this site is amazing. When we see people getting beat up, dropped, I'm talking and that all those videos are still live. I wouldn't look the other day. They're still live and nothing is happening. You had hang Mike Pence trending on Twitter. No plans have been announced. Coincidentally enough, no plans have been announced by Amazon to take Twitter off of their web hosting service. It's funny because if there's the whole reason of taking away Paula is because it's inciting too much violence. Like you guys just said, it's a joke that there is so much violence. I've seen it. I've seen meme pages posting like you're just like scrolling through and you're like, Oh shoot, like what? Oh, I don't want to see that. Yeah, I'm sure you get violence directed at you for being the wife of someone. Yes, people. I don't even do anything. People find me on all my social media. I'm like, you went through the effort to find me to send me some nasty message about me dying and whatnot. It's like, okay. Yeah. Sorry, but I'm sorry your life sucks. Yeah, it's crazy. But also with like Twitter and all these people going, no, no, we don't silence concept. No, we're not purging concept. Absolutely not. And then as soon as Trump joins Paula, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's no place for you guys. We're going to delete all of you off every social media platform. There is no place for you. And if you start your own platform, sorry, we're going to take that away too. So tell me again that you're not targeting conservatives. Right. Yeah. Well, and I mean, I think that that is that is really the the axe to grind that so many people have is if you have these terms of service and you want to abide by them, then abide by them, but you have to be objective about it. You have to be consistent. Both sides of the aisle have to see this happening. Unfortunately, that's not really the way that it's the end out. They only see what it is that they want. I even trying to check the shoulders of my fellow libertarians who for whatever reason, they both sides are the exact same. And this is like an equal playing field. No, it's not. You're going to be on the wall up on the wall too. And it's all said and done. They are pointing at all of you guys that don't pledge allegiance to their cause. You can, you cannot sit up here and look at this objectively and sit up here and say that there's no one here in bias and how these rules are certainly enforced. I don't care what side of the aisle that you want. We just were not even that far removed from what just happened again with the post George Floyd protest. None of them are taking down the tweets are still up when they were authorizing all of this will sometimes these things need to be violent. They were all these blue check marks, the AOCs of the world. It makes you uncomfortable. They got to say all of that. And there was never a claim that they were in violence. Punch it. I wish I could punch a present. No, I assassinated them. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to blow up that blow up the white house. I would like to see what they're saying now. Yeah, most definitely. But that's whatever the hell they want. Still, whatever the hell they want with no repercussions with absolutely no repercussions. It is frustrating. There has been a report that has emerged today that President Trump is planning to fight this big tech censorship of conservatives during his final days in office. But that looks like they have not yet said. I know that the president was looking for, you know, he had passed, I'm sorry, he had executed an executive order for the section 230 and Ajit Pai, the FCC commissioner, had said, oh, we can't really do any of this because he's about to leave office and we don't really have the time to make sure to follow through on this executive order. So we're just going to go ahead and disregard it. So really there has not really been a play that has come to light. Eric, what do you think that the, what is the answer? Because I go back and forth on this. I'm sure coming from you, the libertarian, you don't want, I mean, it's tough to say, like, yeah, we really want government to get involved and put a stop to it because anytime government gets involved, it's going to get way worse in the event. Look, the only answer is that what you're seeing right now is that people are coming up with a lot of alternatives. And now people are fleeing. We saw again, Gab, they had there long said they have more, more new users than they, like, this past three days than they had ever had, like, over the course of their first two years. Like, this is a real thing. Like, there is going to be an alternative tech revolution. I know a lot of people are short-sighted because we see all of that. What I specifically want to, what pertains to Twitter because of their lack of monetization, they are the one, like the one big tech group that can become obsolete, like, tomorrow. Like, they really can, believe it or not. Like, now, again, it's going to be harder to dethrone the Facebooks and the Googles of the world. But Twitter, Twitter can absolutely get the hell up out of there. And I think we need to let that play out. My play, I've been trying to get in the ear of Elon Musk to try to see if I can get him the gist because he's the one, like, first of all, he's richer than all of them now. And he's the one guy that doesn't seem to drink as much of the Kool-Aid. Right. And as all of them, so you can imagine that all he would have to do is come up with an alternative, a better alternative. And everyone just flees. You're saying even right now, don't be so pessimistic. You're saying even right now, the shares when it comes to these companies, they're tanking. They're going down right now. Like, we can be short-sighted. I understand the frustration. I say, let it play out. Yes, it's going to force a lot of people to have to make adjustments. They're going to have to try to go around. They're going to have to purchase their own servers. I understand all of that. But let it play out, America, the worst possible case scenario is the government getting into it. And I'm seeing these loser guys, like, you know, claiming that the GOP should talk about nationalizing Twitter and Facebook. I'm like, no, that's not the answer. Do you think that these platforms should still have these Section 230 protections that have been afforded to them? I'm not, yes. But to be honest, I'm not worried about that. I don't want people to go after them. That's why you never heard me on the show. Yeah. Even talk about the whole publisher versus, like, I don't even care for that. To me, that's not even where the argument needs to be. Let them fail. Let them, if they want to go into the ground, you see, they don't want to stare. But you're also seeing a lot of creative alternatives be creative. Now we know with Paula, because that was the one that was shooting up, they did everything they can. But to their credit, they're like, okay, we're going to try to find our ways around them. They threw everything they could. I hate, I'm not saying go to gab. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that's an example of they threw everything they could at them and they still came out and they persevered. So we got blockchain technology, all these sorts of things. So there are ways. There are ways. So let them fail. So I don't know what Trump is talking about. Preferably it would be okay, I'm going to try to get used my money to create these alternatives when I get the hell up out of office. That to me would be the better case scenario than trying to utilize the government to, like, nationalize it or something like that. That's not what we want. That's not what we want. That's actually such a good point, because I think isn't like everyone quitting resigning from Donald Trump saying, like, no one's on Trump's side anymore. I don't think he has any power or authority. I think, no. That's a really interesting point. I like what you said. Yeah. So you, would you support President Trump leaving office and immediately creating? Whatever Trump does after this, I am waiting to see. It will be interesting. I'll do it. I'll do it. Oh, yes it will. Yes it will. All right. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Candid. So it may be you are like me, okay, and you used to have braces and I had the headgear. I had the whole thing. What a nerd. I wore a headgear at night. But I stopped wearing my retainer and then my teeth shifted and I was unhappy with my smile. Well, you don't have to be like that. Okay. There are thousands of people now who have used Candid, including myself. It's clear, it's comfortable, removable, and practically invisible. They are aligners to help straighten your teeth. And just like me, they love their smile now. So what Candid does is you take a bunch of pictures of your teeth. All right. They send you a kit. They send you a couple of different options. It's very, very easy. You send it back to them. You have a licensed orthodontist who reviews everything. They send you that for me, they sent me 12 aligners. They sent me the whole box, 12 aligners, and each step was labeled very carefully. So you get them, you wear for a couple of weeks, you wear the next one, and it transitions your teeth where they need to be. It's super easy. And again, you don't have to deal with braces because who is an adult wants to be like, oh, I need braces again. No one wants that. And as an added bonus, Candid is way cheaper than even going to your local orthodontist and getting braces. By the way, the average Candid treatment is only six months, and you're going to start seeing results way before then. All right. Become your best. You start straightening your teeth today. Right now you can save $75 on their starter kit. All you have to do is go to CandidCO.com slash Y. Use code Y. That is WHY for you podcast listeners. It's not the letter Y. All right. WHY that is CandidCO.com slash Y. It is $75 off of your starter kit. Start the new year with straighter teeth. CandidCO.com slash Y promo code Y back in a minute. Before you move on, I do since we have, I hate to call you his wife because you're so much more than that. But stop there. I hate Shafer. I hate Shafer. Host of Crocs on podcast, but also happens to be married to Elijah Shafer. It's a full time job. Being Elijah's wife is a full time job. I can't even imagine. And if you need to say that that's my job, let it be. You need to get paid for it. Probably a lot more than I hate now for it. I need medical bills to like anxiety and trauma. Right. So we talked on the show on Friday about Elijah being what he was demonetized. Yeah. And so what was he, he was banned from Instagram. It wasn't even like he has his like slightly offensive Instagram, which has tons of followers. And then he has his personal ones. Elijah Shafer. His personal one was Bent and Dileina who was suspended. Which is so stupid. Okay. That's like fine. If you're going to take one of them, take it. Right. Right. And also off his personal Facebook account, which is so, so bizarre. But it didn't last very long because obviously the blaze was like, hmm, on it. How does that make sense? And then they gave it back. But apparently it was just a lot of people, everyone's messaging the FBI arrest Elijah, arrest Elijah and telling and emailing YouTube and all these things. Like he incited violence and he, they all saying that he started the scene or something like that, which is credible. Unarmed siege. Yes. It is right. So for the parties that have the guns. Yeah, right. Yeah. It makes all the sense of that. That's what actually it was a siege. Yeah. So apparently Elijah has been doing a lot more than we realized. So everyone's just been bombarding all these websites and things to try and get him banned. And everyone's obviously been writing hip pieces about him and he's terrible. I've been getting a lot of lovely supporting messages from people. They're so warm and so nice. They're so nice. Yeah. Yeah. It's all about, right? Oh my gosh. Well, but for now he is back on. Yeah. So it got that. Well, you can't take it away because of like a made up life. Right. So they gave, they, he is back on for now. But it's only a matter of time. Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Everybody. So house Democrats moving on house Democrats have formally introduced an article of impeachment against President Trump. I feel like we're living in Groundhog's Day and it's just over and over again. Impeach, Impeach, Impeach. This time for inciting violence against the government because he incited a mob. This is what they say. He sent him mob of his supporters to launch an attack on the US Capitol over of course his rally where he maintained that there were fraudulent election results, which I will say. I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire, right? There was a lot of crazy stuff going on. Just going to say that. I think he probably has a right to say, hey guys, there was a lot of crazy, slimy stuff going on coincidentally in all of the battleground states that I was winning before they stopped counting overnight, all of a sudden, oh my gosh, Joe Biden's winning. Look at that. Nothing to see here, YouTube. Don't take this episode down. So now house Democrats, they want him to pay for inciting violence against the government. Eric, this is, I think we're going to make Eric's head explosion. Yeah, because, you know, I know, yeah, I know a lot of people that watch the show, you know, if you're not familiar with me, I am an anarcho capitalist. So I have to go full and arc is here. Here we go. So sit here and dramatize these events. You see how quickly they are willing to move on it on whatever it is that they want to do any event that they feel like this is why we call it a cathedral. They feel like it's still that comes under attack. Then it's like they get they become so like efficient and they want to get out there and try to get things done. That's how they operate. Now my thing about that is America, they sat and watched your and I hate to just be consistently bringing this up, but I have to. They watched your businesses be burned to the ground and they authorized it and they justified it. The men at someone kicked, they feed up on NASA Pelosi's desk. Then the plural, the, the, the pearls got clutched. Yeah. And then they fainted on a couch and said, well, y'all, y'all, depends on the supposed to attack each other. Y'all can't. Us. Weird the elites. Y'all can't come do this to us. Nevermind what happened to, of course, two years ago and some change when the women's march got to do exactly that and it was, it was all good. That's not here nor there. What they are saying, and this is why I'm so, it's so in opposition to this and why I'm so pro-decentralization here, I think America, look, I think the only way this is the most peaceful route to me is a divorce. But when it comes to this right here, they are saying explicitly when they do things like that, that it's okay for you to attack your neighbor. It's okay for you to blow up each other, but don't y'all dare come to us. Because then there is a problem. So now you really see what this is about. This ain't got nothing to do with all that other unity, uh, uh, treason, all of that stuff only sounds good. It's that you took it to their cathedral. You actually took it to where it is that they are. I always have said that that is the one of the capital building houses criminals. Okay. It's period. I know it sounds blunt putting it like that. That is the house of the largest criminal organization that exists right now. Honestly, the first time you said it, I was like, oh, they're right. Yeah. They do very bad things. They do very bad things. They sign off for your kids to get blown blown up for. They blow up other people. Then they take your tax money and then they do whatever it is that they want. It is a large criminal organization and I've long stopped pretending as if it was anything. But that, but the biggest frustration I would think America would have is just how swiftly they're willing to move on stuff when it's them, when it's their tails on, when they feel as in on the line, but they sat and watched you, your y'all's businesses and people get attacked. People get killed, actually get killed out of all of this. We're not even that far removed from that. That was only five months. Well, I mean, it wasn't that it was just one instant. That kind of went over the course of multiple months, but you saw that. Still they did. Yeah, they still did. They still did nothing. I think they encouraged it a lot of what they were saying. Exactly what they did. Yeah. So you have the incoming vice president who encouraged and said, yeah, they are not going to stop fighting and they should not stop fighting. Yeah. So they can go at you all day long. They can go at you all day long, but you took it to the air cathedral. That's when it became a problem. Right. So that's why I'm so pro. Look, me personally, when it comes to this little experiment, this growth of this tumor of the federal government, the reason why I'm so pro decentralization, because I don't think it could be resolved at this point. At this point, I do believe there's no issue of we get the right people in up that that can't happen. You're seeing how corrupt it is from top to bottom. So how about we just pull the plug on it and it's entirely a pull to room from under them. I'd rather them be out on the streets and forced to get a real job as opposed to, I don't know what we're doing now and having to rely on them to try to rule over 327 million some people. Right. Impeachment again, because you're reaction. So this is the thing. I wasn't there. I wasn't at the event, but I'm yet to hear anybody say one line of Donald Trump's speech that supposedly told people, hey, it doesn't exist as well. Well, well, but it was what he meant. But also when he said peaceful, he meant go and call the dog whistle. But also Elijah, who was on the ground, he said to me, while Donald Trump was speaking, they left like 20 minutes before he finished speaking and people had already started attacking the house. So Donald Trump, when it all started kicking off, he was still giving his speech. So, apparently violence and whatnot. So none of it makes sense. And also, I don't know if we're going to talk about this or not, but how come there was only like 50 police officers guarding every single person in government? Yeah, I mean, I think if we've learned one thing from this, which, you know, God bless the families of those who have lost their lives. I know there was a, what, two police officers now that we know of. But it has exposed really, really, really big vulnerabilities in the Capitol Police, how they operate, what, you know, I mean, because imagine that there were some foreign, you know, bad operators. Right. With weapons. Yes. Everyone in that, in that facility would probably be toast. And mind you, they had weeks to prepare. Donald Trump said a long time ago, hey, everybody, January six, come to DC, I'm giving a speech. And even leading up. Although they shouldn't have believed though that Donald Trump supporters would do that, right? Because just a couple weeks earlier, there was another big match in DC with a whole bunch of Trump supporters. And everyone, everyone is peaceful. Okay. Yeah. Why, why, even if they will, if even if it is like the most peaceful protest, but you know that people are angry about something, why would you not even prepare? You've known this for weeks. And that's all you've, you've got. And like you said, what if there was somebody from another country or whatever who had bad intentions, how easy would it have been to go in and do anything they wanted? Yeah. And then Nancy Pelosi's office and access to a computer. Wow. Oh my gosh. Yeah. That's insane to me. That's like, that's insane that everyone in the government except the president was there. And you had 50 police offices. Yeah. What? Yeah. Definitely exposing vulnerabilities. I know there have been a lot of resignations since that as well for the people who are supposed to be in charge of Capitol police. We've got more coming up. You know, we're talking about all this coming from the left that we were talking about earlier in Peachman again. Coming up, the Biden team has announced their inauguration theme is America United. Oh, I have a feeling these two at the table will have a little bit to say about that. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Home Title Lock. Now, if you have not heard of Home Title Theft, it's a really scary situation. And it's a good thing you've never heard of it. Because if you have, it's probably happened to you and you've just lost all of the equity in your home. So here's what happens. You've got all of these thieves, these hackers who go online where they know that your home's title is kept. Everything's kept online now, right? Where they can hack into it, they find your home's title. They will forge your signature on a quick claim deed that says that you sold your home to this hacker. And then they can do whatever they want. They can take out loans against your home until your equity is gone, which most times is your, it's your retirement nest egg, right? And then all of that is just gone in the blink of an eye. By the way, if you're not scared enough, you might be thinking, oh, I'm protected by probably my insurance plan or my bank. No, no, no, no. You're not protected by insurance, your bank, or even common identity theft programs. Home title lock will protect you though, all right? And in the unlikely event that you become a victim of title theft while you are with home title lock, they will spend up to a quarter million dollars in legal fees to help restore your home's title. Yeah, it costs that much. All right. Here's what you need to do to make sure you are not already a victim of home title lock. Go to home title lock.com after this program, home title lock.com, register your address. You will see if you're already a victim, you can use code radio for 30 free days of protection. I know this isn't a radio show. I don't know why it's code radio, but just use the code. All right. Radio at home title lock.com for those 30 free days of protection home title lock.com back in a minute. Joe Biden's transition team has announced that the theme for their inauguration for Joe Biden will be America. He will be united and will focus on Biden's efforts to forge a new national journey and a path to a brighter future. I know that is so sweet. Isn't it? It sounds very genuine, not at all disingenuous because as we know leading up to the inauguration, Joe Biden has been very, very unifying. Yes. Language and what he has. Well, actually no one ever really knows what Joe Biden is talking about. So we just have to interpret it. As unifying like that's fair. Donald Trump incited violence when he said remain peaceful. Joe Biden is just subject to interpretation. Yes. Whatever he says he might not mean. Eric, your thoughts. Look, man, it's to see what's going on right now with the these people can't even tolerate folks on the same forms of social media as them. They can't even they can't even stomach it. They want you to move. They want you starve. They want you to they come for your jobs. They want everything. And then sit here and talk as if they care about unity. No, it's better off. They're just saying allegiance is what they want. They want to do they want to your they demand certainly your allegiance. None of this has anything to do with unity. I have absolutely no desire to be unified with people that won't be dead anyway. But that's not on the table. That's not even in the rhetoric. That's not even in their in their language to try to unify. People that's not what it's about. So I accept that though. I'm embracing that. I don't want to share government with you either. So yeah, let's let's let's break this thing up. But unity coming from that clown. Can't take this. When they talk about unity as well, they're never talking about like, hey, we want to reach out to everyone who loved Donald Trump. We want to hear your concerns like what was it that you loved about him? What were things that he did? It's no, it's not about unifying the conservative part of America. It's just about pandering to all of the minorities, all of the if you're black, if you're transgender, we just want to unify with you. Get on board with us or get the hell out. Yeah, is really what they want to say. Oh, unity is here. You need to love all these people and accept them and help them in every way. And if you don't, then you're not part of unifying and get out and hate. We hate you. So it's like you're not unifying. You're making your own little club with half of America and you're calling it unity. Right. Well, unity. Yeah. Unless you disagree. Yes. Screw you. Yeah, exactly. Speaking of all of this unity that Joe Biden is promising, Joe Biden also, I believe it was the same day, maybe a day later that he announced that his theme was going to be unity. He also announced that their priorities, their administration's priorities for economic business relief, oh, it's just going to be based on race and gender. Watch. It will be on small businesses on Main Street that aren't wealthy and well connected, but are facing real economic hardships through no fall of their own. Our priority will be black, Latino, Asian and Native American owned small businesses, women owned businesses and finally having equal access to resources needed to reopen and rebuild. But we're going to make a concerted effort to help small businesses in low income communities in big cities, small towns, rural communities that have faced systemic barriers to relief. So Joe Biden acknowledges that these businesses that are hurting through no fault of their own. Right. But if you're white, you're screwed. White man. Yeah. Sorry. If you're a female, you might still get it. You will be prioritized if you are a female, but if you're a white man, you deserve it. This is the time for every man who owns a business to just sign it over to his wife's name. And then there we go. Okay. Problem solved. I mean, is it like, I watch this and I'm like, this is for all the talk that all of the left said about us having a racist president the last four years, this is blatant racism and they are putting it on a pedestal and saying, oh my gosh, it's so beautiful. I'm like, you just called this president racist for the last four years. This is actual racism. Right. And it's beautiful. Most definitely they can prioritize actual legitimate, like by definition, racist policy and which they are going to exclude a certain type of person from all of these sort of reliefs. I just always find it hilarious to hear these guys talking about this as if government had absolutely nothing to do with why. Right. No matter what kind of business or what color or race that you were or gender, you weren't shut down because of the virus. You were shut down because of the government. So yes, it's no fault of their own, but who's the fault? That's something that they absolutely never say, which is so frustrating to me when I hear them talk about this is that they act like they had absolutely nothing to do about this. The only subsidy, the only thing that can happen is just to allow people to get back to work. They don't need you, but that's what they want. They want dependency. They want. And that's why they'll sit there and throw that out there. We're going to do this for you. We're going to do that. We're going to tell you how, of course, we're not going to tell you how. We're just going to say that that's the reason why we're doing it for. We're going to help all of these, these minority on business, women on business, Native Americans, all that. We're going to set you up. We're going to set you up. That's what we're going to prioritize. They're telling you exactly who they're signaling to right there. And this has nothing to do with actually solving the problem, which is the state came in and they made it illegal for people to operate. That's y'all's doing. That's that institution's doing. And we need to stop pretending as if it's anything but that. They act like they have absolutely nothing to do with this situation. They'll even blame it on Donald Trump. And that's what's so frustrating to me. We even saw Cuomo today come out and say, well, we got reopened, right? And then what he said, he's like, we got to, as if he had nothing to do about it. It's like that. What show is that always sunny in feeling with a guy, it was like, yeah, I play on both sides. They'll always come out on top. And that's exactly what they want you to forget. It's like Mrs. Tech's book gaslighting, man. But it's silly if they're if their whole thing is like pretending that the reason your business has failed was not because of them, but it was because of COVID and whatnot. Why not do it equally to everybody, to every single American who lost their business? Why are you only targeting black women who lost business because of COVID? Like if the reason is, we're going to help you out because of COVID, but we're only going to help out black women because of COVID. What are the systemic barriers anyway? What are you talking about when he said they had these systemic barriers so they didn't allow them to get relief? And I'm sitting here like, what did y'all have some like only white people get this subsidy or what exactly are you talking about? Everything is rhetoric with these guys. They just use the same buzz times over and over and over. And they want you to take that into consideration. They don't have to say anything. They don't even mean anything. All you were saying is just hide air. Not untrue. Not untrue. We've got more coming up first. We want to think our sponsor, Bilt Bar, if you are one of probably millions of Americans who one of your New Year's resolutions was, okay, I need to eat healthier. Maybe I have some weight to lose. Maybe you just had a baby three months ago and your son came into the room and you were feeling good about your body. And then your son said, you're fatter than you used to be. Not that I know anyone that that's happened to. You need Bilt Bar in your life, okay? Bilt Bar is a protein bar, but it is way healthier than probably your favorite protein bar. And as an added bonus, it doesn't taste like chalk like all of those do. They're low calorie. They're high protein, high fiber. If you're on keto, they're great for keto. I do it myself with keto. So if you're looking to lose weight or maintain, they are so good. If you love chocolate, you're going to love Bilt Bar. They are covered in 100% real chocolate and they taste like a candy bar, honestly. I've got so many, my husband is going to kill me if I order any more Bilt Bars to be sent to my house. So I think we've got Candy Canned Brownie right now. We've got Carmel Brownie. We've got white chocolate cookies and cream. We've got a peanut butter. We've got way too many Bilt Bars in my house. We eat them every day. So if you are looking to lose weight and also eat healthier but delicious, you've got to try Bilt Bar. I'm telling you, go to builtbar.com. Again, it's not Bilt Bar. It's Bilt Bar. People in the comments one day were like, why are you talking about Bilt Bar? No, no, no, no. I'm talking about a delicious protein bar that you can eat. Builtbar.com. Use promo code NUS20. You'll get 20% off. They're already very reasonably priced. So you are getting a steal today. If you go to builtbar.com, promo code NUS20 for 20% off. Back in a minute. We just mentioned Andrew Cuomo earlier, Eric. Andrew Cuomo, not only did he come out and say, come Lee, you know what? Being shut down is really hurting the economy. Maybe we should open back up. That's a really novel concept. He also is in hot water because he apparently had stuck to very rigid guidelines with the COVID vaccine that prioritized healthcare workers, residents and staff of nursing homes and group homes so much so that medical providers were throwing unused vaccines in the trash can. That's how great government bureaucracy is. So they, of course, we know these vaccines had to be kept at very, very low temperatures. And whenever you started using one of the dose, you know, you can get several doses from the one vial, they had to throw it away after so many hours. So because we know, again, big bureaucracy, always very good, very efficient. They were actually throwing vaccines in the trash can. So Trump, miracle that he gets this vaccine, say what you will about the vaccine, which by the way, I think they belong in the trash can. That's where I would put it personally. But from the left, they said, oh, it would be a miracle if Trump even got this vaccine in time. There's no way he's going to get this vaccine in time. He gets the vaccine. And then now they're being forced to throw them in the trash can because the states can't figure out how to get these injections. Oh, man, it's almost like that's applied to, I don't know, everything the state does, not just New York, every single state in which I don't know why you think a handful of almost called them something else, a handful of people can can somehow dictate how efficiently an entire geographical area state can administer something. It's almost as if they are designed to be inefficient. Like the libertarian at the table, I hadn't been screaming this, but I don't know how long and how the hell could you literally scream it? How the hell can Cuomo of all people still be touted as this guy that somehow had a, we know that time and time again, under his leadership, if you want to call it that, they failed at every single, darn most deaths. I mean, with a nursing home and today, and now we got this and you mean, but he wrote a book on how to handle. That's right. And they come from up and you also got a friggin, Amy, what was it? I'll ask whatever it is, any international, Amy award for all the things that he was doing sitting in front of the TV. It's not like he was just doing that because he wanted to see himself or something like that. That had nothing to do with it. He just wanted to really get out there and just inform the people. I don't know how anybody can look at what's happened with this whole COVID thing and sit here and still advocate for bigger government unless you're on crack. Amen. Yes, you're not on crack, are you? Certainly not. You would know if I was. No, I think the interesting thing about the vaccine is that it's not even about someone's individual choice for medical, whatever. It's like a moral thing now. It's like, oh, if you get the vaccine, like, you know how everyone's criticizing the TikTok Nexus because they're always just like doing, doing, working day hard. Yeah. Overwhelmed. Yes. Overwhelmed. We're seeing some TikTok nurse videos where the nurses are like, hmm, vaccines are kind of scary. Huh, well, we decided that we love people. So we went and got the vaccine and it's like, it's the mask on steroids. You're enough. Yeah. And you're not even saying, hey, this is going to be really good for you because X, Y and Z, it's because we love people. They think way too holly of themselves. Yeah. I'm not a kid. Don't speak to me like a kid. Second of all, this is a medical procedure that everyone should. I never got vaccines. My parents were always like, no, look at me. This is health. Wait, you're alive. You're alive. You guys. It's a miracle. Yes. I only got the vaccines that you have to be able to be in a country. And I'm fine. That should be my choice. That should be everyone's individual choice. It shouldn't be a moral decision whether I'm going to choose to vaccine or have any medical procedure done. That's my choice. Well, it is interesting too to Kaza's point, Eric, because if the vaccines work, like for you, then you will never get out. Everybody gets in. It doesn't matter about like we love people. Like if you're getting the vaccine, it should be to protect you, right? Not everyone else. I get the whole herd immunity theory. Right. I'm just saying the vaccine itself is supposed to protect you. Yeah. So it shouldn't have like if I didn't want it and you got it, it shouldn't even matter. Right. I can go back to that brand new test. I'm going to go back to the test that I'm assuming with all, so the other people who decided that they didn't want to get it. But that's why. When I keep calling in a cathedral, guys, this is why I am saying this. Like these guys want you to worship them. At the altar. Like they have these. It's nothing. You're seeing how compromised the medical community is. But you also see these like these scientists and doctors, these academic, lead to a sit best for you and whatever government doctor be it foul cheer whoever they get up there and say whatever it is they want to say and we're just supposed to listen as if we don't have doctors of our own that we can kind of consult to and converse with to decide what's better for us. It just goes in line with everything else it is that they push for it in that they don't see you as an individual. It's like use in Asia like you can make the decision to kill yourself but you can't make the decision to protect yourself from a virus. Yeah yeah on on how you'd like to do that I know insanity. What I like to say where there is risk there must always be choice. All right we got to go back in a minute. How are you? All right Friday full do you want to go back to 2020 which is saying a lot because 2020 really sucked but the beginning of 2021 I already want my refund back. I don't I did not ask for this. 69.6% of you almost 70% of you said no you don't want to go back to 2020 you're hedging your bets on 2021. We'll see what happens with a Democrat controlled both chambers right and then the presidency. Oh man I can't wait. Today's poll do you have hope for 2021? I would love to see these results. I don't you know what I've kind of just resigned to the fact that like it's just going to really suck for several years and I am just focusing on my family and you know local right because I'd like to believe that the federal government is not going to affect us as much as your local government. Maybe if we abolished the damn thing we could get to talking about that people would pay more attention. Look I'm dead serious. I'm not joking when I talk about this. That and that's why I'm more optimistic because a lot of folks so I say yes to that I am optimistic because a lot of folks are more open right now to the concept of decentralization. Are you optimistic because you guys know what just happened to her husband and her family. This is the wrong time for me to have. No answer in the answer.
