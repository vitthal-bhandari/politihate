    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On Demand Why is this so important? Why did you pick the story? Why does this matter? This is the news. And why? Why? And why it matters. Hi, I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Welcome to the news and why it matters. The table is all in agreement that what's going on in South Africa is the top story of the day. Glenn, I want to start with you on what's going on and why it matters. Well, I'm having a hard time finding what's going on. The press is barely covering it. There is a new president in South Africa who has announced that now that Nelson Mandela is dead, the time for reconciliation is over. And they are following the path of other countries. Zimbabwe, Russia did this as well, where they are taking the farms from the farmers and giving them to the lower cost. That are not farmers. Do not have the experience. That country is going to starve to death. But first, we'll have a race war. They are pitting the whites against the blacks and saying, I mean, one of the main leaders in the party has a song, Kill the Bores, which is basically Kill the Whites. He often talks about slitting the throats of white power. They are headed for real trouble and the media is not covering it. Jason? Okay, so tagging along with that, the media is not covering it. And who are the only people that have voices on this? It's the same thing with the immigration crisis in Europe. No one will talk about it that's in the mainstream politicians won't talk about. The only people that have been gravitating to that story are people on the... All right. ...light and alt-right. Those are the only people that are talking about it. And I think because of that, a lot of us have kind of shied away from the story. Like, I've done the same thing. I looked at it, I looked at some of the facts, some of the figures, and I just didn't really want to go there because I didn't want to be associated with some of the people talking. I would say this because you and I have talked about it because I've asked for research on it. We can't find anyone that is not alt-light or alt-right to cover it. And so I'm not going to go on the air with facts that I don't know. We're talking about it today because the Guardian in London finally covered it. And we've been watching the videos. But if you look for coverage on this online, it is only the alt-right. And that's dangerous. This is how the alt-right grows. Because the mainstream media will not reflect what's really going on. And so somebody who is an identarian, somebody who says my identity is the most important, my color, my race, they stand up. And the rest of the people who have been concerned about immigration or killing of the white farmers, they stand up and say no one's talking about it, but we will. And people flock to them. Pat, I want to bring you into the conversation. But before we do that, I do want to go ahead and show you guys are talking about how the media is not covering this. They're not picking it up. I went to CNN to try to see if I could find it. And I did not find it. However, I did find all these things about the Manafort trial, the EPA rolls back Obama-era coal pollution rules. And Trump is powerless as his legal fate spins out of his control. These were the headlines on CNN. Nothing about what's going on in South Africa. They are seizing the biggest farms, which is the food source. They're seizing the farms. They are giving the white farmers X number of days. I think it's 10 days to leave. Otherwise, they'll be killed. That's the assumption. And we can do something. We can actually take these white farmers in. But no, no, no. No, we've got to take some millions in first. Wait a minute. Hang on. We cannot know. We don't know who's a good Somalian who's not. Here's a group of people that for no fault of their own, they're just living their lives, their farmers, their productive. They happen to be white and they're going to be slaughtered. And they're trying to get here to the United States and we will not let them in. The president wants to, but no one else will. Yeah. Well, that's what I'm wondering is, are we going to do anything about this? Are we just going to sit by and watch white farmers be annihilated in South Africa? It's fascinating to me that the UN is doing nothing on this. We actually searched for something the UN had done, talked about, communicated on the South African situation. There's nothing. I mean, they're not doing anything about it. They're too busy doing resolutions against Israel right now. And nothing on the South African thing. If this isn't what the UN is for, what are they for? I mean, if this is not what the UN was designed to take care of and you're not doing anything, well, then what good is this? We've said this for years. Get the UN out of the US. They're awful. They don't do anything. And on top of this, we have another situation in Venezuela. That's not being covered because that's a massive failure of socialism. And so no one, notice the media was all there. Hollywood was there when it looked like it was going to be great. Now that people are starving to death, they're not covering it. Venezuela was not prepared. It was a first world country. It was one of the richest countries in the Americas. It was like us, just 10 years ago. Now people are eating their dogs and their cats. Doctors and lawyers are now prostituting their bodies to be able to feed their family. There's an emergency crisis on the border. Colombia's border is out of control. All of the people going, our border is going to be out of control. And what are we doing? We're doing nothing. And the press isn't reporting it. So please don't tell me it's because they're white farmers. I care just as deeply about the Hispanics that are in Venezuela that are also starving to death. And we're talking about Manafort. It's insane. A chicken dinner is 14,600,000 boulevards, which is $2.22 American. They cannot afford it. That shows you the minimum wage there is a dollar a month. So it goes to show the situation they're in. And you're not doing anything for them either. So should we? Yes. Mercury One is. Mercury One is. We're currently looking for the right people to distribute it on the ground. We have to be very, very careful. But we are and we'll be announcing that very shortly. I think you just did. We are working a lot behind the scenes on this. Yes, we have been for a while. It's all shut down. You just cannot get to it. And that's why I'm here to talk about the way. If you or your family members, if you know anyone in Venezuela that can communicate with us and tell us what's going on or in South Africa, please contact us. We don't have any sources. I will say this from the people that we have attempted to reach out to. We haven't even heard the worst that's going on in Venezuela. Some of the stories I'm getting now, it'll blow you away. Just to tease it a little bit. But rogue military units trying to find their own way to survive, kidnapping people, selling them as slaves. This is stuff that we're hearing about that's going on. These are the things that there are groups that are actually trying to go and induce stuff about this. You know what's there? You know what's crazy? This would unite the country. If we said, look, I want to stop arguing about socialism. Why do we go help this failure? And we can argue about whether we're going to do it, but let's go help them. Let's go help the people in South Africa. We can argue about how much white and black hate each other here and how horrible our lives are, but these people are going to get killed. Here's an idea. We can talk about a wedding cake later. Right now they're throwing homosexuals off the roofs of skyscrapers in Tehran. We can talk about the loss of religion here, but right now in Myanmar they are killing Christians. What do you say? What do you say? We just stop talking about all this crap and start doing it. Go ahead Jason. In South Africa there's this group. The more I was reading about that one group, I think his last name is Malayma, the guy that started a lot of this. He's with a group called the Economic Freedom Fighters. I was just reading through their demands, like early demands back in the day. They see some of the sounds familiar. They're like, we want free college tuition. We want single payer healthcare. We want guaranteed housing. Some of this is starting to line up with what you hear today. It's the EFF and it is democratic socialism. But to get these things done you need some kind of populist rallying cry. So what did they do? They started blaming the bores. All the white farmers out there, they're the ones taking away all your money. They're the ones to blame. What started happening? Well record numbers of all this hatred was spilled out over, directed their direction. Record numbers of white farmers were starting to get killed. I was looking into more of these numbers because they were even disputed, but people in the country were trying to turn it. But last year almost 100 white farmers were killed. We're talking about rural areas. There's nothing out there. But over 100 were killed. And it's almost two farmers a week. It's insane. We're talking about the kinds of deaths where one of the farmers, he told his wife to run inside the house and lock all the doors. And they have already prepared. They have bars on the windows and so no one was going to get in. She ran in the house. She locked herself in. They slaughtered him outside of the house. Then they just lit the house on fire and burned her alive. I mean this is Nazi Germany in Poland. It's happening again. And it's not the Jews. It's just a white person. Just a white person. It's a person. What are we doing? And the people trying to dispute the homicide numbers are saying that white farmers rate homicides are going up with the rest of the country. I'm sorry, but that's not a regular homicide. That is retribution. What you just described. That was torture. They're making them pay for what they consider was a crime against the rest of the people. That's what's going on there. It was so bad. If you doubt those numbers, it was so bad that someone in the government just a few months ago tried to get expedited visas to come to the United States of the farmers. Do you remember when that was going on? Yes. Now if the government's saying no, it's just rising with regular numbers, then why are they people inside the government saying, okay, we need to get some of these guys out of there. Because it is a problem. And this is only going to get worse. I mean, this is what gives credibility to Trump when he talks about the press and how dangerous they are, is that, you know, I think that people aren't hearing about it. They're just not hearing about it because, again, they're not seeing it on CNN. They're not reading it in the headlines. And so, you know, to your point that why don't we unite and help them? Because we don't know. People don't know that it's going on. It's the biggest threat in the universe of all mankind and all alien species happens to be the orange fellow in the White House, they think. It's not true. It's not true. Have you seen what they're doing in China? In China, they have rounded up one million Muslims, rounded them up. They've built a re-education camp. They're disappeared. One million of them have been disappeared. In the last, what, 12 months? Million. We are sitting here and we're being lectured on how horrible we are to Muslims. What do you say we stand up for the one million Muslims in China who are just, God knows what's happening to them. We know they're building more, I'm sorry. More re-education camps in China. They're building them today. You can see them on satellite photos. And the Muslim community is crying out for help. In China, they just torched 165 Christian churches. Wow. What are we doing? What are we doing? Yeah. Alright, let's take a break. Hi, it's Glenn and I want to thank you so much for listening to the podcast today. I want to tell you about another show I think you're going to like. It's called The Morning Blaze. It's with Doc Thompson. You can check it out right now, wherever you get your favorite podcast. This is going to go ahead and call this segment, How Far Left Is The Left These Days. Let's start with Antifa, Pat. Now they're pretty far left. The Antifa group in Austin is calling for a Red Army. They want to start a Red Army and they posted this on Facebook. Please start it in Texas. Please start it in Texas. Come to the worst place. Oh my gosh. Here's their Facebook post. We encourage the formation of paramilitary organizations on two levels. The first being those who are mainly unarmed but are prepared and trained to carry out fist fighting or using blunt weapons like axe handles or flag bulls as well as shields and basic armoring. The second level is the more advanced embryo of a Red Army, which is trained militarily and operates as soldiers all the time, engaging in production and mass work among the proletariat and the oppressed nations people. Of course. That's great. We stand up, shake off bad leadership and trying to impose itself on anti-fascism and come together under a better model of actual resistance and not token performance. When we organize and lead actions, the fascists do not march every step. Every step they take is met with physical confrontation and they're bombarded from all sides. On the basis of our principled United Front work, fascists and their collaborators can be drowned out, run out, routed, beaten bloody and even annihilated. These are our principles and we aim to hold them to the very finish. Could you read that again with a Thanos voice? It's what it's like and it's, you know, but that's on their Facebook page. That fortunately doesn't violate Facebook's hateful hate speech standards. Well, have you seen Prager you though? I mean, for eight days, nine or fifteen of their videos violated the standards at Facebook. This is unbelievable. You're calling for a red army. These are communists calling for a red army and violence. No, they are just good people standing up against Nazis and when you stand up against hate, you're morally correct. They're morally correct people. And that's the cover that's been laid down for them, isn't it? And then yeah, when they say, when they claim that, they always say, well, what's wrong with standing up against fascism? What's wrong with that? It's funny there was a, during the Patriot prayer rally at Oregon, we have some actual video of this, some of them attacked a guy that was walking through the crowd and he was carrying an American flag. I love this. And so he's carrying an American flag and they go upstairs, they're beating him eventually, they knock him over the head. He ends up getting a concussion for this. His only crime to them. And like 20, was it 20 stitches or? You must have, there he was and he just went down like a sack of potatoes. But his only crime apparently was he was carrying what they called a symbol of fascism. It was an American flag. They called that a symbol of fascism. The ironic thing here is that that guy is an ardent supporter of Bernie Sanders. He supports Bernie Sanders. He went, he was with Antifa. Yeah, he was there. Oh, wow. He wasn't engaging in the violence or anything. He just wanted to show that, hey, we're Americans too, which is fine. He wanted to show that his political ideology, although it's misguided, but he wanted to show it, but he wasn't engaging in violence. But regardless, he was declared an enemy of them. So it's what's funny is they claim that they're all about destroying fascism, whatever. They're the ones that are acting like fascists here. They're the ones that are acting like fascists. They're book burning. They're like shutting down free speech. It has nothing to do with going against fascism. You know, if they did, if they wanted to just punch Nazis, then why weren't they out falling around this Nazi war criminal? Were they barricading his house before we deported him today? No. No, because it doesn't matter. And how many people when he was deported, an actual 90-year-old Nazi that we've been trying to get out of the country for years, Donald Trump said, get the Nazi out of the country, finally put pressure on Germany to take him. He essentially made Germany take a job. Yeah, he did. And what did the left say today? They were xenophobic. Yeah. And he sees torturing this old man who makes no different. Elder of the United States. Come on. Yeah. What? It's insane. He's an actual Nazi. He is about the chaos. He helped kill people in the camps. Right. Right. That's insane. In other news of how far left is the left and how crazy is the far left, the... Go ahead. No, go. It's a LGBTQIA safe sex guide. How long is this acronym going to kill? It's longer than that, actually. There should be two cues and a two at the end. It's quilt bag. It's quilt bag. Yeah, that's true. So actually, health line needs to check their privilege because the new term is quilt bag. Yeah. Okay. So I'm reading this. And I want to thank you for being one of the people who sent it to me. Thank you for that. Yeah. I'm reading this this morning. That's sought and it had your name all over it. My opening monologue today was no. Just no. I'm not going over the cliff with the rest of humanity. I will not go here. They're now in this. We now have to teach that male parts don't belong to males. Female parts don't belong to females. They can belong to anybody. And they're teaching that in universities. Yeah. Okay. The purposes of this guide, we'll refer to the vagina as the front hole. Yeah. Okay. No. Not going to. Not going to. I don't care what happens. You know, no, not going to do it. By the way, we have more than one front hole. That's what I said. You got a mouth? You got a nose? You got to be a little more specific. I think if you're going here, you have to be more specific. Okay. More front hole. Is that good? Well, I could be the belly button. Yes. I mean, it's ridiculous. So you can't refer to the penis as the penis anymore because that's a male body part. No, I'm sorry. You know, when this started, I understand compassion. I understand the compassion that we should have for Caitlyn Jenner. Okay. I have compassion. He spent his whole life feeling that wasn't him. Okay. But I'm sorry. If you're going to put me under oath, I'll be nice about it and I'll call you Caitlyn. But if I'm under oath, I'm sorry. It's a dude or as Austin Power said, it's a man, man. Okay. I'm not going to go there. I'll be compassionate. But you're not talking about Caitlyn though, because that's a beautiful woman. That's it. That's just a stunningly beautiful woman. Right. You're going to deny science. They told us that homosexuality, this is science. You're arguing against science. Well, you've never found the homosexual gene, but I also know people who are gay. And I know people who have prayed, please Lord, take this away from me. I don't want to be this way. Who chooses that? Well now they're telling us that you choose that. Wait a minute. I didn't think it was a choice. Now it's fluid. Now you're encouraged to be anything you want. Well, and they place so much importance on science, science when it comes to climate change. You know, and now, but now when we want to talk about science and say calling, you know, saying that it is a penis is scientifically accurate, they say it doesn't matter. They're teaching now that biologically there is no difference between a man and a woman biologically. Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Yes, there is. And when it comes to climate change, I refer you to my opening monologue on my show today. The fires that are caused by climate change? No. Point three degrees Celsius is the change in California. Point three degrees. That's not making trees just burst into flames. I don't know. That means if it's 91 degrees today and 10 years, it's going to be 91 degrees. Right? 91. Whoo! Yes, it's going to be accurate. So that was accurate. I believe that was a hundred year change. In a hundred years from now, it'll be 91.3. So Jason, you're going to start teaching your kids front hole. I mean, it's front hole and back hole. Sorry, Dick, there was a sociology professor that you were talking about on your show yesterday that said that those biological differences are social constructs. They're just social constructs. Social constructs. And the people that... Oh, good gosh. That impose that are white supremacists men. So do you guys know... Really quick. Okay. Can we continue this on the show? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've got a story. I don't know if you guys know the story of the first doctor that brought us all of this stuff. That said, oh, it's a social construct. And girls can be boys and boys can be girls. I don't know if you know this story. You'll never forget it once you hear it. All right. Back in a minute. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. You said penis. really cosmetically do things, etc., etc. So John Money is this psychotherapist and psychologist or psychiatrist and he says, you know, I have this theory that gender is fluid, that you can actually just raise him as a girl and he'll be a girl. So the parents did and the story is absolutely horrifying. They kept bringing them all the way, I think, until the age of seven before the parents were like, okay, enough. They would keep bringing him and he would actually have the boy mount his brother or sister. He forced them to dress her as a girl, call her a girl. He was always asking to do boy things, be out with his brother, everything else. They never would let him. They always treated him as a girl because John Money said gender is fluid and we can just, you can just be a girl. Long story short, both brothers are dead now. The little girl was, had some surgery done later, to become a girl, then had surgery done to become a boy, finally got married as a man and shortly thereafter killed himself, all because of the upbringing. So amazing on multiple levels, but one thing that just hits me right off the top there is that they claim that gender is a social construct that we are putting on our kids. That's what they just, that's what they did. That's what they tried to do. They tried to socially construct and into a girl. It didn't work. It didn't work. He's the guy who gave us gender identity that no, no, no, gender is different than male or female. Well, here's the experiment. This is the first one and look what happened and no one knows that story. It's outrageous. On the topic of transgender's Pat, what's going on in Massachusetts? There was a bill for driver's licenses. Yeah, this is kind of interesting because somebody fought back a little bit. In Massachusetts, they wanted a gender for male, for female, and then ex-gender, so that you don't have to identify with either male or female. So a Republican said, you know what, that's not inclusive enough. Why would you just limit it to boy, girl, and ex? There's 74 genders in Facebook. So he forced the legislature into voting on a bill that considered each of them individually, that debated them each for 10 minutes and then voted on them. Oh, I love it. It was a huge process and it got so convoluted that they finally said, enough. No, okay, the bill failed. I love him. So we just tried to push it to the extreme. Yeah, we should. Yeah, that's good stuff. That's good stuff. Fantastic. That's amazing. So update to the Asia Argento story, Jason. She released a statement. Yes. I was shocked. Okay, so it was a her statement that she releases. She straight up denies it in a statement. And what she said was that Anthony Bourdain, her now dead boyfriend, it was all his idea. He was the one that wanted to pay off the, what, $300, $80,000 to this child actor. Now, so for one, I cannot believe that she is blaming the person that is now dead and can't answer for himself. But beyond that, even. So I guess TMZ got their hands on some text messages between Bourdain and Argento. And in those text messages, remember, she's denied that she had any, she says in it, she had no sexual interaction with this kid whatsoever. And the text messages, she's like, Oh, I don't, I know I'm broke. You know, I don't know what to do. You know, and he's like, don't worry, I got this. I got your back. But then all of a sudden she goes into, yeah, like, I felt so like frozen. I didn't know what to do because he was on top of me, you know, and we're in the bed. Wait a minute, girl, I thought you just said that you had no sexual. So not only is she putting this off on someone that is now dead and can't defend herself, but she's also now trying to say that she was the victim in this. Now it seems very obvious to me that from a 17 year old boy, from a 17 year old boy, when she was what 35, 37, 37. So it seems very obvious that she was literally caught red handed in this thing. This is what it seems to me and that she was basically begging and pleading for her rich boyfriend by lying to him and saying, yeah, okay, something happened, but it wasn't my fault. This kid was the one that was pressuring me, the 37 year old strong woman into doing this, which is, which is why it's so dangerous to say things like believe women. I mean, women can manipulate situations too. You know, it's not like, no, her good friend, her good friend, Rose McAllen, didn't say believe what he said, believe the victim. Survivor. Yes, survivor. Okay. Well, that would mean you believe the boy. Right. Yeah, except that's not what she's saying now. She's saying, we don't know the facts. Let's wait and see, be gentle. You know, it's interesting. Oh, well, that's a first. I know somebody who is famous, who has been down this road. And everybody said, well, look at what he paid. Look what he paid. Okay. Well, there's a couple things to that story. One, they were consensual relationships, okay, that money started to play a role and destroy a family. He has told me the biggest mistake he made was listening to counsel say, bury it, just pay it. He said, because that makes you instantly guilty. Now, are they going to accept that? Did they accept that from anybody? No. But are we forced to accept that from her? Or is she going to be treated like maybe a friend of mine has been treated? Is she going to be banished for all time? No, she won't be. Why? Because her politics are right. Yeah. Before we move on to the next story, I found this interesting. I read that he Bennett initially asked for like three million. And but they ended up settling for 380,000. And I was like, well, that's not really a great, like usually you come back with something a little larger than 380,000 if the initial ask was three million. Have you seen the tweets against Rose McGowan on that? Not Rose McGowan, but Asia, that she was that one of the reasons why he spun out of control was because of this. And she was constantly cheating on him. Oh, and her statement in the past was, Anthony and I had a very open relationship. We knew exactly where we stood. We could do whatever we want. Blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't think he agreed with that from what I've read. That doesn't seem to be the case. No. Not from his perspective. No, because I read that he was obsessed with her. So Jason, the US is planning to drop bonds. Yeah. So guys, I haven't. I win the show today with this. I've won the show if that's even possible. But today it's happening. Well, I feel like it's a state. It really is a competition. I haven't heard that. So a quick geopolitical segue update into this. So this makes sense. So you know about all that everything happening with the US and Turkey right now. We've been at odds for a while, but it really started heating up with the sanctions that were imposing on them because they're holding that pastor, which they basically, Erdogan lied to us, had us get one of their prisoners released, I think in Israel. We released him, but now they release this pastor, pastor basically to a home arrest. So they're not letting him go. So this is this is continuing to escalate. There's a lot of bad blood. Well, there's a lot of state run government publications, newspapers, and Turkey. One of them, very, very popular, has just said what he believes will be the ultimate US attack on Turkey. And apparently, everyone's freaked out about this in Turkey. But really popular columnists just said that, look, back in the late 1940s, when we were developing the A-bomb, we were also developing another bomb. It's called the gay bomb. Now, we were going to drop the gay bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but we just switched the last minute and dropped the A-bomb. This is not serious. This is straight up serious. I'm going to give this to you. It's got to go on radio tomorrow. This is awesome. What does the gay bomb do? Well, duh. It does the same thing as fluoride does the frogs. Right? Only here. Okay, I just wanted to be clear. That's what it does. I didn't want to assume anything. I just wanted to make sure for the record. You're not interested in front holes anymore, unless you already have a front hole. You drop the gay bomb, everybody turns gay, and that wipes out your civilization. What's in the gay bomb that turns us all gay? That's a very good question. Is it fluoride? No, actually, he does go. It might be actually, but he goes at heaps. He actually goes into that. It's very detailed. It talks about the sterilization programs, through different chemicals we've experimented with. Wow. It's common. We did experiments on sterilization. In fact, the progressives did sterilize people. True. But apparently, they turned it into a bomb as well, which is incredibly more efficient now. Yeah, we are so good. Remember when we talked, Pat, this is during the first call for, and we had the inventor of the neutron bomb who spoke to him. It was the most chilling bone, chilling interview I've ever done. It's an old man, and he invented the neutron bomb. Do you know what the neutron bomb is? Kills people, leaves buildings intact. They're one nuclear. Okay, yeah, thermonuclear. So you drop it, and the first effect is it ignites. No, that's a fuel air bomb. The neutron bomb, actually you drop it, and it pounds people with radiation. So you're too sick to fight, but you have 45 minutes to live. Okay. So your entire army and all of the people in the city, everything's fine. Nothing is affected, just living things. Yeah, it doesn't blow down buildings and it's just a radiation release. He was on the air with us talking about how he was really upset that we weren't, we would never even consider using it, because think of all the money we would save. We would never have to rebuild a country. We would never have to read, everything would be fine. It's just all the people were dead. We're like, okay. All right, I'm glad they didn't listen to you very much. It was terrifying. Wow. Thank you for that nightmare I'm going to have to let go. I appreciate it. So Michael Cohen has surrendered to the FBI. I know this is all developing kind of as we're speaking, but Jason, you were reading that there's not, he's pleading guilty, but there's not a deal. I first read that it was a plea deal. Right. That's what I read too. And everyone was wondering, oh, what is he going to give up? He did all the headlines where he's turned, but now federal prosecutors are saying there's no plea deal. It was a straight up guilty plea, and it includes I think three to five years in prison, something like that. Yeah, that's what I read too. Three to five years for sure in prison. So he's going down the river. Yeah. So today's poll question. The river. Up the river. Up the front hole. Across the river. Up the bay. So today's poll going along with that. Does Cohen's guilty plea affect your opinion of President Trump? Of course he was very close to President Trump. You know, his lawyer shared a lot. Zero percent. So yes. Zero percent. Zero. I mean, we all knew who this guy was. He was a fixer. Yes. Nobody has really a very good one. Yeah. Right. But nobody has a fixer that's clean. Yeah. Some of the stuff that he said to people when that we played on the air, you know, this is not a good guy. Yeah. He's not a good guy. But if he's not a good fixer, then I think President Trump will be in trouble. But if he did his job well, he did his job. If he did his job well, this is as far as it'll go. Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday's poll results. Remember we did a special one where we did a little experiment, and then we did a regular poll. So do you support Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance? 94% of you said yes. Six percent said no, no surprise there. But our experiment, we re asked the question on the military parade. So Thursday's question was, do you approve of your tax dollars going toward a military parade? 57% said yes. Wow. And 43, yeah. 43% said no way. What? 57% said, yeah. We're okay. We're spending 92 million dollars on a military parade. Yes. I had the same reaction. God bless the USA. Oh my God. A lot of that was keeping the Oh my God. You would have arrived to be able to sing this song at the end of the parade. He comes in like Santa Claus. But here's the experiment we did. Yes. So in light of Donald Trump canceling the parade due to cost, we re asked the question. Right. Hang on. So remember that first poll was taken when Donald Trump won it. I want the parade. Yes. Now that Donald Trump says no does this. No, don't do this to me. It completely flipped. It completely flipped. Do you support a military parade? 44% said yes. 56% said no. It's completely flipped. Wow. LOL nothing matters. I think in the name of the show. Thank you peculiar Baptist for that one. Yeah, from a veteran's perspective, none of us want that. I can't think of anybody that wants a, it's a parade. Take the money out of it. Nobody. We don't want to be glorified like that. We don't. I can't think about you. I want to see the missiles. Right. It's funny though. I heard that from one of our viewers, Lori online said the same exact thing was that she's her husband as a military. She's like, no one in the military even wants this. But, but, but, but, but, I don't. It's, it's, it is only somebody who likes the show of Mike. Look, we all love it when the, when the planes fly over the stadiums before you know, angels love, try to go there every year, watch their show. That's fantastic. That's different than a military parade, which is just a show of force and deflects our muscles. Nobody, nobody wants that. But, but put that almost $100 million into something that could really actually really help veterans. If you really want to do that, like, I personally, this might not be popular to some people, but exactly. Or I'm all about privatizing the VA. I don't think it should be a government ran thing because I think that they've screwed it up. Their time is gone. And I think it's time for us private industry to say, look, we got this. We'll take it from here. I know that's not all very popular with a lot of veterans, but that's the way I think it is. I think it's something that important. We should not leave up to any kind of government. That should be our responsibility. Before we go, can I just ask the table of questions? You guys feel there's a change in the air, but there is that this democratic socialist stuff is going to come undone, that all of this stuff is, is exposing it to be the radical, you know, the radicals that they really are. You're hearing people, I was watching Twitter last night with the debate of some people on, you know, democratic socialism. And we just want healthcare like they have in Switzerland. They have one of the best with, well, that's private. That's private. It's funded by government dollars, but it's still private. Same thing over in Sweden. That's a welfare state, not a socialist state. And I think this, I think people are starting to wake up a little bit. I think they are. Hope so. I think they are. And I think with, you know, we talked, I guess it was last week about places like Vox shedding light on how much it's going to cost. And, you know, I mean, left-leaning sites who are still kind of like, oh, I don't know that we want to be associated with this. Yeah, the Democrat that I had on two days ago or yesterday on radio. Fantastic. Yeah. Exposing his own side, almost like the beginning of a little tea party for the Democrats. Let's hope they are waking up to it because it reminds me of a quote from Romeo and Juliet. These violent desires have violent ends. It circles back to South Africa. It started off as what you would hear from a democratic socialist nowadays, offering up all this stuff, channeling populism to get these things done. But your desires end up having violent ends the further you take this towards end game. Eventually, there's got to be a scapegoat and there's going to be a violent conversation. You're seeing that with white farmers over there. Over here, they're doing the same thing. But they're dividing us. They're giving us identities. They're pitting each other against each other. All for their own selfish motivations and desires. It will end up violently if we don't wake up. I'm going to leave it on Glenn's positive note that they are waking up. Yeah. I think they are. I think we're all going to die. But... Right. Tomorrow or do we have some time? No. Do what you really want to complete tonight. All right. We'll see you guys tomorrow."
