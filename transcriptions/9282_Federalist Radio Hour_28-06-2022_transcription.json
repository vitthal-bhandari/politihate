    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Juszenski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FTRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I'm here with a virtual roundtable of the Federalist's younger female staffers starting with Jordan Boyd. And then we have El Reynolds. We have Kylie Griswald and we have Madeline Osburne. Kylie, before we begin, I wanted to congratulate you on your recent nuptials, on your relaxing honeymoon week. Our listeners may know you as Kylie Zemple. But you are the same person. Can we confirm that? It is the same old me. Unless I have a really bad hot take, in which case, I don't know who Kylie Griswald is, and we'll go back to the old man. You can just blame it on Madeline. That's what I always do. Yeah, you do. Yeah. Well, on that note, we are assembled here as we continue sort of digesting the reality that Roe v. Wade has been relegated to the ash heap of history. I wanted to talk to some of my colleagues who grew up, like me, in the 90s and the 2000s, with this notion that Roe v. Wade was permanent, was a standard, was a norm, and it would be sort of impossible to ever uproot Roe from its place in American politics and culture, which turned out to be false. But it seemed as though we didn't realize just how vulnerable Roe always was, although the decision itself, as we've talked about many times on this podcast, has been criticized for decades. Basically since it was handed down by liberal, legal, judicial scholars, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, of course, included because rooting the right to abortion and the right to privacy has always been very tenuous. Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion, brought up that rooting a lot of different rights to privacy is something the court should consider in future places, consider the wisdom of in future cases. So on that note, with that table sort of being set that we grew up in this world in which legalized abortion was the norm, it was the expectation, it was the standard, and it was part of the American fabric. I want to go around the proverbial table here and start with Jordan, then I'll go to Elle, then I'll go to Kylie and Madeline. First of all, tell me, Jordan, how you are reacting or what your initial reaction was when you first heard the leak and then was made official that Roe v. Wade was over. I mean, I think when the leak came out, we were all really caught off guard. No one expected that. And I was a little bit angry because I felt like it camped down what could have been this massive celebration. You know, it sort of tainted what was going to be a victory for almost 50 years of pro life movement organization and big activism. But once, you know, the ball started rolling, I realized this is a really great opportunity for us to take advantage of sort of the political wins that come with this decision. And so we saw that between the few months, between the leak and when the final opinion was released, there was a lot of ramping up on both sides. We saw violence and calls for violence on the left and we saw conservatives, you know, being celebratory but cautious and sort of looking to move the ball forward. So when the final decision came out, we saw that Alito, you know, and the rest of the predictably conservative judges stick to their guns, even though they were intimidated and even in some cases like Brett Kavanaugh threatened by assassination, they stayed firm and they said, you know what, this is, this was a bad decision. It was egregiously wrong. And I think, you know, that was just a brilliant way to take down everything. And when you read through Alito's opinion, you read through Thomas's concurring, you just see all of the little things come together and leave this great tapestry for states to be able to take forward in their legislatures. And Elle, I'm going to throw it to you with an addition to that question, which is, what did it mean to you as somebody, a woman, and I think you grew up in a fairly conservative environment, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but who grew up with abortion being legalized, with Roe sort of hanging over our heads as a country? Sure. Well, I think Jordan's right about the leak. I'll say as far as the decision itself, I think, I know for me, and I think for a lot of other conservatives, it was extremely encouraging to see a culture issue on which we've worked hard for 50 years since the Roe decision and to see that one in a time that I think a lot of conservatives feel like they see the Left's culture war in everything from classrooms to doctors' offices where we see some really radical propaganda being pushed on children, especially in the last couple of years. And so I think a lot of conservatives feel like there's this heavy culture war that, as hard as we fight back on it, it's kind of encroaching. And then to see this victory, it's just really the biggest conservative victory that we've seen, I think, in decades, it was extremely encouraging. And yeah, I mean, you're right, I grew up in a conservative family and I remember as a kid going with my mom when a lady that we knew was considering an abortion and we went and we prayed with her in the parking lot of the abortion facility. And I still remember that I was little, but knowing that women like that are going to be directed to pro-life pregnancy clinics that can help them and knowing that it's going to be harder for them to get to that point where they would want to turn murder their child, their unborn child. I think that is good news all around. Kindly, what's your reaction, Ben? I know you were literally on your honeymoon when the decision came down. How did you react? Yeah. Well, when the actual decision came down, I had logged off of all my social media. I wasn't on Twitter or email or signal or anything. So I was trying not to be in the news and I forgot to turn off my Wall Street Journal push notifications. And so usually I just ignore those anyway because a lot of them are not real news, but I saw the opinion and it was definitely a moment of celebration. I wouldn't say I was surprised when the actual decision came down, but that was really my only reaction to the leak was just sheer surprise. I know a lot of conservatives had publicly speculated and with a lot of evidence pointing in that direction that Roe v. Wade was very vulnerable, that there was a high likelihood that Dobbs would overturn it, but I was very skeptical. And I think conservatives have had reason to be skeptical. We've become accustomed to disappointment to conservatives not delivering. And that's certainly true in Congress and in other halls of power, but it's been true in the court too. I think back to Gorsuch just offering a huge blow to the meaning of sex in Bostock. John Roberts constantly playing to the media and public perception despite being on the quote unquote conservative wing of the court. And so it was a huge shock to read not only an opinion in favor of life, but a very bold opinion from Alito and then of course the concurrence from Thomas. And so I was very surprised, but it was a moment of celebration. And maybe we'll talk about this more later, but I also was just encouraged by the point in favor of incrementalism. I think conservatives, many of us have had the wrong idea about when we negotiate, we never really ask for what we want. We never really fight for what we want. We saw this with Second Amendment stuff and gun control, you know, just in the last couple of weeks, but in other matters too. It's like an all or nothing approach where we don't, we're not able to see conservative victories as such, you know, unless we have abortion abolition, it's not a victory. And so you have a little state measures are not good enough. And I think Roe being overturned was kind of a repudiation of that approach that we do need to chip away at these huge cultural issues because eventually the whole thing will come crumbling down. So it was certainly a moment of celebration. Madeline, you hate life. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Oh my gosh. Unfair. No, go ahead. I was going to say only cat lives. Wow. Madeline, you threw me off with that one. Tell me what your reaction was. And I wanted to ask you this question in particular as somebody who's really been covering this, this issue closely, you've done a lot of really great reporting on the industry of abortion and all of its grizzly sort of elements. But in over the last couple of years, it seems as though a lot of that reporting, there's been almost momentum that's exposing something that a lot of people weren't exposed to in new media because old media just completely blacked it out. So tell us what your reaction was and how you've you felt over the last few years covering all of this. Yeah, I echo what everyone said about being shocked and surprised. But I think my my surprise is more out of pure pessimism and sin and cynicism in just that how much the pro life movement had going against it. I just still can't believe that. I mean, and that's why it took half a century, but just for as much as they had going against it with the way Roe v. Wade has like become popular within the culture. Obviously the media propaganda we're fighting against. I mean, and even a lot of politicians and religious leaders that were nominally pro life were nominally supportive of the cause that now are still kind of sitting silent. I think that's a great example of just how how big of an obstacle the pro life movement was able to overcome. And it's still like shocking to me that they actually achieved it. Obviously, you know, Hollywood, they have every single institution in America working against them. And then my other reaction, I think, is just I'm overwhelmed because I feel like there is so many more obstacles facing us now. This decision, it just barely gets the pro life movement to the starting line. And now I think the real work that's ahead of the pro life movement is really difficult, even with with still all these same obstacles, obstacles facing them. You just think about like pro life legislators and how the media is going to be attacking them. I just think we have so much ahead of us. And again, that is still like a very pessimistic view. And obviously, this is something to celebrate, but I just think that we have to deal in reality with what's ahead of us. And so for me, I'm just still really overwhelmed. And I think, like you said, my coverage of how Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Federation, how big they are and how much power they have to control the narrative, I think that, you know, the reporting I've done on that has kind of shaped my pessimism for the situation. Jordan, like Madeline, you live in Texas and Texas is a state where this pretty much immediately, almost immediately went into effect and is also kind of a test lab for pro life legislation in the same way that this the ruling that was or the policy that was in question in Mississippi in the Dobbs case was sort of intentionally designed to bring this issue to the Supreme Court's attention. And in Texas as a state where there has been restrictions on abortion access, which I don't think of as necessarily the the left's way of talking about abortion, if you want to access the opportunity to end a life abortion access is maybe a bit euphemistic, but that's one way to describe it. So Jordan, where do you expect states and where do you think states should go in the months and in the years ahead? Well, first of all, I'm very grateful to live in a state that already had legislation set up and laws in place that automatically got rid of abortion. I mean, for a while now, abortion has been slowing down in Texas, thanks to legislators, thanks to sort of the administration here. So I've never been happier to be a resident of the Lone Star state. But yeah, there's a lot of different states that have this on their plate now. And some of them did look ahead. I wrote an article in the Federalist other day, I was talking about all these ballot measures and quite literally, you know, Roe v. Wade being overturned turned the issue back to the states, but some states are taking it further and putting it on the ballot for voters to determine in November. So there's some states that that's more of a pro-abortion push and the way the ballot measure is word is to enshrine this quote, right to abortion in the state's constitution. In other states, they're trying to amend constitutions and amend policy to ensure that this won't happen again in their state, that this is something that is a hard line that will stop. So I think it is important for safe, like Texas and Mississippi to stand firm on their ground and show, you know, this is the type of legislation that works. These are the loopholes we were able to close. I mean, I know that was one big thing about abortion policy in the past. The states have tried to pull back on abortion and failed because they left too many loopholes. So that will be one thing going forward that Republican legislatures need to keep in mind. And, you know, in states like purple states, especially where there's a lot more blue influence, they're going to try and go soft on these policies. They're going to try and say, oh, well, we're going to restrict abortion, but only to this certain point. And I think it's important for states like Texas and, you know, conservative voices, pro-life voices to say, no, you can take it further and you should take it further because you now have the ability to do that. So I'm interested to see how it plays out in certain states and how voters react in November as well. Something we talk about a lot in this podcast is how recent changes to the way humans live their everyday lives have caused all of these other downstream changes that are pretty major and that we don't actually think about that often. For instance, did you know that poor sleep can caused weight gain, mood issues, poor mental health, and lower productivity? Think about this, sleeping less than six to seven hours per night is actually linked to reduced white blood cell count. And those white blood cells protect our body against illnesses and diseases. They fight viruses, they fight bacteria, and so much more. I am one of those people that absolutely needs critical sleep. I need absolutely more sleep than most people probably do, but it's a huge difference. And we all know that because we all need it. Introducing Beam Dream.

Elle, I want to ask you, feel free to add any thoughts to that question that you have. I also want to ask, though, I've heard from just, you know, this is completely anecdotal and not meant to be representative, but I have heard from people who are close to your age that their friends' reactions on social media to what happened in Dobs has been kind of eye-opening and has really been difficult to deal with. Now, you went to a conservative school, so you may not have had that problem. Maybe you have. I'm curious to hear. But how do you think this is playing out for younger generations of Americans, for whom Roe was treated or they were conditioned to see Roe as a settled law? As a, I heard one person say, this was a constitutional right that was revoked for the first time. That's what one commentator said I heard yesterday. How is this playing out among younger Americans and younger women in particular that you've seen? Well, I keep seeing a trending article headline on Twitter. And every time I see it, it kind of makes me chuckle. And I think it's business inside here, but it says, Gen Z is reconsidering sex after Roe reversal. And I'm just like, good, that's good. We need to be taking this life-creating act more seriously and understanding that it does have consequences. And it's an important thing. And so every time I see that headline, I just kind of think it's funny because it doesn't have the intended effect I think on me. But I think a lot of people are asking a lot of questions. One of my friends who's also pro-life and conservative, she had one of her liberal friends texted her and was just like, hey, I am really interested to hear what you think about abortion. I trust you to be intellectually honest. And I just really want to have a conversation with someone who's pro-life and understand what you think about it and why. So I think there are a lot of people who maybe aren't sure what to think because they've grown up under the shadow of Roe. And even those people, not all of them, of course, but I do think a lot of people who have taken Roe for granted and maybe just assumed abortion was a status quo and assumed that was fine, are asking questions and are trying to come up with kind of a worldview of how to think about that. All right. So Kylie, this in my opinion is one of the biggest things to realize, just what Elle was touching on. One of the biggest things to realize about the post- Roe era, which is that it's landing at a time when Gen Z was actually already giving up premarital sex. But the, I guess, reigning theory is that it's because of this risk aversion, that first kind of crippled millennials and made them do less drugs, made them on average, less likely to try drugs, to try premarital sex. But that risk aversion had some real downsides, of course, because it means that they're less comfortable sort of pushing themselves and like parental supervision and kind of enjoy the helicopter parent that was derided for so long. And that's interesting. It's landing at a time where we just went through a pandemic, sort of the limits of our humanity were being tested. How long can you be forced to isolate kept away from worship, kept away from X, Y, and Z? And I really believe that the abortion, and you can look at studies, like when abortion was being legalized in states before Roe came out, abortion was very much changing the way people were having sex. Legalized abortion was very much changing the way people were having sex. I mentioned this a lot, but even Janet Yellen co-wrote a paper for Brookings Institute with her husband back in the 90s that found legalized abortion had actually increased single motherhood because people were more comfortable having sex outside of commitment. And to Elle's point about all of these big sort of cultural changes, I want to ask you, is this perhaps this timing, perhaps a great opportunity for the pro-life side and the right in general to start talking about abortion in a way that maybe resonates even more than it would have in earlier times? Yeah, I agree. I have a lot of kind of mixed feelings and mixed observations about how Gen Z kind of approaches sex. I think some of it has to do with risk aversion, but you make a really good point, and this was what I was going to bring up just about isolation and the way that Gen Z kind of lives their lives through screens and such. So I think their aversion to sex might have more to do with kind of a knee-jerk reaction to the way millennials live, and that paired with their draw toward androgyny and other weird things that Gen Z has going on that are less about risk aversion and more just about their other social tendencies. But yeah, I think this is a really good time to talk about the consequential nature of sex, and I'll touch on this, but I think it really bears repeating that Gen Z and Americans at large need to understand just the sacredness of the act of sex and what that actually entails, because abortion just took all of that off the table. And I think we have a real opportunity to educate people, not just on the fact that abortion is the taking of a human life, not just on the emotional toll and the physical and spiritual toll that that takes on a woman and on a family, and on men too, but on just what sex is and what it means and the fact that it is literally a life and death act. And I think that's something that Gen Z might be a lot more open to as kind of the coming of age kids in a post-row world. Right, so I'll think, I actually will just say something myself quickly, which is that I was on another podcast just a couple hours earlier talking about how I think a lot of it's hard to even call it the left anymore, but a lot of what this sort of secular post-modern moral order wants to do is help us overcome our own humanity for the sake of comfort. And that means we do have a lot of technologies, like let's say refrigerators, or mass production of food that have brought immeasurable people out of poverty and have made lives immeasurably better, but that doesn't mean there's not always a balance to be struck. And the technologies that have evolved over the course of the 20th century, for instance, this happened really quickly. Abortion went from those treacherous and tragic back alleys into antiseptic and tragic medical offices, and it became an industry. And there are ways to kill children now that involve something so easy. And it's not physically easy for every woman, let's say, who uses pills through the mail, and the media won't tell their stories, but it's certainly not easy for those women, but it has the appearance of being easy. It has the appearance of being simple. And sex, to Kylie's point, the idea that the choice is on the woman to continue a pregnancy and not the choice on the couple to have sexual intercourse, that you should be able to overcome your humanity as a woman and engage in sex like a man does, which is to say you shouldn't have to carry the creation of that sex in your body, because it will interfere with your career or your artistic potential or something. Something like Stevie Nicks set at one point that without getting an abortion, there would be no Fleetwood Mac. And you can't do anything. I mean, I don't want to laugh at it because it's so evil. It's such a horrific thing to say, but it's like, oh my gosh, you're right. It's all worth it so that we can have Fleetwood Mac and the mentality of somebody to say something like that is sort of stunning, but it has been the norm. And in that case, abortion functions as a way for women to overcome their humanity, to overcome what their bodies are meant to do, which is reproduce. And the healthy way to do that is within the bounds of commitment. And rather than calling on anyone, I don't know if we have Madeleine here, if anyone else wants to jump in, I'm just going to toss that open to the group and see if anybody else has thoughts. Oh, can I jump in? Please do. I have seen so many. I've seen the phrase forced pregnancy thrown around in so many places this week. And I just, it's such an offense against grammar, because no, I mean, if a woman can sense to consensual sex with a man and that results in a pregnancy, the choice like you touched on this already Emily, but that the choice that we're talking about here is the choice to have intercourse. There's no force like no one is coming in and forcing her at once she's made that decision to become pregnant or to deal with the natural consequences of her actions. So I just I just want to make a point against that phrase, because I've seen it so many places and it's so intellectually dishonest. No, I'm so glad that you did Elle. And Madeleine, I saw you unmuted yourself quickly. Did you want to jump in? I was just going to say to your point about how we've made abortion so easy and how erasing our women's humanity is kind of like the way they this has been playing Parenthood's MO for a long time. I think we may have talked about this before, but a great example is their clinic that they opened in DC. A few years ago, it's by far one of their nicest abortion clinics in the country. And there's a reason that it's a few miles from the Capitol because that's you know the one they show off to lobbyists, but it feels like an Apple store, right? They make it just so you don't have to don't think about the violence that's happening in the womb. Don't think about the the violence that's happening to you and the emotional toll that this is going to take on you. Just you know sign the papers and swap all of the pill. And I think the larger point is that it just speaks to contemporary progressivism and how kind of sterile it is and unhappy and fearful it is. Like they're so fearful of a few of the future and we hear so much about like why you shouldn't have children and obviously you know if they want to argue that they should stop reproducing then like that's going to be a win for conservatives. But I think overall it's just very sad and scary just like the end result of the progressive mindset. I think the reason I ended up in journalism is that I'm just so skeptical of absolutely everything. It's like a reflex. And so when the good folks over at my pillow offer to send some towels my way, I was immediately skeptical. I thought there's so much hype here. Can they live up to it? Nothing beats the feel of a luxurious towel when you step out of the shower and I'm telling you this is not scripted right here. These really work. They're very very absorbent.

Well and you bring up the dehumanizing point Madeline and and Elle as well and it's just interesting that like people have gotten so comfortable with abortion and so comfortable with row and the entire topic has become so sanitized that we're not talking about hypothetical kids. We're not talking about even people in utero like human beings in the room. We're talking about actual like fully like grown children out in the world like I saw one mother holding a sign out at an abortion protest and it said nobody should be forced to do this and she wasn't pregnant she was standing there with several of her kids like nobody should be forced to motherhood she's talking about children that she's already given birth to these are living human beings that she's just like completely dehumanizing there was the the viral tick-tock of the mother talking to her baby saying you know I could have killed you but I didn't I mean it's dehumanizing all around not just for women not just for babies in the womb but for the children of moms who are talking about the fact that they could have aborted them but didn't. Jordan did you have anything to add? Yeah I would just say just pleasing to sort of this bigger issue which Kylie touched on and that's just anti-motherhood and anti-parenthood. We live in an increasingly anti-family society and that is very much evidenced in this abortion debate and we see that play out I mean there's people out there who have pledged not to have more children because of the climate or have said you know I don't want to bring kids into this world or whatever and I think that is very closely related to this conversation and a lot of it comes back to people want control and this is something that they feel like is out of their control especially now but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing and I think that's sort of the the point of the pro-life movement and children are a blessing children can be a wonderful thing and that doesn't mean it won't be hard that doesn't mean that it will be interesting at times or difficult but that's where the pro-life community those worked so hard over these last 50 years steps in and they've already been stepping in I mean one of the things that I've seen reposted on these flowery Instagram graphics by young women is oh you know well if you're not planning out and going to adopt some of these children like you need to just shut up and sit down about this job's decision well guess who's been stepping up to this adoption plate it's been pro-lifers it's been largely Christian conservatives so this is something that they've been doing for years now and the time to shine is still now but that doesn't necessarily mean that they should buy into these bad faith arguments of well you don't have a place at the table because you don't fill in these blanks spoken like somebody I was just gonna I was gonna say spoken like somebody who's never met Madeline's child but Elle please jump in I just wanted to make one more point on the the dehumanizing note I think it's really interesting that even just a few years ago we heard a lot of arguments about whether or not or at what point an unborn baby in the womb was in fact a living human being and we really haven't seen those arguments going back and forth this this year and it's specifically in the context of the Dobbs case and the Dobbs leak and we've even seen people as significant as President Biden slip up and and use the phrase abort a baby in talking about the taking of a baby's life through abortion and so I think the the pro-life movement has kind of won that argument won that point everyone knows now that abortion does take the life of a baby but what we still see is a push from from the left that that's still justifiable and I think that stems from our culture's really glorification of self-gratification and the individualism that that pours into that to the point where where the women like I think Kylie was was mentioning are willing to say that they would sacrifice the life of a baby that they're not contesting whether that baby is alive or not they'll agree it's alive but they're still willing to sacrifice that baby's life for their own personal satisfaction and and gratification and I want to tell you I was gonna say yeah here I'll just toss this as an open question to anyone who wants to answer it because that's a really good point about the earlier question we were discussing in terms of whether this is a different time for us to reopen the conversation and it's not as though anybody I don't mean it to sound or to minimize the work that other people have been have been doing this is not to say nobody was talking about abortion or that you know we wouldn't have wanted row to fall in any other point in history this is to say however that is there an opportunity right now that exists because of the way we live life and because of the way the left has has evolved on this question of abortion right like they're going to trot out sob stories that are legitimately tragic and sob-inducing and horrific in every sense of the word and it now the burden is of course as it always has been on the pro-life movement to explain why the life that is that is in the womb of a woman in a tragic situation is worth preserving and protecting and and that is an interesting or it is more I think it's an interesting challenge to make that argument now as you say Al that we are increasingly aware thanks to different technologies ultrasound and everything else that that really have given us a glimpse into what that life looks like and Jordan go ahead yeah I was just gonna say on on Elle's point with the women thing this is not just coming from women who are saying oh I want access to abortion or oh I want this this is a as a whole a large push by the corporate media by companies by pretty much every institution which we've seen into the culture war in recent years and so I was just gonna make the point that there's a lot of woke human resource departments out there who are financing this issue and they're saying we're going to not only affirm you as an employee who says she wants to remain childless or an employee who says she doesn't want this pregnancy but we're going to pay for you to end it we're going to pay for the end of your child's life and that is that I think falls directly in line with the dehumanization thing it's it's very dystopian it's very odd and unnerving to know that a company prioritizes what they think will be more productive a childless woman over mothers and and people who are invested in bringing up the next generation yeah that's a great point Jordan um could you actually talk elaborate because you just filed an article um that I saw come and hit the hit the inbox um not long ago about what companies are doing um and and this is I think a very fertile ground for discussion tell us what you what you reported on basically yeah so a lot of these large companies with with big names you know Wall Street Fortune 500 firms a lot of the same people that you saw donating to Ukraine and posting Black Lives Matter things on their page or donating Black Lives Matter these same companies came out after the dog's decision and said we're going to do whatever it takes to help our female employees and in some cases they went with the more leftist pregnant people um in our company get abortions and for a lot of those companies uh they offered to pay for travel across state lines uh for employees who live in states like Texas where you you can't walk up to a plan parenthood they're all closed uh for abortions um and even Google said you know what you want to relocate we'll pay for it no questions asked and uh this is sort of a trending thing that we've seen in woe human resource departments where they take this political issue and they crafted into something that is uh is delectable it's something that's a lorry and they they put it on the table and they say this is this is it this is our stance and um take it or leave it and it's sort of crafting this interesting uh circumstances in the workforce where people are looking to companies to answer for all of their needs including political ones including health ones and um that's alarming and like i mentioned earlier it's really to benefit the companies it's not to benefit you i mean i doubt most of these companies care about your personal health life what they care about is that you're sitting at a desk working for eight plus hours a day and for them to come out and say this it's it's just virtue signaling it's alarming it's i find it quite offensive as a woman if i worked at one of these companies and this email came across my desk that said oh by the way we're gonna start paying for you to go across state lines and abort your child i mean that that's ridiculous well and it also brushes this issue of uh dating apps being very pro abortion and coming out with very pro or let's say anti-dobs stances taking these opportunities to virtue signal as best they can because women have been commoditized by the abortion industry and that's why companies are jumping in the same way um and actually i think funnily enough Madeline had to drop off to take care of her young daughter uh who is who's adorable and not uh not problematic in any way as i earlier implied uh for the sake of humor but um do you guys have thoughts l and kylee on what jordan just said uh maybe one of you actually edited her piece i don't know uh but this is a really i think a very critical point and it's a critical point in efforts to talk to younger women about what ro has brought about the reality that ro has brought yeah it's really interesting because the the pro abortion camp likes to frame itself as kind of the savior of women uh you know they paint the pro life cause as the handmaid's tail you know we are forcing women to carry their babies term forcing them to you know kind of work for the man and it's just so funny that they can't see the irony um and what they're doing specifically with this corporate example that jordan mentioned where it's like they are they are paying women to continue working for the man because it's more profitable for them to have um to not have to pay for a woman's maternity leave to not have to pay for a woman the flexibility that it requires to be a working mom like the type of flexibility that employers like the federalist offer where women can have all the choice in the world to get married to start families to you know i mean joy our executive editor has six children and she has all the flexibility that she needs to be a working mom and i mean that's got to be the opposite of handmaid's tail so it's just funny to see these employers um work women and do whatever they can to make them as productive and profitable as they possibly can they're not even trying to hide it i mean it's just like advertising advertising trying to profit off of women at whatever cost yes and yeah go ahead oh i was just going to add um i i think it's kind of leftovers of third wave feminism and this is a point you make often and well emily um but the idea that that for women to be fully and holy women we have to be just like men we have to you know work non-stop without um the flexibility or the maternity leave or whatever it is that enables us to have families and have children um and that's that's only one of the ways that uh the left's agenda really hurts women there's that there's there's just the fact that they're throwing out these ridiculous terms like pregnant people or birthing persons or people who menstruate which all of those are just demeaning and objectifying uh it's the same side that that wants to put men in women's spaces whether it's on girls sports teams or in women's prisons or um shelters and so i think it's all reflective of as others have said commodifying women and reducing women and really trying to fit women into a mold to be just like men that that isn't empowering at all yes trying to fit women into that mold and with the insistence that women must in order to be equal you are not equal we've heard this line and this implication again and again over the last several decades and in recent years you are not equal unless you have the right enshrined in the constitution understood by all of society and culture you are not equal to a man unless you have the right to abortion um that is absolutely the argument that they have been making for years and in practice it's absolutely true as jordan was saying that abortion allows women to compete with men in the workforce in a way that they aren't able to we see if you look at the real wage gap which comes out to like six or seven cents um the you can explain some of that by pregnancies by women taking maternity leaves to breastfeed and and nurture their babies but even just the time out of the office that labor um can create or cause these are things that make women less profitable than the men it sets them back as they climb the corporate ladder amazing women like joy are able to literally have it all have it a wonderful career and i'm sure without children joy would say she could have done x number of different things and have been more you know quote-unquote successful but she wouldn't trade any of that for the world and this is i'll ask everyone for final thoughts on this note that's why my first piece that i wrote post post-dobs was that this is liberating for women because it's an opportunity to rediscover how much healthier and happier you are if you have sex in the way your bodies are supposed to have sex if you procreate in the way that you're supposed to um if you couple off in the way that you're supposed to the the party of science um is actually the party of overcoming biology is they deny biology in order to overcome it and it's set so many women down a a very treacherous path over the last half century and that's not to say we didn't need um to to have certain abilities and rights that came from um the the last half century and changes and you know everything from the 19th amendment until right now and even further back than that absolutely no question about it but uh there has to be balanced and and women do not need to be Cheryl Sandberg in order to have a happy life in fact it's pursuing some of the things that women like Cheryl Sandberg do a lot of people over the course of this 50-year experiment have regretted it if you look back the regrets are not that they weren't named CEO you know 10 years earlier and made 10 million more dollars plus the regrets are having fewer children than they wanted never getting married um and you can go on down the line so with that i'll turn it over to each of you who wants to start with some final thoughts wrapping us up here i can go uh i agree with everything you said emily they're especially on the Cheryl Sandberg point and the regrets that women have um i'll just add because i wouldn't be on the federalist radio r if i didn't bring up theology at least once but i will just add that there's a huge theological component to this um and that is that women are are uniquely created um for a vocational purpose for a biological purpose a relational purpose that is so much bigger than career um and it's not misogynistic to say that it's not sexist it's not oppressive it is fact and the sooner that we embrace it and um for lack of a better word submit to it but but the sooner we embrace it the happier and the more fulfilled we will be the more content um and productive and flourishing lives we can lead uh and i mean that is just a fact that is inherent in our biology um in our psyche in our souls uh and it's important it's an important thing that we can't neglect um when we get caught up in all the legales of row uh so i i think that's just a really important thing to to note who's next i can go um yeah i think the bottom line which kylie touched on this perfectly is that men and women are different and for so long ironically men have dictated this i mean row was decided by men which you know a lot of the pro abortion propaganda is oh no uterus no opinion um but for so long we've been told we have to operate a certain way and and that's just so inherently untrue and and so wrong and so antithetical to the way that women operate the way women feel the way women act and i think this dog's decision really does open it up for for everyone to flourish for women especially to flourish and for us to get back on the right track as a culture and as a whole and i hope that's what happens i pray that's what happens and you know we'll see how it plays out but this is an opportunity and we would we would be in a bad place if we passed up on it um Emily i want to tie in to what you said about rejecting our biology because we were talking earlier about gen Z and as a member of gen Z myself i think our generation is so just craving to find identity and reaching to find identity anywhere and everywhere and often turning to some really detrimental things for that but at the same time that gen Z is so desperate to latch on to something for identity we're rejecting the things that make us who we are and our womanhood for for those of us on the call for women is such a intrinsic part of what does make us who we are and so i think like Jordan said this is a great opportunity to really rediscover and help other people rediscover um why womanhood is a great thing and why it's an important part of who we are and not something that we can consturb away and i think Madeline is uh actually attesting to that right now she she she could be here to share her final thoughts and words but uh she she's doing it in action uh ladies thank you so much Jordan Boyd, L Reynolds and kylie Griswold not Kylie Zepel but it is still the same person as we confirmed earlier we appreciate all your time today thanks thank you L Y"
