    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Today we're going to be talking about gender stereotypes because there's some craziness happening in the UK. You know, lately we've been getting a lot of our content from them and it's a good thing they can't charge us royalties. As CNN reported this past Friday, quote, depictions of girls as less academic than boys, men being belittled for unmanly behavior and an array of other cliched portrayals have been consigned to history in British commercials as new rules come into effect banning gender stereotypes in advertising. The changes announced in December and enforced from Friday onward ban companies from using depictions of gender, quote, that are likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offense. The article continues that advertisers will have to tread carefully in scenarios the watchdog sites is problematic. These include commercials that show a man with his feet up while a woman cleans, a man or woman failing at a task because of their gender, suggestions that a person's physique has held them back for romantic or social success, or a man being belittled for performing stereotypically female tasks. Examples of potentially problematic material given by the advertising standards authority or ASA include a man failing to charge a nappy or a woman struggling to park a car, a commercial suggesting that mom should prioritize cleanliness or looking attractive over their emotional well being. Okay, time out here. I have never in my life seen a commercial tell a mom to prioritize cleanliness or her looks over her emotional well being. Like, I don't even know what that would look like. I don't even know how a commercial, which is usually like what a minute long would go about conveying that message like, Oh, depression mom, who cares about that? You got to get yourself some lipstick. Like what hypothetical ad are they referring to? But the UK also won't be allowed to have quote ads that play on stereotypical ideas of gender such as men being more daring or women being more caring. Now I know a lot of people watching this or hearing about this news might be wondering to themselves, whoa, hang on a second, doesn't that violate free speech telling advertisers what stereotypes they can or cannot have in their commercials? Well, there's no need to worry about that because the British government doesn't recognize the right to free speech. So just not a problem. Seriously though, the British government doesn't have a constitution like America does or a charter of rights and freedoms like Canada does. And as we can see by many of their practices in the past few years, the British government unfortunately just really does not give a crap about its citizens right to free expression. So if you're hearing about this news and you're worried about how it might affect free speech in the UK, I'm sorry to tell you but that ship has long since sailed. I'm going to be ripping on the UK or at least its governments a lot in this video and I'm pretty sure I actually did the same thing in our last one as well. But I just want to say I don't hate the UK. In fact, I love it. I don't know how many of you guys know this but when I was in high school, my family actually lived in Surrey for a bit and growing up in Hong Kong, we were legit a British colony and even after the handover back to China, I was still going to a British school surrounded by British peers and teachers. I just have a huge amount of respect and admiration for British culture, heritage and history. London stabbings aside, the UK will always be one of my favorite places to visit. I'm just heartbroken and worried that so many of its citizens are losing their fundamental rights. In regard to this advertising ban, the advertising standards authority or ASA is technically an NGO and not part of the British government but if the British government actually cared about enforcing its citizens right to say and see whatever they wanted, they would do something about this but spoiler alert, they're not going to. The idea that you shouldn't be able to say something if it offends people, that's the norm, okay? The status quo among British bureaucrats and the ruling class, it's scary but that's how things are now. I mean personally, I actually know of a lot of Brits who are offended by this blatant disregard for freedom of speech but you know, I have an inkling that their feelings aren't the ones that the bureaucrats are concerned about. Yeah, so I don't know, maybe all of the base people of the world we need to get together and try starting our own new country somewhere. Maybe we can try taking New Zealand, I feel like there aren't that many people there. Note to all of the people who hate watch me and pretend to take everything I say seriously in order to discredit me, that was a joke, okay? Joking. Let's move on to the implications of all this though because even if you're someone who passionately hates gender stereotypes and does not give a crap about freedom of speech, this ban will still come with problems. For one thing based on the examples that were given or the fact that according to CNN each ad will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, it seems like this ban is going to be inherently arbitrary. To varying degrees, gender stereotypes do change from culture to culture and time period to time period. So for a bunch of people who I'm guessing consider themselves fans of intersectionality, it just seems really strange to me that they wouldn't consider that. The CNN article mentions that under this new ban, depictions of girls being less academic than boys will not be allowed, but nowadays it's girls who are overwhelmingly succeeding more than boys. So if there's an ad that features two kids, a boy, and a girl, and one kid needs to be doing better at school than the other because maybe we're advertising tutoring services, whatever. I think it could be argued that portraying a boy struggling in school is a gender stereotype, but also maybe portraying a girl struggling in school is a gender stereotype. So what do we do? Is the future of British ads just gender-segregated commercials so we don't have to worry about this kind of thing? Because actually, according to CNN, quote, commercials featuring just men or just women will not be affected by this ban. I guess you can be a sexist as you want if you only have women in your ad. To me, this kind of seems like this isn't about policing sexism so much as it is monitoring gender dynamics. And it's also strange to me that they would take such a hard line on stereotypes when, let's face it, a lot of humor does revolve around stereotypes. The nagging mom and goofy but well-meaning dad are classic stereotypes that form the backbone of a lot of comedy. So are shows like The Simpsons just going to be banned from advertising in the UK now? And what about the Big Bang Theory with its take on male nerds and their trouble with the ladies? That's not a very flattering gender stereotype. But considering what happened to Count Dankula, I'm thinking the argument of, but what about comedy probably won't do any good here. I mean, part of me does kind of understand it. I think they're at least trying to do this to fight sexism and it's not like I'm a fan of sexism, but I just have to wonder what is so inherently sexist about gender stereotypes. Because a lot of stereotypes, whether they're about genders or cultures, aren't necessarily untrue. Even if they don't apply to every single person in the group they're about, a lot of the times stereotypes exist for a reason. A gender stereotype that is absolutely real is that men, on average, tend to be more interested in going to hardware stores than women, on average. If there's a commercial for a hardware store and it features like a funny back and forth between a husband and a wife and he wants to go into the store and she doesn't, is that really such a bad thing? Is it sexist to portray a situation in media that is representative of what the majority of people experience? I don't think it is. Because you see stereotypes can either be prescriptive or descriptive and I don't think there should be anything wrong with showing descriptive stereotypes. An example of a prescriptive stereotype would be telling a woman you have to be a nurse, not a doctor. An example of a descriptive stereotype would be telling a woman most women become nurses, not doctors. In one case, you're limiting someone's personal freedom and in the other you're simply describing what the majority of people choose and the individual is free to conform or not. Prescriptive gender stereotypes that tell people what they should or should not do or are or are not able to do based on their gender, those are sexist and they actually used to be a huge thing in the advertising industry. Old advertisements from like the 40s and 50s used to be just actually, you know what, let's, yeah, let's look at some of these old ads. That'll be fun. Here's the sad for what looks like a ketchup bottle with the caption, you mean a woman can open it? Women are the weaker sex but saying we're so weak we have trouble opening ketchup bottles, that's that's kind of iffy. And showing us that the past was truly a trip, here we have an ad for ties with the caption, show her it's a man's world. Yeah, I'm not too crazy about this one. And here's the sad for coffee, which just comes right out and says that if your husband ever finds out you're not buying good coffee, he'll beat you. And then finally here's this ad from Hardee's which literally just says women, don't leave the kitchen and that we all know a woman's place is in the home cooking a man a delicious meal. I do agree that those types of gender stereotypes, not cool, but A, companies aren't putting that kind of crap in ads anymore and B, even if they were, it still wouldn't be the right move to ban them because freedom of speech. In the past, not conforming to gender roles used to be seen as a really bad thing. But I almost feel as if nowadays actually conforming to traditional gender roles is what's seen as taboo. Manly men are being shamed for having toxic masculinity and feminine women are being shamed for having internalized misogyny. And now in the UK, you can't even portray these gender stereotypes in commercials. What made those vintage ads so gross wasn't necessarily that they just portrayed gender stereotypes. It's that they tried to limit personal freedom. Women don't leave the kitchen show her on her knees. It's a man's world. Showing a woman cooking or serving her husband breakfast in bed wouldn't have been bad. In my opinion, instead what gets me is the oppressive overtones of the ads. And with this new ban, maybe they're trying to fight sexism. But the thing is they're doing it in a way that is just as oppressive. They're literally saying you can't show women doing this and you can't show men doing that. How is that any less sexist than the ads in the 40s and the 50s? It's not. In any case, though, those are just some of my thoughts about the new UK ad ban. And as always, I would love to know what you guys think. Do you support the ban? Why or why not? And how do you feel about the presence of gender stereotypes in media as a whole? Let me know. But that's it for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time."
