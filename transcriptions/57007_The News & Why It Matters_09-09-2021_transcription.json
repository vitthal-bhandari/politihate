    "text": " Today, Larry Elder attacked by a racist liberal. The National Archives posts a harmful content warning on the Constitution and more. And President Biden tells 11x Trump officials to resign from their military advisory boards. They say, hell no, we're not going anywhere. We've got a lot coming up today and it all starts right now. Welcome to the News and Why It Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by, I know it is Thursday. I'm going to mess with your mind just a little bit because Pat is out today. So I am joined by Blasey B. Contributary Yaku Buoyan, host of the Yaku Buoyan show and also Stuber Gear. So we have half of Pat and Stowe, Stuber Gear, host of Stutas. The lesser half. But I'm here anyway. Well, I mean, I wasn't going to say it. No, I'm sorry. I'm not the one with the cookie company. So that's fair. Not nearly as exciting. Not just the cookie company, but like the best cookies you'll ever eat. I still haven't had these cookies. Oh my gosh, I have some in the other room. That's a bringer. Do you really? Yeah. Actually, I have some of the new flavors here. I hear about all these cookies. There you go. I know that's the beginning of the show. There you go. Yeah, there you go. There you go. And and that will be my calories for the rest of the month. Yes. Oh, by the way, also, I don't know how we're going to get through the show without just mentioning football is starting back. And we were discussing the NFL. And I said, I was boycotting the NFL, but I did find out that they are doing a merch collaboration with Ed Sheeran. So now I buy all the things. We're right. I didn't know you were an Ed Sheeran fan, but we should we should arrange some. Oh my gosh, I got to tell you about my tattoo later. Anyway, any who back to the news and my matters, California Republican gubernatorial candidate, Larry Elder had eggs thrown at him yesterday while walking the streets of Los Angeles with members of his campaign. And it gets gets way worse than that because it was a white person wearing a gorilla mask. Let's play that. So here is for those of you who are listening on podcast, Larry Elder walking with his, I guess his his campaign, his security. And here she comes on a bike throwing eggs. It is a gorilla mask with pink hair. And now she's throwing very womanly punches at the security detail. So this is great. This is a really great look for liberals wearing a gorilla mask while throwing eggs at Larry Elder, who again, for those of you, maybe you're someone who is listening on podcast and don't know who Larry Elder is. He is a black man who is running for governor in California as a Republican. So just just trying to give the right context for the viewers to understand how bad this is because how bad would it be if the tables were turned? And let's say that this was Stacey Abrams over here walking the streets and someone did this. I think every Republican for the end of time would have to answer for this random person who did this and answer the question why are Republicans such racists? How could you do this? This is so violent. This is, you know, somehow they'd tie it to the insurrection, I'm sure. And here we are and crickets from the left when it comes to a liberal dressing up in a gorilla mask throwing eggs. I mean, this is a salt at this level throwing eggs at Larry Elder. Gentlemen. Yeah. So first of all, he was attacked by a monkey. Right? A freak show. Well, yeah, I mean, a freak show. Yes. Freak show. Complete freak show. I hold on. I have a question. Is the mask connected to the hair or is the hair connected to the woman? I don't know. It doesn't matter. It's all a freak show. They're all they all want to be they all want to be joking. I feel like it's a good question. I think it does matter. The news of my matter has been heard. No, at this point, the hair is connected to the mask. I'm just going to throw it out there. Okay. It looks like it, right? Right. You know, I. It does look like it. Well, which I'm just curious, like number one, where do you get a gorilla mask with the pink hair that just seems very long? In California. Yeah. In California. That was actually that is a great answer. That shut me up. And she missed. She can't throw number one. Right. So she missed for those you can't see. But yeah, it's case in point. This is that that picture. That's the left, right? Yeah. Masking themselves coming as a monkey. The racist act, it would have to be depicted as that. All of a sudden, if it was reversed, it would have been, oh, you racist. And then throwing punches. But this is where we are, Stu. The hypocrisy and the sort that only cuts one way and not the other way. And they can flip skin color like it's a toggle on a digital dial. All of a sudden, if it's them against elder who's black as black as they come. Doesn't matter now. I mean, they've accused him before of being a black white supremacist. That's what I was going to ask is that that's it. That is all in the black white supremacist. And so the rules are out the window, but it's cowards. They're cowards, just like their president, their president, not my president, their president who runs away from top. Hashtag not my president. Not my president. That's my hashtag. I'm not talking about South Africa's president, this president, right? Hashtag not my president who runs away from tough questions. They hide behind masks. If it was a conservative, there would be no mask and they would hit. They wouldn't miss, right? But we don't do those things. We don't. We're civil. We're civil. Right? And we're intellectual, right? Well, really, we could spend the entire show, I think, talking about the democracy of this, the coverage of it. And that like, I don't know of any mainstream source that did anything on this. I mean, I don't think it was a story at all. A gubernatorial candidate in California getting assaulted by someone is kind of a black deal. Black. I mean, but let's take race out of it for a second, even if it was a white white person. If it was a Democrat. Yeah. I mean, let's go to, let's just play this out for a second. Texas, a black Democrat, is walking through a town where a bunch of white people surround them in guerrilla masks and hit them in the head, or you're right, Yaka, we would have hit, we would have hit the candidate in the head. But don't poorly throw eggs at the candidate. That would be not a passing kicker of a story. It would be the lead story in the nation for a week. The Justice Department would be talking about how they're doing all of the, you know, Oh, white extremism, white rights supremacy. Professional investigations. Yes. Yes. There would be testimony on top of it. And mind you, she picked a black face. Yeah. Oh, yeah. A white person in black face against the, this is so, I mean, yeah, it would, it would be a risk. It would be a risk. And so it's, it's, it's important to note that hypocrisy. I, because I think we have this tendency of doing, you know, of like wanting to say, well, I mean, you know, I want to do the, you know, well, if it happened with Obama, or if it happened with, you know, Biden, or it happened with Trump, it's too much to mention here. It would be a massive, massive story. Remember, it was a massive story when people were, were like, uh, making stat, making like, uh, uh, it was like a scarecrow in the shape of Barack Obama when he was president. And that was a big story. And nothing, he wasn't even there. He wasn't even in the state. Can you imagine if Barack Obama, while campaigning in Texas, got hit in the head by, by a white person in a gorilla mask? I, I, can you know, out of, out of, no, um, we should also point out too, though, this race is like, there is a chance for California to have a respite from the torture they have had for such a law. I refuse to believe it. I do too. I, I, I can't get my hopes up like that. I do too. I do too. Now the polls show in a Newsome holding on from usually between 53 and 58 percent. Anything, 49.9 and you lose this. And Larry Elder wins. I mean, you look at the secondary candidates. Larry Elder has a massive lead. So it's really a, a two person race. That's what Gavin Newsome is trying to highlight, basically. Like, okay, well, it's, you might not like me. I might not be the perfect Democrat. Sure. I want it to a fancy dinner. But do you really want this guy, this Rush Limbaugh guy, this scary conservative guy, the guy that doesn't like women and all these things he's accusing Elder of. Uh, but it's really remarkable in a state like California that we could be here. I mean, Larry Elder in a couple of weeks, uh, you know, it's next Tuesday, right? The actual election is Tuesday. It's all. Um, could be the governor of, of California. I mean, that is a remarkable thing. Um, we went over a story last night quickly just to, I don't mean to take us off topic too much. But about Gavin Newsome, the story that I don't think anybody really knows. Evan Cena reported anywhere. That he, when he came into office, he had an infectious disease specialist as a director of public health in the state. And she went up leaving the, the, the under the, the, uh, assistant secretary was also an infectious disease specialist and took the job for about four months in the summer of 2019, leading right up to the beginning of COVID. Uh, Newsome demoted her and put her back into her assistant role and hired a woman who had no knowledge of the inner workings of the state whatsoever, Sony Angel, uh, and was hired because she was Latina because the assistant who was an infectious disease expert was white. The court was, she was too, too blonde to take the job. Yeah. Uh, they, they, they pushed her, they eventually pushed her out. But in the process of doing this, they, uh, they banned, uh, the doctor who was, who was the assistant from saying the word pandemic in the offices. Shh. They, they made her erase her whiteboard graphs of, of how the disease would spread. This is what board? Her white, I know whiteboard. She was white and that was the problem. Wow. And then when it was so obvious, this, the, the woman, uh, that he, Gavin Newsome appointed to this role, couldn't handle the role. Yeah. They actually tried to hide it and said that they would get, they would let this other, uh, actual infectious disease specialist run the response as long as she didn't say she was doing it, as long as they said the Latina was still doing it because we don't want to remove the Latina from office. And Gavin Newsome even said in, in one of the express conferences that this woman was only put there because she had an expertise in health equity and, um, structural racism. I mean, now California had, of course, a very rough battle with COVID and, uh, so, and I'm not even saying that we would sit here as conservatives and look at what the, you know, what they wanted to do in California and be like, Oh, that's the best idea. We might have hated all of her ideas, but the bottom line is that at least she was qualified to do the job. Instead, he chose wokeness over competence in a role that wound up being incredibly important and he's faced no consequences for it. Wow. So it's doing, if, if that's not enough, I want to do my part in helping Larry Elder. I'm going to be the one at the table. I'm going to draw a line in the center. Go we're going to flip California. Really? Yes. Yes. Yes. I love it. I love it. And this is why I'm telling him, Newsom's got to go. And I'm going to do my part. I'm going to remind all the California moms that Gavin Newsom is the first governor in our country to bring in comprehensive sex ed to teach your 10 year olds about anal sex, to teach your five year olds about masturbation, to take your three year olds and say they can get puberty blockers. That's Gavin Newsom. He's the agent of death to all things child in California. So if you want your children to fall off the proverbial cliff, if the earthquake don't split you off and you float into the ocean, if you want to fall off the cliff, then you keep Gavin Newsom. Larry Elder is not the best, but he's a lot better. And at least he will fight for children because there's some conservative and Judeo-Christian values around there. So just remember Newsom anti-children. Elder is at least going to be pro-family and pro-children. I have hope. Wow. Well, that's what I like. Yeah, I appreciate it. I do appreciate it. Okay. Well, while we're on the subject really quickly of this race, CNN is, see, I don't you love it when the left just eats themselves? I personally, I bet they've radicalized all of these people, all of their viewers. And then when it turns back, it turns around and bites them in in the ass. I do love it. I love it. It is fun. It's satisfying. Yeah. Thank you. So CNN viewers very upset at CNN because they interviewed Caitlyn Jenner, who obviously is also a California recall candidate. There's Caitlyn right there. Can I? Okay. So by the way, they were upset because Caitlyn Jenner only has like 1% support. So is Charlotte climber, who is like, can we agree one of the biggest lefties ever? Yeah. Up there. Is that hard? I just don't. I'm not familiar with it. Okay. Okay. Well, Charlotte does have the flag, the rainbow flag. Yeah, I mean, okay. And beautiful feminine picture there. But if any other candidate was pulling at 1%, they wouldn't be getting airtime. There is absolutely no reason why Caitlyn Jenner should be on any news network because, you know, this is not LGBT love, tolerance, respect, all of that. It's, you know, Caitlyn Jenner is a Republican, which is a big problem. Therefore Caitlyn Jenner, much like Larry Elder is a black white supremacist. Yeah. Caitlyn Jenner is all of the fill in the blanks. I think Charlotte had a crush on Caitlyn and couldn't get a date number one. That's the first point. And then Charlotte, can I remind you that there's another person who got a lot of airtime, who got 2% support, who is now the vice president of the United States. Just saying. That's a very good point. I seem to remember plenty of Republicans in that primary at 1% on CNN all the time. I mean, people like John Kasich, who were critical of Trump, got on all the time. Oh, they were constantly on television. I think he even got a contributor role with CNN. I think he did. You know, that's a look. Caitlyn Jenner is on TV because Caitlyn Jenner is famous for other reasons. It's nothing to do with the writing for the gubernatorial race in California. It's because, you know, he's on the Kardashians for a long time. I don't know if people know that. That's not like a gold medalist. Exactly. Yeah. No, actually that was Bruce Jenner. Let's not dead name. Dare dead name. I'm just not dead name. I'm telling you, give the medal back. Actually, so I saw Caitlyn Jenner at, I'm trying to be careful here with the, but people get mad any pronoun you use. You have someone like getting out of you for not using the right pronoun. So I saw Caitlyn Jenner at, I saw Caitlyn Jenner at CPAC and boy. Stomping around. I was not like the lady like. There's no grace. No. Stomping around in flip flops. You're only supposed to say Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful. It's the only thing you're supposed to say until, well, I can tell that body. Caitlyn Jenner is a Republican. Now you can say she's trash. See? So that's, well, we'll see that body that's structured and changed. The bone structure was not the structure of a decathlete. He's walking. An Olympian, right? So he's walking around. We're like, Hey Caitlyn. Hey, I was just like, this is not. Was Caitlyn Jenner a popular figure at CPAC? We were there. So I wouldn't say, I would say Caitlyn Jenner generated a lot of attention at CPAC. But it was also Swift that was in and out. Yes. It wasn't there for long. Yes. Yes. And there were a lot of people who wanted to, similarly to us, we were like, I want to get the video of Caitlyn Jenner walking past me, right? Or like saying hi to Caitlyn Jenner just to have it, but not necessarily because I'm a big fan. Exactly. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of passion. It's just like novelty. And it doesn't seem like it's a real candidacy, frankly. Right. I mean, you know, I believe Caitlyn Jenner was doing a big brother in like Australia. Yes. Like in the middle of the campaign. It's like, all right, if you're trying to be the governor, you need to be in the state like talking to people, not in Australia. I mean, I don't think it's a series. I mean, look, I think there's really. It's a really good point you're making actually Stu. I actually think every day. He's shocked. He does seem to know that's a really good point Stu. Thank you. For the first time ever. No, I didn't. I did it. No, brother. But what I mean is there's no conviction. There's a lack of actual conviction, I think, in politics today, in general. Of do you really believe, you're so flipping that you will go do back brother while you're running for governor? Or you will talk to the American people as the president and not give a hood and leave people. Or you're so flipping and you go eat at fancy restaurants while with no masks. Other people have masks. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. I think that's what we're seeing. There's no there's no depth in conviction about the American people. So yeah, wow. Great points, Stu. Thank you. Thank you for that. I did one. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor Express VPN. You know, a couple decades ago, those of us who are old enough to remember this, private citizens, you used to that used to mean something when something was private. But the internet has changed all of that. So everything you browse, search for, watch, tweeted everything. All of that is being crawled through all of that data. It's collected, aggregated by third parties into a public record. This is your life, basically, essentially your life, your private life that can be exposed for others to see. And now it can happen to anyone. And that is where Express VPN comes in. I use Express VPN to and by the way, a lot of people are like, oh, you only need a VPN if you're looking up a bunch of porn and stuff that you don't want your spouse to figure out. I will have you know, that is not true because there are so many different things that all of these big tech companies can find your information. I just don't like personally, I don't even like it when Facebook shows me ads of stuff that I was searching for somewhere else. Or talking about it. Yeah, and they're making money off of it. So you don't need to be doing something nefarious online to need Express VPN or to not want big tech to not get your information, all of your information, all of your data, and sell it to somewhere else. All right, so Express VPN, the connection gets rerouted through an encrypted server and your IP address is masked. You are given a random IP address every time that is shared by other Express VPN customers. So it makes it more difficult for third parties to identify you. By the way, that my favorite part about it is it doesn't make any of my systems lag, my computer, my phone, they do it on smart TV as well. All of my devices, they don't lag. It's just a one button tap to get protected. All right, you got to go to expressvpn.com slash Y you will get three months for free. When you sign up, it is expressvpn.com slash Y. In an effort to protect all of us, the National Archives and Records Administration determined recently that all of our founding documents that we have here in America, that now they may be quote, harmful or difficult, end quote, for some reason, for some users to view since they reflect outdated, biased, offensive, and possibly violent views and opinions. This is the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. They have harmful language alerts above all of these in their catalog. When you click the alert link, you're redirected to the statement on potentially harmful content, and they say that it is their charge to preserve and make available these historical records, and by virtue of this charge, the harmful content will be preserved, but they do note, guys, that you just have to be very careful. You never know what you're reading on the internet. Some of these items, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, they may reflect racist, sexist, ablest, misogynistic, misogynoir, and xenophobic opinions and attitudes. Now, you may be wondering, what is misogynoir? But I know that Stu knows it because I listened to the radio program this morning when I knew I was not the only one who did not know what misogynoir is, and you had to look it up. Yes, I did. I had never heard that term before. Apparently, if you're a pros-man anti-woman, misogynoir is anti-black woman. Yes. So they couldn't just say anti-woman. No. They had to say anti-black women specifically. Now, that list is going to get to be 40 pages when they go through all the genders and colors and ways people identify, but as of right now, they're only signaling out black women. To wait a minute, in this moment, there is such a thing as women. At least, that's a great point. I don't know. Let's look at that. People with a uterus, people who menstruate. People. Okay. Yeah, which, personally, I'm offended by that word in particular menstruating. I think it needs to be wimixen-strating. That's much better. Thank you. I think you need to roll off the term. Can we get back to this? I did not emigrate to this country for these documents to be thrown in the trash, trampled over, because I came from a country with this happened 100%. And let me tell you, like I told people, affirmative action is the next step in America, and it's the equity act, but that's affirmative action. That's just going to call it something else. The next step is this horse crap. I could say something else that's going to happen. And if people buy into it, this is what happens. They'll change your flag. That happened. They'll change your national anthem. That happened. They will topple history. They will cancel history. They will re- They're already trying to do that right now. There wasn't a statue that was just taken out today. I know, but what I'm saying, we can look at history and other places around the world. This is not rocket science. This is Marxist behavior. There's a playbook. It's checkboxes. They're not imaginative. They're going down a playbook. Right? This doctrine that's been drafted since the end of the Second World War. And they just go, this is next. Check America, for it. This is next. And now they're coming after the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, saying, hey, these are harmful documents, which means the foundation of the nation is harmful. To do what? To replace it. To shake it. Right? To uproot it. And so if people in any way, if you're watching, and you think, yeah, maybe it could be shut your mouth, get your head in a sand, take a beating, someone come back with reality. Right? Or check yourself into a loony bin and realize that we have to preserve those things as the untouchable documents like the Word of God, or all else will fall because when you move the foundations through, the building comes down. Fully agree with that. And you have obviously real experience seeing that happen. It's happened all over the world though. Right? I mean, it's really, it's been something that's been repeated over and over again. The idea that the National Archives has to warn you about the National Archives is really a very strange development. And this stuff just keeps happening. It's really a problem because when you get, you know, I was on, I want to say it was Reddit or some liberal, you know, collect, you know, news aggregator, and they were like, check this out. And it was this link to the original draft of Thomas Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence. And in there is a long screed about how bad slavery is. This is something that they had never even considered to everyone, everyone who was commenting underneath it was basically saying like, this guy's own slave. He's the worst guy in the world. I thought these guys were all racist. You read this and like he's talking about how it was one of the worst things was this scourge on humanity. We have a copy of it in the Mercury One Museum. And it's, it is, it would inspire everyone to understand what the reality of even that time was. They knew how bad that was. And they did everything they could to get rid of it, if not for just a couple of states blocking it at that time. And then they worked for 100 plus years to stop that later on. These documents are an inspiration to all of humanity. It has changed the world for the better. And it is, it has created the greatest environment for human beings to flourish that has ever existed. And I'm not apologizing for it. No way. Show me, show me another nation with stronger fundamentals, stronger fundamental documents from which they created an idea became a country. Show me one. There isn't. There's none. Yeah, I agree with you, but I appreciate you making the statement stronger fundamental documents because stronger fundamentals right now in this moment in 2021, I would say, I don't think we have them as a country. We don't execute them. No, I mean, they're there. They're there. They're there. Which is why they want to remove them because they've moved the move cultural, the cults daily culture has moved so far. The only thing that's anchoring us still, right? It's like a boat that's more to the dock and is a lot of rope. You can drift, but you know, we're not going to lose the boat. So how do we make sure we lose the boat? Cut the rope. Right. So rock the foundation because the only thing that's still kind of keeping us halfway in the right direction is the foundational in the documents. If you get rid of those, oh, float to sea. Right. You're gone. Yeah. Yeah. All right. We've got more to come. First, I want to thank our sponsor, the segment, Eye Target Pro.

As of the time of this taping, he has not spoken yet. I believe that the time that this is airing, he will, I guess, just be wrapping up a speech. Who knows how long it's going to take him to get through a teleprompter speech. So we will have more on that in the coming shows. But he just told 11 appointees from the Trump era that they must resign from their military academy advisory boards or be fired immediately. And we've got several of them. Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer, I know, namely, who both responded yesterday and said, absolutely not. I will not be resigning here. Kellyanne Conway said, President Biden, I'm not resigning, but you should. So which was, I mean, I feel like a very succinct yet says so much. But so it's Kellyanne Conway, Sean Spicer, but also HR McMaster. And there are several names in there that, you know, someone might say, well, Kellyanne Conway doesn't have any business being on a military advisory board. But there are some names on there that certainly you can't say they are not credible people to be on these boards. So it is interesting. And Kellyanne Conway pointed out three former directors of presidential personnel inform me that this request is a break from presidential norms. It certainly seems petty and political, if not personal. The result is that faithful and willing public servants will be discouraged or thwarted from service. Our service academies will risk being further politicized and polarized, which I don't disagree with. I don't disagree with that all. I mean, this is a break from the norms. You know, for all that we heard about going back to God, don't you remember when they said this is just going to be a boring presidency. And they were so excited about that. Brian Stelter is like, the best part about this presidency is that it's going to be boring. And we love that because Trump was so high drama. That's an incredible stelter. When did you do develop that recently? That sounds just like them. Thank you. I appreciate that. That's out of resentment. Well, what? Well, resentment for Stelter. That's you read that kind of talent. Yes. Yes. You're absolutely right. Look, HR McMaster is unquestionably qualified to serve on a military board, whether you like the president he served under or not. By the way, he's served under multiple presidents. And is critical of Trump. Yeah. He says, not exactly like Trump's best friend. Trump doesn't like him. He doesn't seem to like Trump very much. What does that have to do with anything? He's totally qualified to do these things. Even if he's not, though, I mean, like there's no reason to make, you know, we have enough partisanship in our life. If we have a situation where people can come together and try to help our service members in any way that they can, we don't want to add politics to that. We better subtract it from any of these. But it seems to be the entire Biden agenda, like their entire policy is just whatever Trump did, we will either undo or just do the opposite no matter what it is. Except for Afghanistan. He was stuck to that deal. He was stuck to that deal. He had to enforce your magic. That's a great point. Look, this is such hogwash. There's not, you have boards of directors and then you have advisory boards. I'm blessed to serve on several of both. You do not want your advisory board to mirror your board of directors. You want your advisory board to be very diverse across different sectors of society. And so absolutely, Kena Kelly and Conway serve on a military advisory board. She's bringing completely different perspective. He would not asking her to have military strategy. That would be the board of directors or the ones who's actually in position, the decision-makers. So a board of advisors should be very diverse coming from different angles because you're putting complex situations on the table saying, can we look at this from different angles and can we come up with ideas? Right. So it's not like everybody in the room all of a sudden had to be an expert because if that was the case, the institute would be completely wrong, which is never hardly ever. Because in the beginning of the show, Stu told us that the person Gavin Newsom brought into the office infectious disease knew nothing about infectious disease. So when does it actually matter to be qualified or not? Right. Come on. No, it's ridiculous. It really is. You know, it's just this back, like you're right, like the anti-Trump thing dominates the way this- Everything, the whole administration, yeah. It's crazy. They don't seem to care about anything else. They don't seem to care about the inflation. They don't seem to care about what's going on in Afghanistan. I mean, you got people, Glenn Beck's over there freaking landing planes and picking up people. I don't know what's going on. That's not supposed to be the way this has happened. And we talked about, you know, we've worked, I know, we've worked with us as well on all, we've all done all this stuff with Mercury one over the years. And like, we, when that was started, I remember Glenn used to, you know, introduce it as if we want the government to do less, we need to do more. I thought that was a really great way for conservatives to think about charity, right? Like we can't just sit here and complain about the government, right? Yeah, exactly. We need, if we want those taxes to go down, if we want there to be less of an impact, we should be able to be willing to step up and donate our time and our resources and our money. I did not think though, we needed to go into Afghanistan and get people up and fly them out. Like, I didn't think it needed to go that far. I thought the government had that one. Apparently not. Yeah. That's a great point. Oh, they're qualified people. Yeah. Well, I mean, well, and then to like block them, I know, we're kind of getting derailed here. But then to block the people who actually the private citizens who went in and did it. It's like, okay. And now, so now, not only do you not want them to clean up your mess, when they actually try to clean up your mess, you don't want people to find out about it, I guess, because it's going to make you look bad. Coverups are always part of it, right? It's just a matter of like, I do feel like eventually with Afghanistan in particular, we're going to get some deep, we're going to get books. There's a lot of people in the state department, but certainly in the military that are disgusted with the way this happened. And we're going to get some reporting. Those sides of the aisle, by the way. Yeah. More than you think. There was a moment I was actually impressed with the media through this. Now, it's starting to fade. It's starting to fade. But I do think there are people that are like dedicated enough to 20 years there, people lost their lives. Now, think about going through this weekend again. September 11th, 20th anniversary is Saturday. This is going to hit, I think, everybody in a totally different way, knowing how this all turned out, knowing the complete incompetence and disregard for human life that this administration has tossed out there. And I think watching that video always brings me back to that moment. To do it again, after all of this has happened, it's hard to imagine. This weekend, 20 years ago, just three weeks later, I immigrated to this country. I walked in that street in New York with, I was leaving footsteps in the ash, right? And so it's going to rattle people this weekend. And so it should. And I don't believe in irony. I believe in divinity. God has divine things happen for a reason. We have this result because the people in power in this country at the moment are anti-American. They do not care about our people. They behave that way. I can judge their fruit. I can do that. Publicly, I can do that. I can look at their actions and I go, that does not line up by putting our people first, period. All right. The latest on Texas is Heartbeat, the abortion law that the left is up in arms about when we come back. Oh, and AOC is. Oh, but it's smart. Sources have informed the Wall Street Journal, apparently, that the Biden administration's Department of Justice will proceed with a lawsuit targeting the state of Texas for Senate Bill 8, which is, of course, the heartbeat law that we have covered on the show. This is not shocking. I think we all knew that this was coming. We knew that the federal government would come after the state for daring to protect human life. You can't do that, in Biden's administration. So look, I struggle to believe it's like it's one of those two good to be true things. I struggle to believe it's like the California governor, Larry Elder, will he actually become California governor? I can't even go there. For me, I know that this law is now in effect, and that's great, but I just keep thinking, like, this isn't going to last. This isn't forever. Come on, they're going to sue us. They're going to block us. The Supreme Court has the case with, who is it, Missouri? Mississippi. And I just can't fully let myself believe that this is the law in Texas because it just feels like we're on borrowed time. Am I being too cynical? I don't think you're being too cynical on the Texas law. I do think the Texas law is going to have its problems in court. What the Supreme Court said was basically, like, you guys aren't going about this right. They said procedurally. This is wrong. Someone needs to get sued before we can take this case. That's all they really said. Of course, they're acting as if they've overturned Roe versus Wade, which they haven't. I mean, that's not what's happened here. The Mississippi case is one where that could happen, right? That's a legitimate, I think. I mean, like, I look, anytime I can see a baby not die, I'm going to be excited about it. Yeah. So I'm happy about the results. What do you say, kind of weirdo? I know. It is a weird, it's a weird stance to take. So, you know, I'm excited about the result, certainly, in Texas, of what may come out of this. Right, right. I don't, you know, I don't know that this is the way we want our legal system working generally, like that people are just suing each other for, I mean, can we imagine what California would do with this? You got an SUV? Well, we're not going to say you can't have an SUV, but people can sue you and get $10,000 if you drive an SUV because you have a climate crisis going on. I think this could span, I don't think it's the best way for our legal system to operate. That being said, though, the Mississippi situation is one where, you know, Roe versus Wade is also not the best way for her. I should point that out. It's also a terrible way for our legal system to operate. And this is why you have to have these crazy solutions because it was such terrible law at the beginning. It's been doubled down on so many times. Now we're at the point where, like, if we could go back to just Roe versus Wade, it would be a massive move to the conservative side of the argument. We're so far away from that. So hopefully I'm with you, I will say. Mentally, I look at this and I say, look, there's six Republicans there. Even if you lose Roberts, you should be okay to do something serious here. I can't physically allow myself to believe this could happen because it's been let down every single time. I just assume it's going to go terribly. That's not a legal analysis. That's just me, I think, hedging my life. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, no, here comes Mr. Optimus. No, it's not about Mr. Optimus. It's about me understanding just how life works and not to, not to, I'm going to go against both of you on this again. That tells them happens. But let me tell you how dare you. Let me tell you something real quick. Momentum is a funny thing. And as an athlete, you know momentum. And when momentum shifts, you do not get it back. And it, sir and ma'am has shifted. Listen to me today. We're going to turn Roe v. Wait, and we're going to turn it in this state in the city where it started, Dallas, Texas. And it's going to turn right here. This is going to stand and bring the war. This is me saying, buckle up, buckle up. Okay. Because we're going to come for you. I told you, I stood with Governor Stitt four weeks ago in Oklahoma. Stood with him when he signed the heartbeat bill. Watch, look at Tennessee, look at Kentucky, look at Alabama. The momentum has shifted. People start to believe. And I'm going to continue to tell him, keep believing. Yes, there's going to be a battle. Okay. Yes, we got to buckle up our AG has to buckle up. We're going to go into a legal battle. But we're going to turn this thing. I'm absolutely optimistic. I'm much more optimistic on Mississippi. I think that Texas state, let's say any long term, but going to be a collective, just going to be one state. Quickly, I think we kind of go down this road a lot of times where we think, okay, well, we have this position on the right and they have this position on the left. We just fight and fight and fight and fight forever. Look at like some other divisive issues that have been kind of changed over the past few years, a gay marriage, right? A huge ruling, a terrible piece of legislative doctrine. I mean, Oberkefell was terrible as far as the law goes. Forget what it actually did. However, like we don't sit here and obsess and talk about that every day. marijuana is legal all over the place. That was a really important rule for conservatives back in the day. Really, we don't talk about it that much. We were going back decades and decades and decades of Roe v. Wade. It's just as important to conservatives today as it was the day it happened because it's the life of human beings we're talking about here. This is not just some little law, some divisive issue. It's not women's rights. Women can do whatever they want, but they can't kill other people just like men can't kill other people. Stu, you bring up a great point because it isn't just women's rights. It's actually menstruating people's rights. This is according to, of course, AOC who was on with Anderson Cooper discussing this very law and she needed to make sure. Actually, she contradicted herself. I think she said like three different terms, menstruating people, women, and one other one. Let's watch. This is about making sure that someone like me, as a woman or any menstruating person in this country, cannot make decisions over their own body. People like Governor Abbott and Mitch McConnell want to have more control over a woman's body than that woman or that person has over themselves. How dare she use the term woman? Women? All right. I told it I offer air not to be a redundant, but I just want one. AOC, just bring me one menstruating man. Just bring me one. Bring me one man that's obviously. Are you sure you want to see that? They don't exist. One. One with an uterus. Just one. You can't put one out of your backside. Just one. She doesn't even believe in her own argument. Now she's a woman and she's not menstruating person, menstruating elephant, menstruating monkey. It doesn't matter what it is. The whole thing is an absolute joke. It's posturing. It's virtue signaling. It's gaslighting. It's all of these things. It's all just to get a minute in the sun and it's just get up the Instagram likes, get the hits up, be relevant, be relevant, because I'm so empty. I can't give society anything of any value. Yeah, let's do it last morning. I'll just leave it here in October of 2024. AOC turns 35 years old. He will qualify to be president of the United States just a few weeks before this election happens. I just want to put that in the back of your mind. You call me the opposite. We need to take a break so I could cry. Don't we just deserve it at this point? We really do. All right, this is the part of the show where we usually do reviews, which we are doing, but it's a cookie review instead of a podcast review. Because we're all emotionally disturbed by Biden. So now we've got to eat this stuff. Yes. So yes, these are of course, yes. Kexy, Kexy, Kookie, which are pack rais. These are pack rais cookies. Well, not his cookie. This thing is heavy. Yes. It is dense. I've got you chance like massive ants. Okay. You really do. I've got massive ants. Look at this thing. Let me put it on my right here. The top heavy that is. It's as big as your head. Yeah. It's as big as your head. And so they're really good. We usually cut them off into pieces. Do you want to have pumpkin spice? Yeah, I would love one. I never tried them. I want to. Pumpkin spice. All right. I don't know. Yeah. The pumpkin spice is quite good. Even this little slice is up. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Really good. So good. Wow. And it's like crunchy on the outside. Can people order online? Yes. K-E-K-S-I dot com. Kexy. Maybe the camera can catch this again. Kexy. Follow them. So if you really want to just like be tempted all day, follow them on social media.
