    "text": " All right, ladies and gents, it's panel time and today I have joining me, TPAUSA contributor and the host of Daily Caller Live, JoBob. We also have the author of Speechless, who's never Speechless, in Daily Wire's own, Michael Knowles. I've read it, Lucie, one of your books. And with us again is the author of Beat in Black and Blue YouTube Sensation, Brandon Tatum. All right, first segment is, of course, politics. It never stops. What's it mean when, like, now the transgender people are starting to come out and say, the transgender movement has gone too far? Like, what's this, like, how do we analyze this? You have this transgendered psychologist who has helped hundreds of teens transition and now is saying, no, actually, this doesn't make sense because the numbers that are rising, it's too many people. We're beginning these people on hormone blockers without them even consulting a psychologist. There was once a guy that was canceled from a shaving commercial as ads canceled because he spoke about this phenomenon on an old show of mine. His name was Michael Knowles. I seem to remember that. We were called Terrible Dirty Rotten Awful Bigots at the time. And now you've got even some of the very pro-transgender pro-transitioning psychologists saying this, and I think they're doing so because of a little CYA. I think they're a little nervous about the impending lawsuits that are going to be coming down the pike. Kids blame their parents for everything, and usually it's nonsense. But if you now think about 20 years from now, when kids will have been put on puberty blockers, which are poison, by the way. I mean, these puberty blockers, they destroy your bone density. They can put you on walkers. They create irreversible damage very often. You'll have legitimate grievances against your parents and the quack child abusing doctors who enable them. I mean, this is the other than abortion, which is by its definition, the worst child abuse in the country. This is the second clearest example of child abuse. I think a lot of people are going to be running away from liability. And what were those numbers? Because I remember a minute years ago, she may not have them fresh in your head, but you were explaining to me that jump, which signified to us that there was a cultural change. It wasn't that all these kids are suddenly identifying as male or female, but rather that the society was giving them the option to, and like children, they just chose it because it's in front of them. The numbers that you need to know right now are that previously LGBT identity among Americans was about 1%, maybe up to about 3%. Today for Gen Z, it's 20.8%. So either Alex Jones is right and there's something in the water. Or this is a social phenomenon that is being cultivated in kids. And maybe it's gone. That's why I get it's toothpaste. No, so anyway. But I think that it's very interesting that even the person who's an advocate can see that this is going to dog on far. I mean, I often say Stevie Wonder can see that this is crazy for you to interject these ideas onto little children. You know, when I was, I can't remember what I was doing when I was seven years old. I think I want to be like Michael Jordan. And now I don't even play basketball anymore. So, you know, I think that when you're young, you're impressionable and it's a drive and a focus to get these children to be prime victims in these sick games that some of these adults are playing. The only crime that the kids are committing is believing their parents. That's the only thing that kids are able to do. When I was seven years old, my parents told me I was a firetruck. I believed them. So what they're doing, what these parents are doing, letting their kids make decisions is child abuse. I just can't imagine it because I'm a mother. The stuff that just comes out of children's mouths, just in general, forget have you don't even have to be a mom, you have cousins, everything they're saying, if you just started to pretend that everything they said was valid, imagine the world we live in. They'd wake up, they'd sour candies, they would put on their Superman cape, they would be jumping from buildings. Our job as parents is to tell them right from wrong and somehow it's been flipped. Now the children are the executives of their households and they're telling their parents who they are. I had a little girl who thought she was a mermaid, didn't want to get out of the tub. I didn't let her drown in the tub and let her sleep in there. You're actually not a mermaid, you've got to get out and you've got to get dressed. Now that's seen as a form of abuse culturally, what do you mean? They know children know what they are. Children know absolutely nothing. That's the whole point, that's why they're called children and not being called adults. And what you are saying, Michael, is actually so important and for my monologue, I just read that anonymous Reddit post from a mother, left-leaning mother clearly who believed she's done everything right. She's now got a 20-year-old who she initially had put on puberty blockers who now has a micro penis and has just learned the reality that they need to use a portion of his colon to create a faux vagina. And the option, and she said, oh, one of his friends did the exact same procedure and actually now his new looking vagina smells like a rectum, right? And so now her child is suicidal. Now young adult man, 20 years old is now suicidal. And she's going to the internet for help. I don't know what to do. I'm losing my daughter as she refers to him as. And it's like, you both need psychological help and evaluation. You have a son who you've allowed to now mutilate his body and is coming to terms with the fact that he can't go back and he doesn't know how to go forward. I do actually really feel for the parents here because for a lot of parents, some of them are just radicals and ideologues and weirdos and creeps. But I think a lot of them just want to do what's best for their kid. They don't follow the scientific and political developments very closely. And they believe the experts. That's their great sin. And so when you have people, there was one weirdo the other day I saw on Twitter. I saw more than one weirdo. It's time to wear that later. On Twitter? On shocking, I know. What? But there was a guy by the name of Jack Turbin who is a creepy young man who is promoting transgenderism for kids. And he's lying about the effects of it and he's lying about the harm that it does to kids. But he's got all the right credentials. He had an affiliation with Harvard. I think now he's a fellow in child psychiatry. Lord, help them at Stanford University. And so if I were a confused mother and my child is being exposed to this nonsense in school all the time. And my kid came to me and said, I'm actually a girl. If I didn't know any better, I'd say, well, all the genius experts are telling me that I need to put them on puberty blockers, destroy his body, destroy his bones, put them on cross sex hormones and chop off his genitals. But why don't you as an adult know better? So I don't care what your expertise are, how many letters you have following your name. If you come to me and you say, Candice, you can fly, jump out of this plane. I'm going to be like, nah, man. I actually can't you first. You first little birdie. Prove it. So there's something that's happening where the academia, for some reason, if I'm just saying they're an expert, I have a PhD in this. And people just completely abandon their common sense. We've gotten into a society where now that common sense is missing and you're looking to experts to tell you what you know. You know that men and women are different. You know this. Here's why though. It is a purely emotional argument. But I understand why people are susceptible to it because the entire argument for transing the kids is if you don't trans your kid, he's going to kill himself. And you can, and all the statistics by the way are completely bogus, but they'll say, you can decrease the chances of your kid killing himself by 70 plus percent if you just put him on puberty blockers and cross sex hormones. And so these parents have a well intention, in most cases I think, but misguided sense that if we just indulge in lies, then we're going to make our kid feel better. And that's never the case. There's a great line from C.S. Lewis. He says, if you look for truth, you might find comfort in the end. And if you look for comfort, you're going to find neither truth nor comfort, only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair. Because living in lies is not going to turn out well. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. I think you really did a good job helping the parents, but I think you are an absolute idiot of a parent. If you were a kid, your children didn't take anything. I don't know what generation these people have grown up in. My daddy, I told my dad I was a girl. Yeah, right. I guess you're going to have to kill yourself then. You ain't no girl. And you're going to do this, this, and this and this. Why? Because I'm responsible for your life. I feed you. You know, we used to still get weapons. That ain't no even Spain kids anymore. But like, we should get toe up. You can just do what you want to do. Your parents mold you and even brainwash you into becoming what they want you to be. And when you're 18, you're free. True story when I was a kid growing up, like whenever I expressed my parents, I used to say, I'm going to run away and my mom used to say, hey, don't run, walk because nobody's coming after you. Take your time, sweetheart. Like, this is the kind of stuff. This is the kind of parenting I grew up with where it was like, you know, like then you start crying, you should realize nobody's even going to come after you. So you can walk away and not run. Like we need more of that. And this is like, there has been a generation that has been softened in general when it comes to parenting. And I'm not saying that everything that was done in the past is great. But I do think that, you know, a firm or former parenting works. And to me, this mass brainwashing that parents can be told over and over again by a psychologist. Like, that, you know, this is, this is air. This is not a soft surface. This is a ball. And it's not, you know, this is, this is not a cup, a mug. I mean, and then they start to believe it. Like I feel, I do feel bad for them because of the peer pressure and the judgment that I think that they, they're afraid that they're going to fear. And parenting is scary. You know, we know that parenting is scary, but it not, not scary enough for me. Like I just, it has just gotten way too far when even the transgender individuals are acknowledging like this is, this is getting crazy. But I think in a lot of ways, we're over-complicating it. To go back to your point and sorry for being blunt, kids are stupid. Kids are dumb people. Unfortunately, they have drunk people. Adults are dumb people sometimes. Yeah, adults are dumb people. So kids are equally as dumb if not way more. There's a reason kids can't get tattoos before they're 18. There's a reason they can't vote before 18. Back to the same point because they're dumb people. So don't let kids who are dumb people make decisions. Yeah. Well, they can't vote before they're 18 because Democrats will have enough power to get it. Not to them. Six-year-olds will be voting. Yeah, right. Would you like a lollipop for me? They can however vote after they die. Yeah. So it's the younger end that they haven't figured out yet. Trust the science. Somebody with a PhD will explain to you why dead people can vote. Give it two years. We will get back to the show in just a moment. But first, we are all staring at screens every single day and we know the horrible side effects that you get from that. For me, I get headaches. I swear my right eyesight is deteriorating. You get the digital eye strain, the watery eyes, the fatigue. It's all so bad. But there is a solution. And the solution is BlueBlox BlueLight Computer Glasses. I love these glasses. They really come in handy during the day when I'm on my computer answering emails and reading up on the latest news stories to prep for the show. They have stylish frames, which is an added bonus. They've been featured in GQ and Boog Magazine. Unlike other BlueLight glasses companies, BlueBlox uses science-backed technology tested to ensure that they work. The results? Well, I'll tell you right now, I'm seeing a little bit better. I have no more digital eye strain or headaches. I feel amazing. The glass is coming non-prescription, prescription and reading options. BlueBlox also ships worldwide in rapid time. So what are you waiting for? Go to blueblox.com slash Candace. Use coupon code Candace to save 20%. That's blueblox.com spelled B-L-U-B-L-O-X dot com slash Candace. And use coupon code Candace to save 20%. I also want to talk about on the same topic. You have the TSA and DHS have come out and said that they're going to stop using gender in the security processes. What does that look like? They're going to update their advanced imaging technology at airport checkpoints with our money. $18.6 million from Congress. And it's going to be a system that is gender neutral. And now when you go through, you can have the person pat you down that matches the gender in your mind and not your actuality. So if you're a man and you've got all your hearts biologically, you can say, actually, I'll take the woman because I identify as a woman and she'll pat you down. You know, every storm cloud has a silver lining, I guess. I mean, it's just, this is what I mean. This is government sanctioned insanity and I am convinced that the government wants to give everybody some type of mental disorder. I've said this over and over again. It's, you know, believing your children can pick their gender and it inspires a lifelong, basically, your sacrifice to big pharma for the rest of your life. Everything that you do is now hormone blocker, surgery. It's big pharma, big pharma, big pharma. And you see this in every single regard. And this is an example of just like government sponsored mental disorder. This is an important point you mentioned on big pharma and the money. The White House has just come out and supported transing the kids. They're basing it on a study from the Trevor Project. The Trevor Project is an LGBT element, non-profit organization. The Trevor Project gets a lot of its funding from ABV, which is a pharmaceutical company that's making the drugs to transgender the kids. So it doesn't take rocket scientists to realize that big politics is going to invite big money and big corruption on this issue. Yeah, it's got to be the only reason. I just see it everywhere. I mean, even when you're talking about all of these people coming out of COVID who don't know how to look at each other's faces anymore and they're in a psychosis and it's government sponsored. Everywhere around you, you are seeing that the government is forcing people to either go on fentanyl because they don't get opioid after they got heroin and drugs from that one tooth they got pulled out and now they become addicts on the street. You're seeing this in the gender category. You're seeing this in COVID. People need therapy now to want to go around their family members, to speak to their husband without a mask on. I'm a therapist and I see that the great winner in all of this is always Big Pharma. You know, we talk about this with regard to the kids right now, but I think the passport issue and DHS and the government agencies talking about it for adults really brings home the question. Conservatives have been trying to split the baby on this issue. We say, look, if you're a grown man and you want to call yourself Sally and put on a dress, that's fine. That's your right. I have no right to infringe on that sacred right of yours, but just don't let the kids do it. That's not going to work, folks. Either transgenderism is true or not. Either a man can secretly be a woman or he can. If it is true, then we probably should trans the kids because if it's real and it's really going to alleviate their suffering to mutilate their bodies to look more like the sex that they secretly supposedly are, then certainly we should do that, right? Or as is actually the case, it's just a big lie and a delusion and it's not true for the adults and it's not true for the kids, but that means that we need to grow some anatomical body parts that I know are at discussion here and just say, it's not real and we're going to ditch it. No more transgender and yellow. I can't figure out the differences between gender and mutilation, which we talk about and what they're doing, which we call it in a euphemism, gender affirmation. What is the difference in terms of what we're doing in the West and what happens in these radical countries? The answer is there is no difference. We just have loony tunes behind you telling you that it's okay and somehow this makes you a better person and it's just genuinely, it hurts my heart for the children that are involved. But I want to catch this next story. I want to get to this because this has been trending on Twitter for the last couple of days. The Washington Post is now involved in doxing. If we did this on the internet, we would be pulled down and our accounts would be banned, but when the Washington Post does it, it's totally fine. So it's totally cool. There is an account on Twitter, which I'm sure we all follow, called Libs of TikTok. Literally all this account does is it takes TikTok videos of liberals and it just plays them on Twitter and places them on Instagram so you can actually see what they're saying to your children and all of these loony tunes that we're talking about, like all of these videos of them in purple makeup and men dressed up like pretty little princesses, like four year olds, which is extremely disturbing to see. And it makes the argument much more real to parents that need to see these videos to understand what we're talking about. These are not sane individuals that are targeting your children. When you hear them speak, you understand they're unstable, that they're predatory. The Washington Post decided to deal with this account by finding out who it was and doxing them, putting out their personal information. And we have Taylor Lorenz of the Washington Post. We've got just a few clips of her showing up at the person's family members' doors, harassing them. And what's unique about Taylor Lorenz, the reporter that was on this, is that she once cried and talked about how scary it is to be a journalist in the world when people are coming after your personal information. So Taylor, take it away, hypocrite. And online harassment is such a misnomer. I think it's a huge problem because harassment is a tool to silence people, especially women and people of color, or from marginalized identities, for speaking out. And there's a very intentional goal behind it. It's obviously it's death threats and all of that and rape threats on the daily. And it's not just Twitter. It's like every single surface. My cell phone number getting out there, people calling, people harassing my family members, stalking me. All of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive. And it's bled out into the physical world too, which is even more terrifying, right? But to me, I think what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own reporters, is this is just a tool, harassment is a tool to discredit and silence journalists. You feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life. And it's so isolating. Where's the tears? No tears, not one tear. And that's exactly of course what she went on to do, trying to figure out who is running this Libs of TikTok account, basically threatening them with their faux deadlines. Like our story is going to mention your name. You have five seconds to answer back. We're going to allow you to offer a please. If you'd like to offer a comment, please let me know in the next hour. You can give me a ring on if you prefer. I mean, this is how journalism is. And this is just, we've already written the article, but now we're pretending that we're ethical in the background. This is the state of journalism today. Look at the word that she uses in that email. She says, we are exposing the woman who runs, I think it's a woman, the person who runs Libs of TikTok. We are, it's not, we're investigating a story. It's not, we are exposing. We are going to open up to violence potentially, but certainly we are going to make vulnerable this private citizen who is just reposting videos that are already public after I cry my crocodile tears. She actually didn't have any tears. That's why she couldn't win the Oscar for that. Only an Emmy, I think. But what a performance. It is interesting. This is in the last week. There's been two of these types of stories from the Washington Post. If you remember last week when Elon Musk is trying to buy Twitter, the Washington Post came out and said, billionaires who are meddling in public forums should not be. Fun fact, Jeff Bezos, billionaire owns the Washington Post. They said nothing about that. So the two sides, the other side of the argument is never applicable to them. It just never is. Yeah. And it is so true that they've been creating these peer pressure campaigns. I mean, we even saw this with the federal judge who removed the mask mandate. They just started publicizing her face everywhere. And here's how it works, right? So they see themselves as this is the criminals, the criminality that happens. They're like, I'm a journalist and I don't have to get my hands dirty. So I'm going to put out all the information that people like Antifa need so they can find these people and they can harass them and they can get dirty. And we're just going to say, oh, we just ran a piece. We had nothing to do with this. And then these people show up to their doors, so harassing their family members and things get violent. And the Washington Post is complicit in this. This is how they run things. And that's why I call them. These are your typical run-of-the-mill brown shirts, except they don't want to do the fighting, right? They look down their nose and they say, all right, Antifa, here it is. Send out the hounds now. Here's where this person lives. And that's exactly what's going to happen. This person, it's been published now, the article with her name and she's going to get harassed. Yeah. And it's very interesting because she should be able to sue them. She's not a public figure. She's not a person that's out in the open. You cannot expose her information and make her susceptible to this. But these individuals on the left are just shales of human beings. I hate to say that. I know some of them probably think certain ways about conservatives, but these people do not have, they didn't appear to have a soul. How do you sit there and fake cry in front of the world and paint this picture of you being this virtuous person and you turn around and do the very same thing to a woman? The same people that claim they care about black and brown bodies are creating situations to hurt the very people that they claim to support. So every time I see one of these shale-like people, it really makes me sick to my stomach. You have to ask yourself one question. What journalistic purpose was served by that hit piece? If there were some question, if this woman's identity were relevant to the political campaigns against transgender grooming, again about the Florida education building, if there were some relevance, I could almost see an argument for doing investigative work. But that's not what's going on here. It's just to believe this person. It's just to silence this person. And I hope it doesn't work. Libs of TikTok is a pretty aggressive account. The only between these two groups here, the Washington Post and Libs of TikTok, one of them is a shameless hack propagandist for the ruling class. The other is a journalist. And I think we know which is which. Exactly. I don't know that they will be able to sue. I don't know if they can, I mean they haven't defamed turn anyway, so I don't know how exactly like Libs, I don't know what the legality is. I mean, I think doxing is a crime, but I'm sure they were very careful not to doxing individual, even though they're giving just enough information to encourage other people to do it. I hope there is some loophole on that, maybe just for bullying and harassment and the person just not wanting to be a public figure because now this person is going to be a public figure and will not be able to just hide behind the moniker of Libs of TikTok. But that is what, that's what the game is. I mean, these people don't want what they're doing to be exposed. And the children has become the front line of this fight. TikTok is where the youngest kids are. I don't have a TikTok account, but this is like, this is the new social media frontier. This is where they're being able to convince children that they can pick their genders. And it's why I always say to parents, why on earth are you allowing your child to be on TikTok? Libs of TikTok is telling you why they should never be on that social media account. We will get back to the show in just a moment, but first, let's talk about your internet security. Usually the internet without ExpressVPN is like leaving your laptop exposed at a coffee shop table while you run to the counter to buy another drink. First of the time you'll probably be okay, but what if one day you come back and your laptop is gone? A lot, Hunter Biden. Every time you connect to an uncrypted network, think Cafe, Airport or Hotel Wi-Fi, your online data is not secured. Any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data. And it doesn't take an advanced techy knowledge to hack someone. A 12 year old could do it. That's why I recommend that you use ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN creates a secure and cricket tunnel between your device and the internet so that hackers can't steal your sensitive data. But I like most about ExpressVPN is how easy it is to use. Simply download the app on your phone or computer, tap one button and that's it. You're protected. Secure your online data today with the VPN that I trust by visiting expressVPN.com slash Candace. That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com slash Candace and you can get an extra three months free. All right, guys. My favorite segment now, pop culture. We have Nick Cannon, who is very funny. He is trending online after photos from his latest maternity shoot goes viral. When you say ladies, she might be thinking, oh, his second child, his third child. I think he's on child number eight and they're all with different baby mamas except for his twins that were with Ryan Carey. That's the only because they were twins. They came out at the same time. So he is outwardly against monogamy and he has leaked. I mean, he has put out these maternity shoot photos and we can see them and it's him with yeah, number eight. I think it's baby number eight. Could be number nine. I'm not absolutely positive. Neither is he. It's number eight right now. I don't see anything he knows about. Very proudly and I think what the internet was just saying is just like, you know, it's just interesting that he, each time he does do a full on maternity shoot, he's had so many in the past and he's done like with every single celebrity under the sun and women that he works with. This is no different here or just a few of them. They're very beautiful shots. By the way, he's doing a very good job. And there was Twitter just had a lot to say about this and made some great fun of Nick. Does Nick Cannon not want to take up any other hobbies like gardening, reading, painting. It says this person. Next person. One thing Nick Cannon is going to do is show up to that maternity shoot. Yeah, he's definitely showing up. The photographers when they see Nick Cannon booking them for maternity shoot. And I think this one's my favorite. God. I don't know if you can multiply Nick Cannon. And I just got personal. I mean, look, I've spoken to Nick Cannon. I think he's a nice guy. He's very misguided here and he is contributing. I don't know why people don't see this as a contribution to father absence because there is just no way that you have eight children that are growing up in a stable household. I understand that you have money, but that does not take money does not take the place of having a father in the household. The cultural significance of this should not be downplayed. He is a very he has always been the nice guy. And I do want to acknowledge that. But what people are learning from him is not a good thing. And these women, how do you still mess with a dude that got five and six other kids? I mean, I think that it's definitely something to say to where's the guidance from these young women. They're going out here and allowing this guy to have children with them knowing that he's not going to participate. He cannot participate. This guy is not omnipresent. He's not going to be in every single household. But I do think it's troubling that Nick Cannon, being on these young people shows or whatever for the children, being an example, he's setting a poor example for young men. It is not cool to have all these kids. It is more equitable for you. It's more appropriate if you have children with one woman and you take care of your dog on kids in that household. And if you happen to have a kid with one woman, another woman and you get married again, do your responsibility and not continue down that path. Of all of the harem having black nationalists, I think Nick Cannon is my favorite one. Because he's got very strange political views. He went down this rabbit hole that was pioneered by Leonard Jeffries about how white people are evil and don't have souls and black people are the people of the sun. This was very popular in the black power movement of the 1970s and this involves having lots of women and having lots of kids. So his ideas are wrong and he's clearly gone down a wrong path. I have to tell you though, again, we talk about silver linings to storm clouds. It's sad that this is the standard today. At least he didn't kill his kids. We live in a country where 800,000 babies a year are killed through abortion. At least he didn't kill them. It would be to your point, it would be obviously much better if he would settle down, have all eight kids with the same woman. I think that would just technically make him Catholic. I think he would automatically become more and more and more men is the other one. But that would be good. It's funny because when Nick Cannon is wrong, he's so wrong. He goes so fully extremely wrong. But he actually is right in some ways that our present culture is wrong. And it's namely that having kids is a good thing, multiplying is a good thing. But you have responsibilities and you've got to do it in the right way as well. Right. Actually, I think it would be really super interesting to have him on the show and to actually talk to him about it because I think he's just missing that chip. And his idea as you spoke to a little bit here, Michael, is that he believes that the idea of monogamy is somehow tied to Eurocentric white supremacist ideals and principles and it's not. It's been proven over and over again. Just good. Yeah, yeah, it's just good. Just good, right? That children fare better when they grow up in a household with two stable parents. That's just the truth. And like I said, the economics of this is not going to transform that. Like having checks sent to these women, which is what they want. This is why they're agreeing to it. You know, just from a prostitution, I'll give you my body and I'll have one child. So I'm taking care of for the rest of my life. Texas. Yeah, exactly. And it's really sad. So on both sides of this, what you're speaking to is just that it's really sad. And it is good that he loves his children. It is good that he's proud that he's gotten another eighth in eighth woman pregnant and family is good and having children is good, just not in this particular regard. But he's a broken man. This is what we're experiencing, a broken man. If you cannot commit to a woman, you cannot, you're afraid of it. And so what you do is you find ways to make excuses of why you shouldn't be with one woman. It's, it's that I would, I would argue that if he sat down here and you spoke with him, there's a lot of things in his childhood, maybe fatherlessness in his childhood that makes him the man that he is. And it's really fear. He's afraid to be solid to one woman. Maybe Mariah Carey heard his feelings of, and now he feel like he can't commit. But a lot of men who struggle with that, they have internal issues that they're dealing with and they make excuses by coming up with these theories of why it makes sense. So true. Hey, Nick, to Mariah Carey, hurt your feelings. We ought to find out. We want to get to the bottom of that. You guys, that's all the time that we had today. Be sure to keep up with Joe Bob, Michael and Brandon. Thanks for joining me on this segment of Candice.
