It was after this impeachment thing bombed out. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? I told you to be on the look because there's going to be something come down in fact, there are 10 months left, and even though impeachment blew up on them, there's going to be something else. And I'm kicking myself. I'm kicking myself for not realizing what it was going to be. I mean, I mentioned it in a list of possibilities. But I'm stupid. I should have realized they're going to go straight back to Russia and they've done it. Live from the Southern Command in sunny South Florida. It's open line. Friday! Folks, it just doesn't get any better than this. You got a word to look at this and laugh at it and smile and understand how to appreciate it and realize that it means the other side is literally gone insane. Including the never-Trumpers, the Democrats and the drive-by media. Great to have you with us. It is open line Friday. You know what that means. It means you can talk about whatever you want to. You may think that's the way it is Monday through Thursday, but it isn't. Well, on Friday it is. So, anything you want to talk about have at it, here's the phone number, and we try to take more phone calls on Friday. Numbers 800-282-2882, the email address, Lrushbo at eibnet.us. So, I have been laughing uproariously this morning every time I tune in to the drive-by media. Let's see. We've had the Democrats have had a disastrous couple of weeks now. The Hawkeye-Cawkeye fear. Do you know that Crazy Bernie is demanding a recount of some of the Hawkeye-Cawkeye votes? This was two weeks ago, Snirdly, and they still are not sure who won. That is an absolute disaster. Why aren't the Russians responsible for that? I mean, that is a direct Democrat fiasco. And you would think that would be made to order for these clowns to claim the Russians did it. But they haven't. They haven't alluded to the Russians or Trump having anything to do with the fact that they can't even count their own freaking votes. So, the Hawkeye-Cawkeye fiasco. And then that bloodbath fiasco of a debate a couple nights ago in Nevada. So, it is clear to everybody. It's clear to everybody in the left, Trump will almost certainly be reelected. Bloomberg has blown it. Crazy Bernie is just so unacceptable to everybody in the Democrat party except most to their voters. The voters love the guy. The party establishment hates the guy. But he scored the big fundraising take after that debate. I told you people, I warned you do not laugh at what Crazy Bernie is saying because there are Democrats across this country lapping it up and they said him record amounts of money. Well, not record. But the most amounts of money considering all the other candidates and what they raised. So now it's time for the media. Start claiming the Russians are going to meddle in the election in 2020 because that's part of what the impeachment fiasco was all about. And I predicted all of it. I did not, I'm going to be honest, I didn't specifically predict that they would go back. And maybe I did. I didn't on January 22nd. I say so much and so much of it is so correct and so right that sometimes even when I think I'm wrong, I end up being right. So I probably did predict this. And just don't exactly remember. But here we are. Voila. The New York Times. The New York Times. In addition to rep there have done they've got an op-ed today written by the Taliban leader. They have given an op-ed section of their newspaper to the leader of the Taliban. And the reasoning is well, we're on the verge of a peace deal with the Taliban, the Trump administration, the verge of a peace deal. Why not? They have, I think they're not consuming their brains and along with this, their intelligence, their IQ, their EQ is melting. They're consuming themselves. So in addition to granting the Taliban space for an op-ed in the New York Times, they have a front page, front page column this morning dictated by Adam Schiff, I'm sure, that says intelligence officials have warned house lawmakers last week that Russia is interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get Trump reelected. Now this news is from last week, but Schiff and the New York Times are trotting it out now because they realize the Democrat party is imploding. There isn't anybody that can beat Trump. And so now it's time to start trying to taint the Trump campaign and have people finally turn against him. They have been trying for four years to get you who support Trump to turn against him. It's not going to work. There is a line of people as we speak in Las Vegas preparing to get into a Trump rally. It is a rare daytime Trump rally. They got drive by reporters going up and down that line asking people if Jesus Christ was running against Trump when you vote for Jesus or Trump and they're saying Trump, no matter who they are given as an opponent to Trump, Trump is being answered affirmatively by everybody to drive by his or talking to in that line in Las Vegas. So this effort, which has been going on, as I say for four years, to get Trump voters to abandon him, it isn't going to work. And does anybody really, but okay, you're Vladimir Putin. And you're surveying the Americans and you got Trump who is acing the chai comms on trade deals. He's acing the Mexicans. He's acing the Filipinos, the South Koreans, everybody. Trump is reordering American trade deals and making them much more favorable and fair to the United States. Trump has rebuilt the US military. It's stronger than it's been in years. That scares the hell out of Vladimir Putin. We're to believe that Vladimir Putin wants this guy reelected when it's possible to have somebody who honeymooned in Moscow as the president of the United States have we crazy Bernie. Anybody in their right mind would know that Vladimir Putin would much prefer crazy Bernie be president than another four years at Donald Trump. Who are they trying to? How stupid do they think we are? Crazy Bernie loves Moscow loves Havana loves communism and Putin wants Trump. And who was it? Somebody was on MSNBC. I'm not even gonna mention the names, but PMS NBC is now calling Trump a Putin agent because of this story. Trump is back to being a Russian spy. He's a traitor. He is a Russian agent. Here we have the audio sound by the media montage. This is after the disastrous debates audio sound like number two. The drivebys have gone back to Russia. Breaking news the New York Times now reporting that Russia is interfering in the presidential election to try to get President Trump reelected. Good morning America on this Friday morning new evidence Russia interfering in our elections again. Russia is interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected Russia trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential campaign in a bed to get President Trump reelected. Russia was already interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected. There's a report tonight, Russia backs Trump's reelection. Russia is trying to meddle in America's election. Russia is now interfering in the 2020 election. Vladimir Putin is at it again, trying to interfere in this year's presidential campaign. Listen, listen, listen, listen, it is actively working to get President Trump reelected. Listen, the president is a Russian operative and it is Vladimir Putin's greatest achievement. That's Lawrence O'Donnell, PMS NBC. And we know we had it on the side of my cookie snuck it in there. You know, I've got this MSNBC ban and cookie resents it because there's gold mine. She thinks on PMS NBC, but I don't want to promote those clowns. So she sneaks O'Donnell in here in the montage. I can't do anything about it, except call it out. But it's okay, because I told you he had said it. I just didn't mention the name. Now, folks, can I take you back to who are we talking about these intelligence agency people who are this is the deep state. These are the people that told us are weapons and mass destruction under rock. And you know my theory about this. And if you are new to the program and gods and gods, if you are, I have to we are we are setting records for website membership subscribers. I can't I can't thank you all enough. There are there are people tuning into this program every day that are listening for the first time. Let me repeat. Please indulge me if you are a long timer or a regular please indulge me on this. Let's go back to the Iraq war 2003. George W. spends a year and a half traveling the country preparing everybody lobbying the American people to support it. Goes to the United Nations has satellite photos all kinds of Colin Powell up there showing the photo supposedly of weapons and mass destruction installations in Iraq. Saddam Hussein and the European are allies in the intelligence community all support this. Now Bush as a Republican probably not popular with a deep state particularly after how he was elected. You know there was outrage the Florida recount in 2000. A lot of Democrats a lot of deep status think that Gore should have been president. He won the popular vote. They make the Supreme Court unfairly put Bush in there. I think there was as much resentment in the deep state. We just didn't call it that then for George W. Bush as there is today for Donald Trump and if not the same it's close. I think how could so many different intelligence agencies get something so wrong as weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and remember they gave Bush mounds of satellite photo evidence and documents. Documentation evidence Colin Powell was dispatched to the United Nations to present this evidence and it was all bogus because we went in there. It was the pretext for invading Iraq after 9 11. We get in there and there are no weapons of mass destruction. It was one of the most embarrassing things the Bush administration had to scramble everybody had to scramble. What I have seen this bunch of people in the intelligence community capable what they've tried with Trump here this whole Russia meddling Trump colluding this whole thing is a gigantic lie a totally bogus hoax a silent coup. That's when I began to think the weapons of mass destruction thing was a set up against Bush too. My point is this. Why should we believe these people they haven't been right about anything in the last four years they were wrong about weapons of mass destruction. They didn't get Benghazi right. Why should we believe them? We shouldn't. It is a continuation of an insane mindset that the deep state of Democrat party are are in because they can't find a way to defeat this guy. They can't they're they're they're almost insane with their inability to land a punch on Donald Trump. They don't understand it. They have deployed every weapon they have to destroy political opponents and it's worked most every time they've tried it on whoever they wanted to damage or get rid of but they can't even land a glancing blow on Trump. So now after the Mueller report says there was no collusion. What are we back to? Trump is a Russian agent. The Russians want Trump to get reelected. We just had a four year quasi phony investigation when there was no evidence the only thing was a fake dossier. There were lies to the FISA court to get warrants to spy on Trump. They couldn't even make up any evidence that would stick. And yet here we are. We're going to recycle this whole thing that Trump is the chosen one of Vladimir Putin. And there's nothing we can do to stop it, by the way. The Democrats get despite knowing who is behind meddling in our elections and Democrats can't find a way to stop it. Trump's going to win. So we have to tame it. The Russians are meddling in our elections. These people are doing more damage to the integrity and the honor of the American election system of Vladimir Putin would ever dream of being succeed successful at. And they're making themselves look like abject fools in the process. Yes. So right on time here comes the New York Times publishing their piece. And I'm going to tell you what, folks, remember yesterday how the drive by media was just absorbed with the Roger Stone sentence, the Roger Stone sentence, something so irrelevant and untied to anything serious. And yet they're glued to it. They have the reporters and their reporter at and their info babes outside inside the courtroom. The sentence is announced. They're hoping for seven to nine years it comes back three years and four months. They're devastated. They're disappointed. But I'm telling you, they covered that stone sentencing so closely because they think they think it gives them a chance to prove Trump is guilty of colluding with the Russians. Even though stone was not charged with anything to do with colluding with the Russians, they still think the stone sentence gave them an opportunity to make this case. And I believe that they all knew this New York Times story was coming because that news is from last week when the House Democrats, the intelligence committee were told about the Russians hoping that Trump gets elected working to make it happen. That's old news. It's from last week they held it for the day after the stone sentence. They don't realize how transparent they are. Anyway, folks, this, I hope you're taking time to save it is rather than get mad at it. I hope you're taking time to enjoy this because you are watching the literal implosion and the self commission to insanity of a major political party in this country, the Democrats, greetings and welcome back. Listen to this. This is John. Oh, by the way, this intelligence agent, these are the people that believed the steel dossier. If they actually did, these are the people that did not even predict the collapse of the Soviet Union. They never saw the collapse of the Berlin wall. They were stunned when it happened. These people, I hate to say this, but the element of the intelligence community that we are being treated to in the New York Times, whoever these nameless, famous, faceless people are, they haven't been right about a lot in a long time. And I think that's part of what's going on here. But here, listen to John King, this just moments ago, on inside politics on CNN, Putin is not running some operation with Donald Trump. That was not the substance of the briefing. Nobody was saying Trump was colluding with Russia again. They were saying Russia is interfering in the election today, and it is their intelligence conclusion based on a lot of intelligence that Russia has a preference for President Trump. Well, nobody was saying Trump was colluding with Russia again. So you're admitting that that was the original charge that Trump was colluding with Russia, but now Trump isn't colluding with Russia. Nobody saying that. Putin's not running some operation with Trump. No, what's happening is that the US intelligence community conclusion based on a lot of intelligence is that Russia has a preference for Trump. Mr. King, you know that I respect you among few at CNN. But this, this is, it's so obvious what you're trying to do here. This is a difference without a difference. There's, there's too much suddenly here. This story, as reported by the New York Times, people aren't going to draw to this nation. You report that Putin prefers Trump coming off of three years of reporting that Trump and Putin colluded. What do you think people are going to conclude? And this is your problem because you haven't proved it. You people who have been alleging this for three years have no evidence, no proof whatsoever. And yet you're going back Putin still prefers Trump. That won't even stand a smell test when you got somebody like crazy Bernie who loves the Soviet Union and Russia running for the presidency. Now I look, I have a theory, folks, I want to share with you Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. They're not letting this go. Then now there as much as we think it's asinine and silly and stupid, they are not letting go of it. The driveby's, the deep state, the Democrats, they are not letting go of it. And I think that it obviously seemed at one group, it's aimed at one group of people, Democrats. Now you might think, well, of course, Rush, no, because some people think that this actually is an attempt to reach Trump voters, a relentless, unstoppable attempt to reach Trump voters and distance Trump voters from his voters, you know, make them abandon him. But I don't think that's what this is. I think they have concluded they can't do that. The Democrats are the only people who believe this crap in the first place. It's the most astounding thing. But I'm sure you know Democrats to this day, despite no collusion, despite the fakery of the steel dossier, I'm sure you know Democrats who believe every syllable of this, even though it's impossible. So the left establishment sees, I'll tell you what's happening out there. You know, Brad Parscale, who is a campaign manager for the Trumpster, that every rally, they count everybody there. They count people in line. They count people who apply for tickets. They count people who get in. And in fact, you know, I need a call. Let me give you the latest data because a powerful info. And remember the media, I get this data. So I want to print this out. I'm gonna send the Colorado rally data that was sent to me by Parscale. He sends it to a bunch of people too. But I'll listen to this. I have it right here. My formerly nicotine stain fingers right off the printer, which actually worked quickly today. Here is the Colorado data collected by the Trump re-election campaign 71,984 tickets of the 700 or 71,000. Let's call it 72,000 of the 72,000 tickets. About 39,000 of these people were voters. 94% of them from Colorado. Now the big news there is, you've got 72,000 tickets, only 39,000 were voters. The others are not voters, but could be. This is scaring the hell out of the Democrats. This is my point. Of the 72,000 tickets and of the 39,000 voters identified 19% did not vote in 2016. They calculated the numbers 7,286 attendees did not vote in 2016, but are planning on voting this year. And here is the thing scaring the heck out of the 17%. The people that showed up at this rally are Democrats. And that number is pretty consistent at every Trump rally. 17 to 20% of the people showing up are Democrats. And the Democrats know this. They are scared to death of an actual movement of Democrat voters toward Trump. They are scared to death of African American Democrat voters to Trump. They have to stop that momentum. And that's what this Russia business is. They're throwing this crap out, hoping it sticks on Democrat walls, because they are the only people that believe it. Trump voters don't believe it. You can't make them believe it. Independence don't believe it. You know who believes this stuff? Educated college, educated suburban Democrats believe this crap. College educated suburban Democrats believe this Russia business. And that's what the Democrats are trying to protect because that there is a significant movement of Democrat voters to Trump as evidenced by a lot of polling and survey data and what's happening at these rallies. And these numbers that I just gave you out of Colorado are pretty consistent. Rally to rally to rally. So this is a defensive move. The Democrats in their establishment have got to do something to stop this erosion. And I think that's why there was some original hope for Bloomberg. Because the way the Democrats look, Bloomberg is just another Trump. He's a rich guy. He's from New York, but he's not another Trump. He can't hold a candle to Trump when it comes to heart, humanity, empathy, personality, connectivity. Bloomberg can't connect with anybody. He doesn't even want to connect with anybody in terms of having a connection with your voters or a connection with your audience or a bond. He couldn't care less about that. And he and as such, he and Brian, get ready to put this picture up. Let me show this. This is, this is I've been trying to tell you how unique Trump is and how unstoppable and how the Democrats don't have anybody like him for a host reasons among them. The Democrats don't have anybody makes you laugh with them. You laugh at them. They don't have anybody that sends a humor. Trump at his rally was holding a little baby. Somebody put a baby, somebody put a baby dressed up in a suit and a meme developed on Twitter, you know, they can do deep fake videos. So look, look what happened. There it is in the ditto cam. Somebody put a picture of Bloomberg's head on that baby and try to video that's a still shot. And Trump is walking around the stage holding the baby. And the video has Bloomberg, so many Mike, little baby Trump carrying him around while making caustic comments, humorous comments about him. This is the kind of stuff Bloomberg cannot respond to. He can't come back from it. He can't stop it from having an impact on people. All he can do is try to buy site. You know what Bloomberg's doing? Have you heard about this? Bloomberg is paying people $2,500 to go on social media and say wonderful, great things about him. Further proving that social media is corrupt and can be bought and things there aren't real. So this is what I think this Russia thing is all about. It's really an effort to stop the erosion of Democrat voters over to Trump. Now I got a couple more sound bites about this, but what would this whole thing be without the lead corrupting agent in this whole thing? Obama's former CIA director, John Brennan. He was the ringleader. Brennan was the he was the link between the Brits and their efforts to implant spies in the Trump campaign. He was the link because he was no longer in office. He was in Obama left and he was not the CIA director, but he still knew all the people. So the Brits and whatever they learned, funnel everything to Brennan, who then funneled it to the FBI, that closed the loop. And that's how they kept things coordinated. Brennan was on MSNBC today right on schedule to help promote this silly Russians want Trump business. The question he got is what is your message to your former colleagues in the intelligence community who were still fighting the fight inside the intelligence services carry out those responsibilities that you swore in oath to do because they have that very solemn responsibility, whether you're intelligence or in a diplomat or in law enforcement, you need to carry out your responsibilities. I would tell them not to go to the door, not to leave continue to do their work the best they can. This country needs a lot FBI agents and CIA officers and diplomats around the world. And Donald Trump is a very painful phase that we're going through right now. But we will get through this. So I encourage people who are currently in the government to stay there, do the best they can and push back. There's it's a pep talk. It's a pep talk to the deep state because they are at their within. Truth be told, they have got to be feeling powerless. All these ambassadors, Lieutenant Colonel Venman. Oh, say can you see show up and testify. They essentially get fired, reassigned. They're out of the mainstream now. They got to be beside themselves. So here's Brennan, give them an old pep talk, hanging their budge, keep working, we'll find a way to prevail. And we got one more James Clapper partner in crime with Comey and Brennan and Obama in an original attempt to set Trump up in a in a Trump tower Trump office meeting on January 6, 2017 before Trump was inaugurated. If you want, I'll tell the story. It's it's old hat by now. Question he was on CNN and Don Lemon last night question. Now we know the president was angry with the acting director, national intelligence, Joseph Maguire over this briefing about Russia, wanting him to win in 2020. Trump didn't want to hear that. So what's going on? Clapper. Come as a shock to anybody that the Russians are going to continue to do what they did in 2016, given the success. Stop the tape. The problem. You haven't proven what they did in 2016. What did they do in 20? Say you haven't proven they did anything. This is the thing that really bugs me about this folks. They keep acting like even though they're heading in a shred of evidence for anything other than the maybe the Democrats hacked their the Russians hacked the Democrat computers. What did the Russians do? Nobody's ever told us is like what did Nixon do? What do you really do? What did the Russians really do? Is so many of some of the Russians meddled in the election? Yeah, how? Everything they've said that the Russians did in meddling with the election to get Trump elected. There's not a shred of evidence for and nobody has found it. So what the hell is clapper talking about here? Well, all clapper is doing is the same thing everybody else is doing it trying to keep Democrats armed and and see. But I shouldn't come as a shock to anybody or Russians continue to do what they did 2016 given the success. What success? What success? You mean you couldn't stop them? The CIA couldn't stop. You knew what they were doing and you couldn't stop them clapper. You're the director of national intelligence and you and Obama, you knew what they were doing and you couldn't say besides Obama was telling everybody it was impossible to tamper with the US presidential election. And yet here you guys are out still trying to make the case make people believe is what happened. You couldn't stop the Russians. What does that say about you clapper would say about brain you couldn't stop them? You knew what they were doing you couldn't stop them and now we can't stop them. We're going to do it again and there's nothing anybody can do about it. You people are so sad it is beyond my ability almost to describe it again back in a second here. The immediately baseball exhibition season kicks off today with a cold front moving through Florida. What a great day yesterday. You know, the feel like temperature yesterday was 90 degrees when the program ended. Right now the feel like temperature is 63. That's chilly for us wimps who get used to the heat and humidity here. It's actually 70 degrees out there but the feel like a 63. The reason I bring this up is I got a you know I also also get open line Friday questions in the email and I got one here from our old buddy Seton Motley. As you are an ex-can city Royals executive I'd like to hear your thoughts on the Houston Astros. The cheating scandal if you have already discussed this and I missed it I sincerely apologize I have not discussed the cheating scandal Houston Astros. By the way not all teams start exhibitions like the Cardinals and the Mets start tomorrow but many major league teams start the exhibition season. Used to not be till March 12th that the exhibition games began but everything's been moved up. So make a note Snerdly remind me Astros cheating scandal sometime before the end of the program. I want to get started on the phones. Kevin in Brick New Jersey you're up first and they are great to have you. Hi. Hi Rush. I was in mega prayers. Thank you. Thank you sir very much. Yeah I'm yeah so basically I'm you know 25 years old I've listened to Houston so I was 13 years old. I've been listening to you religiously. I'm a brush 24 seven member. I never miss a show even when I was in high school and college and all that. And my question is I think you always joke about the Rush Limbaugh broadcast museum but you know I think that really should be a reality that you know in 50 years from now I want to be able to you know show my kids and grandkids you know all these episodes all these Rush Limbaugh shows. I think this should be an online website that stays up for eternity that you know has all your shows and all the deal campers and everything because you are a national treasure Rush and you have no idea what you mean to us. I think I think your shows need to be out there for eternity. So I mean that that's my open line for other questions. Now I've been trying for you and you know you have no idea what I do you mean to me to us. I'll tell you I mentioned yes it's very risky to acknowledge this and I'm not I'm not going to say anything right now other than but I actually believe because I believe that all of these prayers are having a positive impact that and I I just I can't thank people enough and a positive impact and attitude is clearly much more preferable than the opposite of that than pessimism and defeatism there's none of that in this. I couldn't be with so much support people like you would be impossible to be pessimistic and that's that's a testament to all of you plus it's my natural makeup anyway. Now as to your as to your observation even now there's some of the some of the early programs late 80s early 90s that are not videoed there was no ditto cam the but the Rush TV show is in the process of being digitized and made available and all of the old audio analog tapes of the early radio we're trying to collect all of it to do exactly exactly what you have said you would like and that is a library that will exist until the end of time that will document every moment of this program every moment that we have saved and recorded even now if you if you join and this is not a sales pitch but if you if you become a member at Rush Limbaugh.com you already even you know what even if you don't join you even if you just go to the free side there is an encyclopedic amount of content of past programs transcripts that you can read it's when you become a member that you get the audio and the video of all these things and we've got a great great start because of the existence of the website on creating that library but no you I'm very flattered that you're even thinking about such a thing but it is in the process of being prepared and organized and even more than that so I'm very excited about it in fact and I'm very glad that you mentioned it like I'm out of time for the hour got to take a break thank you again Kevin very much be right back folks you know about the Astros cheating scandal you remember Bobby Thompson's home run 1951 the year I was born the shot heard round you remember that well get guess what Bobby Thompson had the sign he knew what Ralph Branca was gonna throw cheating in baseball sign stealing is as standard as quarterbacks throwing touchdowns in the NFL it ain't that big a deal yeah greetings to you music lovers thrill seekers and conversational across the conversational this all across the fruited plan I am Rush Limbaugh America's real anchor man America's truth detector and the doctor of democracy on Friday live from a southern command in sunny South Florida it's open line Friday yes sir Ray whatever you want to talk about is perfectly fine the telephone number 800-282-82 an email address hello Rushmore and EIB net dot us look let me I need to make a major correction when I said signs stealing I eat cheating in baseball is no big deal I misspoke what I meant to say it's not unusual it is a big deal from a moral and and a fairness standpoint it is a big deal I don't want anybody to believe it I think cheating is okay that's not not the point but it's not unusual the Astros just took it to a new level now I found out something in the past year that I didn't know about all this 1951 was the year I was born it was born January 51 when I was 10 months old there was a huge baseball game between the New York Giants and a Brooklyn Dodgers and in that season they had a three game playoff to determine the winner of the nationally penant that year the Dodgers had something like a 13 game lead Brian with six weeks left in the season and the Giants ended up winning the pennant from the Dodgers overcoming those 13 games or 12 whatever it was the culmination was Bobby Thompson's home run 1951 Ralph Branca on the mound and for the Dodgers Bobby Thompson shot her it's at the polar grounds and it was shot her around the world and everybody think it was just magical it was the culmination of one of greatest comebacks um in major league history well guess what guess what out in center field the signs were being stolen the uh telescope or binoculars or something and interestingly enough it was a buzzer system from the employee in center field letting the dugout know what the pitch that had been called by the catcher was and they found a way to inform the hitter and apparently everybody knew it everybody knew this was going on after the fact Ralph Branca who gave up the home run pitch to Bobby Thompson Thompson knew it and in interviews about this in in years and years after the game and after the event nobody would deny it I didn't know any of this until a year ago when his astro stuff bubbled up and all kinds of history about sign stealing and baseball began to resurface there were comments like yeah Branca knew that Thompson was sitting on the pitch take a look at the film take it well it was filmed take a look Bobby Thompson he jumped on that pitch he knew what was coming and nobody has denied it and Branca made a lot of money on the speaking circuit for years as the guy who gave up the shot heard around the world now and there was a recent story about this I think in the New York Post and maybe our eagle eye website people go out and search it and then put the link at russianumba.com so you can read it for yourself the story in the post backs up stuff I learned a year ago and makes it sound like it was commonplace and everybody knew it stealing signs in baseball can I can I tell you a little story I'll try to make this brief a second when I worked for the Kansas City Royals handheld video cameras cam quarters were just hitting the market and it was commonplace for a team employee to be in a dugout with where the media cameras were in the dugout to videotape your own players at bat for later study and I was the guy assigned to do this because I was the high tech wizard wherever I've been I've been the high tech wizard so I'm in the dugout the Royals but a dugout at the time first baseline so I'm at about first base in the in the section of the dugout where all of the photographers for the media are and I'm aiming the camcorder at the plate for right handed hitters because that's a full front on view of the right hand hitter the swing and so forth well the camcorder had a blinking red light when it was operating and I forget who we were playing but the opposing manager who was in the third base dugout and could see the blinking light on the camcorder called timeout stormed out to the umpire demanded to know he thought that we were sending signals he thought that that blinking red light on the camcorder was a was a way of sending signals to the hitter he thought his pitcher signs are being stolen it was a 10-minute conversation out there I think Dick Houser was the manager for the Royals at the time and I'm watching this and I'm not knowing that this conversation is about me and then all of a sudden the opposing manager turns and points at the section dugout that I'm in I still don't get what's going on it goes 10 minutes and the game's paused and nobody's been thrown out it's a heated argument between the opposing manager I don't even remember who royals were playing and finally I had to leave I had to stop had to stop videotaping because they couldn't we the houzer and our guys could not convince the opposing man it's just a video cam or videotaping our own guys he's I don't like it your videotaping who knows you could be aiming at our dugout you could be stealing whatever my point in telling you the story and later when I found out what it was I was kind of no idea that I was the subject well what I was doing was the subject of this heated conversation at home plate but I bring this up only because the the idea that stealing signs is somehow unique and outrageous is really not true it's an art sign stealing has become an art in baseball you get a runner on second base who you know that that's that's when the catcher's do everything they can to hide the signals they are sending to the pitcher for what pitch they want thrown oftentimes the manager in the dugout is calling the pitch he's sending a signal to somebody that's pitcher gets and the catcher gets and so forth it's a now what the Astros were doing as best I can understand is are you ready for this the Astros had all kinds of intricate ways of stealing signs meaning the pitch that was coming they had people in the dugout pounding on the trash can to send signals to the hitter I don't know what the signals were but and I don't know how long this went on but how somebody didn't figure out pounding on the trash can and dug out the send signals it's not normal to pound on a trash can so then the Astros tried something else supposedly supposedly players like Jose Altuve were wearing buzzers taped inside their jerseys and the buzzers would buzz with a code to tell them what the pitch that was coming was based on however the Astros were stealing it the evidence for this is that in a in a playoff game Altuve hits a home run he rounds third base on the way to be mobbed by his teammates at home plate and he is holding onto his jersey with his life making sure nobody rips it off and the theory is he was doing this to hide the buzzer that he was wearing now I think that the Astros because they have been so accused here and apparently I mean they're their their owner has gotten involved and there's obviously been some truth established I think you know there were there were some people calling the Astros should give up their World Series victories give up the trophy it was tainted it was it was obtained by cheating and so forth maybe their World Series share should be taken away from the players this is going to be something they're never going to live down if the Astros play clean and pure as the wind driven snow for the next 10 years it's still going to be suspected that every odd victory they have is going to be the result they're never going to live it down and Altuve is not going to be able to live it down it's it's it's it's it's going to stick with them but it's not sign stealing is not uncommon it's just the Astros apparently took it to a high-tech level and now you've got players for the Yankees who lost to the Astros in the play of I've had my whole career cheated and I'm never going to get over it and I think I think get over it bud but it has had a it had it's had a dramatic impact and of course it comes after all of the performance enhancing drugs and the steroids and the stuff that was going on in baseball all of which has just served to ramp up attendance Major League Baseball attendance has seen it in a TV ratings not so much but at least not on a par with the NFL but that's what I think of it and I'm I'm who's worse the Astros are the Patriots you're asking well see that's a New York question who's worse the Astros the Patriots are never going to live that down never ever going to live down the video Spygate anyway let me take a brief time out rather than rather make a transition not to a serious deathly political issue we'll take a brief time out going to obscene profit break and we will return and right after this don't go away folks let me just tell you something folks I think lying to the FISA court is far graver a far more grave example of cheating than his baseball sign stealing stuff lying to the FISA court spying on political opponent everything you want to talk about cheating you want to talk about stealing signs you want to talk about voter fraud you want to but any number of things whatever has been going on the past four years aimed at Donald Trump pales that the baseball stuff pales in comparison to this now I have here a New York Post story this is not the one I was references there's a a column that was just in the past week or so but the story I have here from New York Post is from July 29 2002 this is 18 years ago the mystique of the miracle of Kugans Bluff the polo ground center field had been taking a beating in the past year thanks to a bombshell revelation in a Wall Street Journal that fleshed out decades of rumors that the giant used an elaborate scheme to steal catchers signs at the polo grounds since the Wall Street Journal story broke denial and evasiveness from the 1951 Giants have been replaced by pride when the story in the journal first ran they all denied it but later on when they saw the reaction to it they claimed credit to it with great pride because it was such a clever thing to have pulled off everybody was stealing signs I don't know anything about our club doing it said 88 year old Herman Franks but it was Herman Franks with a military field scope who ran the giant sign stealing operation from the team clubhouse in center field of the old polo grounds now this story claims that Bobby Thompson clavie didn't know what pitch Branca was going to throw but there are more recent stories than this that indicate Thompson okay back to the phones we go Val prizo Indiana this is Marv I'm glad you waited sir great to have you here with us hello Hi Rush Marv a longtime listener first time caller from Valparaiso which is a suburb of Chicago on Lake Michigan thank you sir and having been born in February of 1951 I'm one month younger than you but I have vivid memories of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago and oh yeah was in the street so my question to you sir is if the Democrats end up with a brokered convention in Milwaukee and they go to a second or third ballot and the super delegates kick in do you think we might be in store for a similar situation with Bernie's supporters well able to wrestle it away from it's it's really tough to sit here and predict riots but if you want to I mean if you if you want to discuss specific scenarios I can see Bernie supporters go and nuts if it if he's got the lead in delegates and if there is some kind of brokered convention that that that Bloomberg is behind and he is behind a movement to actually create the circumstances for brokered convention if Bernie's voters get because they know they got sandbagged in 2016 they know Hillary cheated and the DNC cheated and they know that that Bernie was bought off Bernie's Bernie's house on the cabin was in a circuitous way purchased by the Clintons Bernie can be bought folks this is what his voters got to be really worried about Bernie's not a fighter who care what anybody says he's not a fighter and he can be bought and is what Bloomberg knows and but Bernie's voters are true believers he collected more money in fundraising after that debate than any of the other candidates you know we sit here and I told you we said we laugh at this guy we call him crazy Bernie but there's an element of a Democrat party that literally adores and loves this guy and yeah I can see where they might not remain peaceful at a convention where they believe that the nomination is being stolen from them and from and from from crazy Bernie and as the program unfolds I'll get into the details here of how they are how Bloomberg is trying to set up a a brokered convention I mean what are the Democrats looking for when I mean you boiled it all down and you you put yourself in the real world the real world of the United States today as our country exists the Democrats are looking for a candidate who can save us from full employment and rising wages the Democrats are looking for a candidate who can change that the Democrats are looking for a candidate who can return us to unemployment and flat wages and every one of their candidates can do it that's the scary thing every Democrat candidate running knows how to slow down the u.s. economy and cost it jobs but which of those candidates this is the question I'm telling you every Democrat candidate running has policies that will wreck this economy lose jobs and cause wages to stagnate the question is which of those candidates can excite a majority of voters who will make America suck again that's what the Democrat candidates challenge is to motivate enough voters who want America to suck again so that there are problems to solve so that there are grievances so that there are victims so that there are people who have to turn to government rather than themselves Trump cheer leads what look at the Trump rally Trump cheer leads a positive movement of doers and makers Bernie is the is the natural leader of angry takers trump doesn't have any takers he has makers in he has doers but what are Bernie's people angry about what is there to be angry about in the United States today oh I mean you could come up with things I don't know we don't have a paradise understand that there never is a paradise but the Democrats are trying to make people mad they're trying to convince people that what's going on now somehow isn't real isn't deserved this needs to change we need more people out of work we need more people losing income we need more people being discriminated against we need more rotten trade deals this is what the Democrats are selling the question is are there enough voters to actually want to get behind that kind of thing they're angry about progress progress equals what climate change destroying the planet and the environment they're angry about self-reliance self-sufficiency they're angry that Obama failed you know there's a lot of Democrats really ticked off that Obama has endorsed the Trump economy by claiming credit for it oh you talk about a sellout they're angry that Hillary failed they're angry that Robert Mueller the third failed or angry that they're co-failed they're angry that their sham impeachment failed you got a party of angry destructive haters and the question is is there a Democrat candidate can mobilize enough of these haters to actually win an election that's what we're up against out there folks all right a brief time out it's open line Friday and as I said talk about whatever it is that's on your mind we'll come back and resume people on the phones before you know it don't go away all right I found that New York Post piece I was talking about I had people saying that wasn't in the New York Post it was a washing and post piece no it wasn't I mean I that that that the Washington Post piece has elements what I read it was a Mike Vakaro column in the New York Post and the headline Jose Altuve will have to wear this forever but the column has the story I told you about the polar grounds the Dodgers Giants 1951 shot heard around the world sign stealing Thompson knew what Branca was throwing so we're gonna link to that at rush limbo.com so that you can read it for yourself try try the YouTube of Democrats what what did I just say the Democrat Party is looking for a candidate who can lose jobs who can cause wages to stagnate James Clyburn everybody you know South Carolina a former chairman of congressional black Caucasians everybody wants the Clyburn endorsement going into the South Carolina primary plugs claims that he's going to get it we don't know who's going to get the Clyburn endorsement but we really hear this James Clyburn congressional black Caucasians dismisses record black employment in America today he was on a fax biddness network on Tuesday he dismissed record law black unemployment under Trump staving well we were fully employed during slavery too so this doesn't carry any weight with me folks is that reasonable is that logical is that even sane I mean what what what what kind of anger or partisanship must you be simmering with or effervescing almost a boil over with here are your people African Americans having one of the most record economic periods in their lives more economic opportunity more jobs being held record low unemployment African Americans and he dismisses it well we had higher employment than this deck during slavery this doesn't impress me this came it was Neil Cavuto who trumps having some problems with now I gather Neil Cavuto said to wait a minute let me check here I just I'll see if we might have this on the soundbite rostrad isn't I don't know that we do but if we do doesn't matter um the question was wait a minute somebody just sending me a always yesterday we didn't get to it my bad anyway here it is he's delivered to goods for a lot of African Americans does he not with record low unemployment levels you don't think that's something constructive and Clyburn said I'm saying at the African American unemployment is not the lowest it's ever been unless you count slavery we were fully employed during slavery so it all depends how you measure this okay um then a companion story Tim Scott African American senator South Carolina predicting Trump could get 15 percent of the African American vote in 2020 if that happens that that alone is going to be an earthquake inside the Democrat party here's uh Marie in Dayton, Ohio glad you waited and welcome to the program hi hi thank you for having me um I'm praying for you hope you get better yeah this is I'm a first-time caller and I just wanted to say that I I am not a victim I am a minority I don't believe in victimhood but racism does exist and it comes from the Democratic Party a lot of people miss this and um and look at the Warren said during the debate that she said that we need to pay people more so we can pay the black and brown people who do this work when she was referring to child care work right and what that tells me is that she believes that black and brown people are the ones that do that work when there's white people that do honorable and good work of child care but brown and black people are also entrepreneurs and it's our persistence and our perseverance and our belief in the strong work ethic and our belief in American dream that helps us overcome and become business owners and I myself I mean I I was fired from my company and I bought the company that fired me two years later but it wasn't because wait just a minute you know you just can't flash that bias you were fired by a company and you bought it two years later how did you do that um well it was a fluke I never thought I'd be CEO of the company I was selling medical diagnostic equipment to diagnose dizziness concussion and traumatic brain injuries and I was fired because they said uh ironically they said I'm making too much money because I'm not educated I'm not a doctor and doctors should be selling to doctors I shouldn't be making that kind of money I was straight commission and so they fired me and at that time I was a single mom with four kids minority but I didn't say I'm a victim or it's a it's a crime from the white man no I went out and I worked and I worked my butt off and then I started another company and I earned enough money that when they found out how well I was doing they called and they said hey are you interested in investing and I said interested investing well let me take a look at the book so your your point is your point you're a minority business owner you have actually my nerd yeah you've actually purchased a company that fired you and and but you still think the democrats still think that you're too stupid to do anything but meanie you'll work exactly and that's what they say if you listen to the debate you listen to everything they say they think you're too stupid you need the government to help you because they exactly because they pander to you that's exactly you said it she said it not if she's a minority businesswoman she said it that's exactly how the democrat party looks at minorities as in capable you know what the biggest problem is the soft bigotry of low expectations and that's what the democrat party and the american left does to minorities one of the worst things if you're a parent and you have kids one of the worst things you can do is have low expectations of them and tell them that if you expect great things from them that's motivating and it can become self-fulfilling but if you have low expectations and it's exactly the democrats are built on that philosophy the soft bigotry of low expectations you can't do much you can't do it on your own you can't do it without us but it's not just minorities that the democrats treat that way it's a whole lot of their voter base it's how they look that that's the preferred constituency people who just can't do much on their own and it's obvious here for me she's offended as hell by that and I given what she's done I totally understand I'm glad you called thank you so much this is Gary in Phoenix your next welcome to the EIB network hello mr. Limba what a pleasure to talk to you thank you sir greeting greetings from a fellow mazurian I am a nurse I'm a registered nurse and god was very good to me he gave me the gift of compassion and empathy and that's why I enjoyed my job so much and that's why I think I did very well at it my question for you is you say quite often I have talent on loan from god and I'm wondering what do you feel your talent is and what is the gift that god gave you that allowed you to become the person you are today okay that might require because you sound like you're serious in the way you're not uh you're not uh flippant about this you actually oh no no I think god gives us gifts and he allows us to use them for his benefit and it it's really wonderful when you can use them well I look good it you know you've done that don't know what the talent is yeah well yeah I'm gonna try to answer then then don't misunderstand but there's there are a lot of answers to this uh this last call that we just had I knew what she was saying even though she didn't say it time was running out I had this so you what you were saying yes she said exactly even though she had never said that yet my ability to understand what people are saying and then if they are having trouble communicating it to find a way very straightforward and simply to explain it uh which needs to the ability to take something very complex and make it understandable and that's how you feel you can look at the political uh landscape and all the things going on and analyze them and well that's that's one but you talk about gifts from god there's another one of the greatest gift from god is that I don't think I'm better than anybody and I assume that everybody in this audience can understand anything I explain to them so there's no condescension you know when when I when I go play golf someplace you know I have a better time I have more relatability when the people at work at the place than the other members and Donald Trump is the same way Donald Trump has as as more of an ability to identify with the people who make things work than with the people who benefit from those people making things work I mean he can relate to both groups but I think it's uh it's it's either a gift from my parents the way I was raised not to think that I am better than anybody and not to look down and condescend to people and to assume that everybody is as smart as I am uh then there are broadcasting skills and talents such as timing that can't be taught they can only be learned by doing and and some people naturally uh a lot a lot of talent you're born with champions are born not made as the slogan and that's applied primarily to athletes but even they have to work very hard at perfecting what they're naturally good at empathy you mentioned that is a fundamental characteristic to succeeding with this because if if there isn't a bond that is created between say me and host and the host in the audience if I'm just somebody sitting here talking to a bunch of faceless people in a megaphone and it'll work uh it's not going to sustain itself for very long it may work for a while uh and it's having the ability to look at this microphone and see millions of faces but treat them as one yes sir that's something I'm just naturally able to do without even thinking about it nobody had to teach it to me yes and I think that um I'm speaking for a lot of people we feel that rush you're a gift to us and we thank you for all you do and you continue to do well I appreciate look I I appreciate the question which is why I took it seriously a lot of people when they ask me that question are really saying so you think you're god huh and no uh that's the point of saying it's on loan because we're all going home someday and talent vanishes when that happens so it's just another way of thanking god for whatever abilities I have from wherever they came nothing more than that quick time out back with more after this stay with us yeah grab somebody number number 24 here is here's here's James Clyburn a congressional black Caucasians we had this yesterday but I didn't get a chance to get to it uh it was Tuesday night Fox uh with kavoodle question whether you like the president style or not or his tweets or comments he has delivered the goods for a lot of African-Americans has he not I mean his record low unemployment don't you think that's something that is constructive congressman Clyburn no no because it's not true you know it's not true I'm saying that the African-American unemployment is not the lowest it's ever been unless you count slavery we were fully employed doing slavery so it's all depends on how you measure this man oh man what what what kind of hatred and anger do you have to have flowing through your veins to have an answer like that to go back 200 plus years this is why these people the democrats this is why they cannot move forward is they this is a classic example of grievance victim politics and that they can't move on from it here's uh here's my consent sennady great to have you EIB network open line Friday hi hey rush god love you and long may you run in the words of Neil Young thank you thank you very much I appreciate that hey uh it's getting back to the Russian thing I think we're going to hear a lot about the Russian thing the Russian thing again obviously and I just think it's important for everybody to know that the Russians live in a real world the Russian people are great it's their it's their handlers that are horrible as we know they hate us they envy us and most of all though they fear us and that's why they want this is the point I'm trying to make that's why they really would like Trump to win because they know that America when we're economically healthy and even militarily healthy they're better off and so is the entire world if we don't if we have another 2008 2009 if we go into a depression the wheels are going to come off next time and then it's everybody on their own and if push comes to shove the Russians will lose against us 10 000 times to one so they don't love us they hate us they fear us but they know that well that way let me this is a unique theory that you have and I need to I need to query you about something sure the contra opinion of yours is that the Russians consider us an arch enemy and want us destabilized and weakened Putin is former KGB and once you're KGB you're always KGB nobody ever leaves the KGB and the KGB existed when the Soviet Union was ostensibly a superpower Russia isn't Putin wants it to become reconstant but he knows Putin wants the eastern bloc back unified as the Soviet Union was how would you answer somebody said wait a minute Putin wants us weakened he wants us destabilized he wants America with internal turmoil because it benefits him I would say this that even when they were the Soviet Union even when they had all their little pieces and parts together they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn rush we even back then they were I know that's true they've always been they were they were manufactured they were manufactured as superpower to create a number of other things the American people had to face but but there's so many people that think the Russians want to defeat us that the chikons want to weaken us destroy us as a superpower your point is the world can't afford for us to be destroyed because of our economy everybody needs it everybody feeds off of it and they do not want any real damage to the United States to occur they just want to be able to to play with us and not be dwarfed by us you nailed it Ross that's exactly my point we are the world's better off and even our enemies know it if we're healthy and we're doing okay with like you said earlier we're not this isn't heaven but we're better than everything else combined if we go wobbly if we get knocked back on our heels us i'm talking about the United States and we have an issue and that's what will happen if the burn if the burnies get in right you kiss everything goodbye there you go talent sun loaned from god okay michael bloomberg we'll talk about the democrat race in the upcoming final busy broadcast hour bloomberg the only democrat running for president with the guts and the money to overtake crazy bernie right now that that's going to be the starting point for the discussion in the next busy broadcast hour open line friday hang tough folks we will be back before you know it and welcome back it's such a delight to be with you each and every day here folks in the eib network at the limbo institute and it's friday live from a southern command in sunny south florida it's open line friday that's right one big exciting broadcast hour remains and the phone portion whenever we go to phones you can talk about whatever you want ask whatever you want doesn't have to be about politics issues what have you 800-282-2882 all right let's move on to the to the democrat race here trump by the way has a daytime rally today in las vegas the day before the democrat quark is is there and uh president trumps rally begins when do you think the rally starts mr snerdly three feet exactly right when this program ends the president will take the stage in las vegas people been lining up there's a lot of talk about bloomberg had a rotten debate you might think so yourself uh mayor peter says that did bloomberg on a dropout it's humiliating it was embarrassing you just sort of get out you don't know what he's doing a lot of people bloomberg going to get out now bloomberg may have had a bad debate but he doesn't have to worry about donors abandoning does he look at folkahodice has already gone back on a campaign promise she said she would not take pack money guess what she's doing she's taking pack money you know why because she doesn't have anybody donating to her and she's got one last gas pick this but bloomberg doesn't have any donors to worry about certainly enough to worry about any donors abandoning him so why would he drop out why would bloomberg drop out if he believes crazy bernie scares the hell out of establishment democrats and he does bloomberg knows that the establishment of the democrat party does not want crazy bernie they didn't want him in 2016 they don't want him now so if you're bloomberg you know how much he spent in january aloneness or snurtly 250 million 250 million and he doesn't have any delegates yet the thing bloomberg's worried about crazy bernie has a good super tuesday he could have an insurmountable delegate lead in all you can hope for is a brokered convention but if you're bloomberg why not stick around and see how things play out i mean if bernie look folks if bernie sanders misses a single campaign event people are going to wonder is he sick something gone wrong there's any number of things that can happen and none of them are predictable so if you're bloomberg and you have the willingness to spend every dollar you've got on this and you don't have to worry about donors abandoning you and if you know that the democrat establishment would much prefer you why not hang around now if the other democrats running for president figure out that they have to attack bernie instead of mini mic how will sanders handle that sanders did not handle bloomberg's attacks well who knows maybe the angry old communist routine gets old grab sound bite number 22 60 minutes did an interview with crazy bernie and here is an excerpt they've posted this as a promo for the entire segment on sunday nights anderson cooper said were you surprised by how unprepared bloomberg seemed for some very basic questions at the debate in the battle and you know and if that's what happened in a democratic debate you know i i think it's quite likely that trump will chew them up and spit them out you know we've never seen anything like this in american history and i just think though that the american people will rebel against this type of oligarchic movement we are a democracy one person one vote not a guy worth 60 billion buying an election don't don't uh crazy bernie on your side of the democrat party don't be so sure the democrat party is the party of the rich bernie this is it one of the one of the dirty little secrets that has resulted in an evolution in the democrat the billionaires the true obscene wealth in america today is held by people who say they are democrats oligarchs oligarchs as far as bernie is concerned but he thinks that trump will will chew bloomberg up and spit him out in a in a debate now there's a bloomberg memo out there warning that crazy bernie could be impossible to stop unless other candidates drop out of the race axios reported internal memo from the bloomberg campaign at warrens unless the other moderates drop out of the race bernie's going to win it memo was dated february 17 since the race stands today sander's is poised to leave super tuesday with an over 400 delegate lead versus his next closest competitor bloomberg a likely insurmountable advantage and so bloomberg is preparing to issue a demand all the other candidates to drop out here's the political story mike bloomberg privately lobbying democrat party officials and donors allied with his moderate opponents to flip their allegiance to him and block bernie sanders in the event of a brokord national convention would sanders emergence as the front runner democrats in those states have recently raised the prospect that democrat socialists could be a top of the ticket liability really that's not new so bloomberg is making a move now for a brokord convention he's making a move on getting uh people to abandon bernie he is paying who knows how many people twenty five hundred dollars to write positive things about him on social media as though they are spontaneous which is proving that social media is not real that it can be bought and that it can be corrupted and has been which you and i have known for many moons bloomberg's campaign manager says it may be there's not much campaign after super tuesday this is again another story that is related to the number of delegates crazy bernie's gonna have after super tuesday and bloomberg's own campaign manager concedes that bloomberg tanked in the debate is not sure that bloomberg will beat sanders on super tuesday maybe there's not much campaign in march after super tuesday could be crazy bernie wraps it all up so this is why i don't think bloomberg drops out he doesn't have any donors to lose he doesn't have any all he can do is just buy this time try to buy all these social media comments that praise him to the hilt and wine and dine the democrat party establishment in hope somehow that there is a brokered convention and right here we have it in the political bloomberg quietly plotting brokered convention's trajectory the effort is designed as a potential backstop to block crazy bernie by poaching supporters from joe biden and other moderates which makes me laugh because there aren't any moderates in the democrat party now some of you might well what about one of a mayor peter clobisher folks they're not moderates the democrat party doesn't have any moderates in it one of the things i've done for the entirety of the time i've been hosting this program has been to attempt to educate people ideologically how to spot liberalism and to believe that liberalism is nothing we want any part of it is a competing ideology but it is it has nothing in common and it's becoming even more extreme liberalism has now become as part of the democrat party socialism and communism there isn't any overlap you know this business about crossing the aisle finding common ground there isn't any when you have a an economy as solid as this is with wages really increasing in real terms for the first time in a couple of generations at least one generation and you want a political party wants no part of it a political party that doesn't even try to say they can do better a political party that wants to tear it all down what is the common ground with it what is the common ground with the people in that party they don't allow pro-lifers they don't allow they are now allowing abortion after birth where is the common ground now my my effort has been to get people to understand to spot liberalism in the moment you spot it to oppose it i think that would that's still one of the most direct roots to making liberalism a minority entity it's going to be a long slog and it may not be possible because liberalism is so seductive it's a gutless choice if the easiest choice in the world to be liberal because you don't have to do anything but say you care about x and that's it you see a couple starving people on the sidewalk and all you have to oh isn't that a horrible appeal to you? and you've got a big heart a minute you start trying to do something about it and that's that's that's not what you're supposed to do that's where conservatism comes in and conservatism seeks to teach people how to escape their own plight not teach people how to go on the lamb and stay in the plight that they're in which is what the democrats or what liberalism does so it's easy to be a liberal very tough to be a conservative because now you're talking about actual solutions rolling up slaves actually trying to reverse life circumstances for as many people as you can using their own talents and abilities that they don't think they've got jack camp had a line i loved it um liberals measure compassion by the number of people getting handouts conservatives measure compassion by the number of people who no longer need it so liberalism is always going to be seductive you have to care and that's all you have to do even if you don't and it's easy to fake caring and all yeah and you really the the the more odd or weird people are care about them oh that makes so great my point is that there aren't any significant there isn't a significant number of moderates in the democrat party anymore they wouldn't be having the troubles they're having and their front runner would not be and have out-communist if there were moderates in the democrat party that overwhelmed and out-numbered everybody else so bloomberg running around trying to find a way to get these moderates out of the way to coalesce behind him there aren't any clobish are may or p listen to them very carefully there are not moderates there they try to act as though they are with the way they speak or their mannerisms or the way they mask their policy statements or as bill gates would say policy but there aren't any moderates so bloomberg quietly plotting a brokered convention strategy is banking on the fact that the establishment of the democrat party is as opposed to crazy burning a day as it was four years ago and the belief is that they are because they believe crazy birdies going to get wiped out in a landslide like mcgovern and like to caucus but like i said the other day notice that crazy burning gets lumped in with what the democrats and media want you to figure outliers yeah to caucus and then uh mcgovern they were not outliers they were mainstream of the democrat party to caucus was a governor mr chucits mcgovern was a senator from the decoders they were not outliers they were not radical leftists they were the democrat party of the day and it hasn't changed any the crazy bernie is just a communist where those guys wouldn't admit they were but that's what the democrat party is so this idea that the establishment of the democrat party is worried that crazy bernie is going to take him down to tubes uh i i think we're being buffalode with that i think it's a uh uh uh a theory that sounds reasonable because it relies on people thinking that crazy bernie is an outlier is an exit he's not crazy bernie is the mainstream he's leading in donations in that debate he's the guy that got all the money after that debate got to take a quick break we'll be back and continue after this don't go away it's a good day David El Paso, Texas great to have you sir hi hi it is a real honor to get to talk to you again i've listened to you since i was 13 and now i've got my baby girl listening to you you really are uncle rush to me thank you sir i appreciate it very much every day thank you uh so what i was thinking about lately was i really think biden and buddajaj any other campaigns are done they have no chance at all um buddajaj just he experienced a fluke in aiowa i think he did good there because he's more well known to the uh to the local populace than the other candidates but biden i think he's been on a downward spiral since impeachment began at the early stages he was he was rude and abrasive to people thinking that maybe that's what endeared trump to everybody but he was rude to the wrong people did you hear what he said the other day he said the other day look in my second term if i'm losing my mind yeah god god forbid if i lose my mind you know i'll get out of there i'll have somebody who knows what to do and step in for me i said if you're losing your mind uh the guy he's he's like crazy burning 78 biden's gonna be 78 this year uh i i think you're but well we'll know but biden biden has got to win South Carolina and that means he's got to win the african-american vote if he doesn't it's over play taps oh yeah buddajaj agree buddajaj time is not this year he may have a a future down the road on it but yeah i i i don't think these guys could overcome crazy burning with their delegates by the way a verdict three or five counts is in on the wine steamed case we don't know what they are yet uh jury deliberations may be continuing but the the jury has reached a verdict in three of the five counts this is the rape slash sexual abuse trial of the man responsible for the me to movement harvey wine steamed miro max and then the wine steamed company and we'll see what uh what happens with this they've been trying to read the tea leaves based on the jurors and their questions for the judge asking for explanations of testimony some of the witnesses but you really don't know now the wine steamed has been doing his part been showing up at court in a walker uh showing up you know with little blue pills falling out of his pockets making it look like there's no way that he could possibly had sexual relations with anybody including himself uh so we'll see how much of the theatrics work will be well i'm sorry but that's what it looked like to me you know it sometimes it amazes me i just i just checked the email during the break what do you mean bloomberg is buying people commenting on social but why would i lie about it why in the world when you can easily go verify okay so i went here you go it is a news week story not admittedly news week something people used to read but as program host i have to consult as many sources i can you know show life is show prep folks it never ends bloomberg to pay hundreds of people twenty five hundred dollars a month to praise him on their personal social media feeds mike bloomberg's presidential campaign will reportedly pay hundreds of people twenty five hundred a month to promote the candidate via text message and their personal social media feeds the billionaires team is now hiring more than five hundred deputy digital organizers to work up to 30 hours a week to promote bloomberg to online friends and phone contact lists the wall street journal reported citing a staffer in california and internal documents so it could be bs i'm just telling it's in a wall street journal maybe even when the new york times prince lies we still report you know the russia stuff for example but now that you know that something like this could be possible that what does it make you think of social media it might make you believe it nothing on social media is real or very little is real back to the phones ellen in magnolia texas great to have you on the ei b network hi hey russia i'm honored to talk to you real quick i wanted to tell you sustain me through the years with all the ups and downs of the politics and of our country but my main point was is that i try to call you november levenson it's my birthday and i am very honored that my birthday is on better and stay and for my birthday i got one of your t-shirts and it was best gift i've gotten in a long long time i was so thrilled the uh... what were the bestie rots um yes it's a long sleeve women's t-shirt i love it oh those were so popular yes i love it now by the way thank you for that i need to explain this audience has a new tune-in factor each day it would boggle your mind so there people don't know what you're talking about so let me briefly explain this um i guess it was last summer nike was it last summer was it two thousand yet in 2019 man time is zipping by here so fourth of july nike announces a brand new set of sneakers that has the betsy rots the original flag 13 colonies united states on the rear heel the heel of the shoe and here comes colin capernig saying he doesn't like it he doesn't like the shoe he doesn't like the flag he doesn't like the design and like he said okay we'll cancel them we'll not sell them we'll put the shoes on the shelves this infuriated me infuriated a lot of people capernig said he was upset about cops and their abuse of minorities now he's upset at the country in the flag and here comes nike he doing his bidding so we gave people a way to push back with a charitable tie-in we created an entire line of apparel at the rush limbaugh dot com store featuring men and women's caps shirts golf shirts any number of things with the betsy ross flag and the tie-in was to tunnel the towers a charity that raises money for uh the uh surviving families of first responders and military people killed in action it was named after steven seller by his brother who was a firefighter killed first responder running back into the towers after 9-11 happened frank seller set it up well guess what the original t-shirt was a $27 item a classy it would be very very classy t-shirt but it was not cotton very unique very unique fabric we heard from the cotton pier cotton pier cotton pier what are these like t-shirts it's not cotton you got to get cotton so we added a cotton line of apparel and inside a three months folks at a $27 price point we had raised $5 million in profit that was donated to tunnel the towers i say we raised it you produced it you had us working around the clock to fulfill orders you had us working around the clock to get product you had you had our vendor in pencil vanya working around the clock to print and manufacture all the apparel it went on for months and months and months five million dollars on a 27 to 34 dollar price point there were some things more expensive it was it was unbelievable and it was it was not a profit pursuit for the russian blood.com store it was a it was a pure charitable pursuit gave people a way to push back against Nike and all of this anti-american anti-american flag stuff that made no sense it infuriated people that that's an incredible amount of money that's an incredible amount of sales divide five million by just say 35 bucks and see how many items had to be sold and fulfilled and delivered it was one of the most phenomenal things to be a part of and it happened all last summer from july 4th on through the end of the year she got hers on november 11th better mr day and she was just calling to tell me how much she enjoyed it and what it and it was folks we don't sell cheap stuff we don't stock cheap stuff everything in there is quality we find we find the best quality stuff at whatever price point we think is is good and fair but it was an incredible money and and the fact that you don't know about it unless I tell you unless you were part of it five million dollars and what's the news on me that i'm somehow anti-gay when it comes to mayor pite that i'm lecturing him on family values which i haven't done but we didn't do it for the publicity of it we did it for the charity and and the the the community spirit of it all and you guys you came through in well we hadn't seen anything like it and i don't think too many other people have i mean imagine that that much profit on a on a relatively moderately priced item to generate five million dollars in a period of of of what i guess it was three to four months you you just you came through like you always do and it was an honor to be part of it anyway that's what she was talking about and that's why it mattered quick phone call before the break this elizabeth in philadelphia great to have you on the eibn network hi hi hi there so not many people like mine last name trumps and since i was in pia near philadelphia and i went to san antoneotectif for a um a convention and we went to go get these name tags and they asked me what my name was and i said it and once they heard the trump part um these two ladies were like boy no way that's so cool that way way way to come in here you're you're young right i want to make i don't want to solve but you're you're a young how old are you 11 i knew it see talent on loan from god i knew from the sound of her voice folks that she was a young because you're 11 years old your name is trump and you live in philadelphia pennsylvania yeah and you are not treated with respect there because your last name is trumper when you went to texas everybody loved you is that basically the story yeah pretty much whether you thought about moving to texas yes well i'm so i'm so glad you called and tell me are you related to the president at all um i'm pretty sure somewhere like really really far back into the family tree yeah i would bet because that that name is um you know it's it's it's a unique rare name i thought you probably are related to the president somehow some way well look i'm glad you're quite proud i appreciate that wait how long were you in texas uh just a couple of days couple days and you were there with your parents obviously or no grandparent grandparents okay well you saw you you had a good time now you're back at your back home and and listening to the program today this is this is this is great well thank you

depending we'll go to kavie texas joustin great to have you sir hello hi russ thank you for taking my talk you bet sir oh and also thank you for the uh recent support to us texas we uh desperately need it sometimes works both ways sir thank you you hehe i wanted to do a quick 180 and ask you a personal question that's okay sure have at it i asked i asked nirly and he loved it his worth not mine of course um i was wondering to know how did it feel like and how old were you when you made your first million when you saw those seven figures looking right back at you well it didn't happen that way but but i'll try to answer now my here's here's my problem with this my parents told me to never talk about money now i know in this day and age everybody does everybody mentions it uh either exaggerates brags or whatever i was told not to talk about it's not very classy to um talk about your own uh financial circumstances uh you know the the way that this program started and the way it was financially structured uh i was i was uh profit participant but not not an owner i didn't have much leverage when we began and so i got i got i'll just i got 30 percent of whatever the net was but i wasn't in charge of the net so for versus a guarantee of a paltry uh compared to what i should have been getting some but it was what i had to do to get started and for four years the entity didn't really make enough money for there to be a significant net for there to be any percentage of it wasn't until the original syndication partner decided to sell his percentage that the leverage i had came into play so my first million was not a check for a million dollars it was not a commission it was an accumulation of years so there was never one entry into the check with one million wow look it was it wasn't that way it was um hard work it was uh it was a struggle uh but and i see i'm out of time here and this is a really there's a bunch of life lessons in this answer but i i'm out of time to give i'll try to remember to go into this uh next next monday because here's the short answer success is nothing like i thought it would be you know we ought to do a fourth hour of nothing but supplementary questions like this have nothing to do with politics i mean just for the posterity of it and i want to think about that folks um anyway have a great weekend and we'll be back here monday
