    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast. Welcome in Thursday edition clay Travis bucks, sexton show. I appreciate all of you hanging out with us. I'm headed up to the sweet 16. Buck doesn't even know what the sweet 16 is as the NCAA tournament rolls on. I will be in New York City before for too long for games tonight, Michigan state going up against who's Michigan state playing Kansas state, Tennessee against FAU. I cannot wait for Madison Square Garden. That is where I am headed. And it's interesting. I'll be headed to New York city where bucket doesn't appear that there is going to be an indictment of Donald Trump at least this week, which makes you wonder what might be going on with Alvin Bragg's investigation and whether there is now pushback emerging given as we have discussed on this program, the extremely novel and I think, frankly, likely to be overturned theory upon which he is trying to bring cases against Donald Trump. The data again, the evidence this week reflects that it does not appear that there's going to be an indictment this week. I would say, and I'm curious what you think about this right off the top buck. The longer we go without an official indictment coming down, the more I think it's fair to say there are behind the scenes shenanigans going on that are putting into question whether Alvin Bragg is going to be bringing charges in this case or not. Would you analyze it that way? Oh, yeah. I mean, delay does not favor the decision here because first of all, for a prosecutor, it just creates a further sense that you are uncertain because the facts aren't really in dispute here. That's what's so cool. That's what's interesting about this. It's not like, I mean, Trump, whether he had a Stormy Daniels affair or not, people dispute that, but the payment is not in dispute. Right. And really very minimal bookkeeping aspects of this or what people are discussing. So yeah, the longer you wait on this one, if you're Bragg, I think the less likely it is to come down. And this might be one of the biggest non-story stories in recent news cycle history. I do wonder what it's going to do for Trump. Uh, can't remember. He's official. He's a candidate. Trump fund raising. I've seen some of the text messages and emails going out on this to raise funds. Sure. You've seen some to clay. They've probably, I would guess they will end up raising more money in the last two weeks of the first quarter of this year than they did in the entire rest of the quarter put together. That's just a guess, but they're going to have to make that public. We'll see. So that is there. We're going to talk with Julie Kelly, who has been phenomenal on so many of these legal related issues at 130 Eastern. She will join us. We'll get the absolute latest there. Other things that are going on, uh, we have got continued fallout over the absurdity of transgender men, I guess transgender women. That is men who are identifying as women continuing to dominate women's athletics. We're going to have some fun with some of the clips that are absurd out there, uh, that, uh, as this continues to become more and more of an issue all over the country, uh, the absurdity of it all continues to grow. Uh, but right now as we are speaking, I believe there is a hearing on Capitol Hill surrounding TikTok, which has turned into a major, uh, in broleo, uh, coming back from Italy, I'll, I'll, I'll break it out there, uh, over what should we do about TikTok? Now I want to give Buck for the audience out there a quick sort of synopsis of what TikTok is because I am quite confident that this audience is not very active on TikTok. Uh, I'm just going to, I'm just going to make a, a wild guess there, but chances are your kids or grandkids are on TikTok. Uh, and they probably are fairly active there. Um, because, uh, it is wildly popular with young kids. If your kids or grandkids are ages, let's say 12 to 17, there's almost a hundred percent chance that they are active on TikTok. I think that's probably the foundational power, uh, base of TikTok in general. TikTok right now is where Facebook was in this country over a decade ago. When people, when a huge number of people were on it, on it a lot and on it for a long period of time, there are 150 million Americans who at least sometimes use TikTok, but if you look at the, the data and it's, it's particularly popular among young people, it's kind of taking snapchats play. Snapchat was, I'm too young and cool for Facebook, but now TikTok is, I'm too young and cool for Snapchat. Um, but it has taken over. It is the, you know, the zeitgeist of social media right now is TikTok with a 150 million US users and people sit on it clay for hours, for hours. It is addictive. And I will tell you that your kids or grandkids use TikTok like you might use Google. In other words, they just go into TikTok and type in a query, a question. And then they'll just run with whatever the feedback they get there is. Um, Buck, I don't know how active you are on TikTok. We have got out. Kick does a TikTok account that I'm amazed. Sometimes we have videos that we put up. Some of them do eight or 10 million views. I mean, it is unbelievable when one of these things catches fire, how massive the influence can be the difference, I would say, for those of you out there who might say, I'm never going to be on TikTok. Some of you are probably like, I'm fed up with Facebook. I don't trust Twitter. I'm not going to get on Instagram. I understand all that. The difference is Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, all American owned companies. TikTok is a Chinese company and the Chinese Communist Party has in many ways control over every Chinese company to some degree, certainly to a degree that doesn't exist in the United States at all. So the question that is out there and being debated today is, I think, an important one. What should happen with TikTok? You'll remember Trump tried to force TikTok's American assets to be sold to, I believe it was Oracle and was it Facebook or Oracle and somebody else that was going to buy the TikTok American assets. And then that thing fell apart over court rulings. Now the Biden administration is actually taking essentially the same position as Trump and demanding that this not be a Chinese owned company because there are fears that China is using TikTok to spy on American users. So that is the backdrop. That is what is going on here right now. Buck, what is your perspective on what should happen with TikTok based on your knowledge of the app and where it lies in the larger social media universe? I'm, I'm a little bit of a dissident on this issue. I think that there, there's one Congressman out of New York. I'm forgetting. All Bowman, I think. Thank you. Jamal Bowman who thinks that there's a bit of anti China hysteria around this. I actually think he's right. And I, and this is something, and I understand I'm out there on my own on this one. But first of all, let me, let me just make my case before people start yelling at me. OXXN left wing New York. Yeah. I totally. Yeah. So, so here's what I'll say about it. Um, first of all, if you're worried about, uh, brainwashing of your children and, and also about politicization and weaponization, we haven't even touched. Okay. We've seen what's going on with Twitter. Thank you, Elon. We haven't even touched Facebook. We haven't even touched Instagram. We haven't touched YouTube. We haven't touched Google. They are far more powerful, far more influential. And as you saw during COVID and the 2020 election and other areas, you look into a much bigger threat to our freedom of speech, our freedom of democracy, whatever. I mean, it's those are for me, such a bigger challenge than the idea that China is going to be programming your kids over the next few decades to be anti-American and weak. What do you think YouTube is doing, by the way? I mean, so that's my first, you know, that's my first line of, of, of, uh, So your first line and, and I think I agree as a parent is that social media is troubling to you. TikTok is not distinguishingly troubling to you relative to the overall social media environment. Yeah. I think the TikTok is not and look, I, I'm not, I'm not somebody who's actively posting on TikTok. Um, there is a TikTok account that picks up some of my stuff, but I'm not, you know, using it that way, but I do go on there. They make a lot of great little videos about how to sear the perfect, uh, ribeye and other things. It is very addictive. I will tell you, be prepared to lose a lot of time using it, but okay. I point one other social media platforms and anybody who knows anything about Google and YouTube would agree with me. They're, they're infinitely more powerful right now and more influential in online conversation. I think then TikTok is TikTok is powerful. But get me wrong. I shouldn't say infinitely, but substantially, substantially more powerful. The second point is, okay. So now we have the government saying we don't like the content on a platform. So we're going to ban it. And I understand it's really easy when you think of it as the Chinese communist party. They are our opponents on the world stage to be sure. And that's real. And I feel that we talk about that here all the time. But does anyone think the Democrats that their mindset is only on this one? Should we ban the platform that we don't like? Look what they did to, uh, to parlor with Amazon web services, knocking them down. Democrats will always try to find a way to destroy platforms they don't like. And when we go along with them, which a lot of Republicans, again, I'm on my own on this. When we go along with them, you're encouraging that, you know, it's interesting. We banned Russia today in this country as the Russian cable news propaganda channel. I kind of felt the same way. I was like, CNN is far more destructive to America than Russia today. But I understand for an ownership third point and maybe the best point here in my defense on this, on this issue, the plan that they have now, I am not privy to negotiations in the day to day of it is called Project Texas. And they're going to have all data generated by Americans on servers, run and operate it and owned by Oracle, an American company. And this would be in Austin, Texas. And only Oracle and the US base employees of TikTok would have access to any of those servers, any of those data and would be subject to, you know, audits and, you know, look at where the backup recording is going and everything else. Now you could say those TikTok employees will, you know, oh, they're just going to try to find ways to back to where TikTok. I mean, other social media companies have employees that also could very easily back door information to China in that circumstance, right? If you're going to say that US based infrastructure and architecture is subject to Chinese espionage, I'm going to say absolutely. But there are plenty of Chinese nationals that are high tech universities, everything else. So I don't see why I guess I don't see why TikTok is so much worse in that context than some of these other social media companies. And I will say this, I am, I mean, it's like me, I think Glenn Greenwald, there's like five of us who take this position right now, but I'm one of them. Yeah. So I actually am on the flip side here. Um, and I appreciate and understand all of those arguments. I think they are, uh, I think they're solid. Here's what I would say. China doesn't allow Twitter. They don't allow Facebook. They don't allow Google. I don't think they allow Instagram. They don't allow American companies access to the Chinese marketplace to compete in their country. And so my position is just not even focused on TikTok in general. If China won't open its market for fair competition in social media, again, YouTube not allowed Twitter, not allowed. I don't think Google hardly is allowed. Uh, Facebook certainly is. And all these companies are not allowed that are big social media behemoths in the United States. My thing is if they won't let us have access to their citizens and their demanding that they continue to have access to our citizens, we're playing on an unequal playing field from a competitive basis. And so I would demand that TikTok either pull out of the United States or probably more likely sell its United States assets in some way in the United States. That would be, that would be my position. If I were right now on Capitol Hill, again, I think that's a very good idea. Very also, I think that's a strong argument, but we, we all end up in this same place. They're talking about a ban to be clear to everybody. Yeah, I'm saying I think a ban is a bad idea. And I don't think I don't think me say this to, I don't think a band would work, Buck. Kids are smarter than all of us are when it comes to getting access to tech. I just, I don't understand how we would suddenly stop people from using TikTok. You know, I think a reasonable national security and and U S interest compromise is if all the assets are based here, it's U S personnel, American citizens, Oracle, the company that's backing up all the servers and data, not just for you and for your companies, but, you know, for the U S government, a lot of capacity, right? I mean, Oracle, Amazon Web Services doesn't matter. Larry Elheim, it's a pretty big Republican for people out there who, who runs Oracle effectively. Right. So I, I'm not disagreeing with the people that say that TikTok, something has to change about it. I just think this notion of a ban sets a precedent that I don't like is heavy handed in a way that's, that's unhelpful. And I think that also, you know, there are some areas where we're going to want to say, yeah, fine, the trade practices issue, certainly something we should address. But also, you know, if we're going to be shutting out external media from the rest of the world, then we're definitely going to be as a country in a position where we start telling other places, Hey, you guys are so closed off and you're not allowing, you know, the global internet to be truly free. And they're going to say, you mean, you guys are the ones who ban TikTok, right? So I don't like that precedent either over the long term. But I look, I understand why there are concerns about it now. I also just think, I mean, I just think Google and YouTube are the are the are the big, this is the big dragon that nobody has stepped up to understand. They are programming your kids right now. They are programming them with anti-Americanism and they are American. And they're here on US soil. YouTube, and this is just me speaking as a dad, YouTube and TikTok are the two social media apps that my boys spend by far the most time on. They're not on Facebook. They're not on Instagram. They're not really on Twitter. And we try to keep them off social media in general, but they're on YouTube and they are on TikTok. I think it's hard to keep them off both just by way of giving everyone a sense of the context here. YouTube has 200 million based US users. Yeah. Right. So not TikTok is is up there, but it's not quite in the same at the same category yet. So we'll see. We'll see. I also just don't trust the Biden administration. So when they call for a ban, I'm like, I don't know. What do you ban? Well, you know what's funny is the Biden administration politically is kind of in an interesting spot. We come back, but we could mention this because they're overwhelmingly supported by Gen Z and Gen Z would be furious at the Biden administration if they take away. And then what do we say, Jen Alpha or whatever the next generation is, if they take away these kids opportunity and ability to access TikTok. I think it's kind of fascinating, but this is where you get a lot of Republicans and Democrats and this is you listen to Republican members of Congress and they're all hammer on this issue. By the way, I think they're much. Let's come back to this as well, Clay, because there are much bigger issues with China that no one is talking about and no one wants to tackle. I think this also becomes the shiny object that they can distract people with. But anyway, don't fall for the free phone deals from Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile.

Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. Welcome back to Clay and Buck. We're talking about TikTok and the possible band. We've also got our eyes looking forward looking ahead, I should say, to whether or not there's going to be anything of this looming Trump indictment. I also want to tell you that in the second hour of the program, you may have seen this. 500,000 kids weren't able to go to school for three days because the Los Angeles teachers unions went on strike demanding more money. I want to tell you a little bit about some of the some of the individuals involved in calling for that strike and their politics and what's going on with teachers, unions in major cities across the country, which I think at this point, Clay, everybody should realize after what they did during COVID they are villains in this drama of our lives in America. Teachers unions are not doing not doing the right thing by the kids. No doubt. Times precious. If you're a business owner, especially a small business owner, get refunds.com understands that.

That's get refunds.com. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show Thursday edition of the program. I put up a poll question. I'm curious. I genuinely do not know how this poll question is going to go, but it's pretty simple, pretty straightforward. Do you believe TikTok should be banned in the United States so long as a Chinese company maintains ownership? I do. And Buck disagrees. There is a great deal debate going on right here right now. To me, it's less about China having ownership than it is the Chinese communist government not allowing our social media companies to have access to their market. So why should we allow them to have access to our market? That's my angle. I do have concerns about spying and and all the algorithmic, uh, ridiculousness that's going on, but I agree with Buck in that there's a lot of stuff that's being fed to your kids and grandkids every day to make them think that America is awful from American based corporations. So the idea that China is going to do something different than what YouTube or, uh, or Twitter before Elon Musk bought it, for instance, are doing a question in general. I mean, if you went back and looked at the, the, whatever it was, $100,000 spent by Russian bot farm accounts in the 2016 election and you, and you looked at most of it. I mean, you could tell this was written by some guy in a basement in Belarus on behalf of, you know, the Russian, uh, equivalent of the FSB or something. I mean, that was, that it was ridiculous. It was like no vote for hail or a 2016 vote for Trump. I mean, it was really clearly like translated from the Cyrillic into English by some translator program. And they also spent almost no money, which anyone who has ever bought ads on social media, when you see they spent like $120,000. It's almost impossible to have any impact on Facebook at 120 K. But by the way, I would say on, on this issue of TikTok, I'm certainly persuadable and I'm very aware of the espionage. Um, that's not only possible for God's sake. I mean, I think you're probably more aware than almost anyone. If, if people understood how much has already been stolen from American companies in terms of proprietary technology, sensitive personal information, uh, massive hacks of, of terabytes upon terabytes of the most sensitive information you can imagine, that's been going on for 20 years. So I just, you know, oh, it's, this is so bad because TikTok is going to be this, this portal to all of our data and information. The internet is the portal for your data and information because the Chinese are hacking every company they can of value and stealing everything of value they can. And they've been doing it since Clay and I were in college or Clay was in college and I was in nursery school, but close enough. I will tell you this buck. I had a conversation recently. I meant to share this with you because I thought you would find it intriguing. These algorithms are constantly feeding kids, all sorts of different videos, all sorts of different content. Do you know, I talked to my kids friends recently. These are kids, you know, like 10 to 16 years old, kind of in the window. I've got an eight-year-old to a, to a 15-year-old. Do you know who the number one most influential person, at least according to the focus group that is my kids and their friends, is right now on any of the social media platforms? Mr. Beast. He's up there. It's actually Andrew Tate. They all see Andrew Tate videos all the time. And I think this is, this is, look, I'm giving you like a, yeah. You know that the Andrew Tate Clay, they just extended another 30 days in prison without charge so they can find out whether he should be charged. Yeah, it's great. This is going into month four of this guy being held in a hellish, Romanian prison. If they, if he was so guilty and there was such bad stuff, they need four months to come up with whether or not they're even going to charge. I mean, this, look, I was going to say it, America is not great with the justice system. You don't want to get arrested anywhere else though. I can tell you, I want to tell you this, this is like a 10 or 15 or maybe even 20-year prediction because these kids, and these are boys, right? I've got three boys. So I'm talking to boys. I'm not saying what girls are seeing. I have no idea. I don't have teenage girls or young girls or anything like that. So I'm sure they get fed different things on the algorithm. I think that these young boys today, and I'm talking about this as a dad of three young boys, I think that they are told that they are awful as men, right? And I mean, awful as men when they're like seven and eight years old, that a lot of them are rejecting what they are being taught in school and desperately seeking out masculine figures that do not apologize for being men. And I think there's a desperate yearning to say nothing of young boys who are growing up, growing up without masculine influence in their household, right? Maybe they're getting raised by grandma. Maybe they're getting raised by mom. They don't really know what men are like. That's a huge percentage. Unfortunately, of young boys in this country. And interestingly, Buck, what they show is young boys suffer far more from the absence of a father in the household than young girls do when they look at what outcomes kids have. Girls tend to be far more resilient. Maybe it's because there's a mother figure and they can see someone exactly who they want to live up to. Boys are desperately yearning right now for male authority figures to teach them that it's okay to be a boy. And I hear that not only is it? Yeah, it's not only okay to be a boy is proud of it. You should be proud to become a man. Correct men are looking for people to pattern themselves after that involve strength, that involve courage, that involve the kind of person that anybody would want to have around. Anybody would want to work with being near, having their community, having their society. And we are being there is an active program to demasculinize us if that is a word I can use. And we can all see it just on the TikTok issue again to bring it full circle. I think one of the things here that isn't being grappled with seriously enough clay is that the algorithm is meant to be entirely addictive based on what you watch. How long are you wanted? How that that I mean, it's pretty clear what they do. And that's where Andrew Tate is taking off on TikTok to buck is that's where a lot of these kids are being exposed TikTok and YouTube. He is, I think, the most popular, the most popular figure on these apps. So he was when she told all of them, as you know, it's pirate accounts. Yeah, put it right there grabbing things that he said and sharing them and then they go viral. So so he's he's still veritate is still very much in the in the minds of particularly young men who are by the way, that's the apparatus wants to control young men more than anything else. Because who's really a problem for you in society when the when the young men all get upset with how a society is going, things can happen. They want to be controlled. They want them docile. They want them to shut up and do as they're told, right? That's the people that are telling you to eat the bugs, have low tea, cry all the time about all the bad things your ancestors did or didn't do whatever. Those people want you to be a shambir masculinity but I just think on the yeah, the Tate, there's some of that that's happening on TikTok but Clay, they keep saying, oh, they're going to brainwash our kids. The brainwashing is already occurring. And what TikTok is actually showing people if you get on it and you start to pay attention to it, is what American youth through their schools, through their entertainment through what they want to see more of. Yeah, people seem to think that this is just like, there's not some Chinese Communist Party figure who's showing up was like, America is very evil. And like, you should hate America. They're showing people things. Where does all the lives of TikTok stuff come from? Obviously in the name, they're showing what's already happening in this country and kids are being trained to believe by the society around them. This is what I want to see more of. This is what I believe in. This is so it's a mirror in many ways to our current problems as it is also, I think, an issue for long term programming and CCP intervention. I'm not saying that's not a risk. But right now it's showing this how actually destabilize a lot of America's foundation has become. I saw a quote. There's a good New York magazine article. I need to send you the link book that I read while I was over in Italy. Late at night, everybody's in bed asleep. You're getting ready. And I'll kind of scroll through and be reading all sorts of different stuff. And there was an unbelievable quote from a left wing mom in Brooklyn. And I just wanted to read this to you because I think it's so great. As Tate was blowing up, this is her kid. Well, I'll tell this story when we come back and we'll also take some of your calls because I think you guys are going to really enjoy this story. Some of the quotes from this New York magazine article are pretty incredible about Andrew Tate. But what I would say as we go to break is there is a desperate desire for masculinity in this country. And kids are craving it. Young boys to a degree that may never have existed in this country before. What figures are going to fill the void in their lives that they want to emulate? It's a big question. I think for a lot of them, it's become Andrew Tate, which is fascinating in and of itself. And I'll read these quotes and we'll discuss we'll take some of your calls when we come back in the meantime, it's on all the towers foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us heroes like us Air Force senior master sergeant Israel del Toro Jr. He promised his father he'd take care of his family and his son that he wouldn't grow up without a father. When his Humvee exploded in Afghanistan, he suffered severe burns over more than 80% of his body with only a 15% chance of survival del Toro focused on the promises he made. Later, he became the first fully disabled airman permitted to reenlist and a gold medal winner in the Invictus Games. Now he shares his story to help others. Thanks to the tunnel the towers foundation and your generosity del Toro received a mortgage-free home. It's a mortgage-free smart home to so important home has a variety of features to help him live more independently. You can help heroes like del Toro when they need it most. Both Buck and myself donate $11 a month to tunnel the towers. Please do the same and join us. Go online to t2t.org. That's t the number two t dot org. Come to tiktok. We all know that social media has massive. You can opt out and when it comes to tiktok, I would I would wager 99% of our esteemed and beloved radio audience is not actively on tiktok. Maybe 95 to 99%. But 150 million Americans are they're overwhelmingly very young. It is left-wing dominated. You would and I did try to post a little bit during covid clay. I got shut down couldn't talk about masks. Couldn't you know I got strike. So it was just as sensorious on covid stuff as as the other platforms. But I think people it's really effective because they realize something's going on with kids. Kids will sit. I mean I see this in airports and restaurants. They will sit and they will go through tiktok for an hour two hours. They'll just sit there just going through going through going through. I mean, you know, look, people said the same thing about Facebook when it started out and Facebook was very sticky so to speak as a platform originally. People spent you know tons of time there. The average was like two hours a day on faith. I haven't I mean a Facebook has fallen off tremendously from what it used to be. Anyway, we got to do you want to get some of these calls because people are going to read this or read this quote from Andrew Tate from this this we're also going to pull some some Tate audio so people can hear some of the stuff. Go ahead. If you if you aren't familiar with Andrew Tate, we will kind of familiarize you with it. But he is as popular if you are if you have a kid 12 to 17 years old, there's almost 100% chance they will know it. And here as Tate was blowing up, this is a left wing mom who becomes concerned that her son is becoming a huge fan of Andrew Tate as Tate was blowing up Ruby made the connection and grew concerned even more so when Charlie told her Tate was being interviewed on Tucker Carlson and suggested they watch together. Funny this I this is the quote that I thought you would love Buck. She and her husband said no. Here's her quote. I'm like a Brooklyn far left person. If Tucker Carlson interviewed Barack Obama, who's probably my favorite person on earth, I wouldn't watch that. Charlie, her son tried to explain which I love that quote. Charlie to add Brooklyn mom, Barack Obama is her favorite person on earth. Charlie tried to explain saying that liking Tate had nothing to do with politics, but he would watch these videos all the time. His mom said one of the things that she noticed was he became far more self-reliant and he started doing pushups and setups all the time because that's one of the things that Andrew Tate argues is you have to have your mind and body physically strong. And what is interesting to me, Buck, is you talk about what's being banned and what kids are seeing, boys, young boys are being influenced by people like Andrew Tate that might be different than who you think they would be influenced by. And some of the lessons of Andrew Tate, I 100% agree with. Yes. Also, I think it's interesting that they hold everyone to this, this standard that, you know, they'll they'll say, well, do you agree with this? And they'll pull something where Tate used to be as he was becoming a more famous individual. They'll pull something where he said, you know, he said stuff that was for me would be what does cross the line is something I wouldn't. No one saying that you agree with that. You know, there are other people who agree 100% with anybody, right? It's like, like, Chuck, you know, Charles Barkley has some incredible phrase, Mike Tyson. Okay. Mike Tyson, everybody has a plan till they're punched the face, a brilliant and timeless phrase. Yeah, that doesn't mean that I agree with everything Mike Tyson says. Everything Mike Tyson does, you know, Mike Tyson's pass, but the man does have some wisdom that has been passed on to a whole lot of people. So I think it's interesting that they do this thing where when you say, well, I like the following tenets of Tate, if you will, they say, well, he did all this other stuff, or they say he was involved in, uh, in webcam businesses, for example, which, you know, if you read any stories, yeah, I think that's gross. I think that's exploitative. I oppose that 100%. But does that mean that I have to say he's wrong when he tells somebody to do a lot of sit-ups and pushups and be a man and defend women? You don't have to like, I think it's interesting because the owner was also saying this stuff. And what strikes my kids and what they respond to so well, and their friends, Buck, is they live in such a fear-laden society that Andrew Tate is one of the people out there saying you need to toughen up. You need to be able to handle difficulties in life because the real world ain't all, you know, rainbows and unicorns. Yeah. I think that's, and especially for young men, these days, I want to say we got the Tate clip here is just the kind of stuff that Clay and I are talking about when we're picking and choosing from what he says that has some wisdom to it. Play 29. The baseline of masculine E as a whole is the thing that makes a good man a man is that he does what he doesn't want to do. He doesn't want to work and he works anyway. He doesn't want to go to war and he fights anyway. He doesn't want to get up. He gets up anyway. That's the whole point of it. We didn't want to die in the Titanic. Guess what happened? We died the Titanic. You can't sit there as a man and say you don't feel like it. You're not allowed to not feel like it. You're supposed to do it anyway, regardless. So I sit here, I say that people need to hear that. Yeah. That's that's important. That's easy. I'm a man. It's a great message for young men. And and you sit here and you say, okay, also I want to, you know, if it wasn't Biden, if it was Trump in the White House, I know it's Romania that's holding him. The timing does seem suspicious to a lot of people. Would there be a Black US citizen, which is Tate is a US citizen, by the way, but there'd be a Black American held in like the Romanian gulag for months on end with no actual presentation of charges without a word of protest from the State Department. Really? Just think about the way Brittany Griner was defended in Russia compared to the way that Andrew Tate is being defended in Romania. I mean, Brittany Griner admitted that she took drugs into Russia because she's a Black lesbian who voted for Joe Biden. The entire Democrat apparatus demanded that she get out of prison. Andrew Tate, American citizen mixed race like you said, dad's Black mom's white. It's almost like nobody cares that he's being held with no charges in Romania. Seems kind of counter productive and also a prison. It's like they're not going to trade the Lord of War for Tate, are they? Remember that? That's what they did. Victor Baut, they decided to make a trade. There's no trade going on here, but also there are no charges because he's being held indefinitely in a Romanian prison and he maintains he's 100% innocent. And a lot of people are saying are there politics behind this decision that we're not even seeing? We'll look into more of this."
