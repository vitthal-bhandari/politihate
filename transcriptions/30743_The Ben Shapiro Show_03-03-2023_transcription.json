    "text": " After Hershey's decides to virtually signal to the radical trans agenda, we launch Jeremy's Chocolate. John Kerry calls for an energy revolution, but the facts don't back him up. And John Federman is apparently sponsoring legislation from a mental hospital. I'm Ben Shapiro, this is The Ben Shapiro Show. Well, folks, I'm sure you've seen by now Hershey's decided that it was worthwhile going completely woke. This makes them the second major chocolate company to decide to move along woke lines. Obviously, so M&Ms with their body positivity, M&M spokespeople, and all the rest of their silliness. Well, now Hershey's has gone a lot further. So Hershey's over the last couple of days in honor of women's history month. Because again, women represent 50% of the population, but apparently only about 1.12th of the history. In honor of women's history month, they decided to launch their she bars. Ah, yes, because it's her or she. Get it? Like, her, she, get it? But here is the thing, that'd be kind of virtue signaling enough. But they decided that the most, the most virtue signaling that they could pack into one chocolate, one chocolate bar, was going to be by featuring as the spokesperson for Hershey's for women's history month. A dude, an actual man like a male who believes that he is a woman. And so Hershey's Canada released in an ad featuring a male to female transgender person. Here we go. My name is Paige Onestone. I'm the executive director of wisdom to act. That's a dude. And we can create a world where everyone is able to live in public space as their honest and authentic selves. See the women changing how we see the future. Dress up as one. I just can't admit that. See the women changing how we see the future. The future is very, very male. All the best, all the best women are men. Okay, so we here at Daily Wire, we don't, you know, particularly hold with this sort of thing. Well, we're not big fans of corporations that decide they're going to virtue signal to you. They're going to try to sell you chocolate or sell you razors or so any sort of good by spitting in your face with regard to your own values. And this is why today I am proud to announce that we have launched Jeremy's Chocolate. Yes, you knew what was coming and it's going to happen right now. Head on over to ihatehershees.com. That's a real website. ihatehershees.com. And what you will find there is Jeremy's Chocolate Binary. Jeremy's Chocolate Binary, there are two types of chocolate bars that we are selling. We have he-him bars and we have she-her bars. The he-him bars are complete with nuts. The she-her bars are nutless. Indeed, there are no nuts in the she-her bar because we at Jeremy's Chocolate, we understand there's a difference between men and women. We feel that any bar that is labeled he should in fact have nuts and any bar that is labeled she should in fact not have nuts. It's very obvious and it's very clear. As ihate Hersheyes says on the website, some chocolate companies don't even know what a woman is but we do indulge in the chocolate binary. One with nuts, one without, you know which is which. Yes indeed, help buy some of these bars honestly. Yeah, it's a troll but also the chocolate's good and also you're going to be demonstrating to Hersheyes and other woke chocolate companies that you don't have to take your money to them. They don't need to have your money. If they hate your values and they spit in your face and they believe that they can cram down their idiotic social justice warrior messaging about how men are women and women are men in the middle of women's history. If you're a woman for example and you actually would like to celebrate being a woman with some chocolate late in the day because your kids have run you raggator because you're late at work and you actually don't wish to honor a company that believes that men are women. Now would be an excellent time to head over to ihatehersheyes.com. That site is live and you can order a four pack, a ten pack or a twenty four pack of our chocolate bars again. The he-him bars come with nuts that she, her bars are nutless as God made them. So just wanted to announce that right off the top and you know honestly our goal is to sell a lot of these bars because we would like for the media to understand. We would like for for Hersheyes to understand that they shouldn't be promoting this sort of left-wing garbage and using your money to do it and then trying to sell you product on the back of hating your values. Once more ihatehersheyes.com and go check it out right now. Okay meanwhile speaking of the delusional John Kerry for some odd reason that is a dude who has just failed up his entire career is like he went to Vietnam after running a failed congressional race. He went to Vietnam he came back he slandered all of his fellow soldiers and then he ended up in the United States Senate and like Joe Biden has been a career useless person. The difference is that he actually lost his run for the presidency in 2004 but that didn't stop him from continuing to be a prominent public figure even his face elongated sort of like the Edvard Munch scream painting that's sort of what just happened to John Kerry's face over time he is gradually turning into the Easter Island head. Well he is still the top climate diplomat despite being a person who has probably produced more carbon emissions than 99.99% of the population. Well a couple of days goes and now that Kerry will stay in his role as President Joe Biden's special climate envoy at least through this year's UN climate talk set for December into buy and in speculation that he might soon depart. He recently informed Biden of his decision to stay in his post. Well yeah I mean what else is he gonna do with his life go windsurfing again? He said there's insufficient there's unfinished business I felt to be inappropriate to walk away from that at this point in time. So he's gonna stay through the COP 28 climate meeting where nations will hold a global stock take to assess the gap between their progress in combat and climate change and the goals of the Paris climate agreement to keep the temperatures well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels that of course is not going to happen but he's traveling around the world and speaking on behalf of the green climate agenda and many of the things that he is saying are just not true and today I'd like to go through some of the things that the environmentalist movement says about the green transition the transition to green energy that are just not true because it turns out a lot of it is just a pack of lies is virtue signaling lies that are directed toward redistributionism and quashing global capitalism in the name of a goal they will never achieve. It's kind of important to understand that when they promote a thing they're not actually promoting the thing they say they're promoting they're promoting a different thing and they're not actually promoting in an end to climate change what they actually are promoting is an end to capitalism and redistributionist economic system under the guise of solving the climate problem. Well speaking of people who don't tell you the truth, simple fact of the matter is that your internet service provider very often they'll say things like you are now in incognito mode let me tell you something you're not in incognito mode because incognito mode means they can still monitor everything that you do and they still grab your data and they still sell it to advertisers well you shouldn't give them that data that data is none of their business this is why I use express VPN express VPN protects you every time you connect to an unencrypted network because in cafes hotels airports etc your online data is not secure any hacker on the same network can access and steal that personal data plus you have big tech watching you plus you have big tech working hand in glove with the government express VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet they'll take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past express at VPNs encryption express VPN works on all my devices you just fire up the app you tap one button and now you are protected this is why I use express VPN is again my data is my business and I don't wish to subsidize a lot of big tech companies that hate my gut so instead I keep my data to myself do the same get the VPN I trust to protect my online privacy visit express VPNs com slash bend get an extra three months free on a one-year package that's expr ess vpn.com slash bend express VPN.com slash bend to get started okay so john kerry is still gallivanting around the world talking about the climate agenda so here he was at a at a in events called ocean I believe this was in Brazil I think and he was explaining that all the science says that the time is running out to act on climate now again these are sufficiently big statements that they don't make a whole hell of a lot of sense if we're talking about what we can do to mitigate future climate change the time is never running out because presumably we can still mitigate whatever is going to happen tomorrow if what he means is that time is running out in order for us not to hit like 1.5 degrees Celsius climate change or two degrees Celsius climate change that time is already over the emissions are already up in the air and we ain't we ain't keeping it under that if you believe in the anthropogenic climate change arguments that are made by folks on left and many people in the in the climatologist departments over at MIT and Caltech in any case here is john kerry explaining that he is on the side of science and the truth is my friends these choices that we've been making about how we drive our economies time is running out and the science is what tells us that not john kerry not present biden not any of the ministers who are here science mathematics physics chemistry biology all of them on a factual basis of screaming to us about the choices we face they're all screaming us about okay but here's the problem the choices that we face are not the choices that john kerry says we face okay the reality is the world is going p dependent on fossil fuels for a very long time to come because the green tech just isn't there and this is the part they just won't say they say it behind closed doors by the way i've been in meetings with people climatologist from mit from caltech who will tell you that the green revolution is not here the tech just isn't here but then if you say that publicly they yell at you then they say it's because you're insufficiently committed see the thing is that bernie sanders has a line in his in his newest garbage book in which he says it's an amazing amazing line he he suggests that politics is not about attempting to allocate scarce resources or about policy it's not about any of those things he has one line that's really telling he says our economic debates should not revolve around questions of resources they should revolve around questions of intent and will intent and will in other words this is the way the left wingers view government government is capable of anything it's not a question of what government can do it's not a question what government should do it's about intent and will do you have a good intent and you have enough vida to ram that thing through and that is what it comes down to when it comes to climate change for people like john kerry they never have to look at the science because the science actually doesn't matter to them the point is that they have good intent they're intent to my intent is good i'm going to serve the plan and i have the will do you have the will if we don't do it it's because you're a bad person who doesn't who doesn't have the will it's not about will it's not about intent it is in fact about what you can do and what you should do but these are questions that are never asked when it comes to climate change because the whole goal of the climate change movement is not in fact to actually lower the future climate change it is not in fact to adapt to climate change and prevent future death and suffering the goal of the movement is to politically wrong foot its opponents in favor of a more pure redistributionist scheme for the global economy but john kerry he never tells you the truth about the actual choices that we face because the actual choices that we face are a lot more grave than the ones he likes to say so instead they lie to you just like all politicians lie to you and they say things like there'll be a green revolution it'll create millions of jobs in your lifestyle will be even better than it was before it's a win win win so michael scott win win win it isn't though so here is john kerry talking about climate change being a crisis of our own choices we face a crisis of the choices that we make not all of us individually but yes in many ways still individually by what we buy how we live the choices we make on a daily basis and the crisis that we face today on the global biome is a crisis that comes from unabated emissions unabated emissions says the man who has been spending his entire career flying around in private and then of course he tells the inflation reduction act so one of the big lies the Biden administration told is that the inflation reduction act would reduce inflation so while you're alert it didn't even come close to reducing inflation it actually turns out that when you pour more money into the economy you increase inflation but the real truth is that they meant it to be a climate legislation boondoggle the problem is of course not going to achieve its goals none of this is designed to achieve the goals they say it's designed to achieve it's not going to have any market impact on climate change even the Paris agreements we're not having any market impact on the upward trajectory of climate change if the United States kept to it and that is the sad truth that is the sad reality but here's John Kerry pushing it for our part the United States is highlighting 77 announcements from eight agencies and offices valued at nearly six billion dollars this is more than double the commitments that we highlighted last year in terms of dollar value and it thanks to the inflation reduction act which is the most significant piece of climate legislation in our history we will be doing even more okay and the end goal of course is to pressure the fossil fuel industry to change it's the fossil fuel industry we need to get them to stop that's that's the real problem here according to John Kerry and I personally know this new president sultan al-Jabir who has been leading the deployment of renewables in the UAE who has been part of a process that has been investing globally in renewables for years and that has already deployed renewables in their own country my friends I believe it's important for us to understand that to get this job done we have to be inclusive and we need to get the fossil fuel industry to change its own choices and join other fossil fuel companies that have decided they're going to be energy companies not oil companies he's selling you a bill of goods here and I'll explain exactly why he's selling you a bill of goods in just one second first let's talk about what nature does require of you one of the things nature requires of you is the your vegetables and have your fruits it's common for me I like vegetables I think God punished us with vegetables because they taste terrible but they're good for you well balance of nature can provide you one solution balance of nature fruits and veggies is the best way to make sure you're getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day their products are 100% whole food balance of nature uses a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients in whole fruits and vegetables and encapsulates them for easy consumption balance of nature sends a bunch of the product down to the studio for us to try they are kosher so I've been using them and I tell you they may be the only thing keeping me alive at this point since my kids are not allowing me to sleep go to balance of nature dot com use promo code Shapiro for 35% off your first order as a preferred customer that's balance of nature dot com promo code Shapiro get 35% off your first preferred order if you're somebody like me who doesn't get the nutrients that you actually need because you don't do the fruits and vegetables thing as much as you should balance of nature can help solve that problem for you go to balance of nature dot com use promo code Shapiro get 35% off your very first order as a preferred customer again balance of nature dot com enter promo code Shapiro get 35% off your first preferred order okay so let's talk about the flaws in the in the arguments that john kerry is making so there's a very good book out that I highly recommend by a guy named peters ihan you may have heard xihan on joe Rogan's show and he has a very good book out right now called the end of the world is just the beginning in which in fairly granular detail he goes through resource allocation around the world hey how much cobalt there is in the world where it's located how much cobalt it would take to to generate certain types of batteries how to make a lithium battery and how much lithium it takes to make a lithium battery and all the rest of this sort of stuff and he comes to a few conclusions about green tech because he's talking about the fact that he believes that is the world becomes less interconnected as globalization ends supply chains are going to become attenuated and they're going to break more easily and the world is going to become a worse place and so what he says is if you are relying on green to pick up the slack you're wrong so here's some of the problems that he points out here and again I think this is important for people to know because whether you are left or right or center it is important to be very accurate about what government can do and what we can achieve otherwise you're just shouting into the wind otherwise when you're talking about green tech in the green revolution and reshifting our economy and all this kind of stuff you're just the same as Joe Biden shouting about how he's going to end cancer by yelling at it so peters ihan talks about a list of problems with the so-called green revolution this green tech revolution that's supposed to re-shift all energy resources on planet earth toward renewables he points out that the best replacement for oil is actually natural gas which is true if you look at the reduction in emissions in the united states over the course of the last decade and a half that has been largely due to the replacement of oil with natural gas but the lefty environmentalists don't like natural gas in the same way that they don't like nuclear energy but if you move beyond fossil fuels he points out quote either the cost of the substitute is in excess of 10 times that of the original input the carbon footprint is in excess of 10 times that of the original input or more likely both in other words if you use solar it's going to be way more expensive and if you use like animal dong to replace oil it's way more carbon intensive so you're going to have to make some really really bad choices green tech as it turns out is not remotely space efficient solar is one thousand times less dense than systems powered by more conventional means it's an awful lot of land covered in really ugly solar panels in order for you to achieve even remotely similar amounts of power to oil natural gas and fossil fuel resources that generally power electrical grids when it comes to efficiency we spent an enormous amount of money globally on solar tech from 2014 which is when the solar boom started until about 2020 1.5 percent of total electricity now comes from solar 1.5 percent globally comes from solar and one big there are a bunch of problems with things like solar and wind some of them are dispatchability it turns out that the sun shines where it shines and the wind blows where the wind blows but that doesn't mean that you necessarily live near where the sun shines where the wind blows 95 percent of humans as I hand points out live within 50 miles of their power plant it says green tech in its current form simply isn't able to shave more than a dozen or so percentage points off fossil fuel demand in fact places that have shifted over to green tech are spending four times what they normally would for power even places like california which has tried to make that shift and california is a fairly welcoming place in terms of green energy it has good green resources even california is paying three times what it normally would for power it would be paying for except that it's importing power from other states and then pretending that it's not in the same way that europe was pretending that it was engaged in a green revolution and then just importing oil and natural gas from russia perhaps the biggest problem with the green tech movement is that a lot of the green tech is not storeable so here's the thing fuel like oil natural gas coal what these are are physical energy right these are energy in physical form which means they are transportable it means they are movable it means that they don't just dissipate immediately that is not true for solar in wind how do you store the energy from the solar or the wind it exists in time so people have talked about well we need battery power well there's only one problem you ain't got nothing remotely like the kind of batteries that would be necessary to store the energy that you are talking about zaihan says assuming that the technological improvements in the world of batteries that have unfolded since 1990 continue into 2026 the cost of a four-hour lithium grid storage system will be about 250 bucks per megawatt hour of capacity six times that of the standard combined cycle natural gas plant which is currently the most common electricity generating asset in the united states despite all of the talk about solar and wind in the state of california for example the amount of total storage power storage in the state of california right now is one minute of power one minute of power which is why when you look at states like texas and there's big freeze that the sources of energy that fail are the renewables the renewables fail all the other energy the natural gas and all the rest of that if there are failures it's because like a pipe cracks but the usual answer is you have to ramp up the natural gas in the oil in order to compensate for the failure of the renewables so zaihan concludes green tech and its current form simply isn't mature enough or cheap enough to move the needle for most people's and most locations it's largely limited to developed countries with rich capital supplies who just coincidentally happen to have large population centers fairly close to sunny or windy locations nearly all other locations globally will remain dependent upon more traditional fuels for the vast majority of their energy needs and so what exactly is going to happen to all of those other countries well as it turns out if they can't get ahold of oil it's going to get worse in terms of the environment not better they're going to turn to coal or they're going to turn to lignite okay lignite is a barely qualifies as coal fuel that is typically one fifth water by weight and is by far the least efficient and zordius fuel in use today germany today already uses lignite as its primary power input fuel because green tech has failed and yet the german's for environmental reasons have shut down their other power generation options like nuclear and natural gas and instead they're using the far dirtier lignite is why you care people like john karry babble about green energy when you hear joe biden talk about oh we need to spend a billion dollars will shift all the power no you moron we're going to be using oil and natural gas for a very very long time to come and when you disincentivize the creation of oil refineries for example which takes sometimes ten years to come online all you are doing is making energy more expensive and by the way you're not helping the environment because people are going to be using other cheaper and zerdier forms of energy in substitute which is the reason why for all the happy talk about environmentalism you know who actually is generating the the most emissions right now china of course according to the washington post despite the west enormous head start china is projected to have emitted more total carbon dioxide than all of europe by 2039 and more than the united states by 2050 we don't mean that they're they're the leading emitter now they are already the leading emitter we mean that historically speaking by 2050 they will have emitted more in terms of carbon emissions than the entire history of the united states in terms of carbon emissions at that point because it turns out developing countries they don't care very much about john carrey's winds they just want to make sure that their people don't starve and the world of reality is a difficult reality for politicians and if the world of reality can also be a difficult reality for you if you don't take care to actually prep which is one reason why i recommend jase medical so i got emergency medications from jase medical because during the pandemic it turns out that pretty much everything broke all the supply chains broke you're living in china they basically welded you into your apartment so you couldn't get the medications you need that sort of stuff actually as we now know does happen and you need the medications that you need when you need those medications why not be prepared jase case is a pack of five different antibiotics you can use to treat a host of bacterial illnesses in an emergency and get your jase emergency medications right now because the vast majority of vital medications are going to be very hard to get if our supply chain gets any worse we've already seen antibiotic shortages last month visit jase medical dot com take a few minutes fill out their online form your information will be reviewed by a board certified physician your medication will be dispensed by a licensed pharmacy at a fraction of the regular cost you can enter code ben at check out for a discount on your order that's j a s e medical dot com promo code ben again the the biden administration seem keen on um i'm making the world less globalized in certain ways which means that those supply chains are going to become a lot weaker you're not going to get the medications you need you should head over to jase medical go check them out right now jase medical dot com promo code ben that's jase medical dot com promo code ben okay so reality is a hell of a is a hell of a waker upper or we've been spending the last several decades in sort of a measmatic dream of our own making and that's particularly true when it comes to the economy what we're about to see in terms of the economy we're about to see a recession one of the reasons that we're about to see a recession is because all the loose money is going away when you just inflate the currency and when you make it possible for people to take out incredibly cheap credit people tend to use it on a bunch of dumb projects you'll get the occasional project that hits and then you'll get a lot of projects that fail because people have cheap money and they're going to spend it on things and so what you have seen is a burst of risky spending over the course of the last several years and nowhere is this truer than in the world of big tech which is about to see a pretty massive cleanup and when you have a bubble and the bubble bursts what ends up happening is all the air and the bubble escapes and that is what is happening right now in the economy as the interest rates ramp up as it becomes harder to get credit a lot of the folks who took out cheap and easy credit on speculative projects are about to get it directly in the tukas according to the washington post eight years ago googles founder split the company up into separate entities and named the collection alphabet the idea was to separate the core business the company's giant advertising machine from the side projects that needed time to develop but what could ones they become a googles next big money maker but that next big money maker has not materialized revenue still comes overwhelmingly from advertising google has shuttered most of the other so-called moon shots from internet delivering balloons to glucose measuring contact lenses even most advanced of its side projects self-driving car lab wemo health care tech startup barely are now confined by the limits of regular business on wednesday wemo laid off eight percent of its workforce adding to a previous round of cuts in january now this is a long time coming it's not only going to happen in big tech it's also going to happen in real estate we've been seeing the prices of real estate stagnate they will start to drop at some point here because again if you spend on a speculative mortgage and then it turns out that you can't afford that mortgage because of the inflation then a lot of the money's going to get washed out of the system shoppers right now are pulling back all the talk about a happy landing here an easy landing a soft landing that seems like that is that is wishful thinking at best according to the wall street journal consumers pulled back on purchases of apparel and electronics in recent months while continuing to spend on groceries and other necessities which is why they are called necessities macy's and best buy so they expect sales to fall this year after declining in 2022 macy's chief executive jeff gennett said he expects to be in worse shape in 2023 than they were last year according to ronnie mck melon chief executive of kroger they are behaving as if they are already in a recession consumers are shopping more frequently than they have in recent months and they're still splurging on products they want like premium beer but people are starting to shift their spending habits because again when the easy money goes away what you end up with is typically a recession and this is going to be the future of western economies unless we get our spending under control because when you spend too much money when you take out too much government debt you have to pay off that debt somehow typically the way that you pay off that debt is you either raise the taxes dramatically or you have to inflate the currency those are usually the best ways of doing that sort of thing or you have to play financial trickeries in which you essentially inflate one type of bond and deflate another type of bond all that is game playing a quantitative easing is usually the government's get out of this sort of stuff and that creates economic stagnation and higher taxation creates economic stagnation. Joe Manchin one of the only sane democrats left in the senate of the United States he says listen you can't tax your way out of debt which apparently is the plan of the Biden administration. You know the president indicated yesterday senator a quoting here I want to be clear I'm going to raise some taxes he didn't outline what taxes he's going to raise you limited those he wanted to increase a couple of years ago where are you on that and what do you think he's talking about. I don't know I'll probably hear something today hopefully of what direction they want to go but I can assure you you can't basically just tax your way out of debt you can't bar your way out of debt and you can't cut your way out of debt. He happens to be correct about all of this. Nouriel Rubini is known as Dr. Doom because he has predicted like 13 of the last two recessions he is predicting doom again but it's worth listening to what he has to say at the very least. He was one of the first economists to call the 2008 recession and he's been warning for months of a stagflationary debt crisis which combines the worst aspects of 70 style stagflation and the 2008 debt crisis he says I believe a stagflationary crisis is going to emerge this year he estimates the federal reserve would need to lift a benchmark rates well above 6% for inflation to fall back to its 2% target but that could spark a severe recession one of the big problems as a Mohammed Al-Aryan has pointed out over at Ali-Auns is that the last federal reserve meeting they raised the interest rates by 25 basis points 0.25 percent before that they've been doing it half a percent right 50 basis points by reducing that they let they gave a signal to the market they thought they had inflation under control the problem is it looks like inflation is ramping back up so now if they reverse themselves it looks like they don't have anything under control so they got a real problem on their hands it looks like they let off the brakes a little bit too early and so this car is still headed toward the cliff just at a slightly slower pace and none of this is going to be good for Joe Biden but it's not going to be good for you because again when politicians tell you that you can have all the things that is a lie every single policy decision is a trade-off every single thing in your life is a trade-off you know this you know this from your own life it can't be in two places at once you can't spend one minute in two different ways and when it comes to government policy there's going to be ups and there's going to be downs to any given policy this is why it annoys me when politicians of all stripes suggest that there is some sort of panacea that there is some sort of utopia available in terms of policy it's just not true it's just not true well when the american public sees the politicians are lying to them they tend to get rather angry and that's what's about to happen to Joe Biden so Joe Biden is getting kind of grumpy who's asked yesterday about when he was going to announce his real elect effort is i'm going to announce when i announce and i'm going to announce when i announce when he announces it meanwhile he is still dodging about when he's going to visit East Palestine, Ohio and this is such an unforced error by Joe Biden i don't understand this at all it's the same kind of unforced error that people who judge made you have to imagine at this point that it is actual spite that he just looks at the people in East Palestine he's like those people aren't going to vote for me anyway i don't want any pictures of myself near a near a blown up train or something here was it Joe Biden answering this question i spoke with every official in the pile democrat and republican on a continuous basis as an intensive agent i laid out and moved it in there when i think the answers are put together and we will be implementing an awful lot to the legislation here and meanwhile Joe Manchin again saying the correct thing Joe Biden should go to East Palestine, Ohio if he wishes to win states like Ohio in the future oh hi governor mike de wine was speaking earlier this morning on this network sir talking about maybe it's time the president really visit East Palestine here that talking about it is agencies dealing with it isn't enough do you agree with that well i can only speak for myself when i was governor i knew i had to be there i knew that gave the confidence to the citizens of my state if i was there i know being a president and having 50 states and all that when you have a tragic tragedy such as this that's 20 miles from the border of west Virginia i spoke to all of their different water departments because some of that had leaked into the Ohio river we're watching that plume as it was floating by they took alternative action to make sure that it wouldn't ingest any of that in the water filtration plants so we were all concerned to a certain extent everybody has a different style i personally if anyway humanly possible would be at the immediately the same day or the day after that anything would happen in my state and he happens to be again correct about that well here's the thing Joe Biden's 20-24 campaign it's already on the ropes the economy is not going to be good heading into the election and not only that and i know that we've all forgotten about this because it happened i mean hell at least two years ago and in political time that is just an enormous amount of time about a year and a half ago but this president of the United States did in fact surrender Afghanistan to a bunch of eighth century barbarians and subject 38 million people to tyranny and cast tens of thousands of people we've made promises to into the jaws of some of the worst human beings in human history and get a bunch of American soldiers killed in the process and as it turns out hand a bunch of like billions of dollars in military equipment over to those people that is something the president did there was a report that came out earlier this week it has been wildly under-covered according to the Wall Street Journal a government watchdog said an abrupt uncoordinated withdrawal from afghanistan in years of problems with planning and oversight of u.s. assistance contributed to the collapse of the western back government in Kabul and the talamand taker over the of the country soon after american force is departed according to a report released on monday poor accountability on weapons and equipment provided to afghanistan and a lack of systemic planning or important factors in the military collapse there according to the report by the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction that document calls out the department of defense for delaying answering official inquiries missing deadlines and providing incomplete answers to questions inspector general they blame on u.s. administration is going all the way back to george w bush they tried to lay blame on donald trump as well and the 2020 dohah agreement which was sort of the predicate for eventual pullout but the biden administration obviously put the capper on this thing biden made quote an even more abrupt exit than anticipated by afghan allies according to the report under joe biden he ignored basically all of the warnings what was going to happen he went out and he lied repeatedly to the american people about what was going to happen in afghanistan and because of those lies people died people died and millions people are now living under a tyranny i mean you remember during this it wasn't that long ago during the afghanistan withdrawal he suggested there was no chance the taliban would just be walking into Kabul and just a couple of months later the taliban was walking into Kabul and by the way a bunch of american soldiers attempting to get innocent people out of harm's way were slaughtered in the process by a bunch of terrorists he had basically had to control the country too joe biden is going to pay a penalty for that god's justice comes in that right quick it is good it is going to happen which presumably is one of the reasons why democrats are clinging to power with like a death grip it's an amazing thing to watch one example of this the latest from senator john fetterman so john fetterman is mentally damaged it is a person who had a debilitating stroke in the middle of a campaign and democrats instead of pulling him during the primaries decided to run him in the general and then during the general when he could not put sentences together they decided to run him anyway and even though this was leading to a worse health condition for him they decided to continue to run him and make him senator from pennsylvania now there is no need for any of that they could have found a substitute democrat that substitute democrat likely would have beaten memed oz because again not through fault of oz per se the top of the democratic ticket joe shapiro won his race by like 14 points very difficult to imagine a race in which the governor of your party wins by 14 and then the senator from your party loses that race but put all of that aside right now there's no reason for john fetterman to be in power john fetterman is not with us john fetterman checked himself into a mental hospital because he has depression apparently suicidal ideation which is terrible and tragic and his family is keeping him in place his family is still keeping him there why there's only reason only one reason pure political cynicism it's the only reason because if john fetterman were to step down tomorrow joe shapiro the democratic governor of pennsylvania would appoint a person to fill his seat there'd still be two years left on that term until the next election cycle and then they'd have to do it again in two years so democrats because they want to keep that seat for six years have decided that they are going to keep a person who is not competent to hold that seat in place at risk of damaging that person the latest story about fetterman by the way is absolutely insane well if you are a person who

employees today head on over to zip recruiter.com slash daily wire once again that is zip recruiter.com slash daily wire also it seems like these days many people on the left are content to live in that post-truth world where facts don't matter and truth like gender is completely fluid the problem is my friend Jordan Peterson points out in his new five part series vision and destiny is the truth is going to come out regardless of what you think or how you feel disregarding the truth especially when it comes to gender dysphoria is very real and potentially tragic consequences here's what Jordan has to say about it the trans activists would come up to me and say well you know you're really hurting me if you don't accept my indeterminacy of identity and I thought well that's what you think but as a trained clinician I think that I'm going to do you a lot more damage in the medium to long run by going along with your claim that you can just be anything you want moment to moment you think that's freeing because you regard all social constraints as inhibitions on the wonderful manifestation of your true self but I know that in order to be healthy in the long run you have to be integrated at multiple levels of social community and when you introduce indeterminacy as to your status at the sex level no one has any idea what to do with you and so how are they going to play with you they don't know what you are in the in some sense that even enables the ballgame to get off the ground and so that's no recipe for long-term well-being because that's always bandied about that notion of well-being and harm it's like no you have to negotiate an identity now the argument that Jordan Megs obviously is that truth is actually the best curative and that living in a land of fantasy is not a curative you should check out the third episode of vision and destiny out today new episodes are releasing every single week but it's exclusive for daily wire plus members head on over to dailywire.com slash subscribe to watch vision and destiny so speaking of john fetterman and democrats desperately claim to power how ridiculous has this story become and kind of shocking how how insane has the story become well they've now released an update on his health. Joe Calvello who is the communications director says quote we don't have a lot to update folks with since there's no real news reports that the john is doing well working with the wonderful doctors he remains on a path to recovery he's visiting visiting with staff and family daily his staff are keeping him updated on senate business and news our team is moving full speed ahead and working tirelessly for the people of pennsylvania just last week we opened a new office in eery and we'll be opening several more offices in the coming weeks and then they add we understand the intense interest in john status and especially appreciate the flood of well wishes however as we have said this will be a week's long process and while we will be sure to keep folks updated as it progresses there is that is all there is to give by way of an update now at the same exact time they're saying there's no update on john peterman's health there is a report that came out same day six u.s. senators including bob kc and john peterman introduced the railway safety act of 2023 to help prevent future trained relevant disasters uh how how how did that happen he's literally in a mental hospital right now how can he join a bipartisan group of senators to introduce legislation it seems like that would be a relevant question for members of the media to ask so you have a person who is not well who's apparently co-sponsoring legislation now and apparently the ai came for the senate now we just have ai algorithms that are running senators offices it's totally wild can you imagine if there was a republican who's legitimately in a state of like a mental hospital and he was co-sponsoring legislation you think there might be questions about whether that person was capable of functioning in the job meanwhile the washington post is doing the washington post does and they have run to defense of josel fetterman so a lot of people on the right including me have questioned josel fetterman in terms of her treatment of her husband here he's not been well for a while here and josel fetterman is a very political person there's been a lot of speculation that she would love to fill her her husband's seat if he were to be if he were to retire from that seat so the media are already running into defense mode so monica has has an entire piece called how josel fetterman became the right wings favorite super villain well i mean i i have a question would you do this to your husband if your wife would you do this to your husband has a debilitating stroke you'd keep him on the campaign trail would you and then you would have him out there in public not able to hear words or speak words properly you would do that to him would you seems like not a great thing to do regardless of who you are but says this this columnist the attacks on josel are dizzying in scope and ambition john fetterman according to one line of grotesque and specious twitter speculation struggled with depression because his wife wouldn't stop seeking the spotlight but then it was also josel's fault when to avoid the spotlight brought on by his hospitalization she decided to take their children to nyagra falls well no those two things are not in conflict actually it turns out that if your husband is in a mental hospital and needs to see you every day going to nyagra falls with the kids is kind of a strange decision in any case the the idea here is that um that you're sexist if you point out that josel fetterman has made some questionable decisions here again democrats must always be defended no matter what and speaking of people clinging to power senator diane feinstein who is overtly not with us she's overtly senate senile at this point the senator from california she's still sitting in the senate why are democrats pushing her to step down again there is no reason except presumably to cling to power i don't see any reason at all because again diane feinstein who is 89 years old is in the state in america california she'd be her replacement be appointed by gavin newson you know american governor so what is it why she said that she wouldn't seek another term in office already so why not just retire her now why not appoint a successor except presumably that gavin newson doesn't want the controversy of appointing another successor because he had to do this with kamala heris when she became vice president and he appointed the unknown alice pedia to fill that particular seat all this is creating a real problem for democrats actually because john fetterman is not president bob kc had prostate cancer surgery last month he's back at work but now diane feinstein is in the hospital which means that they don't actually have a governing majority at this point meanwhile speaking of democrats who have so far escaped scrutiny for what appears to be rather corrupt behavior apparently half s house ethics investigators say they have evidence that representative elixander el cazio cortez so fresh so face the freshest face whoever fresh faced she ran afoul of congressional rules after she was slow to reimburse vendors for clothing and other expenses tied to her participation in 2021 mac alla by it's almost like the socialists who inhabit the squad a very fond of using other people's money to pay off all of their friends and family members they just had a story about cori bush another member of the squad she's an adjunct member of the squad who was apparently paying tens of thousands of dollars to the security contractor who didn't actually have a security license and she ended up she ended up marrying that guy you have illhan omar with all of her payments to the guy who would later become her latest husband who she's not related to apparently that was that was the allegation anyway so very weird how all of your favorite socialists are happy to use everybody else's money including campaign money to benefit people they personally know it's quite fascinating at this particular event ocasio-cortez wore a white dress by fashion brand brother bellies but the words attacks the rich scrawled across the back in red ink the house ethics committee on thursday released a report by the office of congressional ethics an internal nonpartisan ethics office that reviews allegations in mr conson the oce stated in june 2022 report that ocasio-cortez may have accepted impermissible gifts in the form of hair and makeup services those services totaled well over five thousand dollars which is above the limit on gifts for lawmakers set forth in federal law the oce recommended ethics officials subpoena witnesses who didn't cooperate with the probe including brother bellies founder aurora james and other figures but ties to the company so this of course would not be her first run in with the house ethics committee unfortunately a lot of our a lot of our congresspeople have run-ins with the house house ethics committee they're just delighted one wonderful wonderful people in public office speaking of wonderful people in public office it turns out that there is a very very bad person in Delaware he is a Maryland mayor and he has now been indicted arrested on more than 50 counts of child pornography his name is patrick wojan of course the party of his identity the party with which he identifies does not appear anywhere in the cnn report literally nowhere it's not in the headline it's not in the piece he is a democrat of course not only is he a democrat as it turns out he is very very close with boudi judge the secretary of transportation sometimes the gods conspire to keep you from being president of the united states is what pete boudi judge is learning he was a self-described mentee of pete boudi judge and uh they took a bunch of pictures together january 23rd 2020 he tweeted out a picture of himself with boudi judge and a quote from boudi judge if you notice a pattern across all my policies it's this the answers don't all have to come from washington much of the resources should on my watch they will support american mayors and cities they used to hang out tweet out just two mayors grabbing a beer together yee not not a particularly good association for um for the for the current secretary of transportation who has run just into the jaws of fate right here and meanwhile we have some updates on the roald dahl bollarder bolderization so you remember that roald dahl the author of charlotte chocolat factory and matilda and james jambhij the publishers decided they were going to go through and they were going to woke up his stories which is absurd the stories are deliberately unwoke they're all about how the world's a mean nasty place and kids have to get used to it and deal with it well who exactly was leading the boulderization of the of the works it turns out according to the daily mail the editors who spent months neutering the works of roald dahl were led on their mission to not offend by an individual who describes herself as a quote non binary asexual polyamorous relationship anarchist who's on the autism spectrum slow clap for the walkies slow clap for you guys i mean you just appoint the intellectual and emotional giants of our age to destroy the literature of people who actually create things in our world the bolderization of dahl's works which broadly included eliminating language deemed insensitive and non-inclusive was done by a uk based group of consultants from inclusive minds in the case of the rolled dahl debacle there's a person named joe ross bared who's at the head of the project ross bared describes herself as again a non binary asexual polyamorous relationship anarchist if you are non binary and asexual doesn't that mean you don't have relationships but she's in a polyamorous relationship in relationship anarchist what is a relationship anarchist exactly you like blow up relationships you like leave bombs randomly in relation to former project manager at the woke form and uh she posted on linkedin in 2022 she was working on a secret project involving the work of a well-known children's author in a profile of bared they them is described as a writer and editor with a passion for championing inclusive content and policies bared's previous work has been published in ba bitable and anthology by evil got it got it got it she's back it's an anthology about bisexuality and related identities and az journal an online magazine for aromantic spectrum asexual spectrum and agender people these are the people who should be taking yeah great works of children's literature and absolutely destroying them these are it is amazing how you have an entire leech class who is just all they do is live off the creations of others and destroy those creations they're like cultural locusts they just descend from the sky onto actual creativity and destroy it destroy it wholesale and this is if there's one rule among the woke is that they have not created anything of value anytime in recent history and they spend all day basically just ripping into people who actually did things during their life which brings us to whoopi golberg so yesterday whoopi golberg decided that she would defend tearing down a statue of abraham lincoln so here you have pitted against one another a person who has not acted in 20 years and who has been sitting on the view a repository of most stupidity in the universe and by the way has engaged in her very name in a wild act of cultural appropriation because her actual name is not whoopi golberg she's not in fact jewish talking about tearing down a statue of the great emancipator who fought the civil war to end slavery these these are the people we have decided to put in charge of our cultural steering wheel Abraham lincoln was not a controversial figure among liberals we liked him now they take his name off schools and tear down his statues really lincoln isn't good enough for you well that statue was not good enough because it showed a slave down at lincoln's feet and if we're tearing down statues that are really not in tune with where we are as a nation or at least where we were a couple of months ago uh yeah you gotta take it down you gotta take it down says whoopi golberg because she of course has been just a massively creative voice in our nation's bedroom it's very very important stuff all right it's time for some things i like and then some things that i hate so things i like today so russell brand is one of the most creative minds out there russell is a fascinating i've had several conversations with him he is shockingly intelligent and also just eclectic is all hell i mean if you talk with him it's sort of like watching somebody pick apples randomly off a tree it's it's an amazing it's a very strange and weird experience he did a really good interview with joe rogan the other day they were talking about the the attempts by tuss science to shut down all conversation around important topics around in covid and here's what russell brand had to say and the horse medicine was the same they had the option of saying look we don't know that there's no evidence as yet i've amectin is effective in these spaces because no one's trialing it because there's no money in it because science is a subset of big pharma and the economic headquarters the rifling no one's doing experiments into natural immunity because natural immunity is not profitable no one's doing those those experiments are not being under it and there's no clinical trials for that because no one wants that they are forbidden indeed of a steroid of all of the things that came out as ultimately effective once the profits have been gleaned okay so he's not wrong about this that big pharma obviously does not have a tremendous interest in researching natural immunity because there's no profit margin there but that's what he's missing is that's where the government theoretically should step in right so when it comes to the government and lack of profit incentive that would be like a a question of the comments right where there's a public good that needs to be pursued and isn't going to be pursued by private industry and where the government has a rather large stake in determining whether natural immunity is just as good as vaxim unity or better and the government did nothing about it that's the part that's insane you're not surprised that big pharma didn't research natural immunity why would they again that's not actually their job they create drugs to solve problems but if natural immunity were to be researched wouldn't it be the government that could have saved billions and billions and billions of dollars by looking in natural immunity and by the way save economies all across the world by looking in the natural why didn't they do that that's the real question so i think Russell's answer would be that a lot of members of the government are kind of in the pay of big pharma that's not a terrible answer but i think that there's something else going on which is that a lot of members of government like the control they like being in control and if they'd actually research natural immunity if they looked at the data very early on from the san ochlear to study that was done by j about a charia looking at the levels of the antibodies that were prevalent in san ochlear to like really early on then that might have undercut their entire argument for controlling every aspect of your life but again i'm glad that that Russell is having that conversation with joe rogan and uh good for for Russell for having that conversation okay time for some things that that i hate so i'm i'm really sick of hearing men ramble about the evils of quote unquote toxic masculinity i'm really tired of it how about to fend a good version of masculinity rather than spending all your days jabbering about toxic masculinity and you need a replacement theory when it comes to masculinity if the idea is toxic masculinity is super bad and you need to replace that with something better i need to advocate for what the better is because otherwise what you're gonna get is just toxic masculinity versus what a femininity you need to provide an alternative for men to turn to a set of obligations that men have a thing for them to do in the world so i say this because doug m-hoff the first lady slash first gentleman of of the of the united states government um he is married to kamala Harris he's the second gentleman i'm sorry he uh he's out there on msm dt during women's history month condemning toxic masculinity and this sort of crap is just so tiresome can we just talk about masculinity for a moment um as being second gentleman changed your own view of perceived gender roles of what it means to be a man whoof that's this is something i've i've thought about a lot and something i've spoken about a lot there's too much of toxicity it's masculine toxicity out there and we've kind of confused what it means to be a man what it means to be masculine and put this out there we're siding right now is is lacking well the big problem big shortcoming is not lack of masculinity we need more masculinity in our society we need more good responsible hardworking and and masculine men in our society we are society that is descended into androgyny that has decided to privilege femininity above masculinity even for men and this is a mistake if you want there to be a society the values of strong men and then you should incentivize strong men to be strong you shouldn't treat it as borderline toxicity when men open doors for women you shouldn't treat it as borderline toxicity when men say they want to provide for their wives and children you shouldn't treat it as somehow in infringement on female prerogatives for men to want to get ahead in the workplace like i i what we have done in our society is we have taken away all the responsibilities for men and then when men get angry then we label it toxic masculinity and we say that really what we need is for you guys to basically just be blobs just be blobs and then we're surprised when men are depressed and upset and suicidal and don't have jobs and they're unemployed they're not going to college take away the role that people are supposed to play in life and they have no role and then they turn to negative things ripping on toxic masculinity ain't going to do the trick here especially when you're providing no actual models for real masculinity out there it's really a problem okay we are we are going to bring back something that we haven't done here in a while here on the bench bureau show it's something we used to do a long time ago and the fact is that for years and years and years there's been an infusion of left wing political bias into children's literature and so a few years ago we used to do something on this show and we liked to call Uncle Ben's SJW story time all righty folks so today on Uncle Ben's SJW storytime we'll be reading you a book that your school libraries will probably be having a drag queen read your book it's very it reads your children it's very important that you see the kind of crap that is read here kids during SJW storytime so here we go today's book is a story by the changemakers it has handled the courage to be truly free Coco's blueprint for self revival and of course this whole thing is about how um we're gonna turn the frickin zebra's gay yeah that's that's that's actually what this book is about so here we go the courage to be truly free it's dedicated to overcoming legislation like the florida parental rights and education act the don't say gay bill which aims to silence youth in search of their identities now first it's published by the alliance for lgbtq wyx happy face emoji youth um i love that that their entire goal is to is to find youth help you find their identities you know it's the easiest thing in the world uh to to find your identity because you're living it right now it's you congratulations we found it also the actual hard thing to do is to civilize children and provide them rules rules and responsibilities okay but that's not what this book is about it's about yelling at rondasantas so this is a book that is now being provided to public schools across the nation to fight rondasantas rondasant here we go the day was just like any other it was a time for school and recess and play a cocoa didn't really like going to school because others were mean especially mule mule's a homophobic republican is is mule that's a big problem here mule would say things like why are you so weird i'm different okay says the little zebra you can't say that here and cocoa would feel a familiar pain in their tummy their tummy what's wrong with me why do they look at me funny says cocoa the zebra it's all about the bullying guys that's really all that happens in school the next morning cocoa awoke to a curious new friend they were tall and spotted and could make their neckband out to giraffe what are you doing down there all alone i ran away into the great big unknown says he were wondering if others could ever love me for me and then giraffe who is genetically unrelated to zebra of course that's i love you for you it's okay to just be zebra apparently has no no parents to provide guidance here after breathing and learning just what to do cocoa saw a few colored stripes shined through oh cocoa's a gay zebra oh oh cocoa can't just accept that zebras are not in fact rainbow but that that's how we're after feeling feeling more brave just after dawn it were stopped by three donkeys from venturing on one is a red-headed maga donkey by the way be just like us and put this clay on your skin no i don't want that i don't want to fit in no it's important no no social response no cocoa tried and tried to shake off the clay and met a soft-hearted elephant along the way hi there friend why are you looking so sad says glad elephant someone tried to change me and it felt really bad yeah you can't change children guys kids should just be allowed to do whatever they want and you shouldn't provide them with any sort of guidance at all that's the thing about kids you should let them eat whatever they want study whatever they want not go to school whenever they want and generally be little greetings which is what small children are i have three of them hey you'll be just fine let's get rid of that clay an elephant help them rinse it away a surrogate parents coming in that's great by now for cocoa things will be coming more clear until a swarm of flies buzzed by their ear your difference say the flies you're strange you don't belong cocoa swatted the flies and tried to say strong uh all righty hummingbird showed them a blossoming field saying let's sing some new words to help you heal world words like i have purpose and my feelings are real oh my feelings are real because that that's the best way to teach kids is that all of their feelings are both real and justified because kids are not selfish little creatures with a lot of feelings they have really big feelings and tiny bodies and not fully developed prefrontal cortexes but you should just tell them that their feelings are the most important thing about them so alpaca gave cocoa their own fun new style they saw all the color and lit up with a smile oh here comes surrogate parent alpaca to teach the zebra to be very exciting confidently cocoa walked by a big waterfall but this time they didn't feel trapped at all oh look look all color it's a gay zebra they turned the zebra they turned the frickin zebra's cocoa thought about giraffe elephant and hummingbird chicken alpaca and the lessons they'd learned breathe when you need never hide who you are listen to your own voice when it gets dark shine like a star don't be like others be brave and be you find the courage to be free in all that you do yes no limitations authenticity follow your own star after gathering all these incredible tools cocoa marched with confidence right back to school what happened to you says evil mule what are you supposed to be oh it comes the punchline i found the courage to finally be me the courage to stand out and be truly free oh take that rondestances to gay zebra okay folks yeah this sort of non-subtle messaging that you find in children's books it's there they're not they're not trying to hide the ball particularly much and then if you notice it they're like oh do you disagree with this message uh yeah i don't think that what kids actually truly need is to be free i think what kids actually truly then i don't think kids need to find themselves i think what kids generally need is guidance i think they need purpose and meaning given to them by their parents and by their community and i think that when you free kids of this what you are actually doing is essentially unleashing a chaotic world upon them that they are not prepared to handle at all but at least we have a children's book that that yells at rondestances in the in the dedication solid stuff
