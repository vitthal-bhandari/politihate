    "text": " Okay, the Harley Quinn pigtails are fun, but they are like impossible to get even. Is this what drove her crazy? Trying to get them to match? Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Today we're going to be talking about Birds of Prey and more broadly, the current state of female led action movies. Now if you didn't know, Birds of Prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn, which yes is the film's full title, is a spin off of 2016's Suicide Squad, and if you keep up with entertainment news, you'll know that Birds of Prey has been the center of some controversy in that progressive activists and fans have once again kind of found themselves at opposite ends of either loving or hating a new adaptation of an existing franchise. So in this episode, I'm going to do my best to explain what's been behind all the bickering we've seen online, and although I wouldn't necessarily call this a standard review of the movie because we have a lot more to talk about than just that, I will be discussing the film's actual content because I did go see it opening day. But first I have a quick message from our sponsor Black Rifle Coffee Company.

So to make sure we're all up to speed, in 2016 DC put out the movie Suicide Squad featuring an ensemble cast. Big names like Will Smith, Viola Davis, Scott Eastwood, Cara Delevingne and Jared Leto were all in the project. And even though that movie ended up performing pretty decently at the box office, the overwhelming consensus was that in terms of quality, it was a confused jumbled mess. Suicide Squad, objectively, not a good movie. However, there was one character that emerged as the film's breakout star and that's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. If there was one good thing or one popular thing to come out of Suicide Squad, it was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn at Halloween parties or Comic-Cons in 2016. You probably weren't seeing any dead shots or any enchantresses or other characters from Suicide Squad, but you could be dang sure you'd be seeing a crap ton of Harley Quinn's. And honestly, I get it. Margot Robbie is gorgeous and she was awesome as Harley Quinn. I understand the popularity for sure, but it is important to note at this point that although almost everyone had Harley Quinn fever in 2016, some people who were not fans of the portrayal were feminists. Yeah, as much as feminists are rooting for Birds of Prey and the new woke Harley Quinn now, keep in mind that when Suicide Squad first came out, a lot of them, not saying the supplies to all of them, but a lot of them, were not thrilled. Articles like how Suicide Squad uses and abuses Harley Quinn and Suicide Squad's retrograde misogyny, the trials of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn were super critical of things like the way the character was stressed, how she was portrayed as being crazy, her relationship with the Joker and her relative helplessness in the film compared to other characters. But whatever, apparently the studio was so into Robbie's performance that they began working on a spinoff Harley Quinn movie before Suicide Squad was even released. Enter Birds of Prey, which did just come out this past Friday and tells the story of Harley Quinn having just broken up with the Joker and trying to get herself out of all sorts of trouble now that she's no longer under the Joker's protection. Look, if you guys are just here to hear what I think about the actual movie, I won't leave you hanging, it's a mixed bag. If you're only looking for, hey, some fun action scenes, some more scenes with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and you're happy to have some really colorful, stylized direction, snappy dialogue, and a solid soundtrack, then I think you're gonna like this movie. This movie does have some good aspects, absolutely. On the other hand though, if you're someone who really cares about story and character and you feel the need to connect with the message of the film, but you don't hate men, then you may have a problem with this movie because I think it's safe to say, and I mean this completely seriously, this movie does hate men. I am not exaggerating when I say that there is not a single male character in this film, that is not a dick, that is not villainous. Literally every single man is bad and all the women are awesome and empowered and competent. The messaging here is really quite transparent and if you guys are familiar with my movie reviews, you'll know that I don't need to agree with the politics of a film to enjoy it and heck in a lot of ways, I did enjoy this movie as in, like, I found it entertaining. Honestly, I'm not hard to please, make me chuckle, give me some explosions, I'll be relatively content. But just because it's a fun movie that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie and I had a certain point, if your political message is just all men bad, all women good, then that's not really a question of simply do I agree with this message, that's just bad writing, that's lazy. This movie has zero subtlety, there is no nuance whatsoever with its feminist agenda and honestly, that's no surprise literally four years, the people involved with the film have been touting how woke it is. Way back in 2018 it was reported that quote, Margot Robbie is hoping to have a diverse cast around her for Birds of Prey. During an interview with Yahoo, Robbie was asked about the developmental process for Birds of Prey and the diversity it already has brought. The film hired Kathy Yan to direct, making her the first Asian woman to direct a superhero movie. The hiring of Yan will be just the start of the diversity on set if Robbie has anything to say about it as she wants diverse co-stars too. When asked if the diverse hiring will spread to the casting process, Robbie said, yep, yes exactly, real life isn't so one specific image, we've got to reflect that on screen. And the article also notes that not only did she want Yan to direct, but previous reports noted the desire for an all female crew during production. I really think those statements mark when many fans of the comics started to become concerned over what direction Birds of Prey might be taking, but conversely, and not coincidentally, this is also when the feminists started carrying some water for the film and for a character, they had previously criticized. And don't get me wrong, all female crews and cast, people of every color under the rainbow, those things can make for a good movie, but they don't, by default, make for a good movie. And I think people are justified in being skeptical when those who are in charge of making the movie seem more preoccupied with diversity than like, I don't know, characters, story, all that jazz. And we've got a lot more to cover, but first I want to tell you all about NetSuite. If you don't know your numbers, you don't know your business.

Then in October of 2019, I.E. last year, you and McGregor, who placed the film's villain, black mask, said some things that really proudly proclaimed that yes, this movie would be woke as hell. As cinema blend reports, McGregor commented that, what interested me with Birds of Prey is that it's a feminist film. There is in the script a real look on misogyny. And I think we need that. We need to be more aware of how we behave with the opposite sex. We need to be taught to change. Misogynists in movies are often extreme. They rape, they beat women, and it is legitimate to represent people like that because they exist and they are obviously the worst. But in the Birds of Prey dialogues, there is always a hint of everyday misogyny. Of those things you say as a man you don't even realize. Man's planing. And it's in the script in a very subtle way. I found that brilliant. The phrase get woke, go broke, exists for a reason. Inserting progressive feminist messaging into existing franchises where it didn't exist before has been an ongoing issue in entertainment media. And frankly, fans at this point are pretty sick of it. And no, this isn't due to any racism or sexism or any type of bigotry like some verified Twitter check marks, my claim it is, it's just, it's frustration. But so often now a social agenda takes precedence over things like plot characters or canon. Plus video games and comic books and the fantasy and sci-fi genres as a whole, and by extension their audiences, for literally generations, they've tended to be at the forefront of inclusion, just naturally. Characters like Wonder Woman or Lara Croft or Blade or Ripley or Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, they were kicking butts and taking names way before a bunch of blue-haired activists started complaining that media wasn't diverse enough. So for fans to have the franchises that they love turned into shoddly-made vehicles to deliver ideological propaganda only to be called bigoted when they voiced their disapproval, of course they're unhappy. A story about Harley Quinn who was coming out of a dysfunctional, destructive, codependent relationship and her quest to make it on her own, that would be interesting from a character standpoint, there's a good story in there. And that is what Birds of Prey tries to paint itself as, but the problem is that that kind of storyline would actually require Harley Quinn to show some weaknesses, some vulnerabilities. But because this movie needs all women to be super empowered right from the get-go, it doesn't allow for that kind of character development. Sure, Harley Quinn is sad that she broke up with the Joker when the film starts and she's vulnerable in that sense, I guess, but the idea that Harley Quinn is so lost trying to make it on her own for the first time, that never feels genuine because she's literally kicking everyone's ass throughout the entire movie. This is not the story of someone who has to learn how to make it on their own, it's the story of someone who's pretty much indestructible going from sad and powerful to less sad and powerful. Harley only really shows weakness twice that I can think of, once when the plot needs her to be saved by another female character and another time when the plot needs her to be beaten up by another female character. Oh, and by the way, if you're someone who finds it hard to suspend disbelief when 115 pound women with absolutely no type of supernatural abilities beat the crap out of 250 pound men as if it were no big deal, then you're not going to like this movie because that's essentially the movie. I get that feminism needs women to be super strong, stronger than men, girl power number one, but if you're protagonists, regardless of their gender really, are just so easily defeating anyone who tries to cross them, then there's not really any sense of stakes in the movie. For example, at one point in the movie, Harley Quinn single-handedly storms a police station takes on all the cops that are there, beats up all the prisoners, plus defeats an armed gang of bounty hunters. You would think that would be pretty challenging for her to do, right, as just one person and it might show her how, without the joker or anyone else to help her, she can't just keep doing all the crazy things she used to. But it turns out it's just, to quote a great man, super easy, barely and inconvenience. Takes her like 20 minutes tops, not really any planning, and she is totally fine. And it's not just Harley Quinn who's pretty much indestructible in the movie, by the way, all the other female characters are too, I guess girl guides include like an MMA badge or something in their universe. Speaking of the other female characters, where the conflict online over birds of prey really got heated, was when just last month in January, some gross, toxic, patriarchal fans had the audacity to not be attracted to the birds of prey cast. Those bastards. As one man wrote, you know why birds of prey is gonna bomb just like Charlie's Angels did? They've removed any sex appeal these characters had to appeal to a female girl power audience instead of the core male comic book audience. They literally don't know who they're making this movie for. Like even women want to see attractive women on screen. Cause players want hot characters to emulate. None of the birds of prey characters have any sex appeal. They even toned down Harley Quinn to make her less sexy, despite that being her biggest draw in Suicide Squad. And another person said about one of the characters in particular, it's like they told Mary Elizabeth Winston, you can't be sexy in this movie. We don't do that here. To these opinions, woke writers did not take kindly. One headline about the tweets said that middle aged man babies are mad that the birds of prey women aren't sexy enough. And the Mary Sue chastised, excuse you, the women of birds of prey have tons of sex appeal. As well as misogynists already bashing birds of prey without seeing it. Where have I seen this before? I know this is gonna be controversial for me to say, but I kinda agree with those men. When I go see a movie, I fully admit to being shallow. If I have to stare at people's faces for two hours, I would rather they be good looking faces. If I wanted to see ugly people act, I would go to a theater production. And it's not a gender thing for me and I don't think it is for most other people or the entertainment industry as a whole either. You don't think there's a reason Henry Cavill and not Steve Bachemi was cast as Superman. You think it was purely raw acting talent that got Jason Momoa, the role of Aquaman instead of Danny DeVito. And of course Margot Robbie is gorgeous as always. It would be an effort for her to not look good. Same goes for the actress who plays Lactinary, but you can tell when watching this movie that having sexy or hot characters was not the goal, especially since Margot Robbie and the film's director explicitly said, it was not the goal. As the Mary Sue wrote in July of last year, quote Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is one of the DCEU's most beloved characters, but her initial design and suicide squad was problematic to say the least. It might be a Halloween costume staple, but it's not necessarily the most feminist of get-ups. It's looking like that will change though, given the first looks revealed of her Birds of Prey costumes. And we have the female creatives behind the scenes to thank for that. Heroes of Prey costume designer Erin Benak said, that's what happens when you have a female producer, director, writer. Robbie agreed adding, yeah, it's definitely less male-gazey. And the writer concluded that, Cathy Yan is clearly shooting Harley through the female gaze. She's not a sex object, but a fully realized character. And she noted that she can't wait to see how they undo the damage done to Harley by suicide squad and to see her as a fully realized character rather than an object for the camera to lust after. You cannot cheer the fact that, yay, these female characters are toning down their sex appeal to men, while simultaneously complaining that, hey, men don't find these female characters sexually appealing. In the end though, should you go see this movie, I'll leave that up to you. If you're just looking for an upbeat action flick and you're a big fan of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, then I don't think you're going to be disappointed. But if you're looking for something with deeper emotional resonance, something with a more fleshed out plot and characters, and especially if you're tired of being hit over the head with a feminist agenda, then I would give this a miss. That's pretty much all I have to say for now though, and as always, I would love to know what you guys think. Are you planning on seeing birds of prey, why, or why not? Let me know. But that's it for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in, and I'll see you next time."
