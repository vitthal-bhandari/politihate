So how big an issue will abortion be when people vote? It is certainly among the issues that are driving women to the polls and according to polls we look at driving support for Democrats. It's also an issue with candidates who've taken a position either Republican or Democrat and certainly with Lindsey Graham's proposed bill to ban abortion nationwide. It's so important in virtually any Senate race. But there is another way that abortion is an important driver of the polls, this election cycle and in a much more direct way. Just as Kansas defeated an initiative this summer to add restrictions to people's reproductive rights, the fate of these restrictions, including policies that take absolutely no exceptions in restricting abortions, are directly on the ballot in a number of states and could prevail. Those initiatives themselves could also bring people to the ballot and to vote who might not have otherwise. So I want to explore what the impact of these initiatives are in various states because we could sit here post-election with a very different reality for many people. And I've got two great people who are joining me the conversation today. Fatima Goss Graves is the president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund. Welcome to the bubble Fatima. Thanks for having me. And I'm very excited also to have Kimberly Ines Mcguire who's the executive director for Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, or ERGE, a grassroots organization who's also was very involved this summer in what was going on in Kansas. So welcome, Kimberly. Happy to be here. All right. So let's pick this apart. Maybe the way to start, Kimberly, if you could give us a bit of a lay of the land before we get to the midterms, how many states have enacted abortion restrictions since the Dobs decision? How many still have protections? And maybe there's probably a middle ground that you may be able to inform us about where there's some restrictions. Yeah. So unfortunately, the landscape is looking really bleak. We have close to half the country that has either banned abortion or passed restrictions so severe that abortion is effectively unavailable. And we know based on where those bans are across huge swaths of the south and the Midwest, that a majority of people of color in this country are living in states where abortion is banned, or may as well be. At the same time, we are still living with the legacy of, before the Supreme Court decision, the hundreds of abortion restrictions that were passed all across the country. So even in states that may have escaped a total ban, folks are still being forced to delay care, make multiple appointments, jump through all sorts of hoops. And if they can do all that, folks are still because of the Hyde Amendment being forced to pay out of pocket for basic and essential pregnancy-related care. So the landscape is looking really challenging, most of all, for people of color, young people, and folks who are living paycheck to paycheck. And Fatima, one thing I just want to make sure it's clear is, you know, at the time the Dobs passed, the focus was on abortion. It's becoming clear that the impact goes well beyond abortion. It goes to almost anything that can happen to a woman while she's pregnant. I'm wondering if you have a perspective on how to think about what is really at stake here. It goes to what can happen to someone who's pregnant, but it goes to even bigger pieces than that. I mean, in the Dobs decision, and I think this is one of the reasons people are so enraged, they called the question about whether or not our lives, bodies, and futures actually matter, and you will notice that women and anyone who's pregnant, they were barely mentioned in the decision as having an important impact. But it also tugged at this thread, and we're already seeing this play out in states because these long decisions that said it is your ability to determine whether you have an abortion, they come from a line of cases that are also about your ability to determine whether or not you access contraception, your ability to determine who you're in a relationship with, or whether you can get married and more. And so some of this is a question of what are fundamental freedoms in this country and whether we are all unequal fitting. And the Supreme Court seemed to answer that with a no. And so that has led some of the most extreme lawmakers to say, I have a license to do whatever I want, and there will not be a check. So I think that's in part what's feeling this rage, right? It is a sense that it is out of control and to the extent that there is control, it has been given to a small number of folks to enact things that the majority of people in this country don't want to happen. And so we talk all the time about how well, you know, elections matter, and this is what elections are all about, and we tend to think about elections about being about mostly about candidates. And I want to get to candidates in a bit, but there's also this direct democracy notion, which we saw in Kansas, where things could happen right on the ballot by people showing up, just as a reminder, because it was a couple months ago, Kimberly, can you remind us what happened in Kansas? Yeah, it was really incredible to see the overwhelming turnout of Kansas voters in an August primary election, right? Not an election that typically brings a lot of people out, not an election everybody necessarily knows about, but what was on the ballot was a measure that would have removed from the Kansas Constitution, what is now understood as the right to access abortion. And this ballot initiative was deceptive, it was confusing, the language was was terrible and even counterintuitive. But once Kansas understood that this ballot initiative would actually use their Constitution against them to take away a basic right, Kansas of all ideological stripes came out in droves. And in particular, new voter registrants, young people, people who'd never voted before, when they got wind of this said, absolutely not. And urge was really proud to be on the ground with the abortion clinic, abortion funds, other folks who are getting the word out and really mobilizing in particular, young people to say, absolutely not. And that same trick, if you will, had been pulled previously, unfortunately, in Alabama, Louisiana, West Virginia and Tennessee. Unfortunately, in those four states, the ballot was weaponized against the rights of the people to get that kind of language through. So, those four states went the other way. Fortunately, in Kansas, we were able to secure the victory. So Fatima, it sounds like what happened in Kansas, even putting aside the outcome, but just the very fact that the voters got to decide is about to happen in a few more places. How do you feel about that? Do you think that's the right way or a good way for this to occur? So you should understand that I definitely entered this conversation in part as a lawyer. And as the child of plaintiffs who brought civil rights cases for our freedom. So I grew up thinking and believing in our Constitution as being a thing that should be protective for people in this country. And so I'm having my own mourning period with the state of the courts and the state of our Constitution. And I believe it is up to all of us in this moment, no matter where you sit, to exercise whatever power you have to protect people, to preserve access. And I believe, you know, whether you're talking about Kansas or what I believe will happen in states like Michigan, that people having the opportunity to so directly express their frustration and anger with this decision and say, actually, I want something different for myself, my family, my community. That's a very powerful act. And I'm so glad it is available in this cycle. But ultimately, and in the end, I believe a healthy democracy has as a foundational notion that we are equal and that we have these sorts of freedoms. So Kimberly, can you take us through the states that have on the ballot actions, which would restrict abortion rights if they were to pass? Yeah, so we're looking at Kentucky, where we have a very similar initiative to what happened in Kansas. They've all been copying and pasting the same language. And then we have in Montana, on the ballot, what effectively a yes vote would pave the way for this really bogus, disingenuous legislation to pass that makes pregnancy care harder to get while also having no foundation in like science or medicine or, you know, truth. So very concerned about, you know, Kentucky and Montana and what could happen there? Okay. And how about states that have something on the ballot that would protect or even enhance the reproductive freedom for pregnant people? So we are very excited to be watching California, Michigan and Vermont, all of which would basically allow voters the opportunity to either enshrine in the state constitution or to deepen existing state constitutional protections, whether those are determined by courts or language that actually affirmatively exists. And we're really excited to be working closely with partners in California on Proposition 1, which, you know, really would stand to put California at the leading edge of abortion access and a model for the rest of the country. Tell us a little bit about that model. What would it actually do? So what's exciting about Proposition 1 is it goes beyond the sort of bare right to access abortion and it recognizes that just because something is legal doesn't mean we can actually get it, right? So Proposition 1 would go further in presenting what isn't in many ways an affirmative right to access abortion. And so it would create more opportunities, for example, for low-income people, right, who, you know, if abortion's legal, but you can't afford it, is it really a right in truth? So California would do more to ensure that people from a variety of backgrounds and life situations would actually go beyond abortion being legal and make it actually accessible. Let's take a quick break. I want to come back and talk to Kimberly and Fatima about not only what's like that happened in those states, but also some of the candidates and the fate of some of the other things that are at stake in November. And then really see, will this cause people to show up? This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Boller and you might know me from another Lemonade on Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved noninvasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your health care provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. False positive and negative results may occur. Any positive result should be followed by a colonoscopy, not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Get your screenings, everyone. So something I do actually pay a lot of attention to is my bed sheets. I only get so many hours of sleep at night. So I try to make them count. So when I say I approve of a bed sheet, you know it's a real deal. And I'm of course talking about cozy earth bamboo sheets. My God, you guys, these sheets have actually changed my sleep and changed my life. And if my maybe two emphatic endorsement is enough, the cozy earth bamboo sheets are also endorsed by the one and only Oprah. And we all know how well she sleeps. Cozy earth's best selling bamboo sheet set was named one of Oprah's favorite things in 2018. Huh, I'd like to get on that list. They also offer pillows and blankets, letting you deck out your whole bedroom in true luxury. Every time I slide into these sheets, I feel like I'm staying at a hotel. They're next level soft and so, so, so breathable. I don't like to feel too bummed up at night when I sleep in cozy earth's responsible, sourced, temperature regulating bamboo, viscose bedding. It's perfect for me. So cozy earth provided an exclusive offer for our listeners today. Up to 35% off, site wide when you use the code in the bubble. That's cozy earth.com and code in the bubble. So it sounds like we have Kentucky, Montana, Michigan, Vermont, California, where we have really the direct outcome of people's access to reproductive care is directly on the ballot. So what do we think is going to happen? Which one do you want to fathom a kind of a sense of what you're seeing on the ground and what either polls or other things are telling you? I can start by speaking to California and perhaps this won't surprise folks who sort of think of California as this progressive beacon in times. We're really optimistic about proposition one. There has been a groundswell of support and, you know, honestly, there's a point of pride, I think, for many Californians in creating a state where access is enshrined, including because California has the longest border with other states, right? So not only is California enshrining access for Californians, but with the recognition that many folks already and will continue to need to come to California for their care and in effect creating a safe place for people who need access. I want to ask you another kind of related question. Maybe, Fatima, you could take a shot at this. There are a number of people like yourselves that have been advocates and policy leaders in this space. There are obviously people who are, we call themselves pro-life, but it seems to one of the things that's emerging is that there are a number of people who they may be somewhere in the middle. They may not have ever declared, they may not have ever been extremely comfortable with the notion of abortion, men and women, but they also really don't like the state coming in and saying that someone can't do what they want to do with their bodies. And they really don't like these highly restrictive episodes. And there appear to be people who are sort of maybe never really spent as much time on this issue, who are starting to say, you know what, if I have to take a position, I may be a conservative, but I am not comfortable with the state getting involved in this decision. I agree. And so what I actually think two things made it a motivator. The first is a right was taken away. It's hard for people to get up and say, the thing that I'm going to fight the most for is the thing I think I already have. You don't think you have to fight for the thing you have. And so to see it so suddenly taken away, people were surprised. And as much as we have spent the last couple of years trying to tell people this was coming, it wasn't until it arrived, I think, that it hit people so squarely. So that's one thing. And then the second thing, you sort of name that there are all these people who are sort of, you know, almost coming out of the woodwork to say, actually, when I think about it, I support the freedom to make these decisions. And that is because, you know, abortion access has been so roundly stigmatized and shamed. People were afraid to say it out loud. And so now you have a lot of folks who understand what's on the line, and they're willing to be brave even. They're willing to tell their own experiences. They're willing to say out loud in settings that may be different types of settings. Actually, I believe this is an issue of freedom. And I think it's the thing you name that in general, there is a strong strain in this country, fundamentally, that we do not like politicians telling us what to do in our private lives. And I want to jump in here, because I think the dynamics are really interesting. So on the one hand, you know, it's one thing to have sort of an ideological or philosophical debate about the morality of abortion, when you know that access is there. And we've long heard from clinic staff and clinic escorts that some of the people who come in and get abortions are people who were protesting out from the clinic the week before, right? That surprises nobody who works in abortion access, right? And so it has long been the case that people who access abortion come from a full range of ideological positions. What's different now is in, you know, path the country, basically, that access has gone away. And that has outraged people. And it is absolutely what we saw in Kansas. I mean, there's, you know, we know from our research from polling, there are folks who voted with us in Kansas, not because they themselves have made up their minds about abortion. In some cases, they may even personally be opposed, but it's very different when the state is going to ban it and take it away from everybody. So what we're seeing is a coming together of people who are outraged and very supportive and pro-abortion access, as well as people who are going, you know what, maybe I wouldn't make that choice, but now you're taking that choice away. And it's no longer theoretical, right? The clinic doors have been shuttered. And so now if me or my cousin or my daughter or my friend needs that care, right, regardless of whether they were protesting out last week, now it's gone. Yeah. It reminds me if we were adjacent to the marriage equality battle and proposition in Minnesota a few years back, and it was interesting because the kind of libertarian Republicans were very bought into the argument that the state should not decide who could marry whom. And that was kind of a surprising thing that happened. And it happened. It was a matter that, you know, they may have said, I'm not particularly a fan of gay marriage at that point in time. But when push came to shove and it came to the ballot, they felt strongly that way. There was an article, and I'm guessing you've seen it, that came out in Politico last week, which basically said that in very conservative areas, conservative, non-college educated white women are motivated by this issue now because they essentially don't buy the fact that when they're in an exam room with their physician or getting any kind of medical care that the state should have any say in what happens. And when they particularly see the highly restrictive politician who says, no exceptions, that is stirring them to consider this issue in a new way. And so I guess what I'm asking is, are we in fact forming a new point of view in part driven by what you both just said, which is you don't worry about your right until they take it from you. And in part, because there are some people who have just not really thought deeply, never had to take a position on the issue, and maybe had a very complicated point of view. If someone talked about if they were at a cocktail party and someone said, what do you think? They've had a very complicated point of view. But now they're sort of having to declare, do you sense that that's happening in any kind of large numbers? I appreciate you've been using the word complicated, because I think the Supreme Court in these outrageous laws have made it not so complicated. When you're talking about an outright ban, when you're talking about putting providers in jail for 100 years, when you're talking about following people from state to state, that's an all out assault. And so I think the question right now has been called. And that you may have a conservative identity. And that identity may be important to you. And you can see the writing on the wall with this decision, with these laws, and with the politicians that are forcing them down people's throats. And I think we're also seeing there is a simplification of the political question, because we see in real life that bans even what there is a quote unquote exception, that doesn't actually work in real life. So even in states where there may be a quote unquote exception for health or life, a woman whose pregnancy is killing her is being told, go home until you're septic. Go home until your fever is so high that you're actually going straight to the ICU, then we can talk about your abortion. So this idea that somehow there's an exception that's going to even account for those people the exception's designed for, it doesn't work. That doesn't happen. Right. And then you've got to find a doctor who's willing to risk perhaps getting in legal trouble. If it turns out that maybe she wasn't so septic. Exactly. And the same thing is happening, you know, this conversation about exceptions for, you know, sexual assault for rape. You know, what that means in real life is that someone who's experienced sexual violence has to meet the standard of having put in the right kind of police report, you know, told enough of the right kind of people hurt story of trauma to qualify for the exception. So what we're seeing is this idea that somehow there's a week at which abortion can be banned or somehow there's an exception that will take away the moral horror of an abortion ban, all that has been exposed to be false. We need real access because without real access, what we see is pain and suffering on a daily basis. So right, the points you made earlier for Tima, at the end of the day, I don't care what the issues are. There's some other person somewhere who's sitting in judgment and saying whether or not you deserve to be able to do what you need to do and want to do for your own body and your own life, whatever those factors are. Let's take a quick break and we're going to come back and finish up with a question of whether or not this issue will really get people out to the polls. There are some suggestions that as powerful as it is, that it's not as much of a driving factor as it was. Hey there, it's Mary Harris and I host Slate's daily news podcast, What Next. It's a show I made because I was grappling with this question. Why is the news everywhere and I have no idea what to pay attention to? My daily short podcast is here to help you make sense of things, from flushing out new angles to uncovering stories that have largely gone unreported. When the news feels overwhelming, I'm here to help you answer What Next. So, subscribe, wherever you're listening, right now. In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news, but behind the Bleak Headlines, there are people working to protect our right to control our future. The Defenders is a new 10-part series about the fight for freedom in a post- Roe America. Co-hosted by Samantha Bee and me, Gloria Riviera, the show will examine ways people are still accessing care from crossing state borders to self-managed abortion. You'll hear from activists, providers and everyday people doing the work to expand reproductive freedom. We're here to tell you anyone can become a defender. The Defenders is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. I guess the question is when the rubber hits the road, we're going to find out shortly, is will it really bring people out? And I think you may be inclined to say yes, look at Kansas, but I want to challenge this a little bit because it feels like this election cycle has so many different threads running through it. Inflation, abortion, democracy, Ukraine, crime. And there are a number of people who would make the point that all of those things motivate people to a degree, but there is a line of thinking out there now, which says that women are more motivated by crime than they are by abortion. And look, we can't treat everybody with a broad brush, but the question is there's some narrative being pushed. Yeah, after the Dobbs ruling, people really reacted strongly, but that's kind of fading. And there are other issues that are going to be equal or more prominent. What evidence do we have that this really is going to be a motivator if we think it is? Well, women don't live single issue lives. They're thinking about their families, they're thinking about their communities. And so I both haven't been surprised that the issues that keep rising to the top in a lot of the polling I've seen are abortion and inflation. And so people are thinking about more than one thing at once. I do think there is a piece to pay attention to that is always uniformly underestimated, and that is around women to anger in this moment. And that anger has to do with Dobbs, that anger has to do with inflation, that anger has to do with still being mad that we don't really have a care infrastructure that makes it possible for people to care for their families. And a lot of folks are still holding multiple roles at the same time right now. So I actually think the electorate is really complicated. And these really extreme politicians who are driving these laws aren't making it easy for themselves. People are just like, why are you doing that? Why do I have to take time away from my worries about making ends meet with my family to fight for my basic freedoms that I thought were mine? So it is jumbled together a bit. And I would say for young people, and we've been polling on young people for years, we looked at young people's views on the Dobbs decision over the course of this year. And what we've seen is, so one, abortion actually cracked the top issues that young people are tracking this year in a different way. So there has been a shift. But the other thing I'll say is, along with economic justice, however you want to talk about it in inflation, the other issue for young people is racism. And young people see the issues of abortion and racism as inextricable and intertwined. And so when we think about young people under 34 in this country, which is a majority non-white population, right? These are black and brown young people, young people of color who have successfully voted in record turnout the last couple of elections, right? Like young people keep breaking their own records. We expect to see that continue because what young people are seeing is patterns of racist abortion bans, racial discrimination, economic justice that is not reaching black and brown families and black and brown young people, and young people are angry too. And young people have been using the power of the vote and will continue to do so. Yeah, I might add environmental justice for young people as well. Yeah, certainly. Yeah. And safety, right? Young people are also outraged that they don't feel safe. I mean, they don't, they're concerned about a climate that's hurtling towards disaster. They're concerned about gun violence that is impacting young people that's unchecked. And they're concerns about their rights being taken away and trampled. So when it may be turned to talk about in which states there are candidates where this, the contrast is strongest and where people are most motivated moving beyond the several states we talked about with the ballot initiatives. Are there specific area specific states where if people in particular care about reproductive rights care about abortion that it is a big issue in their state? Well, one thing I want to name is that when Senator Lindsey Grimm introduced a nationwide abortion ban, I think, I think he really made the entire Senate election about abortion in part because it was pretty clear that if power changes hands, you will see a vote. And if it doesn't, you won't. So that, that level of clarity, um, two months before the election, I think people need to understand and I, and I think they probably do. And then there are a couple of other states where the question is called pretty clearly too. I think in Michigan, it's called not just because of the ballot initiative for the state. It's called because the governor has filed a lawsuit naming protection as the goal even in advance of the DOP's decision. And so they're having that debate pretty squarely as candidates. Um, you know, you're seeing it in Pennsylvania. The question really called very directly between, um, all of the folks who are running statewide for a Senate, but also for a governor and a G and, and, and so people are having this debate actually far more squarely than you see in every election. It's not every election that you actually have an out loud debate around what to do around abortion access and whether these both rights in access should be restored. That, that is playing out. And so it is one of the issues that people are going to have to have in their minds as they, as they go to the polls. And I would just add to that, you know, I think that the, the political climate in which it feels like, you know, rights are being wrenched from our hands, you know, every other day has also forced a crash course in civics for a lot of people so that folks are paying attention to more and more races than ever before. You know, who would have thought that something like the Georgia secretary of state or the Ohio Supreme Court would become so politically salient in voters minds, but they are because people are coming to understand, particularly with attacks, not just on abortion, but on our democracy, right, that who sits on, you know, the Ohio Supreme Court, it has a lot to do with redistricting, right, who sits in the seat of the Georgia secretary of state has a lot to do with election integrity in that state. So, you know, the voters are sort of coming forward not just to, to seize the vote, but to really understand in a deeper way, right, all of these down ballot elections really make a difference on whether our rights are real or not. That's a really interesting point. And to find it interesting that we have now at least several Republican candidates that have chosen to hide their position on this issue. Those websites, boy, they sure did start to edit those websites after Kansas, didn't they? Yeah. So, I know that that includes the Republican Senate candidate masters in Arizona, which is an important race, but it appears that this is not an issue that people who are, who've been very much supportive of whether it's Lindsey Graham's bill or applauded the Dobs case seem they want to talk about it. I think they're going to have to talk about it. And I think that they will be reminded through ads and mailing if they don't talk about it. I also just want to name that. This isn't a new tactic for a very long time. What we had were bills passing in states that were restricting access to abortion or just banning it outright. And then people didn't want to have a public conversation about it because they knew that that those acts weren't popular. And so now gone away is this idea that you can hide or do it under the cover at night. People are watching exactly which laws are being passed. People are angry at the fact that they have no way to influence it and that some of these states came back and did it in special session. And it happened rapidly while people are still digesting the decision. They usual tactic of hiding the fact that you are trying to undermine our freedoms. It's not going to work in the same way. Yeah. But by the way, one other, I mean, to me, get earlier, when you talked about people who are protesting in front of an abortion clinic one day and the next day are in the clinic, it just causes me to think about the most recent story about Herschel Walker. Yeah. You know, I have to say those who do the work on abortion access were used to this story, were used to people shaming abortion out loud and securing what was a protected right in their personal lives. And we're not in that place right now. And I think you're going to see more people coming out and telling their stories. You both just, she has to talk to Vice President Harris. What did she have to say, Kimberly? You know, what I really appreciate about Vice President Harris's approach. And you can tell that she's a policy wonk. You can tell that she is someone who cares deeply about the details, right, and the opportunities in a whole of government approach to actually meet people's needs even through a moment of crisis like this. So I always appreciate a policy wonk. But the other thing that was really clear and I think has become clear in this administration's response is there is both a whole of government response to the question of abortion access specifically, but also the understanding that this is not an isolated attack, that those who are coming for our abortion access are also coming for the right of trans children to learn and be in school. They are also coming for our democracy. And so understanding and you know, when I think about urges constituency, right, we are buying for young people of color, young queer and trans people that the communities most harmed are sitting at multiple intersections, right, of needing an abortion of, you know, facing homelessness, of being kicked out of school. And so I think the Vice President really understands what we're up against. And this is not a single issue of assault, either. This is a multi issue coordinated attack on our foundational health and rights. So let's close by talking about that anger that you read up Fatima. I would suspect that some of the people who listening to this episode felt some of that anger. No doubt have felt it over the last number of months, probably longer. And I think that the question they have probably right now is very simple. Help me channel that anger in the next few weeks. So maybe you could each close by giving us a sense of if you are feeling that anger and you want to do something productive, that how do you point people? Well, I'm happy to start. You know, we have a gender justice voter guide that we've just put out. And it is a way for people to understand the issues that are at stake. And so one thing if you are someone fueled with anger is get that information and don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with your friends, bring people along, make sure that they are not just voters, but they're voters with a little bit of information. And then the second thing that I would say is what a historic moment to practice being part of a democracy. And I think taking small acts, whether it is voting or making a phone call or joining a protest, reminding yourself of that power, that that's a thing that I have found has helps a little bit with the anger. It reminds you that there are things that you can do. And then the last thing that I will say is that this is a long fight. It won't begin and end with a single election. And the most important thing I want people to do is to recommit themselves to fighting for their own freedoms and for everyone else's. And that is an ongoing fight. You mentioned that you have a voters guide and we will have a link to it. Just go right to our show notes. You'll find a link to that guide. Kimberly, what can you tell people? I would encourage folks to come to urge.org. You can learn more about our work in the South and the Midwest. And if you have it to spare to donate to organizations like urge, we are on the ground fighting these abortion bans where they're happening and supporting communities that are being impacted. And the last piece I'll say, and this is maybe new to some people, but I would encourage folks to become educated about self managed abortion. This is increasingly how people in states where there are no clinics and where abortion bans are being enforced are accessing abortion, even though they may face criminalization for it. And folks can learn more about that at abortion on our own terms.org. When we talk about reclaiming our power, part of how people are reclaiming their power is they're saying, even if there is an abortion ban, there are ways that people have always ended their pregnancies that people have always taken this power back. And you can learn more about that and what it might mean for your community at abortion on our own terms.org. Yeah, and maybe one thing I'd just add as a close, maybe if you want to touch up briefly is there are a lot of people who are not of childbearing age or years that are really bothered by this. Some of them are men, some of them are young girls, some of them are post menopause women. And I think this is important for a couple of reasons. Like one is, I saw a lot of people in Kansas who were if that's right, who made this their issue too, because they're offended by the fact that this can happen. And they don't like that precedent. I also think that part of that anger that I sent from people that I talked to is also fear and anxiety and a sense of feeling alone and not seen and not heard. And I think you said something important that I would just want to come back to and ask you'd also close on, which is if you're feeling this way, you are in the majority, not the minority. You are not alone. And the laws may currently not reflect that reality, but that doesn't mean that you are not with the large majority of people in this country. Well, and that's why it's so important that we talk about abortion, because it's actually the abortion stigma and silence that has kept us from realizing we are absolutely the majority. And by the way, we're the majority in Alabama, in Texas, in Kansas, in Ohio, in every single state. And part of that is because while one in four people who can become pregnant will get an abortion, four out of four people are part of a family, right? Whether that's a chosen family or a biological family. And all of us can see that making decisions about our families, about our pregnancies, about our health, is something that we can all be passionate about. It's something that we can all be vocal about. Regardless of our, you know, our entry point into the conversation, we are all part of families. And we should all be able to make decisions about our own families for ourselves without politicians getting in the middle. Fatima Goss Graves, Kimberly, Inez Maguire.
