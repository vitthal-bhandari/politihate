    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show rolling through the Tuesday edition of the program. We are joined now by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Appreciate him coming on and hanging out with us and Governor DeSantis want to dive right into it. We've loved on the show that you haven't buckled down over the parental rights bill that you signed yesterday. Disney I'm sure you saw yesterday released a statement condemning the the bill. What would you say to Disney which obviously through Disney World and the properties there has a substantial component of its company located in your state. What was your response when you saw their public statement yesterday and do you anticipate talking with CEO Bob Chake a bit anytime soon? What's the relationship like there? Well, this state will be governed by the best interests of the people of Florida, not based on the ideology of corporate executives in California and for Disney to come out and say not only that the law should have never been enacted in the first place but that they are going to actively work to repeal substantive rights and protections that have been put into law to benefit parents in our state. I thought that that crossed the line. I mean, first of all, they were not involved in lobbying on this bill when it was going through the House of Representatives. I don't think they even registered to lobby on this bill. So it was something that was going through they were not involved in it. Then all of a sudden the mob came after him. So now they're acting like it should have never been enacted. Also, to say they're going to work to repeal it, you know, I think that they think that they control the state just because they have a big theme park here and I got news for you that is not the way the state of Florida is going to be run and we're not going to be bending any knees to any woke corporations. Hey, Governor Santas, it's Bach. I just wanted to I wanted you to get on the record with people all across the country listening because as you know, there's been such an onslaught of propaganda around the parental rights bill in the state of Florida. Most people without even thinking about it in the news media or perhaps after thinking about it depends who we're talking about referred to it as the don't say gay bill. You know, I'm sure saw the celebrities at the Oscars who were pretending that it was a don't say gay bill. All of that. What does the bill really do and why was it important to get this through? Well, first is let me say people in Hollywood. These are the same people that held up degenerates like Harvey Weinstein up as exemplars. They serenaded him for years and years knowing full well about his misconduct and his behavior. So if they're criticizing Florida, that is a badge of honor for the state in terms of what the bill actually does. That even mentioned the word gay. It does two main things. It bans any classroom curriculum on things like sexuality and transgender for grades K through three. And so it's totally inappropriate that that would be something that would be injected into your kid's kindergarten or first grade classroom. And then anything beyond that has to be age appropriate. So that's kind of the curriculum component. So that's really what they're talking about. What they don't talk about is much. So they're misrepresenting that. But they don't even acknowledge are some of the substantive protections for parents beyond that. So we had a woman at our press conference yesterday from telehaffy named January Little John. Her daughter was in school in the school system here. And this school without telling her her consent was transitioning her daughter to become a boy. They even assigned her a boy's name. They had her used boy pronouns. And so in Florida, that is totally inappropriate to do that without informing the parent or without the parents consent. So now parents have substantive rights. If a school would try to do that and schools know that that's not something that they're allowed to do. And so I think if you if you talk about the bill to parents, you know, I think overwhelming, massive majorities, think that this is just common sense. We loved what you did. We had one of the female swimmers that competed against the pen transgender swimmer yesterday on our program. Swims at the University of Kentucky. And you honored because the girl who came in second really would have been first place if a biological man and swimming against her. Emma Wyatt. You released a proclamation because I believe she was from Sarasota. If I'm not wrong. Explain how you came to make that decision and what your perspective is in general on men competing against women's sports, which has become a cultural flashpoint in our society of late. Unfortunately, why find a bill last year protecting women's sports in Florida from the early grades all the way through college because women deserve to have equal opportunities. And when you have a man who may identify as a woman, but is still biologically a man competing and swimming and some of these other things, it's not fair and it destroys the integrity of the competition. So that's really what the NCAA did. They destroyed the integrity of that women's swimming championship and they robbed Emma Wyatt of a national championship. And yes, she's from Sarasota. She was an all-American, all four years of high school. She won a silver medal at the Olympics and she should have been crowned national champion. And this is a girl that is really fantastic and to have something, a life achievement like that taken away from you because of a woke organization like the NCAA, I think that wasn't an injustice. And I also think the NCAA is asking people like us to be complicit in what is a fraud. We're not going to accept what they're doing. That is not an honorable competition. That is not a competition with integrity. And I can tell you that if everything I've done as governor, this is one of the things where I'll just have random people come up to me and just saying, hey, I really love that you just took up for the woman's swimmer. Here's the thing, guys, people know this is wrong, but a lot of people are scared to speak up about it because they're worried about a woke mob smearing them. They're worried about a media that will smear them because this is something that is very that they hold dear in terms of their agenda with elite media and these wokesters. And so I'm just like, you know what, I get attacked every dog on day. What do I care if they attack me? I need to speak up for these people. And I've gotten a lot of correspondence from women college athletes around the country writing in my office just being like, hey, thanks, we all believe this. We can't say it. And we're worried about saying it, but you're speaking the truth. We're speaking to Florida governor Ron DeSantis and governor, you were on the very front line of holding the line against the COVID lockdown mandate masking madness. We're now two years into this. And I don't know if you saw this governor, but there's just now a lawsuit that's making its way up in the press of airline attendants who are saying that masking on planes is absurd, which I think anybody who thinks about it for a few minutes will come to that or even shorter come to that same conclusion. What are you doing in this? First of all, I just want you to weigh in on the mask mandate that the federal government is going to get a Florida. Yeah, you know, we just announced that today, myself and our attorney general announced that because, you know, they extended the mask mandate into April and then Fauci's now put his head back out saying, oh, well, we may have to impose restrictions based on where cases are. And this is unacceptable. So even if Biden lets the airline, the transportation mask mandate expire next month, he very well may re-institute it at some point. And so I think that there's a constitutional issue here. I think there's a matter of the government acting in a way that's arbitrary and capricious. And so we have filed suit. There's been other suits that filed. Unfortunately, these suits have not succeeded throughout the last two years on this particular issue. The federal government does have certain authorities when it comes to interstate, interstate travel. However, you cannot tell me that if you're sitting in a window seat nibbling on peanuts for two hours with your mask underneath your chin, then I'm sitting right next to you. And I can't just put my mask on my chin if I want to just read a magazine. I mean, give me a break. This is COVID theater and it needs to end. Amen. And you're preaching to the choir here for a lot of our audience. We talked recently with you. I don't remember a couple months ago about the overall number of people moving to Florida. A couple of things here. One, what would you say to people out there who are afraid that people, the numbers have reflected. I'm sure you saw them, Governor, that people are leaving New York. They're leaving California. They're leaving Chicago. Are you concerned at all about what political beliefs those people are going to bring with them as they move into Florida, which has been one of the top states to gain? What is the data showing you there? And second, my cohost here, Buck Sexton is considering making the move from New York to Florida as many have. What pitch would you make to him on why he should officially make that move? So first thing, when I got elected governor, there were almost 300,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state of Florida. This month of March, we are officially passing over 100,000 more Republicans than Democrats. So that's about a 400,000 registration shift in favor of Republicans. What that tells me is that the people that have moved here since COVID have been disproportionately moving for philosophical reasons because they liked what we were doing in the state of Florida. Yes, they liked the low taxes, but we've always had low taxes. They liked the fact that Florida was a free state and they were fleeing lockdowns. They liked the fact that Florida is a law and order state and they were fleeing areas where crime was exploding. And there's a lot of other things that we've done that I think people do. So I think it's skewed very favorably to us. And look, I'm running in 2022. We're going to run, run hard. Hopefully we were in big. But if we do, I think people will start conceiving Florida less as a swing state and more as a red state. So stay tuned on that. What I would tell Buck, I don't know what part of New York City or I will tell you this. I saw an analysis that Manhattan had the biggest decline in registered Republicans of any other jurisdiction in the country. They lost 25% of their registered Republicans. And I know there's a lot more registered Democrats in Manhattan than Republicans. But I think that shows you that those folks were very sensitive to the disastrous policies and a lot of them came to Florida to do it. And so what I would tell Buck is, anytime I'd see somebody, California, they move, Washington state, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Minnesota, you name it, I will always say, do you regret it? I had one person say they've regret to move yet. We'll save some room down here, governor, for not just me, a whole lot of other folks listening all across the country in crazy blue states, Governor Ron DeSantis of the great state of Florida governor. Really appreciate it, sir. Thanks for being with us. Thanks guys. Take care. Man, I know there's a lot of people listening to that right now, Buck, that are fired up about the fact that, I mean, you're willing to go toe to toe with Disney in Florida. You ain't going to apologize for what you believe. And I do think, you know, we were talking about the Trump legacy. I believe the number, we'll talk about this a little bit more when we come back, but I believe the number one legacy of Donald Trump and the Republican party is going to be the willingness to fight. You're not being concerned about what the New York Times editorial page is going to say or what a Washington Post columnist or what they're going to say at CNN or MSNBC. Because those people don't speak for the masses fight for what you believe. Trump Trumpism means the willingness to go on offense in politics to not constantly feel like you have to wring your hands and apologize and prevaricate the anti-mit romney. Yes, it's the anti-mit romney of Republicanism and Governor Ron DeSantis is certainly right there throwing throwing punches for the good guys. So now, my speaking after the whole slap thing. Open ended slaps to America. Here we go with the Giza Dream sheets. I got to tell you, Michael and Dell help you get a great night's sleep. I've been talking about these Giza Dream sheets for a while because, man, you know what I did last night? I got in bed after I came back from my little league.

He liked the original karate kid, maybe a little bit advanced for him, but he's the youngest. I'm going to let him keep up with his brothers. And we were all cuddled up in these Giza Dream sheets.

The other one is a property owner and thinking about making the full time move to Florida. I am losing friends. Believe it or not, I have some friends in New York or Republicans or maybe just believe it or not, I have some friends for those of you who are cynical. I'm losing them to Florida on a regular basis. They're fleeing New York City, particularly from Manhattan, for Florida. We really enjoy talking to the governor about all that. We also spoke with him about COVID and COVID policies. You know, clay, I try to keep it real and I try to give credit where it's due. Two things. I think we do that here on the show. We keep it real and we give credit where it's due. I think we do that pretty well. I still have a, you know, I don't have the love of the professional leagues that you do obviously, but I have some familiarity with them. But one of the one of my things is I'm going to try to speak English here. I don't know why I'm pulling a Biden, a mumbling nonsense. One of my things here is that I'm upset with some of the politics that have been very prominent in those leagues, particularly in recent years. And that fell in NBA in particular. I've also got a credit where it's due, right? I've been saying, I like Aaron Rodgers, my favorite quarterback because of his stance for freedom and just sort of general go bleep yourself attitude toward the live media. Kyrie Irving is fantastic on the issue of personal bodily autonomy and freedom and deserves applause on this one. And here he is speaking about how he's standing for freedom. The point of this season for me was never to just take a stand. It was really to make sure that I'm standing on what I believe in freedom. Freedom. I don't think that's a word that gets defined enough in our society about the freedom to make choices with your life without someone telling you what the **** to do and whether that carries over into nuances of our society that, you know, politicians control the government controls or things people that empower, the powers may be right, that control. I'm standing for freedom. So that's all that's in my life. And there's nobody that's enslaving me. There's nobody telling me that what I'm going to do with my life. And that's just the way I am. Applause for me. Yeah. Amen Kyrie Irving for speaking out and also Buck. I think this is important and certainly it has not gotten enough attention in the world of sports media. It's not brave to speak out when speaking out gets you more money. Right. Colin Kaepernick is a mediocre quarterback in the NFL by the time that he decided to take his stand by refusing to stand for the national anthem. And as a result, he has made tens of millions of dollars as an activist that he never would have made as an athlete. LeBron James and his I refuse to shut up and dribble has made more money by pretending to be an activist. I want to point out what's going on here with Kyrie Irving. He left tens of millions of dollars on the table by refusing to get the COVID shot. In other words, to me, activism deserves to be praised when it costs you something. When you don't gain more financially and economically by the choice that you are making, just every athlete in America who has taken a or coach left wing stand has ended up being rewarded for that stand. Kyrie Irving in refusing to get the COVID shot cost himself tens of millions of dollars. That is true bravery. He stood and paid for what he believed.

If you're just getting into your cars, I think you'll enjoy the conversation we had with Florida governor Ron DeSantis top of second hour. You can see it on the podcast. Search out my name clay Travis. Search out Buck Sexton. You can find that podcast. You can go subscribe just in time for March and make sure that you are well on your way to be able to hear every single moment of the show. We're talking about the number of people you heard the governor himself talk about the fact that Florida is now a red state and that if things go as he hopes that they are going to go in the governor election in 2022, by the way, you want to talk about an important governor's election that most people really didn't pay that much attention to Buck. Ron DeSantis beat Andrew Gillum by around 30,000 votes in 2018. If Andrew Gillum wins that election, then what ends up happening in the state of Florida is I really do believe this. I think Florida would lock down like California. I think Florida would have locked down like New York and Michigan and many other blue states and the red state governors. Many of them followed in the wake of Ron DeSantis's lead in terms of COVID normalcy. That would have been much more challenging to do without the leadership shown by the state of Florida. I think you and I will be broadcasting from a ship in international waters somewhere at this point. I mean, we would have had to find the island where Tom Hanks filmed cast away. I'd be shouting at Wilson while you were taking us into commercial breaks. It is amazing. A lot of people don't pay attention. I do think that's been one of those impacts. We talked earlier about how many more parents are involved in school board decisions and local elections in a way that maybe in the past have not been. I don't know that there's ever been a more consequential time in any of our lives to be governor than what we've seen over the past two years. I mean, the Republican party really does have this, this huge opening and it's been happening here for a while to be the party of what do normal people who aren't indoctrinated with fashionable ideology? What do they think about things? Yeah, it just said a normal everyday American is going to think. And when I say I'm not just talking to Republicans here, talk about independence. I'm even talking about some Democrats. Remember, Trump got a bunch of former Obama voters to switch over a lot of water class folks change the election class folks listen to the show. And you know, they're just like, okay, politics should be about trying to make our lives, you know, not make them worse. Start with that. A Juno harm principle will be really good in politics. And then just make our day to day maybe a little bit better, a little bit easier, have a sense that the country is moving in the right direction and a feeling of, you know, Americanness as an asset, something we're proud of and something that defends your day to day freedom. And Republicans have this huge opening here to be to be the party that's like, we want you to have more input in your child's education. We think that parents that children belong to parents that don't belong to the state. We think that you should be able to literally breathe freely on the mask issue. We don't think the government should arbitrarily and capriciously lock down your business because they feel like it because some people that control media are terrified of what is now essentially an ongoing series of flu seasons. You know, there are so many ways that it's just the common sense stuff. We get to be the Republican party, the conservatives, everyone to say we get to be the common sense party that does good governance that helps businesses grow, that helps people live in freedom and prosperity and isn't. I mean, what we saw last year was what happens when the government gets to basically make more and more and more decisions for you all the time. It's misery. It's misery. And it also starts to destroy the currency, which is another bad thing, which by the way, speaking of this is what the nation is now saying. There's a Harvard Harris poll out. I teased it earlier in the show, Buck. And the results are pretty staggering. Donald Trump, who to my knowledge, Buck, you may remember, I love looking at polls. I understand people out there who say, Oh, the poll data, you can't trust it. It's unreliable. I understand. Okay. But I don't remember ever seeing Donald Trump having a six point lead over Joe Biden at any point from any poll that existed during the 2020 election. Donald Trump right now, according to the most recent Harvard Harris poll that came out late last night is up right now over Joe Biden, 47 to 41 percent. Okay. Significant. That's a six point lead over Biden for Trump. Buck he has an 11 point lead over Kamala Harris, 49 to 38. Now, if you believe as many of our listeners do that these numbers oftentimes are skewed in terms of being favored towards Democrats, I mean, this is unprecedented for him to have a lead. And I also think this is significant. If you look at the data, the data is reflecting right now that Republicans are opening up a huge lead overall in terms of the congressional race. Same poll. Harvard Harris poll. Generic congressional vote. Republicans have opened up a six point lead as Joe Biden has hit a 39 percent approval rate, by the way, in this Harvard Harris poll, Republicans have opened up an unheard of six point lead in this overall battle in the midterms. If that's accurate, and again, requisite, hey, it's a poll maintained that we don't know exactly what's going to happen. That would represent a seismic change in our congressional membership, the likes of which could exceed what happened in 1994 and 2010. Let's go to the phones, Buck. This guy Greg is calling from his RV as he moves to Florida. He was just listening to our interview, I believe, with Ron DeSantis. Greg, how's the road? How's the drive going? Well, the drive has been good. I'm 40 miles from the Florida state line. Sold the house yesterday in Connecticut and moving all family to Florida. Where in Florida? Yeah, where are you headed? West Palm Beach. Oh, man, we might be neighbors. All right. So what Greg for you, what's your family situation and what made what was the tipping point for you to finally say, I'm out of Connecticut and I'm moving to Florida. What was the the precipitating factor? Well, one, I could sell my house at a fair price because of all the exodus of people leaving New York City, but not being able to move far enough away. They're moving to Connecticut. Yeah. My house price was a favorable there, but I'm on the board of a social media company taking on Facebook and, you know, it could have a very nice exit here and I want to be prepared and in the right place for when those things happen. For tax purposes. I was that for tax reasons, but also for political and life reasons as well, all those reasons, it just was a no brainer for me. But I was also very interested in this absurd statement about we're going to tax unrealized games. Oh, yeah. I mean, not only is it ridiculous. So if you think about it, so what are you going to have to do? Sell your shares every year to pay the taxes on. Great point. And then eventually you don't own your company anymore because you have to sell percentages of it. And if it's an unworkable idea, it's not even a workable idea. Really, it would cause devastation. Horrible idea. I'll use that. I mean, thank you for the call, Greg. And by the way, welcome to Florida in advance as you're 40 miles away. How big is your family? By the way, do you think? Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. How big is the family? Five five Republicans coming down. So I have my in-laws that are living with me and my wife and myself. And I've actually got a 20 year old daughter who is actually Republican in the New York. So you've got five votes for DeSantis now that are transporting from Connecticut to Florida for the fall. That's correct. All right. Keep it going, man. I'll see. I'll see you down there. I'll be visiting for sure a lot. And we'll see what else. I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave my NYC and my WOR listener fam. So I got to spend a lot of time in New York no matter what, Clay. But I will say, I wonder if our caller, when he crosses over, you know, do you think he throws on the flip flops and puts on some Ray bands or some Maui gyms in a little celebration moment? I think probably. So I'll say this, Buck. He's right about the unrealized gains. So I founded a company in Outkick. I sold it last year to Fox. I don't know what the valuation on a year to year basis of my stake in the company that I owned would have been. But to his point, in order to pay a 20% tax on the increasing value in your unrealized gains, many people are going to have to sell their companies in order to pay the taxes on the gains that they have in the company. It is this is one of the dumbest. I mean, again, defund the police is probably the dumbest idea. But it is to me a testament, Buck, to how few people in the Democrat party now understand basic business. If you are running a business and you are putting your heart and soul into that company, as I know many of our listeners are somebody out there in IRS land is going to assess the value of your unrealized gain in your company and potentially force you to sell assets in your company in order to pay a tax bill. I mean, this is one of the things that they talk about in terms of the death tax and how it's applied. This unrealized gain. And again, they're trying to sell it as something that would just impact billionaires. That's not true. It's eventually going to impact. I bet just about everybody who is listening to us. If this passes, it's madness. It can't pass. This is giving way too much power to the IRS. And it is going to be a incredible detriment to growing businesses all over this country. I feel like the Biden regime is writing checks that its body can't cash. Clay well played. We're going to be talking about. Yeah, we've got top gun. There you go. Trailer out.

And the top gun too, I guess, they're calling it top gun maverick. The trailer is out. Clay and I are right at about the age. You know, I'd say what, maybe late 30s to late 40s right now. So let's call it maybe, you know, 37 to 47 or so. Top gun was, was, you know, life changing when you saw that. That movie was the coolest thing you would ever see up to that point, probably it. And we admit some people would say Star Wars or whatever, but it was a really, really cool movie, the music and everything. And Tom, Tom Cruise, his best movie all time. And he's made some good movies. And I think that's arguably his best all time movie from just a pure entertainment and cultural relevance perspective. Oh man, that's a great question. What is the, so we were talking off air about who would you buy stock in just for purposes of without even seeing an advertisement. You're like, I trust that guy or that girl to make a good movie. And the guys that it's mostly guys that immediately come to my mind over the last 20 years or so. Pre-slap, maybe even post-slap. Will Smith is on that list. But I, for me, Matt Damon has tended to make really good movies, but Tom Cruise to me, Denzel Washington also really good movies. To me, Tom Cruise is number one on the list of, I trust this guy. I will pretty much go see whatever movie he makes. I think, Buck, risky business may be my favorite Tom Cruise. Really? Wow. Watch risky business recently. No, I mean, I've seen it. I mean, wow. But by the way, producer Charlie here is giving me, he loves risky business. He's giving me thumbs up here. Holds up. I watched it on a flight recently and I was like, you know, they had the old school, which I didn't like by the way. I don't know when they started doing this, but they have like classic movies now. It's not just all new movies. And I was like, you know what? I need to watch risky business. And so I watched it probably three or four years ago and I was like, man, this is a great movie. I would have put Harrison Ford on that list of Harrison. Oh, yeah. What probably among the five or 10 greatest box office draw actors of our generation, although he got kind of, he got kind of curmudgeonly and you know, he didn't, I don't know, he's got older. He sort of excited for the new Indiana Jones, by the way, I didn't like any of the Jones. He's doing a new one. Yeah. They were. I mean, the kingdom of the crystal skull pretending it didn't happen. I'm still upset about it. Oh, wait, but it was coming. I think I have a secret magic power that I'm sure everybody listening thinks they have to, which is that I can watch a trailer and I'd say with like a 97% accuracy, tell you whether or not this movie is worth seeing. That's my, that's my, I think if I watch a trailer, call, yeah, that's, you know, you realize that's the job of the trailer is to make you want to see the move. But a lot of trailers are watching. I'm like, I mean, when I watch the Ghostbusters, all female reboot trailer, I was like, this is going to be an assault on my eyeballs. Like this is going to be the worst thing that's ever, and it was. But here, for example, oh, man, if we're going to talk about bad movies, that's a whole other conversation. I've seen some movies that I just wonder with big budgets, by the way, like B level movies, people say, Oh, there's, you know, leprechaun five was a movie that was made. Like that doesn't count. They made it for 50. Right. It doesn't cost any money. I'm talking about when they spend 200. Will Smith, Wild Wild West, people have already been making the joke. If you go back, that movie is Wow level bad. That was one of his rare big swing and miss, but it was like Kevin Costner with Westworld. Remember Kevin Costner was one of defeated water. Oh, yeah. What Westworld is the television show, which is pretty good. Right. Not that bad. I disagree with the water. It's okay. It's not great. But back in the day, by the way, Russell Crowe had a stretch there where he couldn't miss. Right. I mean, he was on fire. And then all of a sudden he's just like a pudgy British guy who's making movies about how he's over the hill and like maybe falls in love. Maybe he does it who cares. He's going to drink. I mean, it was like not really. He went off the rails. He was amazing in the early 2000s. Hugh Grant had a good run where he couldn't miss and then, you know, he kind of got, you know, we pride and then he had some problems. We promised you the trailer. Here is the trailer of Top Gun Maverick. So is that come back from this? Those are your pilots. Everything happens to them. You'll never forgive yourself. No turning back now. I mean, you find it. I mean, Clay, they're too close for this. I'm switching to guns. I got like a chill box. Like just thinking about Top Gun Maverick. I wanted to be a fighter pilot. Like a lot of kids out there after Top Gun came out. Do you remember that? Like you were like, oh, I'm going to grow up and be a fighter pilot because of how badass Maverick was in Top Gun. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think Top Gun was a there's guys listening to us right now that are fighter pilots because of Top Gun. I guarantee you, kid me. I bet there's some guys that are F 22's at Ellis Air Force Base. We're doing, you know, barrel rolls because they're listening to podcast. Well, I guess that would be hard because they have to listen to podcast later. You get what I'm saying. Go. We're going to have some. We're going to have some pilots, airline pilots, combat pilots right again being like, we'll do a flyover for you guys sometime in the radio studio. That's why they're pilots because of that movie. I guarantee you, especially around our air force academy had a big and naval academy had big increases in applications after that movie came out like 10 or 15%. Yeah. All right. So we got excited about Top Gun Maverick. We'll do the movie review after it comes out. We'll go see it and we'll talk to all of you tomorrow. Play Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth."
