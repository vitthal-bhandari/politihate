    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome back in our number two Thursday edition clay Travis Buck Sexton show We know that a lot of you out there all over the country. Hey, maybe you're starting your July 4th celebration a little bit early Monday and Tuesday a lot of people not going to be working Maybe you are gearing up for a trip if that is you Why not go ahead and do a couple things now? The iHeartRadio app you can take this show with you anywhere no matter where you are around the world same thing can be true Hey search out clay Travis Buck Sexton go sign up for the podcast Tens or do we like it 20 million or something downloads a month coming in the Clay and Buck podcast if you want to make sure that you can take this show anywhere with you as well as get a lot of unique podcast uh Opportunities that aren't found elsewhere. We're building out a great podcast network involving other people. It is absolutely fantastic I encourage all of you To get out there And make sure that you do both those things. Okay, buck We're continuing to talk by the way About the decision from the Supreme Court just about three hours ago To end the affirmative action the use of race as part of college and university admissions Having really interesting conversations there 800 282 282 we've also discussed legacy admissions the meritocracy in general How do the schools actually do at educating people in other words? How much of your success in life is attributable to where you went? Would you agree with that buck that that you don't have kids yet? But I think the number one sells pitch of a university is And tell me if you agree or disagree with this idea The university sells the idea that if you come here You will be more efficient and more successful in life than you would be if you didn't And the more elite the university is the more they sell the idea that your future life will be more Successful as a function of the four years that you would have spent in undergrad institution there That's basically the essence of why you would be willing to pay 75 or 80 thousand dollars a year to go to these schools, right? Yeah, and in and I think a vast majority of cases of the of these different schools It's just not true if you're a hardworking industrious smart person you'll do well Wherever it is that you go. They used to be real door openers You know, there's like on campus recruiting and and if you went to the right school I mean I could tell you my I don't know if you had a different experience Nobody ever cared where I went to school the alumni network never lifted a finger for me I remember I I was encouraged by my uh, we had kind of a, you know career guidance counselor um And encouraged to write letters to alumni in different industries. I was interested in like actual old school read a letter like hey I didn't get a response. I think I wrote 10 letters like no one even responded, which was good It would I realized like okay, so that was all a scam. There's no alumni network that's gonna help me or whatever But it's all right. I wanted to work the ci anyway, so it didn't really make much difference to me Um, but at the time I saw this a lot and and I think that uh, you know clay The the value of these degrees is going down because ultimately this is an arms race Ultimately, this is inherently competitive which gets lost in this conversation You know, harvard talks about oh we need like holistic and the bert the benefits of diversity People go to harvard because 95 percent of the people who apply to harvard don't get in Yeah So they're very happy to tell a lot of they're very happy to crush a lot of people's dreams And as we saw in this case a lot of like asian kids were jesus dreams Very happy to tell them you don't get to go to harvard because we think that there's something more important Than the excellence you've shown academically The whole thing is premised on how hard is it to get in because then that becomes How valuable is this in the marketplace the job marketplace when you graduate and what does this mean? The the value of a yield why won't yale ever change its name? Yale is named for a slave trader everybody Yale will never ever ever change its name as university because you go there So that when you're at a cocktail party or a job interview you go well as a yale man never goes whoo But here's my point. I don't think everyone goes whoo anymore I think that people less and less think that this stuff relieving matters clay. I got into ivy league business Mba programs. I didn't do it. I went to work for glenn instead So I sit here as somebody who went through this right now you can say well I went to undergrad Yeah, but what I realized was that I know plenty of people that get these mba's because I think oh It's going to open all these doors to be amazing. Maybe It's all very situational. It's not some golden ticket to this amazing future And that's to your point what the promises for all these kids is if you get in it's going to be Such an easier life for you Now for a lot of people going to the you know Sometimes it's better to be on the on the uh, you know the the other team The practice team so you can get better and better and then you know life is a long game I I just feel like people need to stop thinking that It's interesting buck gw was probably the worst school that I got into But they gave me an academic scholarship and there are a lot of kids out there right now Who let's say you live in georgia? The university of georgia has an incredible honors college. You might get into emery. You might get into vanderville You might get into duke I bet the education that you're going to get in the honors college at georgia is every bit is good You asked a good question. You said hey I don't think that I got a single benefit from going to georgia washington university I I I mean and i'm not sure i'd take a shot at gw It's a great school in dc if your kids just got in and you're like, I'm so excited in the north east I'll tell you it's considered like a rich kid school So because i'm the most expensive school in the country and you know, it's certainly a super rich kid school And those rich kids help pay for my scholarship. So I thank them for that Right, that's they charge a lot But dc is a fabulous place to go all these things. I will say grad school Vanderbilt university law school I do think in my experience where you go to law school the alumni networks are very helpful in getting you those initial jobs When you come out of law school because they have on campus interviews. I think vanderville university law school I met my wife there. It's my best three years of my life. I've ever spent. I can't speak highly enough about it But I also think a lot of people come out of law school. They have so much debt buck They have to go. You know this your sister's in a big firm like the big firm lifestyle Is not conducive to people being like this is amazing you work 80 hours a week You basically are chained to your desk Much of that time is spent trying to pay off of your existing law school loans You aren't doing for the most part high level intellectual work It's a lot of grunt work. There are worse jobs. I'm not saying it, but I do think this idea gets sold to kids Um That is oftentimes not reflective and look what I did I went into media and ended up, you know completely doing something different Right. I mean I was going to say I I remember at at amorous where where I went um They they was all this on campus recruiting and it was really Overwhelmingly in two fields because you got to remember this is 2004 So it's pre-great recession and you know it was Investment banking and management consulting go work for goldman go work for mckenzie That was kind of or some variation of of you know those firms out there You know jp morgan or whatever and those are sweat shops out there for people who don't know what investment banking jobs are for young kids They are brutal. We'll see this is what I was going to tell everybody of the people I knew who did that Um and a lot of my my graduating class went to those places Almost none of them stayed in those fields almost none of them I mean at this point I mean one out of one out of 21 out of 30 maybe are still working and and I mean I'm not talking about that firm I mean in that business. I had a friend who got out when to finance and he opened he he got into the restaurant business I had another friend who got it went into finance and then he went so now people will argue they'll say Well, it's a huge benefit to your resume to go to one of those fancy places It helps you go other places But the point is that this uh the the way that Career fields work now you and I are both examples of this and in in sort of both different and similar respects Is that you figure out which where you have opportunity where you want to be what you think you're good at and you move and maneuver The spend 30 years at the company and be a company man and retire and that's that's just much less common these days anyway So that that whole notion is I think is changing very rapidly Um, and you know, I think that's a good thing Yeah, let me say this too. This is a good email. I just got from one of our listeners Carl He said I have to disagree with your statement that a university degree doesn't matter after your first job I'm 60 years old and my association and degrees from texas a and m help you help me regularly in my business Otherwise you and buck have a great show. It's a good point. I should bring up. I do think buck you were mentioning athletics I like though. Otherwise good show. I'll take it. Yeah, you're totally wrong on which I respect and you're totally wrong on this I will say if you have a strong association with your alumni group and sometimes that can be hey We are all monster fans of and I bet this guy is a big texas a and m fighting agie fan And you go back to games all the time and your network is very much connected in that way That can have a long term impact in a super positive way Um where it's not necessarily though the degree It's basically the fraternity and relationships that you have with all of these people and If you are a diehard fan of a sports team It is true that you may look at some of those initial applications when they come in and be like oh this person went to my favorite school And you may be more likely to respond to it. I don't think anybody ever saw me go to gw And was like oh, I got to give this kid a job now. I went straight to law school Again, I'm not trying to take a shot at gw because I don't want somebody I've inevitably people there are out there buck right now They're like, you know, little susie or little johnny just graduated from high school and the family's ecstatic And they're going to be paying x number of dollars and everything I think it's the individual that that's my ultimate take it is But you can also get a great education we we live in an era with the the democratization Of education and your ability to be an auto die-dact of of a really high caliber Is leaps and bounds beyond what it ever used to be? I don't even think that many people know Um, whether it's con academy or you know, they're they're a whole series of yale I'm not our friends at hills del who put out incredible programming all the time that you could go check out of it That's free. Yeah, but that's but that's what I mean You can you have access to whole university Lecture series and and they're reading list if you want which any of you've been a university No, that's basically what college is you go to lectures. You do some papers. You have exams rince repeat That's what it is. So it's it's all out there. You can get an excellent You can get an excellent excellent education at at so many of these places they all have the resources and the basics Um to put it in place for you But I I think that people are going to be changing a lot of their their view here that you know I'll tell you growing up in New York city clay. It's if you didn't get into an ivy or something similar Oh, man. Everyone's like, oh, that's that's rough. You know what this is obsessed with school obsessed with this stuff Almost no one in the part of the country is you know and and everyone's can point out Well, yeah and stanford's on an ivy dukes on an ivy etc. Those are amazing schools In terms of the you know the difficulty of getting in But I I think that it's changed. I think the whole system has changed and it's changing part Because of legacy admissions athletic recruiting affirmative action There are reasons that people get into these schools that aren't that they're such amazing I wouldn't even say that you know, it's it's about how it's not about how smart somebody is but how well did they perform Academically in high school There are a lot of people who didn't perform very well. I could definitely in high school who went to these places, right? I mean, that's You know, I mean, I think uh, famously jared kushner was like dead last in his class in high school went to harvard Oh, I didn't know that. Yes. I will I will say this too buck The best argument I think you can make is one that carl kind of hit on I think the peer group To the extent that you pay for your peer group being surrounded by super smart people I think you learn more outside of college oftentimes than you do in the classroom And certainly the relationships that you make with the classmates that you meet there ends up being The most valuable aspect I would say of college or law school or any graduate Degree that you would get Uh, but it's just such a fascinating Um, such a fascinating debate and discussion. I think in general that's all tied in with what the supreme court did today You feel the effects of inflation every day whether you're at the gas station supermarket or even just buying a cup of coffee If you're a homeowner, you're likely feeling it with every repair We tend to pay a lot for our bills these days. I guess what you do with a credit card That means you know, us consumer debt levels are up over a trillion dollars in the last 12 months The biggest increase in two decades if you're a homeowner There's a way out if you are finding yourself under some of that crippling debt load sometimes 23 24 25 or more a year They'll put together a plan to pay off high interest credit card debt create meaningful savings for you Every month they're saving homeowners thousand dollars a month Closing in as fast as 10 days time you can take advantage of this call american financing Uh, they have a salary based mortgage consultant today 7,000 positive google reviews cost you nothing to get started and if you get started Today you could possibly delay two mortgage payments giving you even greater savings upfront Call american financing today the number 80777 8109 that's 807 788 109 you can also visit american financing net nmles 183 1 8234 nmls consumer access dot org From the front lines of truth clay travis and buck sexton welcome back to play end buck Uh hunter biden Giving a deposition and laptop lawsuit that up on fox now. We're gonna continue to follow that story very closely What's gonna happen there joe biden? Um What was it he said he got a scholarship in top of his class To be fair jara did not graduate in the bottom of his class But he did have a 2.5 million gift given in his name, which was probably helpful to get into harvard Um Gotta get the facts right here hunter biden joe biden Wait hunter went to yale law school That's the hardest law school in the country to get into everybody just so you know They they accept something like 2 percent of the people who get it So the elite stuff happens on on you know, the democrats Republicans not as much republicans if you have a famous last name and you're a democrat you will get into I think uh Uh didn't Cuomo bro Cuomo not Andrew the other one chris He got into I think he's a yale law grad as well Because his dad was uh mario quomo the you know Well-known democrat governor of new york If you're if you're a canody if you're a clinton if you're any of these you will get into did any school you want? reject Sasha or malia obama No, they got into absolutely every school. They have every school they applied But you know what they only I bet they only applied to one harvard That would be my guess. I don't even know where they went Yeah, it was this it's if you're if you're a powerful democrat politician your kids It's a safety school for them to apply to harvard basically you're good to go you're getting in So that look there's a lot of this is what I mean Though there are a lot of games people write big checks people have famous last names So you start to add all this up. You realize, you know, you're it is supposed to be About education It's supposed to be about learning stuff and growing as a person The notion of this as some kind of a golden ticket to this amazing future where you make all this money I know plenty of kids went to ivy league schools who Didn't really amount to very much. So yeah, it's not not a guarantee of anything clay was pointing out that the uh the president of harvard Has already come out with a statement And what they're going to do here is that I can already see how this is going I think columbia university drops sat requirements Yeah As a so they're going to drop sat requirements If you are not a preferred minority You're going to have to share your sat's or else you have no chance of getting in and if you are a preferred minority by these schools You're going to have to write an essay about how much racism and discrimination you faced and then you'll still have already sent an email buck Uh harvard university said the court ruled that colleges and universities May consider an admissions decisions quote And applicants discussion of how race affected his or her life Be it through discrimination inspiration or otherwise They will have these essays which are default Uh the tests for who is actually a minority right Um, and I I think you're right. I think the actual makeup of harvard's class will not change one iota. Yep It's not going to change. So the only way this will change is if somebody and they're going to Uh really clamp down on on how people can get information about it about admissions Uh, you're just gonna have to sue these places. You have to sue them a lot. Otherwise, nothing's going to change I mean mind not change anyway Look, this could go down As the worst government power grab in history According to someone who knows dr. Noemie prince our financial system could soon spiral into chaos It's all thanks to a dangerous new program put forward by the Biden administration Forget about banning guns or gas-powered cars. We could soon see a total ban on cash itself This is all thanks to the launch of a new technology called fed now It's an attack on our cash, but it's also an attack on your privacy and your ability to spend your money when and how you see fit Soon you may not be able to buy a cup of coffee without tripping an alarm at the irs huge changes are coming this summer You should get the facts so you're not caught off guard when events take a turn for the worst Find out what you can do to prepare now at disappearing dollar Dot com again. That's disappearing dollar Dot com take action today so you can prepare before this financial calamity hits go to disappearing dollar Dot com paid for by rogue economics clay travis and bucks exon On the front lines of truth. Welcome back in clay travis bucks exon show Buck one thing that I don't think we should ignore the supreme court just ruled that colleges and universities Can't do exactly what joe biden did when he took put kataji brown jaxon on the supreme court One of the three people who said affirmative action should still be legal You'll recall that biden specifically made the promise as he campaigned in south carolina in the spring of 2020 That if there were a supreme court vacancy he would only appoint a black woman to the supreme court in so doing he Directly eliminated 94 of the qualified applicants in the united states to sit on the supreme court probably higher than that because I don't know What percentage of black women are lawyers in this country? uh, but Anyone who was a warrior that was not a black woman was not eligible to be considered I theoretically buck Could be considered to sit on the supreme court, right? I was not specifically considered by joe biden because i'm a white guy That would not be allowed Probably not the only reason but was a reason to be fair Yes, there are many reasons why I was not considered but buck what's interesting about this is It first of all probably is unconstitutional what joe biden did but and this ties into me with the supreme court decision today If joe biden had just put out buck a list like donald trump did of 20 people that he was considering to name as a supreme court justice And one of them was katanji brown jaxon. He could have come out and said I interviewed all 20 of these people I found katanji brown jaxon to be the most qualified you or I might not agree with it But at least it would have considered her in comparison with her other contenders to sit on the supreme court when he said I'm only going to take a black woman. He actually demeaned his selection Before he even made it and I I hinted at this and we kind of mentioned it in the first hour The data reflects that this actually becomes a major issue with affirmative action because people get into schools that they're not qualified to get And then they fail more often than if they had gone to a better match of a school where they would fit the overall undergraduate student body better so This to me is just fascinating because katanji brown jaxon is dissenting at least she's being consistent But joe biden's very own qualifications by which he selected his only supreme court justice Are not actually constitutional if they were being applied Beyond just colleges and universities and that raises this question buck does this opinion Actually start to call into question the entire dei diversity equity and inclusion Narrative that has taken over so many parts of our government and public companies you'd have to wonder what about Government contracts that are specific to minorities. Yeah, what about privileged or or um, you know specific Hiring of minorities by private companies If it's illegal now unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race In college admissions shouldn't it be unconstitutional to hire on the basis of race? I would like to see how that argument goes. I think we are going to be heading in that direction Um, so you know that they it's also interesting I find that the weakest of all the defenses you hear about this stuff the same democrats who You know would we're celebrating, uh, you know, oh burger fell as the the greatest thing in history and whatever you think about that Obergefell was a departure from what had been the law of the land in this country for a very long time um meaning a sweeping supreme court decision of any kind that the left likes is Finally justice a supreme court decision that goes against previous decisions the left doesn't like starry to sizes The court has already ruled on the you know, it's also Obvious and and goes right in line with what we had to expect But when you really look at the precedents here the precedents were super weak The precedents are we won't you know, hopefully we won't need this in 25 years That's not the constitution is not a we won't need this in 25 years document, right? Uh, the the notion also of diversity as an educational benefit What does that mean? It's a phrase that we've all been taught that has no actual diversity of what how how much when for how long and what does it do? And that came up specifically in the in the majority opinion as well. How are we supposed to measure this? How can we know if we got rid of this that there won't be just as much diversity in the classroom? They have no answers to any of this they just have there's so much racism in america And we want special stuff for some people that's it Yeah, i'm glad you mentioned that buck because diversity of thought is the only diversity that matters And implicitly especially in an educational context because without diversity of thought you don't learn how to debate You don't learn how to contemplate ideas that you may or may not agree with going forward I've got a 15 year old in debate camp right now You would have loved the text that he was sending me buck They're learning about modern monetary theory And he had not experienced the idea of modern monetary theory Which is the underlying aspect of the biden administration when they came into office Hey, we'll just print as much debt as we want. There's no such thing as a national debt. I'm Simplifying it, but I said, you know, this is so important because you need to understand The entire scope of left and right political arguments in order to figure out what the right side is in your opinion You don't win In the court of intellectual opinion by only considering one side of a spectrum argument You've got to understand the totality of it And that's why diversity of thought is the only diversity that matters but buck Implicit in the idea of diversity as a classroom justification is the idea that we're all different based on our race Which I fundamentally reject. I think that most of us have far more in common across racial lines And by the way, we should play this because this is joe biden just had marrick garland his attorney general walk out and say Questioning the rule of law and i'm paraphrasing him is a direct assault upon democracy That's what he said when any of us said hey feels like hunter biden's getting a sweetheart deal This doesn't feel like actual justice biden was asked after his affirmative action comments about whether this was This supreme court, let me just play the audio he's asked a question. I want you to hear it I want you to hear his response. Is this a road court? This is not a normal Okay, if you had trouble hearing that he was asked is this a road court and then he said this is not a normal court But they are setting the table To pack the court and add more justices, but that's a direct attack Up on the independence of the judiciary, which marrick garland just said was unacceptable Yep, there's uh, there's really no particularly Stable and consistent arguments that you'll hear in favor of of keeping they the left has decided they like this Uh, they like this process of affirmative action and college admissions It makes them feel good about themselves to support it And particularly the democrat elitus spouse this stuff Their attitude is always as long as my kids get into great schools through whatever means necessary Sure, affirmative action is is fine with me. So I but I do believe this is going to create There'll be more things that now have to be Uh visited. I think now you have to on what basis can you have? constitutionally speaking Uh racial preferences and hiring. I mean if you can't have it in college admissions, how can you have it in hiring? It'll be more difficult in private employers to analyze it Um because the private harvest the private institution well, but they take a lot of federal funds Yeah, so I think that's part of the way that they tie that in now your point. I think which is a hundred percent true This to me would destroy the idea. Let's say that you are out there and you're making a You're you're doing a new road and the road has to be 20 completed by minority-owned businesses, right? How is that justifiable when it is federal taxpayer dollars that are paying for an interstate? Yeah, I would think the same logic would apply here as would apply meaning to the colleges and universities as would apply to uh that and and by the way, but that's a total sham a lot of times because people will just put a minority at the top of the uh of the of the ledger and Then they'll get that minority contract even though a lot of times This is behind the you know how these construction businesses work a lot of times. It's not actually Anything different, right? It's it's the same subcontractors and contractors that are doing the work Look, I I think that it's a it's a great day for the constitution and the rule of law in this country But I think it's also just the beginning of more that has to come for this to be for the for the equal Protection of a law to be meaningful this notion that institutions can treat people differently based on skin color Privilegings some at the expense of others Um, this is wrong and it has to be dealt with and we have to erase this from our society The same way that people would view racial discrimination of the past is wrong and obviously that is true Racial discrimination in the present is wrong And I would suggest this also buck is a huge opportunity for republicans to reach out to asian voters You saw this happen with lee's elder in the new york uh election Um, I think that a lot of asian voters because they believe in the meritocracy Are natural republican voters. They just haven't realized it yet And I think this is an example of how you reach out to them We've been making that there's a lot of arguments been made like that for a long time I don't I mean, I don't think this is gonna move the needle with asian voters particularly, but we'll see It does at the state and local you are such you are such a pessimist I got it. I got it. I got to get you I got to get you to uh to to buy into the uh to the Destruction of identity politics. I really do think it's gonna happen buck I think in the next decade the entire identity politics pyramid is going to collapse I think you're calling you're calling for the collapse of the democrat party there So I'll remind you I'll remind you this we're in year three of the uh, coma administration Oh God now i'm really being pessimistic. I Fourth I don't know if I can do three years of convula Uh fourth of july weekend means lots of family gatherings barbecues But if you're lucky it also means downtime either to relax or get a few projects done One project a lot of you put off digitizing old media from back in the day If you've got a box full of family videos from the eighties or the nineties It's time to preserve them because those tapes they're not gonna last forever the magnetic strip You know what the centigrade's with time a lot of people have forgotten that You may not even have a vcr in your house to watch those old tapes Why not go ahead and take care of these long-term memories with legacy box their company based in tennessee They've got the technology the gear and an expertly trained staff You ship them your tapes and boom they come back preserve forever digitally right now.

We're going to talk about this is case up in new york city Where a guy who defended himself on the train was released Um From no more charges have been dropped basically Uh, and and we'll give you the details on that story It's interesting because a lot of people are drawing parallels to the daniel penny story and wondering well Why is one of these outcomes so different already someone who Is uh threatened by someone and now we'll we'll get into the details of it I won't get in all the details right this second. We'll get to it though coming up here in just a minute now we have Who is on the lines jane in emerald isle north carolina two kids in college. What's going on jane And one is a volunteer Well, i'm two kids in college and the reality is this the college never makes the student the student makes the college And your skin color your sexual preference your religion. That's not the issue. It's what the student brings to the table I mean, I think that's true at any at any of these institutions It's what someone makes of it I knew plenty of people that went to the fanciest most elite schools who used it as a Bong and beer session for four years and graduated and wonder why everybody wasn't so impressed I know other people clay that went to to your college or then or or a community college And then they maybe got into another program to specialize in and all of a sudden, you know They own like 10 businesses and i've got 150 employees Yeah, sometimes people use getting to a good college as if it's the end I think that's good advice that you need to give to kids out there. Okay. Congratulations. You got into a good college You're not done Right, that's just really the start of your adult life and and a lot of people miss that I gave a an impromptu speech a long time ago at my high school I was this before I was even working in media. I was still the cia at the time But they asked me to come and talk to the outgoing senior class And it was uh fall of the of their graduation year And I said look you guys have great grades. You're going to great schools fantastic So do a lot of other people every awesome job that you want that you're going to apply for There are going to be 50 to 100 other people with excellent credentials that want that job and thousands of other people that would love that job But they could have it so it takes a lot more than just know well. I have a 4.3 And you know, I was awesome. I I thought it's a four point system This is one thing. I don't know how it was another we had a four point system Like people say oh I had a 5.5 GPA or something. I'm like, what is this? I'm just throwing that out there I don't know what that is all about That's why they had to put in place standardized testing because everybody had all these different gpa standards and it's not all equal art in Taylor, Texas. What's up art? Hey now much guys Clay, I agreed with your assessment. Oh, I'm opening monologue About 90 percent of it the other 10 percent when you said at some point there still has to be some sociagnostic economic or Raised taking into consideration. Just not checking the box on the front page. No, yeah, let's let me explain that I think I think that merit part of merit is not only looking at who can rise to the highest level It's considering what you've overcome And to me if you are in that bottom 10 percent of income And you have risen to the point where you are in the mix I also think and I don't know about you buck a lot of these schools the kids that go to harvard and yell They don't have a real idea of what it's like to not be rich like they are overwhelmingly filled with the kids of the super rich So yeah, I understand some people disagree. I think socio economic diversity is more important by far Than racial diversity because of rich black kid who's got parents who are doctors and lawyers Is no different than in my opinion a rich white kid with the same background You're proposing making up for the deficiencies of the education system between the grades of k through 12 We're gonna we're gonna make it all up when they enter college now Now you're you're argument. It's a great point for school choice Because if these kids even though they come from a poor background or maybe not a family that's supporting Education if they had school choice. I as one example They would they wouldn't you wouldn't need to use socio economic It's a great point art and this this ties in with bucks point. You know who really favors school choice rich people There if you're wealthy enough to put your i'm fortunate to do it I'm fortunate my kids went to public school for most of their for k through six I've got kids now in private school If you're wealthy enough to put your kids in private school Those rich democrats in congress who are opposed to school choice They don't oppose it in their own life. They're just opposed to people having school choice who don't have the same economic resources as them Patricia from date no high. I want to get you in here. What's up? Patricia Oh, maybe patricia doesn't want to weigh in Okay, I do. Oh there we go. I just had some static I'd like to address the other side of the coin That you actually did for me and that was a conversation that I heard On russia's program from tomah soul when he was talking about the individual who is the recipient of Affirmative action and the destruction that this does for these young people that come in and they don't have the background to compete And they leave school they are not successful When if and tomah soul's point was if they had been allowed or sent to a community college or college within their state That had the the curriculum that they could handle Yeah, the skills mismatch. I remember tomah soul has written about it many times"
