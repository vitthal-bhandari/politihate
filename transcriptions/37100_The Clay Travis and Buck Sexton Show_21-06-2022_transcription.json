    "text": " You're listening to the Buck Sexton Show Podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to the whole line. I'm Buck Sexton. Is the left fighting a losing battle on many fronts of the culture war right now? It certainly seems like it's moving in that direction, which would be the first time in a long time that the Democrat Party, the Progressives, those who seek to do damage to our lasting traditional cultural institutions may find themselves with the American people saying, enough is enough. But first, the Supreme Court decision that we're all waiting for that is expected based upon a leak of an earlier draft to overturn Roe v. Wade has not been released as of yet. It could come any day now. It is likely to come in the next week or so. And that means that there are going to be some people who view this as a massive, a massive move in the right direction when it comes to the rights of unborn babies. There will be others, however, the activists of the pro-abortion movement who are enraged. And one thing you notice about so many of the people that are most vocal in favor of abortion, they often seem unhinged and quite a bit nasty. Here's a pro-choice activist, for example, shouting some obscenities at students for life. I'm sorry, I'm not like it. Oh, ****. You're a hard person. You're a hard person. You're a bad same part right away. I'm always getting a portion of the vote in the black house. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. You're a **** guy. Put rapers. Do you wanna have a sport? What do you wanna mean, ****, what do you wanna mean? I'm gonna talk to somebody that has a break. Thank you. Such anger and also sadness at the same time from a young woman who clearly has been lost. There are so many of these abortion activists, these people for whom abortion is really they find the fundamental freedom of wrongdoing. of women that seem deeply unhappy, unsettled, perhaps even a bit unhinged. And that's going to get a whole lot worse if the decision does come down as a 5-4 overturning of Roe the Wade. Democrats don't have any particular messaging on this that holds together and makes sense. Vice President Harris, for example, has said recently that there's nothing about abortion that will require anyone to abandon their faith. Well, if you're a Catholic, for example, a believing Catholic who follows the tenets of the church, that's not true, despite the fact that there are Democrat activists and Democrat politicians who say otherwise, there is, in fact, a connection for many people of faith to need to protect unborn babies in the womb. And this seems like a major blow to the left is coming, at least, in the days ahead here from the reversal of Roe v. Wade. And after decades of being able to lean on this fake constitutional right, now they'll have to actually take this to the states, which means making an argument instead of just shouting about how it's a right, it's a right. So they may lose because of the courts on that one. On the issue of the trans agenda and transgender athletes specifically, much more likely that the left is going to be losing ground as we see it play out going into the midterm elections. Megan Rapinoe is a female soccer player from the US national team who is for the end of her career. She's almost 40. And she has given some very dismissive and snide comments recently about anybody who plays women's sports being upset at the fact that there are men, biological males, individuals with male genitalia, XY chromosomes, et cetera, that anyone who's upset about them playing in female sports is being childish, being selfish. I mean, here's one example of a quote from her. Show me the evidence that trans women are taking everyone's scholarship, dominating in every sport, winning every title. I'm sorry, it's just not happening. So we need to start from inclusion period. And as things arise, I have confidence that we can figure it out, but we can't start from the opposite. It's cool and frankly disgusting. She said, so we need to really take a step back and get a grip on what we're talking about here because people's lives are at risk. Kids' lives are at risk when the rates of suicide, rates of depression, negative mental health and a drug abuse, we're putting everything through, God forbid, a trans person be successful in sports, get a grip, take a step back. And she also said something along the lines of, you know, your daughter's high school volleyball team isn't that important, get over yourself. She's a fraud and an imbecile. Fraud in so far is if men were allowed to play in women's sports, nobody would have heard of her because she would be dominated, not just by any male professional soccer player, by trained 15 and 16 year old men. As we know, they actually were able to defeat the women's national team in a friendly not long ago. I don't think they're actually 14 and 15 year old. So 14 and 15 year old men can beat the best women's soccer team in the world. Yeah. So start with that, which I think is just interesting because after she was able to use sex segregated sports to her advantage for decades, now she wants to allow for the destruction of that. But notice also the way that this is framed as, you either don't want people to live or you allow, you know, a 250 pound man to play on a women's field hockey team. That's just completely unfair. Everyone knows it. Everyone at a very basic common sense level understands how absurd this is. But wokeness demands you embrace absurdity. Wokeness, the left, the Democrat party, demand of you that you reject what you can see with your own eyes, reject what you can observe yourself. And that's why. And also, of course, there's a lot of virtue signaling here. Oh, yeah. I care so much about trans inclusivity and sports. So I'm a good person. What about the women who are trying really hard to be the best in their sport? Just essentially abolishing that for them is somehow, the dismissiveness, the snide tone, Rapinoe is gross. And then there's Olympic swimmer Sharon Davies, who was revealed recently that she has received death threats because she spoke out against trans women, also known as men who think they are women, in women's sport. Why? It really is. Everybody is scared because the moment you try to speak out and just ask for fairness, you get called names, you get death threats, you get the TRA's bringing up your employers, trying to get your sack, trying to get you unemployed. There's not been respectful debate on both sides of this. You know, it has to be out in the open. It's trying to lie on everything to find solutions for everybody. And that's what this has always been about from my side. It's never been about excluding trans people. It's been about promoting fair sport. Promoting fair sport. Yeah, that is certainly what it's about, among other things. And then there's this video, the American people, I think, recognizing that even in the US Navy, the pronoun mania and the trans inclusivity doctrine are mandatory. This is a US Navy training video. Watch this. Hi, my name is Johnny and I use he-him pronouns. Hi, and I am Conci and I use she-her pronouns. And we're here to talk about pronouns. What is a pronoun? A pronoun is how we identify ourselves, apart from our name, and it's also how people refer to us in conversations. Using the right pronouns is a really simple way to affirm someone's identity. It is a signal of acceptance and respect. If it's a signal of acceptance and respect, how do we go about creating a safe space for everybody? That's a good question. A really good way to do that is to use inclusive language. Instead of saying something like, hey guys, you can say, hey everyone, or hey team. Yeah, and now that you say that, another way that we could show that we're allies and that we accept, everybody is to maybe include our pronouns in our emails, or like we just did, introduce ourselves using our pronouns. This stuff continues on, this wokeness, infiltrating all across the military. We're going to end up losing a major award at some point. You're never going to say, why? Why do we not have the esprit de corps to fight a battle to the very end? Well, because we're worried about pronouns. That our friend Ned Ryan of American Majority coming up in just a second to tell us about the political landscape. Is there some elections today? And of course, the big election coming up this fall, they go around. Let's talk about protecting your home for a minute. You know that I'm skeptical by nature. So when I first heard about home title theft and the idea that thieves can literally steal your home, I was like, really? Can some cyber criminal really forage my name off the title of my home and take over as the new owner? Turns out, yeah, he can. Not as rare as you'd think. According to the FBI, this crime is growing faster than credit card fraud, and you're not covered by homeowners shouldn't insurance or common identity theft programs. Home title lock earned my trust. Home title lock puts a virtual barrier around your home's title. The instant they detect anyone tampering with their home's title, they mobilize to help shut it down. Here's what I urge you to do. Number one, go to hometetalock.com and read the testimonials from FBI agents and government officials. Number two, register your home address to see if you're already a victim, and don't even know it. When you protect your home, tell them bucks, sex, and send you to get my listener discount.

There were some primary and special elections underway today in Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia and there was a big election that just happened last week that has some indicators of what we could be expecting this fall when it comes to Hispanic vote in the GOP. Whenever we're talking politics, we want a man who has a finger on the pulse, who is a prognosticator, Para X. Alance, who understands where all this stuff is going. We've got to talk to our friend Ned Ryan, CEO of American Majority. He joins us now. My main man, Ned, how are you, buddy? Good to see you. Hey, I'm doing well, Buck. Good to be back with you. So the victory of Myra Flores in Texas is District 34 last week. To you, one district tucked down along the U.S.-Mexico border Rio Grande Valley. What do you take from that with? Well, I'm pretty optimistic, Buck already. I don't want to get overly optimistic, though, looking at these results. But I do think things are moving in our favor in a lot of different ways. I mean, go back and look at December. There was a bolt on of the Hispanic community in which they were asked, who do you plan on voting for in the 2022 midterms? And it was 37% Republican, 37% Democrat. So they've been signed the long away. Do you get the April Joe Biden's approval rating with the Hispanic community was only at 26%? And the thing that the Hispanic community has made very clear is their number one issue is inflation. Right? What a shocker. Right? But the rest of the country, it's inflation. But the Hispanic community, it's inflation. So they're looking at this and blaming Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for what's taking place, rightly so. So I think there's a whole lot of different trends that are pointing in our direction that are going to be very beneficial to the Republicans with the Hispanic community come this fall. I think the Flores victory is an indication of that. I actually, Buck, I got to tell you, when you're looking at some of these approval ratings, Joe Biden, various demographics, not only is he taking you with the Hispanics, he's taking with the Asian American community, I think 76% of them voted for him in 2020. He's down at 53%. So it's not only the Hispanic community, but there's other demographics that Joe Biden is very, very badly. Precinct Quinnipiac poll shows that Biden's approval among Hispanic voters dropped from May of 2021. It was 55%. I mean, solid numbers there for Biden. May of 2022, 26%. That is, do not pass go, do not collect $200 kind of approval number. That is rough stuff right there. And you're seeing that kind of holding over the course of months. It's not like it's bumping up and down and going in Biden's favor and then driving back. Now, no, it's holding pretty steady at that 26, 27, 28% approval rating in the Hispanic community. I mean, these are all telltale signs that they have real problem. I'm stating the obvious, Buck, when I say this, Democrats are facing an absolute shellacking come this fall. In fact, so much, Buck, I mean, I'm here in my home state of Virginia, where it was a 12 point flip between 2020 and 2021, when you look at Biden versus I have to tell you, I feel very comfortable in saying anything that Joe Biden won by 12 or 13 points in 2020 is absolutely in play in 2022. In fact, so much so I'd even go out on limits. Say this, Buck, I think anything that's 20 points or less that Joe Biden won in 2020 might absolutely be competitive this fall. So what are some of the races then some of the states or districts that are high profile that you think could be in the in the gettable? Maybe a bit of a reach, but gettable category going into this fall. All right, the easiest place to start is with the statewides with the Senate. You look at Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire. I think those are those are absolutely real pickup opportunities for Republicans where I think it gets very interesting is when you start to look at states like Connecticut and Washington state and Colorado, where people are thinking, you know, that there's no way those could be competitive in 2022. But those are right at the 2019, I think Colorado was 14 point margin of victory for Biden in 2020. I think those three Senate races could be highly competitive. I'm not saying we're going to win them. I think we might be able to sneak one, maybe two of them though. That would be fantastic, obviously. I mean, I'm certainly hopeful. By the way, Mo Brooks squaring off today in against what is it, Brit in in Alabama? What do you think? What do you think of that race for the that Senate seat? You know, Brooks got the Trump endorsement, the Trump endorsement got withdrawn. I mean, I've known Mo Brooks. I knew him when he was a congressman. He was really good on the border, really good on immigration. That's all I really remember about his time then though. So what went on here? Well, it really came down to Mo Brooks announcing in front of a very large rally that he thought we needed to move past the 2020 elections, which of course is a big issue with Trump. And on top of that, he was running a rather lackluster campaign at the time. I think a combination of factors, Trump, Trump, all the endorsement. I have to tell you, what irritated Trump coming down the home stretch in the primary was that Mo actually continued to use that endorsement after it had been rescinded and sent out a mail or so people I think were a little surprised that Trump endorsed Brett afterwards in the in the runoff. I was not actual. How do you have any any prediction for us on that one? People are voting as we speak. I got to tell you, I would love to see Mo win being completely honest, but I'm getting bridge the nod. I think she's going to be able to pull out because you have to understand she's Shelby's former chief of staff. And Shelby has a very powerful machine inside of Alabama, even though Trump is very popular and Trump is very popular as well. So I think those two combined factors are going to make it very hard for Mo to overcome. But hey, I would love to see Mo win. I just think Brett's going to pull it out tonight. And the race between our Herschel Walker, I interviewed Herschel earlier today on radio. And he showed a real grasp of the issues and particular fluency, I think, in connecting to people over the issue of gas prices. If there's one Senate race that you really, what's the biggest one for you that you think is going to be the harbinger of things to come? I mean, is it that race between Warnock and Herschel Walker or is it lack salt out of Nevada? I mean, which one are you going to be watching most closely? I feel really confident about Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. I think the one that's going to tell you is going to be a disaster is New Hampshire. If we take back New Hampshire, I think it's game on with those other things. Remember in homes in that one? And how's it looking right now? Boy, it's one of those things I have to tell you has been a little they wanted to do. The NRC was recruiting governor, Sunu. We might not get the top quality candidate that we want, but I think at this point, it's 2022 Buck. And I think any Democrat that's on the ballot, and a lot of these states, you have to look at Biden's approval rating. It's in the low 30s. I think he's maybe 37, 38% New Hampshire. And I would remind people in the 2010 shellacking, Obama was at 44.7% approval. And he got absolutely hosed in the house and the Senate races. And Joe Biden is well below that mark, not only nationally, but when you get to these individual states, he's in the low 30s, even in the high 20s and some of these key center races. I think it's going to be a good fall, Ned. Keep her fingers crossed and the eye on the prize. Thanks so much for being with us, my friend. Good to see you. Thanks, boy. All right. Coming up, a major decision on religious freedom comes down in a 6-3 ruling from the Supreme Court.

A blow for religious freedom today struck by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision that will make it a whole lot easier for parents across the country who want their children to go to religious schools to be able to do so. Turns out the wall of separation between church and state, which doesn't actually exist in the first amendment or the Constitution, isn't quite what a lot of libs thought it was. We're joined now by Bethany Mandel. She's editor of Heroes of Liberty and contributing writer at Deseret News. Talk to us about all this. Bethany, thanks for being here. Hey, thanks so much for having me. So first, get into the news. What was at issue in this 6-3 Supreme Court decision that came down today? What are the facts of the case that folks need to know? Yeah, so basically, this Supreme Court decided that parents in Maine can use their tuition vouchers for religious schools, not just any old private school, but that they have to be able to use those tuition vouchers, even at religious schools. So it was a pretty big decision for school choice advocates today. And so what do you think this means nationwide for the trend, it seems, of school choice and specifically religious school choice? Yeah, absolutely. So for states that this choice is granted, it opens up the door to a lot more, a lot more religious schools to be able to take this money. And so, not just Catholic schools, but schools of any religious persuasion can take this money from voucher programs and expand their programming into parochial programs that were just sort of channeled before into private education without any sort of religious structure. The basics, as I see here, are that this could increase school voucher programs, tax credits, defund scholarships, and tax exempt educational savings accounts. The Supreme Court decision reads, under the new program, parents designate the secondary school that would like their child to attend public or private, and the school district transmits payments to that school to help defray the cost of tuition. Also, the documented states that if a state uses taxpayer money to pay for students attending non-religious private schools, it must also use taxpayer funds to pay for attendance at religious schools. So, I mean, do we expect that this will perhaps increase enrollment at schools that are Christian, Jewish, or Muslim, and anything else that may be involved here? What do you think? Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, for a lot of parents who wanted to pull their kids out of the public school system, money was a huge consideration. And so, they were sort of in Maine or in similar states, they were deciding, you know, we'll send our kid to a private school that's better than the public's. But if the money can't go to a religious school, then I guess we'll try to send them to a different sort of more morally aligned private. But now they don't have to make that choice. Now, they can have their money follow their student to a religious school or to not a religious school, and that really opens the door for a lot of religious schools that had been hampered by the fact that, you know, their competitors down the road who didn't have a religious affiliation were able to take a lot more cash from the state. And now they're able to take it too. Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined the majority in this six-three decision, wrote that Maine's non-sectarian requirement was otherwise generally available tuition assistance payments violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. What do you think? Yeah, I mean, it absolutely does. Parents have to, you know, I don't understand why they, I mean, I do understand why they limited the use of these funds for religious schools, it's because they wanted to handicap them. And it was against the religious freedom, the religious rights of these schools to be able to take this money just like any other private school. And so, yeah, I mean, it was a long time coming. Also, in the minority opinion here, Justice Sotomayor, Chair and her thoughts as follows, this court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the framers fought to build. The court has upended constitutional doctrine, shifting from a rule that permits states to decline upon religious organization, to one that requires state in many circumstances to subsidize religious indoctrination with taxpayer dollars. I honestly do wonder, as I read this, if Justice Sotomayor knows that the wall of separation between church and state isn't actually a thing. Yeah, I mean, and it's also disturbing that she thinks just sending your kids to a Jewish school or Catholic school's religious indoctrination. No, it's just education. There was so much wrong with that statement that I don't even know where to begin to unpack it. Yeah, I mean, she's citing this obviously, and you could say, it's a very common talking point among people that are either atheist or believe very strongly in denigrating any kind of public, public exercise of religion or anything in the public sphere. Of course, it doesn't appear in the First Amendment doesn't appear in the Constitution anywhere, and they speak of it with reverence as though it does. So, I mean, I think that this at least shows that on some key issues of First Amendment freedom, this court seems to be unified with at least a six-three decision, which is a good thing. I also want to ask what you think about the big push going on right now from the left separately from this to push for children to be exposed to drag before, which this has become a big cultural flashpoint. A lot of people will openly say, this is a good thing and that drag, like, why does drag queen story hour have to be something that people get behind? Why not just have adult males or adult females dressed as they normally would reading to children? What do they get out of this? I don't know. I mean, where is Justice Sotomayor right now? Let's protect children from this religious indoctrination of the drag queens. This is part of their religion. They think that drag queens have to have this access to children and therefore widen their horizons. I'm really not sure what it comes down to is just the total sexualization of childhood, which is their ultimate goal. And I really don't understand the fervent desire to expose children to gyrating men dressed as women, but there's so, so much wrong with it. And parents can do whatever they want to do, but we're paying for it with our DAX dollars in public school library and when they do these events in New York City and also in the public libraries as well. Yes, it just seems to me that this would be such an easy issue to be dealt with by just ever agreeing there's no reason for this to be happening in the first place. But it's obviously important to a segment of the left that young children are exposed to people who are men who are dressed as women. Yeah, yeah, I really don't understand it. I mean, it used to be, you know, in Pride Month was around, I don't know, five years ago, it was just a celebration. And it was just, everyone has to accept us and now it's become sort of force fed, not just at us, but also our children. And if you don't want your toddler being read a book about swish swish go the drag queen's hips, which is a real book, suddenly you're big it. The line keeps on going farther and farther. And we should have drawn it a long time ago. And now with the drag queen story hour, I think finally we're starting to realize that they're just all out of salt on childhood, on innocence on all of it. Bethany, thanks for being with us. Thank you. The Twitter board has approved officially Elon Musk take over bid for that social media giant. We come back, we'll speak to Kara Frederick of the Heritage Foundation about just what this means and where it's all going. Stay with it. Each morning, the President of the United States receives a highly classified briefing on the most important issues facing the country. It's called the President's Daily Brief or PDB. It's delivered by America spies and analysts. Well, now you can hear your very own PDB in the form of a podcast hosted by me, Brian Dean Wright, a former CIA operations officer. Each morning at 6 a.m. Eastern, I'll bring you 15 to 20 minutes of the most important issues facing the country, giving you the critical intelligence and analysis you need to start your morning. The Elon Musk stepped closer to his actual takeover of Twitter. The board has met of that company and they have approved Elon's takeover bid. So what does this mean? Have we got to this point? Where are we going? What does it mean for free speech? All that good stuff. We got Kara Frederick with us now, director of the Tech Policy Center at the Heritage Foundation, former Facebook employee. She knows how these big tech companies work. Kara, thanks for being back with us. Of course. Thanks for having me, Buck. So how much of a milestone is this that Elon's actually gotten the approval of the board over at Twitter? First of all, are you surprised at all? Is this what you were expecting? And where do we go from here? Okay, I will say I'm a little surprised. Last time I was on the program, I was like, yeah, I'll give it 50 50 at this point because they've thrown up obstacles in his way again and again and again. The joint SEC DOJ investigation, allegations of sexual misconduct, the board taking the poison pill from the beginning. So I was not so sanguine about this actually coming to fruition. So I think this is a pretty big milestone, but as Elon himself has said today, there's three things that are still unresolved that need to be fixed basically before this goes forward. One, the bot issue, right? He wants to get it under 5%. Now, the funding that all has to come together. And number three, the shareholders still have to vote to approve this takeover. So three things, some little, some not so little, but again, this is a massive win, I think, for the people on the side of free speech and for Elon himself. So what are the steps that I mean, you mentioned so there'd be voter approval, a stock shareholder approval. Do we have any idea of what a timeline could be before? I mean, basically, people want to know when are all the Libs who are crying at their desks at the mere prospect of free speech in Twitter? When are the tears going to start to flow because this is a done deal and it's all over for the open censorship of conservatives on Twitter? I think they should get the tissues out at this point. I'm not quite sure exactly when in terms of a timeline, but I do think the shareholders would be wise to vote in favor of this because right now, Twitter is trading considerably below what Elon's actually offering for share for the company. Stocks are up a little bit. I think 1% was the last figure I saw before I came on here, but it is, I think, the fiduciary duty of the board, they did it, right? They said yes, and for their shareholders to actually let Elon take this thing over. So I think that the Libs better get their tissues out and, again, a Prague, Agarwal and all of his lackeys better keep cleaning up the platform because at this point, I think Elon's coming. If Twitter becomes a true free speech guided platform, right? I mean, Elon's always said, illegal stuff will still be illegal. You can't operate a digital illegal drug market or something on the platform. Obviously, there are going to be some things that they still don't allow and police, but if Twitter does actually allow important political debate from both sides of the aisle as part of its mission going forward, do you think that will have a meaningful impact on the way some of the other platforms, notably your former employer Facebook, maybe even TikTok, approach their approach censorship because then they won't all be in it together, right? At least there'll be a break in the chain or break in the links of the chain of collusion here. You know, Buck, you took the words out of my mouth. Number one, I have no hope for TikTok, so take that CCP-owned nonsense out of here, do what you gotta do to get the kids off TikTok, throw it away, table that for a second. Facebook potentially, but what you said is the bigger issue. It's breaking that ideological monopoly. What most people don't know is that these tech companies, they move in concert, so Google's gonna look to Facebook. Facebook's gonna look to Twitter. They're all gonna look at each other and see, are you making this decision? Okay, we're gonna follow suit. We feel comfortable when one tech company makes a content moderation decision, so we can make it too. But Twitter, if they are going to be the stalwart, if they're gonna poke their head above the parapet and basically say no, we believe in the First Amendment within the bounds of the law, Elon's words, that is gonna break that ideological monopoly, so they can't all move in concert and then sort of point fingers at each other when something like the Hunter Biden laptop story is suppressed. So that's what I see, and you pointed it out very clearly, is that breaking of the ideological monopoly, Twitter is gonna be a wrench in the spokes effectively, and we'll all be exiled as conservatives, as freedom-minded people for that to happen. The, I think it's an internal chat company, Slack. I've never used it. I've read a lot of stories about this one. I know a lot of corporations use this. Kinda reminds you what AOL Instant Messenger was back in the day for some people, but Slack has banned. It was in the news this week. The Immigration Restriction Group Federation for American Immigration Reform, from using any of its services for allegedly violating the company's terms of service. But they said they wrote a letter to Slack, quote, you should be advised that fair is well aware there are government actors who are actively trying to censor Americans' right to freedom of speech and their use of tech platforms, including particular individuals in the Department of Homeland Security. Evidence that there was intervention by government officials in this matter would be of supreme interest not only to fair, but to the general public, preserval, and trigger communications in this anticipation of probable litigation. You know, my friend Alex Faronson, I know, is in a lawsuit, ongoing lawsuit that has made it past the initial phases and is going into discovery against Twitter. It seems to me that the Federation for American Immigration Reform President here saying to Slack, well, if you guys were colluding with the government, the sitting Biden administration, for example, this is going to be a legal issue. Exactly. It's time to start treating these companies as quasi state actors. We've seen this happen again and again. Jen Psaki telling Facebook, we're working with them to flag problematic posts. Her doing it again to Spotify during the Joe Rogan issue when he was platforming Dr. Malone. You have Joe Biden saying private companies need to do more to police COVID misinformation. DHS Secretary Mallorca saying that we're working with these private companies to ensure legitimate use of the platform. And then the leaks from the disinformation board saying that we're operationalizing this, working with the government, working with the executives at Twitter to police American speech. This is indicative of a pattern that we've seen again and again and again. And you're right. Is it a legal issue? Does it render these quote unquote private companies as potential state actors? I think there's a pretty good argument that it does. And I will say when the climate change experts come out and who work for the government and basically say we're working with platforms to take down climate or potentially push them to take down climate denialism. YouTube already instituted something like that last October. Then you have a big problem on your hands. This is government and tech company collusion and big tech are the new enforcers of what is right speak according to the government. Huge problem. Take them to court. Put the hammer down on these tech companies for this because they cannot be the mouthpiece of the Biden administration to the detriment of the American citizen period. Cara Frederick always illuminating. Thanks for being with us. Thanks, bud. Biden fell off his bike from. That's some thought that's coming up next. Wicked. Oh, it's time for those stories. We throw together for you at the end to make sure you don't miss them. Some are wacky. Some are crazy. Some are fun. Some are oh my gosh. And more. Quick hits. Let's get right to it. We have as you know, bicycle gate. Not really just kidding. Joe Biden slipped on his bike a little bit. He's fine. He even heard himself. But it just looked a little goofy for a second. And it's funny to watch how you point this out. And some members of the regimes, protectors in the media say, oh, it's, you know, it's fine. Everybody falls. Everybody slips. What's the big deal? Well, you know, it's not a big deal until they make it a big deal. And at some point you say to yourself, what the heck is going on here? But Trump always able with the one-liners, always ready to step into the fray had this to say about the habit that several previous presidents have had about riding bicycles while they're in office. One of the greatest travesties of all is to see a person in the White House who even after years of political experience has absolutely no clue how to be the president of the United States. And I hope he has recovered because as you know, he fell off his bicycle today. No, I'm serious. I hope he's okay. Fell off a bicycle. I make this pledge to you today. I will never ever ride a bicycle. I'm not a big bicycle. I gotta be honest. I do ride an e-scooter in to do this show, which is a very fun way to get around. You don't necessarily look like a badass. That's putting it mildly. But you do get there quickly and it is fun. You just sort of scooting around. Bicycles not for me, not for the former president either. Maybe president again. So I believe that we are all fighting a war against noise. And there are people who are on the side of the inconsiderate and the people who are on the side of the inconsiderate. This is a battle between evil and good between those who have some desire to protect civilization and those who don't care if it comes apart of the themes. And excessive noise is all over the place these days. People on their speaker phones and restaurants playing their Bluetooth speakers at the beach. I don't want to hear whatever the make believe DJ of the moment thinks we all need to hear at the beach. I just want to hear the waves and the birds and quiet. I don't want to hear their crappy music. Everyone understands that this is the civilized response and those who don't aren't very civilized. And if someone's having a wedding and they ask you, hey, can you maybe just stop with the lawnmower? It's their wedding day. Maybe just wait before you have to take care of the lawn right away. The lawn's not going to catch on fire if you don't cut it right that moment. New York posted a story about how this woman continued with her lawnmower even during a wedding next door. The neighbors are having a wedding in their yard. They couldn't even hear the vows because the lawnmower was so loud and we couldn't get this neighbor to stop with the lawnmower. So it's got to tell you, you know, be considerate. Excess noise, unacceptable. And excess noise when it's not necessary. If you can time it out, you know, no reason, no reason for that. Here's a poster photographed in New Jersey school that says, if your parents aren't accepting of your identity, I'm your mom now. Poster includes a bear and bear cubs colored like the pride flags, I believe. That's what this is all about. There needs to stop being this movement among leftists and some people in the schools to try to have kids become trans without their parents knowing because we all know that this is really weird and they need to stop and that there's a social contagion going on here. But they get very tense when you bring that stuff up. And then the White House press secretary responds to a question about the recession. Here's what she said. You got to see it. The president said last week that there's no inevitability around a recession, but there is a greater deal of market concern about exactly that. And I know that inflation is here number one concern, but can you talk a little bit about if you're doing anything at all to prevent a recession or a rise in unemployment? So the way that we see this, and you've heard us talk about this, that we're in a moment of transition. We have seen we are in a unique situation with our, with the historical gains with our economy. The way that we see it as unemployment rate has held steady at 3.6, which is also near historic lows. Business investment remains strong. Household balance sheets remain strong. There was an analysis that came out recently that showed middle class Americans had an additional $10,000 in savings then before the pandemic. That's good. All right. Not good talking points from the White House. Not a good narrative. That's it for tonight's hold the line. The no spin news of Bill O'Reilly is next. Bill Ty. Each morning, the President of the United States receives a highly classified briefing on the most important issues facing the country. It's called the President's Daily Brief or PDB. It's delivered by America spies and analysts. Well now you can hear your very own PDB in the form of a podcast hosted by me, Brian Dean Wright, a former CIA operations officer. Each morning at 6 a.m. Eastern, I'll bring you 15 to 20 minutes of the most important issues facing the country, giving you the critical intelligence and analysis you need to start your morning."
