    "text": " Hey, this is Dorei and we're going to pass it to people in this episode of TME, DR Amiles and Kaya talking about the news that you don't know from the past week, the underreported news with regard to race, justice and equity. And then I sit down with Pulitzer nominated reporter Chip Jones to talk about his new book, The Organ Thieves, the shocking story of the first heart transplant in the segregated south. Yo, I learned about this initially online, reached out, read the book, talk to Chip, wild wild wild wild. Here we go. Family, welcome to another episode of POD SAVE THE PEOPLE. I am DR Balinger. You can find me on Instagram at DR Balinger. I'm Miles E. Johnson. You can find me on Instagram, Instagram, and Twitter at VeroRapture. I'm Kaya Henderson. You can find me on Twitter at Henderson Kaya. And this is Dorei at the I want to tell you. This is a special, special edition of POD SAVE THE PEOPLE because the miles eat Johnson. It is your born day and we appreciate you, your magic, your love, your joy. And we just want to celebrate you today on what is probably, I don't know, you're like 27th birthday. So if it's your birthday, make some noise. I'm a Kaya Henderson birthday, make some noise. It's like a Baltimore club mix. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Let me represent, let me represent for New York. Shine a light on it. Whoa. Shine a light on it. Whoa. I'm Harlem Shaking. You can't see it. Make room. I'm Harlem Shaking. I'm Harlem Shaking. If you all can't see it, thank you all so much. I'm 32 years old. And very wack, you didn't have to say the goodness. We didn't need that. We didn't even have to say the goodness. We didn't have to say the goodness. We didn't even have to say the goodness. And I'm so grateful to be sharing my birthday with my aunties and my uncle, no matter how forgetful some of them are. You know who that was for. And we're coming off of the Oscars, which were last night. I am, let me just say, I am so tired this morning. One, because the Oscars was six hours long and I watched all of it and it was daylight saving. So then we lost an hour. I don't really know how it works. I just know that I woke up this morning very tired. So big wins last night for everything all at once, which was amazing. Michelle Yoe, first Asian woman to win an Oscar, which is this the more I watched the Oscars, I'm just like, why are we doing this? Why? Like, why are we? Why? But it was interesting. The performances. I like the, I think it, the Indian performance. What was it? I think raw, raw, I probably should get that right before I'm just broadcasting it. But that was amazing. And they won best song, which was fabulous. I don't really have a lot. I mean, what were y'all's highlights? I mean, you know, besides everything all at once, I was kind of just. I will say that the idea that this is the second non-white woman ever to win that Oscar is wild. That is, I mean, that's nuts. And then, you know, what a sweep for A24, the first studio to win all the major awards. And one night, shout out to A24. I didn't watch it because I was on a plane, but I feel like I saw enough of the recap and, you know, shout out to Michael B. Jordan and Jonathan Majors for. That was the highlight. That was the highlight. Shout out to Angela and Rihanna and that D-R-E-S-S baby. I loved it. I really did. You didn't get my house. Oh my gosh. No, I loved it. No, I loved it. No, I was in my head thinking about Angela Bassett. And that head nod was about her getting snubbed. Rihanna looked amazing. She actually sounded like really amazing. And then on top of that, like, yeah, it was just really beautiful. It was super long. Mind you, last night I went to go see Patti LaBelle. It started. Went to go see Patti LaBelle. Got drinks. Came back and it was still on. I was like, this is wildly, wildly, wildly long. But yeah, I see everybody in Internet morning over Angela Bassett not winning. And we got to, maybe it's because I had an absentee father or something. I'm like, we got to get you to the disappointment. We got to bounce back. We got to bounce back. We got to bounce back, y'all. We have to expect it. Can I just pause for one second and tell you a cool moment that just happened. I'm in the Amtrak lounge recording because I have to take a train. And this, a black woman walks by and she looks to me earlier and doesn't say anything, but she just walks by literally right now and she goes, I love y'all podcast. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. When she comes back to her seat, I'm going to try and turn the kids. She doesn't know that I'm just sitting here. She doesn't know that we're recording right now because she can't see you all. But she smiled. She was like, I love the podcast. Oh, so I'm. When she comes back, I'm going to pull her. Oh, I love that. That's amazing. And also, so I don't get canceled by the Indian community. It is not too not to the film. And what no, the song is not too not too. The Blackbusters are our rise, roar, revolt. And it was fabulous. And I, the one thing I will say, and I did say this, I had like a tiny Oscars get together last night, what's fascinating to me. And this is why we need to come together as different communities, marginalized communities, seemingly, is that when Rihanna had her time on stage, it, and it was a Black Panther moment, it was blackity, Black, Black, Black. Then when there was kind of a nod to everything at once, and I know David Burns is probably some of how tied to the song, but maybe he's not. You guys say everything everywhere. And all the ones, what I'm sorry, auntie, sorry, everybody. It was, it was, you know, Asian performers that the, the one of the stars from, what is it, everything? All that, where all that. I'm never going to get it. It's too long. It has a downfall. And I, and I love a 24 and their client and I adore them, but that title's too long for me. I needed to be like two words less. That's a gesture that actually won the Oscar. I think they're doing pretty okay. You seem to be the minority. Most of you seem to be able to handle it. You have to tell them it's never going to make it if you all started that name. I don't know what's going to happen. But it was interesting because the Asian moment had white participation. The Indian moment had white participation. Oh. And I know that the, that was part of the film. It was explained to me while I was making my own commentary in my house that that was part of our, our, our, like that was the moment. It was like, cause it talks about colonialism, all of that. But I think it is interesting though, but I don't know. I don't know if y'all noticed that or if that's just me being. Wait, wait, finish the statement. I know. I was saying there was not white participation when we had the black and black moment. That's what I'm saying. They finished with us. It's over. Last year, huh? Can't come back. They said they said no healthy shorts in, in America's to flimsy for us to be on stage with y'all. So we're going to go ahead and call this one out. I wonder and I, and I was, I don't know. I'm black American. Just so this is, I could be totally 100% wrong on this. I wonder how much that matters to other phrases like it matters to black people. Cause I think that just because of the black American history of it, of our history, and specifically black American, cause even since I'll see participation when it, you know, in like, in, from other African countries, and it just seems to not be a big deal for everything to be black and to, to, to, and for it to be, like, for other things to be shut outside. I wonder if that's a, a thing to, because of specific things we went through. Sometimes it's also a little schizophrenic on somebody's part, right? Because like the appropriation of black culture is rampant, right? And the lack of acknowledgement, I think is what we're talking about here, right? The, the lack of participation, like you take our stuff, you consume our stuff, you enjoy our stuff, you whatever, but you can celebrate with us in the moment when it's our time. And I, listen, I'm with you, Miles, let's get accustomed to the disappointment. I, I don't even expect it anymore, right? But for some people, it's still that white validation is still really important. I thought DR was actually going somewhere different with this, cause one of the critiques I saw on Twitter that was interesting was like, they were like, of course, Jamie Lee Curtis wins, cause you have to center whiteness in a movie about Asian people that like, how could you, how could you get out of a movie that is just about it? I mean, it's like all the main characters are Asian. And somebody was like, she wasn't even the best supporting character in her own film. You didn't mean? Right. But I think that was, that is my point though. Like I think it is fascinating. Like, can you imagine a white person being on stage during Rihanna's performance that was a nod to Chadwick Boseman and about Black Panther? Like we would have lost it, but everything everywhere. We're like getting the best supporting actress award at Wakanda. Yeah. And it's like everything everywhere. I think I'm getting it all at once. That it was a predominately, it was an Asian film with Jamie Lee Curtis. But what was it? The performance was, I just was like, what was it? OK, so I haven't seen everywhere all everywhere, all at once. Everything. So and maybe this is my like, my Negro star, comb syndrome, just being a Black American and loving all types of stuff. And I love the activity of commercials. So I don't hate Jamie Lee Curtis. So I love the activity of commercial. And I don't know. The other thing she's done. Yeah. I think that was just so revolutionary. Let's talk about it. But I'm thinking from my perspective, there were obviously Asian people in every in all that once, right? But was it a. Asian film, I don't know this. So like when I think about like the last Asian film, like, like, that was like really big, like this was like rich, crazy, rich Asians, which was about the culture, was about the heritage. It was kind of it was like fantasy. And it was an Asian film. So I feel like if somebody was like white in that and they won when crazy rich agents, it would be so obviously inappropriate because this is a film about Asian culture, etc, etc. But and what kind is about Black culture and African in an African culture. So that feels different, but it's, but it's all that once really a film that features Asian actors. Does that make, am I making sense? Like, I don't know how much the Asian bug and maybe I'm just making excuses because I don't, I'm tired of being, being upset about race. So I'm just trying to like maybe set that video to you. I'm like, let that activity woman, she's been running from that man her whole life. She's been running from that. How do we? She's been running from that. I'm glad I got a little ghost statue. Y'all, I get it. But was that her first Oscar? Yes. Yes. Fascinating. And she was, and she was, and she's kind of positioned because of the activity commercials and because we don't appreciate horror movies, she was kind of positioned to never really win an Oscar. So I think that that was kind of her, like her end. Like I get the politics of how come she went, why she won. God, God, God, God, God, but hold on. If we like, we can't, we can't even start the who is owed an Oscar story without talking about Auntie Angela, not. Oh, absolutely. Tina Turner, right? For who was love got to do with it? And Apple mex. Yes. Anyway, the Oscars are the Oscars. They're going to be the Oscars, us expecting them to be anything, but the Oscars might be our fault. Yeah. OK, well, shut out. April Rain, your legacy. I guess I guess nothing really happened. I guess we're April Rain. Ed. She got us talking about it in a different way. You know, I do think that what I'd say about Jamie Curtis is that I do think it's an Asian, it's a film about Asian family. Like that is the, that is the star of the movie. And Jamie Lee Curtis is like the antagonist ish. So she has a role to play and she's good at it, but it definitely is like a story. It'd be like miles if there was like a story that centers a Black family and there's like a white person at the welfare. At the welfare. Why is that? Why have you at the welfare? Because you don't have to pack that. I've tried to play on all the tropes is that that that would be what Jamie Lee Curtis's role is. She was like an employee at the. So she was good in the role, but the start, the movie is about the family. Do you know, you know, yeah, that makes that makes total sense to me. I guess I'm just thinking, yeah, that makes that makes total sense to me. I just know there's a lot of films that. Yeah, I just haven't seen the film and I wasn't sure how much that the Asian culture was a part of it. So maybe that was a loop over you. You know, I'm always down to say white supremacy does again. Speaking of which, speaking of which Silicon Valley Bank failed. On Friday and a ton of people's money was imperiled and somehow were another. Everybody's going to get their money back in what was the worst banking failure since the 2008 crisis. I know about this thing firsthand because my little startup's money was in Silicon Valley bank. Y'all know, for real though, for, I mean, all most many entrepreneurs. Especially tech entrepreneurs have their bank accounts and their assets at Silicon Valley bank, something like more than 50% of tech startups and healthcare startups are, we're banking with Silicon Valley bank. So this had huge implications. And today, Monday is a is the draw for payroll for most people who paid their staff on the 15. And so it would have been catastrophic if the government did not step, like literally millions of people would not get paid this week. If the government hadn't stepped in to deal with this issue. But y'all capitalism is a beast. And I don't, I mean, I don't know what to say about this, but I don't, I think there are lots of people who just went through the weekend thinking it was a regular weekend, but there were millions of people this weekend who were literally in crisis. One of my big investors had over $100 million in Silicon Valley bank. And the FDIC only ensures you for $250,000. And so they were looking at all of that money potentially going. Another company that I know just did a raise, a $20 million raise to keep their company going for the next couple of years. And that money would have been gone like it, it is. And these are not like, I mean, these are not your LinkedIn's and your, or your Instagrams or your Metas. Like these are small, many of them are small entrepreneurial, innovative startups and stuff. And so, which your president was just on TV talking about how everybody's going to get their money. And that is capitalism, fixing capitalism, I guess. Yeah. Money is so fake. Like I've read the article back and forth and I technically get it. But also I just don't, because I live in a world where, what do you mean you gave me $20 million and I don't got it no more. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't live in that world. I'm like, that's just not going to happen. And what do you mean that? Yeah. I remember seeing the other thing where there's, I guess, like talk around it being, like how do you say this? Like that there were some kind of like, like drills like other people had insight that this was going to happen. And they were like, what's the drill? Is that we're suspicious that were like, that were, that were happening. So I thought that was an interesting perspective too, that there were some people who are in the, in the now and some people were just like, vulnerable. Yeah. Peter Thiel, who's a big venture capitalist on Wednesday or Thursday, put out things saying that all of his companies should withdraw their money from Silicon Valley, Valley Bank. And so that creator run on a bank where lots of people are like, give me my money, give me my money, give me my money, give me my money right now. And the bank could not support it. And so they are, they are investigating whether or not this was manufactured by this, you know, by this, by Peter Thiel's influence in the industry. It's, yeah. Well, everyone should take a lesson from my best friend, Criches grandma, who was known as grandma sister, who every Friday in Tipton, Georgia will go to the bank and have the people give her all her money so she can count it. And then she give back to them. I know that's right. It's just a big, a read of Franklin and put it in your pocket. I will say the only thing, you know, it's so, it was so interesting on Twitter to see the VCs talk about the government's responsibility and wow, simultaneously being like, how dare you forgive student loans and what is wealth. It's like, this is a social safety net, right? Like this is socialism. If we believe that the market just corrects itself, then we would let you fail and we just sort of deal with it, right? Like you put your money in a bank that, that like made not great decisions with it and, you know, you're screwed. And that's just what, and that's what happens to everyday people all the time. They like make a decision and the system sort of screws them over and they just kind of eat it. But when you have a billion dollars, apparently the cost of society is too big for you to eat it. And it's like, that actually is not the market. Like the fact that the government intervenes is, is not capitalism. This is what socialism looks like. So I, I have some good old ignorant news for you all. And I've been on my, my, my high horse and high art and high cuisine. And this came on my, on my, um, on my timeline. And I was like, well, I guess on the podcast, I have to go to hell and talk about just true ignorance. Just go love Samson. First of all, Fox has a sub sub, sub genre news. YouTube channel thing called Fox new or, excuse me, Fox soul. And has some of the, it's Zeus and Fox soul. I think are, are, are, are trapped for our community. Has some of the worst program I've ever seen happen ever. And I've always seen little tidbits of homophobia or just really outdated ideas come, just come out of those, of, of that programming. But it never kind of like pierces the, the, the, the stratosphere. Like I never see it really take over the timeline. But lo and behold, it happened this week. Samson is on Fox soul and was asked about pronouns. Samson is a black gay comedian who is mostly known inside of the community. Like one of those, if you know, you know, characters, but, um, he was at, he's like the cis gay black man, but he was asked about pronouns because if you fall underneath this umbrella, we all got to know everything. I don't know why they even asked him. And then he tells this story that to me, when my mama nerves here, I'm like, oh, you lying there. That did not happen. But he tells his story about a non binary person who maybe presents as a, who, who seems masculine or sit, or sit assigned or whatever. And basically says excuse me, sir. And then the person, the person comes and says, I'm a man. And Samson, you know, he's the story to say, well, if you're going to be gender, um, non binary or be true or be trans, you need to put some effort into it. And that put it into it. Created such a, um, just, just a firestorm of a conversation around gender identity. Like, what, what does it mean to be the things that you feel and who do you have to perform for? But then also, I guess in my spirit, it brought up. Why are people asking? Like, why are people asking people who have nothing to do with that identity? Their opinion. If not just to create these controversies that are really seeking trans phobia, just so somebody can say something that is trans phobic and so we can all be upset about it. Like that, like that was what's most disappointing about it to me was that somebody breadcrumbs somebody else into. Just put it for any trans phobia for no reason, but no reason. But so maybe it'll go viral or maybe they'll have a better moment. I again, I know it's a comp, a complicated issue for some people, not to me anymore, but. I think it's a really worthy issue inside of black, the black community to talk about gender and transness because I think that trans phobia and transness touches all black people. And I feel like I've probably said this on this podcast, 50 11 million times that because black people weren't necessarily afforded gender when they, when we first, when we first came here in America, that we all have been swimming in a type of transness that I think listening to trans people. listening to trans people talk about gender and identity will help all black people, even if you identify with the, if you're sex in your gender, like, if you if you identify with what you are assigned with that birth. This this conversation really does transcend and expand one's thoughts around identity and it makes me sad that it's so other and so simplified. It's in such a joke when we do talk about it specifically said the inside of the black community, because it's a really, really, really helpful framework to explore. And yeah, I wanted to bring this to the podcast. I wanted to have a little conversation. Use this as a as as an as an open door to have a conversation or just to, you know, throw stones. I'm down for either either option. Here's what I'd say is that one of the things that was most troubling about Samson's comments in addition to what you said was that when challenged on it. Samson just dug his heels like no critical reflection. No sort of deep engagement with people's criticisms initially. It was sort of I said what I said and. Instead of no understanding of his privilege is assessment like it just. I was not shocked by the initial comments because I've heard people say those things before. So I was disappointed but not surprised. I was actually stunned by somebody who lives in public in some ways to like not listen, not take feedback, not change comments. That was that was sad to me. I will say. So first of all, I was like, is this really a show like is this real? This does not seem real to me. What is going on here. And admittedly, I'd never heard of Samson before. And I was looking at him. I'm like, who is this dude? And like, so the whole thing. And I thought his comments were just so ludicrous. I like you, Miles. I was like, this didn't happen. The whole thing just seemed farcical to me. So I didn't even, I didn't even, I will be honest and say I didn't even put credence into like he should have been thoughtful. He should be reflective. He should say something different. It just seemed so unbelievable to me. And I was like, who is this dude? Whatever. Keep moving. I don't care like what he has to say. But I do think that a serious, like, I think we have to have serious. Conversations about the trans community in, in within the black community in ways that we have not. And I'm like, I would love to hear, I guess, like our leaders aren't talking like it's just sort of not really talked about or glossed over or violence, right? Like there are, there is no, there is no constructive. Maybe there's not a wide stream constructive conversations about the trans community in the African American community in our churches, in our community centers in other places where we have conversation. And so I wonder what it's going to take to change that. What, what the hell is wrong with these people? I just, I don't even, I don't have anything that is substantive, substantive to say other than that like. I mean, I can't believe this thing has 416,000 subscribers, this Fox soul thing. And I think what's even more problematic to me is since who was like, since who was like, well, I don't even know about the quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, girl, go somewhere and sit down. What is wrong with you? This just, I mean, I just feel like Black folk, you know, we add, we want compassion and empathy and all these things from so many other people. And then we can't love ourselves enough to give it to one another within our communities. Like, I just don't understand it. Like these, these aren't, these aren't trans and queer, but what it's not like we appeared yesterday. Come on now. Like, it's just wild to me. And I think when you go on, because I went on Samsung's Twitter after you sent this miles and it's like, now he's just getting so much content off of the silliness that he said, right? So it's just, it's also just playing into this whole like, people needing to celebrities themselves as well. So it's just, it's sick. It's awful. And we can do better. Don't go anywhere. More potty. The people's coming. So my news this week, I saw this pop up and I was like, what? Everyone pack your bags. So in Virginia last week, a Virginia judge ruled that frozen human embryos can legally be considered property or channel. And he based this decision off of a 19 century law governing the treatment of enslaved people. What? What? I'm just the preliminary opinion. It was by Fairfax County Circuit Court judge and Fairfax County mind you is right outside of DC. I'm not. This isn't like Lynchburg, Virginia. Like this is in the DMV. So Richard Gardner delivered. He delivered this opinion and says this long running dispute that's been happening between this divorced couple. But essentially the ex wife is suing to suing her ex husband to use the embryos that obviously his sperm are part of the embryos. And this judge Gardner decides that the heart of this case, the facts in these case really should be governed by the principle of goods and channel tying back to this 19 century law. I just don't even know where to start. And so and he he also said, you know, there's no prohibition on the sale of human embryos that may be valued and sold and they must be considered as goods and channel. Just like that makes sense to him. This this case is still sort of ongoing. He hasn't officially ruled. But what he has given is this premise based on this. Wild law that should be outdated and why would any judge use this as precedent for deciding any case. Um, you know, and folks in folks in in Virginia that are part of the bar and a drawer about it, but it I'm at a loss for words on this one. I just don't understand why this judge would think. I mean, maybe he just was maybe the concept of an embryo being outside of someone's body was just so surprising and and seemingly shocking to him that he. I don't know. There's no for me. There's no real clear legal standing or common sense standing for this. It was just wild to me. I mean, you know, reproductive rights are a whole complicated issue. And, you know, I could see both sides in terms of the divorce couple. Right. I want to use the embryos. I don't want you to use my embryos because you not my wife. No more. Whatever. The thing is in 2023, you couldn't find any other legal justification for how you wanted to rule, but slavery. Okay, judge, are you elected? Are you appointed? It's time for somebody to rethink this thing because or, you know, legal people are supposed to be some of our smartest folks. Sometimes supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be. And this to reached way back in order to make his point and like that's just not politically expedient. It's just not, it's just not smart. I don't have much else to say on that. Well, you're wildly inappropriate. What's also interesting to put it to put it in a word is that that judge is still doing his job that he is upholding the exact look. He's actually doing the function of a judge. And I think that the fact that he did it so boldly and blatantly, it's getting us talking, making us, um, outraging us just, you know, as it should. But actually he's upholding the exact system. He's supposed to be upholding. And I think that these type of moments are should fuel us to reexamine all things legal, all things justice system because he's right. That's if that's where you're going to. That's where our legal system and our social justice system is is undergirded by is by slavery by unfair and racist and white supremacist acts. So, so, so maybe everyone thinking about a silver lining using this moment as a way for us to really be able to dig in and take these legal, these legal point of views and take them back to their root and figure out what we can do to either totally transform them or just uproot some of them because they're obsolete. I'm optimistic. It's my birthday. People often say, you know, happened so long ago, slavery's the best. And it's like the foundation of the thing was just built on slavery. So unless you undo the foundation, it will live today. It might not live as loud as it lives. It might not live as totalizing as it lived before. But is it still present? And this is a good reminder that we think about the penal code and the criminal justice system. It's like you actually have to uproot it at the core. It's the war on drugs is not enough, right? Bail is not enough. There's actually like a mindset and a sort of the minutia of the law can live again unless we change it. And like, this is what I saw when I when I read your article. My news is about the Memphis Police Department and a seven year period where they were trying to radically increase the number of police officers and change the complexion of the police force. And over those seven years, they basically lowered their recruitment and training standards in order to meet these numerical quotas. There's a subtitle in the article that's called more recruits, more problems. And that just about solves it up solves sums it up. Basically, Jim Strickland, who was the mayor of Memphis made a commitment to radically increase the number of police on the force, which is what many cities across the country are currently doing. So just because this is happening in Memphis, it is probably also happened or happening in your neck of the woods. But he made a commitment to get to 2300 officers. And over that seven year period, the basically the only way that they could do that was to relax their selection standards, relax their academic standards, relax their disciplinary standards, their fitness standards, their shooting standards. They basically threw out all of the rules that you needed to pass in order to become a police officer. This was all happening after right after Mike Brown and a number of other police brutality and police murder cases where public opinion about police was low. People weren't applying to be police officers. And so they did things like defer the college credit requirements. It used to be that in order to be a policeman, you had to have a certain number of college credits. They're like, yeah, as long as you promise to go to college at some point, you can be a police officer. You used to have to do things like pass the academy tests. And there were lots of young people again coming out with just high school diplomas who could not pass the academic tests that were required at the academy. And so they put them in study sessions, when they basically gave them the test, gave them the answers and then let them take a get take the test again. They stopped interviewing people interviews, two time consuming. They stopped background checking the people. And again, two time consuming. And so you had people who had literally who had brutality accusations in the same county. And because nobody was background checking, you didn't realize that this too was a bad apple, but you brought them into your relax standards police academy and oh my gosh, he ended up being one of the five people who had a bad apple. And then the five people who are charged with murdering Tyree Nichols. I wonder how that happened. Failures that used to lead to dismissals were now ignored. So things like cheating on tests, not passing your shooting test. Sexual harassment of of instructors at the academy, you run into issues with law enforcement while you're in the academy usually that would get you tossed out. None of that got you tossed out. All because they were trying to make this quota that the mayor, the former police chief and oh yes, the current black lady police chief handed down. And so what you hear from a lot of the people who previously have worked at the academy is wait a minute like this is not okay. We are like these are people who were putting on the streets. We don't feel confident about them. And basically they were told if you got a problem with it, you should put your paperwork in and leave this cushy Monday through Friday job and go hump it out on the streets, you know, on the weekends and at night with the dangerous criminals. And so there were lots of folks who they knew they were flagging during the academy that were likely to be problems and they became problems. And so all of this is all of this potentially was foreseeable but in the quest to put bodies in slots. You see this happening, not just in Memphis as I said, but in lots of other places. And so, you know, there's not a lot of data that shows how police training works. But these officers, many of the officers who spoke out about this spoke on a condition of anonymity because many of them are still working at the at the police department. And, you know, they talk about the responsibility of training police officers and how all of that went out the window in this effort to meet their recruitment numbers. And so I thought this was an interesting and important piece of the Tyrey nickel story that we had not yet heard. And as I said, I think it's happening. There are lots of police departments who, because of because of the rising crime and people wanting to be tough on crime, you're seeing a lot of police departments or municipalities allocate more money for more police. And so there's a whole bunch of people sitting out on great policeman island waiting for us to just find them. And we have to invest in high standards around recruitment selection training. I mean, this is the whole teacher thing. Right. That's how I know this human capital problem, but it's a police problem as well. And I thought you all might want to talk about it on the pod today. The You know me, I come straight from the gut with it. I'm like, they just put the standards on the standards on Fox soul in order to make sure we got to keep this thing racist. We got to keep this thing violent. And we got to keep it going. And whatever we have to do, we will continue to do it. And we'll and we'll turn up a line to this and we'll turn our heads to this in order to make sure that it's still violent. It's truly disgusting. And again, I feel like I say this often here too, is it always perplexes me how it probably doesn't perplex me. But it probably still still stuns me. No, nonetheless, it just how cannibalistic it is. It's like, this is not good for anybody. Of course, black people are going to be harmed. And because of these choices, but also this is not good for anybody in that community. These are these low standards. So it's always stuns me how white supremacy will create things and that that that eats its own as long as you're in a bow or two. And that, you know, it's not, oh, let's let us survive and be good. And we're going to eat you all. It's like, oh, no, we'll eat our own as long as we get to, you know, chew on your bones too. Just just a horrible, horrible, horrible set of standards. But thank you for bringing it to the podcast, because, you know, I needed that fire. I'm upset. I'm just thinking about just because I've worked in Dorekheim, sure, you know, a lot more than I do, but I just worked a tad on public schools in Memphis. And I'm also just thinking about if young people graduating or on the verge of not graduating from high school. And I know, I think Latino, Latino kids in Memphis have the lowest graduation rates. If they were given as many times as these people to achieve something, I just wonder what better outcomes we would have. So I'm just thinking like you're getting your hand held to get through these things, to pass these tests, to not pass these tests, we'd be cheat on these tests, etc, etc. And I'm just why couldn't this effort and care and diligence be put towards where it should be put towards. One of the things that I'm heartened by is that when people know this, they think it's wrong across party. We've done a lot of polling campaigns here. And when people realize these details, they are like unacceptable, wild, shouldn't be the case to the problems that they just don't know. So like when we poll when the police, a lot of people across party, people are like, that's bad. Most of the things that you've heard in criminal justice reform or harm reduction, etc. We poll people across party that actually on our side. But people's impression of the police is actually just so holistically positive that we lose when we sort of try and address the institution as a whole. But I'm telling you, if we poll people right now and we're like, do you think there should be no entrance requirements, no interviews, no people across party across age would be like, this is actually unacceptable. And this to me, I read this guy, I was like, wow, what an incredible organizing moment to like force this conversation and to create an entrance for people who otherwise are like the police do all these great things and do that in the same way that like people will be appalled if nurses, all of a sudden, never got interviewed or like never got like you'd be like, that's really unacceptable. Or like even if teachers, you know, there are, there are some states that are really relaxing standards. But the idea that there'd be none. People like, I would never send my kid to a school where like you just hired any old body. A high school graduate, no background check and you didn't interview them. But I mean, that would be horrific for teachers, but we are putting guns in these people's hands. Like we are like this is, I mean, I mean, yeah. Yeah. And if we, if people knew I am positive, all the testing that we've done, I mean, all the polling that we've done with confirm it. Piggybacking off this, my article is about, you know, I think before I became an activist and understood the system. I actually did not know how much the public safety conversation guided everything. I think when I was a teacher, I thought education was the thing because I remember, Kai, and you know this because you were actually, you know, ran a whole school system. I remember the first time that I actually understood that people choose homes based on schools. Like, I know I'd heard it before. But I didn't know it was like a real, the people like legitimately moved to neighborhoods because of schools. And I'm like, oh, man, that means that's like the quality of the people in my building actually helped shape the neighbor. I like didn't. It was something I saw in movies. I didn't know it was like a real thing until I got older. And I was like, you really moved your whole house because of the kindergarten program, which is really for teachers and a good principal. You know what I mean? Like, this is really just good people. And I didn't know how much the public safety conversation shapes almost everything else. That's not education. So this article is about how in in a conversation on public safety, when people are being elected to office who are progressive or. Or don't see the police is the only they might even be progressive, but don't see the police is the best option for public safety. How there's a attack on local control. And we talked about Jackson. We talked about the attempt to the state to like take over Jackson. We talked about that before. But what I didn't know until I saw this, I didn't realize it in St. Louis city. There is an effort or in in Missouri. There's an effort to take back the police department from local control in St. Louis city and have it run by the state. Mind you, the police in St. Louis city have been independent for almost a decade. Definitely were for the protests and I lived through that. And it was a, you know, not great mayor then and certainly super racist police department that were out to get us. And now that Tashara is the mayor, black woman, progressive, you know, some people don't like everything she's done, but she is by far the most progressive mayor they've had in a long time. And you see now these renewed calls to take it back. To like take local control away from the police department. And I think that this will be the thing that like again, if I didn't have to prep it for the podcast, I wouldn't know at all. But this is what I don't think is is leading in the public conversation and I wanted to bring it here. I have some particular feelings about this because in the place where I live, Washington, D.C. Our local government tried to revise our criminal code, which was over 100 years old and was outdated. And, and the city council passed it. The mayor wasn't super excited about it, but whatever, like this is the way democracy works. And because what people don't understand is that D.C. is still a colony. Our we don't get to make our own rules without congressional approval. And so the crime hawks in Congress didn't like the revision of our code. First of all, they didn't understand the revision of our code. And they just thought it was going soft on crime when in fact, if you understand the nuances, it was not going soft on crime. And so the led by the congressional Republicans, they set out to disapprove the criminal code changes. And our president who has stood up for home rule for D.C., etc., etc., who talks about democracy and all that, jazz, when he had the opportunity, decided that it was more important to protect his right flank by siding with these congressional Republicans. Oh, and a bunch of Democrats as well to say, we don't like D.C.'s criminal code because we're tougher on crime. And so they vetoed it. They overrode local democracy. And, you know, Republicans are super hypocritical because all they want to talk about is states rights and local rights and all that jazz. And we made some decisions ourselves about how we want to be covered here in Washington, where we pay y'all that got me started and pay more taxes per capita than any other state in the union. And these folks who have nothing to do with our community get to decide what how, how we will and won't govern ourselves. It is absolutely reprehensible. Most United States citizens have no idea that any time the federal government shuts down, the D.C. government technically has to shut down as well. And we shut down all kinds of things because of the way we're tethered to the federal government. And in this case, because the country is, because the Democrats want to show that they are tough on crime, they completely road rough shot over our democratic rights to govern ourselves. It is absolutely ridiculous. Okay, I'm done now. I mean, all I can do is applaud that. What kind of ramp I got. I wouldn't even salt what you just said with with a follow up. It was this has been like an educational moment for me of course I'm outraged, but I think I think I have really just, you know, guns are blazing. I mean, you said it. We saw it in Jackson with them creating a special zone for the white people with a whole different police force and all the dishes. Beat why because of crime like this whole crime allowing us to throw out all of the rules and regulations is absolutely reprehensible. And it's just politicization right like it's it's wild to me when I was at the State Department, one of my jobs was basically a law advisor. I mean, I had no business doing this but I go to other countries and help them reform old and outdated criminal procedure codes, evidence codes. And so it's wild that that can happen far far far far away. But the upgrades that we need here in the place I was raised. No, still going off of 100 year old rules. So I think to give you all more added perspective to to set you off. Hey, you're listening to Potsie the people. Don't go anywhere. There's more to come. This week, we welcome author and award winning reporter, Chip Jones to talk about his new book, The Oregon B use the shocking story of the first heart transplant in the segregated South. After a healthy black factory worker had a skull fraction in the 1960s, his family was shocked to find that his heart was transplanted into the body of a white man without his knowledge or consent. Y'all, I learned so much. It was wild. You got to read it to believe it. Listen to the interview to believe it. What a world. Here we go. Chip Jones, thanks so much for being with us today on Potsie the people. Thank you, Dorei. It really is an honor and a pleasure. So what's wild is I had seen a story about Bruce Tucker in the first heart transplant on Twitter, actually. And I read an article and I was like, okay, this feels wild. And then it was like, oh, this is a story included in your book. And I sent a text to our producer and I was like, can you find him? Like, is he doing interviews? Like, is he around? Is he doing interviews? He's talking. And then, and you are doing interviews and you're here. So honored to be here. I will tell you, I read the book and I was like, oh, this might be just like a longer accounting of the article. And then I'm like, oh, my goodness. There's so much stuff in here that I like literally never knew, never thought about. So let's start at the beginning though. How did you. How did you get to this story about the first successful heart transplant? Did you always care about hearts? Was it? Did you care about medical school? I don't know. Like, well, how did you get here? Well, there I basically, I'm a former investigative reporter. I spent a lot of time like researching the tobacco industry in the 90s. And I'm down here in the kind of heart of darkness in Richmond, Virginia with tobacco. And I've written a few other books about the Marines because I came from a Marine family. And I was, I was working a second career at a medical academy here in Richmond and learning a lot about medicine. And one day, actually, the story of my book started as a public relations problem. Because I just being real about it. But I figured out the best way to boil this down when I talk to audiences, like, well, how did you hear about this? Well, like a lot of things in life, it's sort of, you know, from the side door or whatever. I was a colleague of mine at this academy that represents a lot of different kinds of doctors in the region down here in Richmond, Virginia. I said, you know, the older doctors, and basically, frankly, it was all older white doctors, were like, they really wanted their clamoring to have an event for this to honor the 50 year anniversary of this heart transplant. And I'm like, okay, I didn't know anything about it. But this guy said to me, but there's a problem. I said, what's the problem? And he kind of told me the back story is like, well, the heart came from an African American factory worker in Richmond, Virginia. And it actually led to a lawsuit four years later. And I got, oh, really? Yeah. And oh, yeah, I guess who represented the family? And he said, I said, who? He said, Doug Wilder. Well, Governor Doug Wilder, you know, first black governor of Virginia history. And I kind of, as a reported Richmond, I've been around his administration stuff. So I'm like, well, it's kind of interesting. And so I'm going, well, what's the public relations problem for our society? He says, well, you know, these older doctors, they want to venerate this event. But if it's an open event and a reporter asks about what happened, it's got to be some hard questions. So since I worked at this medical society, I kind of made it my hobby just to go dig into it. And then very quickly, I heard another thing, Dorei, about the story that blew my mind, which I was a teenager when this happened. I lived around DC then. And there's a guy named Christian Bernard, who was very famous back in the day, 67, 68. And he was the South African heart surgeon. And he was part of this whole story because he had taken the technology, the medical technology from Richmond, and actually going back to, you know, South Africa, apartheid South Africa, and applied the Richmond surgeon's techniques to sort of win this huge race. Because it was kind of like, you know, I started thinking about it kind of as a book. It was kind of like a race to the moon, but it was a heart transplant race. So that's how it started. I mean, I just, first of all, you know, my, my colleague had to keep away the older doctors who wanted to like hold this event. Like, this is the greatest thing since the Civil War, you know, like, no, we're not going to do that because there's a whole range of kinds of physicians in the society and some of them are liberal, some of them are conservative. But the one thing, you know, the society itself shouldn't do would be like, just put out some propaganda for these guys. So they put that to the side. I made it my own project. Like on Friday's afternoons, I go down to the medical college of Virginia. I call Virginia Commonwealth University of ECU and started looking through the archives kind of, I basically got it. I say kind of a master's level degree in medical education over a whole year. And that's how it all started until I finally interviewed Mr. Wilder, Governor Wilder. He kind of didn't want to talk about it. And I finally had an interview with him. And that's in 2017. And that's, that's kind of where it took off for me developing in his book. How did you finally get him to say yes? You know, I basically, you know, this whole, this whole story is me, the lowly reporter, basically, with that. I'm not trying to put myself on a pedestal, but just sort of saying, look, I'm just trying to keep it real. Governor Wilder. And I wrote him a letter through a third party in a media, a very, very nice guy at a law school who passed in a long. And I said, basically, as I recall it, and I'm just trying to remember a few years ago, but it was like, Governor Wilder, this man's story has never really been properly told. And that's all I want to do. And so from the very beginning, my initial goal was was just to tell the story of this forgotten man named Bruce Tucker. It was basically forgotten history. Got it. So can you give, I've had the luxury of reading the book, and there's so much more in the book outside of just this one story. But can you, can you tell us, can you tell us about Bruce Tucker? Yes, well, he was a guy who grew up in rural Virginia outside of Petersburg, which is for listeners, never been to Virginia. It's about 30 minutes south of the state capital of Richmond grew up, you know, hard, I think farming life segregated schools in the 50s. And he followed his brother to Richmond. His brother had polio, actually, William. And he was a very successful small businessman, William Tucker, started a shoe repair business. And so Bruce Tucker followed him up into Richmond in the mid 50s and got a job at a factory. It was actually an egg processing plant of old things. You learn a lot about history when you just start digging. It's like, you know, who knew shoe repair shops, egg processing. A lot of this stuff is kind of nerdy, but as a researcher, you get really getting into the nerdy stuff too. But I learned that he was, you know, a guy who lived by himself. He was divorced. But he had a son living back on the farm, his name is Abraham, and he was sending child support payments back home to his son and his grandmother. And then one day after work on May 24, 1968, he was sitting around with some guys, having a drink. I don't know exactly. I think it was just passed a wine bottle around or something. And he fell off a very low wall and he hit his head and had a very serious head injury. His skull was basically fractured. But he was rushed to a nearby hospital, which was Medical College of Virginia. It's a big teaching hospital in Richmond. And so he's rushed in. And just to jump ahead on the story, you know, people can read the rest. But what really first of all shocked me and then ultimately just sad me was that less than 24 hours. His heart was gone. And the official idea and official autopsy report that I found said, you know, he died of a head injury. Well, no, he died when the heart surgeons pulled the plug on the on the respirator and let him die. So the story begins, the book begins, if you've read it, it begins with a frantic phone call from his brother, William, who's saying, Mr. Wilder, then Doug Wilder was a very, you know, young, maybe about your age now, the late thirties. I think of anyone that reported really, really young, by the way. My son's about your age, I think. And so he, like, said, I need help. And Wilder was at first kind of like you, kind of like anybody. Here's the story. No way. How did this, what happened? They stole his heart. And, or they took his heart. We can talk about words and their meanings if you want to death, because this was part of my whole evolution as a writer and kind of absorbing the story. Like, well, what was it? Was that a theft? Was it an accident? Or was it something else? Was it a murder? And, you know, so Wilder took the case and it took four years till it went to trial. It was the first, it was the first civil lawsuit over heart transplants in the United States. No one had ever challenged an institution. And it actually slowed down transplants around the country at the time, because a lot of the, like, big hospitals, I'm sure, like Johns Hopkins and Baltimore or Columbia or out in LA, they slowed down everything because the whole country, at least the medical transplant community, was looking to see how this jury would rule. And if you read the book, you see how the ruling went and it did not go well for the Tucker family. And the amazing thing, Dorese, is right now, there's still a backstory to it. It's still unfolding. And I don't know how it's going to resolve, but the university has apologized. I saw you did a recent podcast about apologies and I started thinking about apologies and nature of apologies. They apologized recently. And they said they were going to do some things, but that still, you know, remains to be seen. So that's, that's kind of it in a nutshell in terms of the issues, but I can, I can stop and let you ask me what's on your mind. One of the things that I didn't know at all was, you know, in the early chapters, when you talk about just the history of ceiling bodies, I didn't know any of that. I was like, you know, I'm like reading and I'm like, Oh, this is going to be a deep dive on Bruce Tucker. And then I'm like, Oh, my goodness, there's still bodies from black cemeteries and medical residents are being asked to go and dig up bodies. People are, you know, standing outside of the doctors place ready to kill them. You know, how did you find that out like this? The idea that Bruce Tucker and there was another thing that I was like, Oh my God, was that they stole the black person's kidneys in South Africa. It was South Africa. Right. Yeah, well, they took they took Tucker's kidneys to when they took his heart. So they took his, they didn't just take his heart just for good measure. They took his kidneys to. And when I was with with no prior consent, at this important thing, there's nobody in his family knew about it. The idea though that he wasn't even the first person that they stole from that like because the South African story happened first, right? Yeah. Yeah. And there were there were other things happening. You know, your your response, and I'm glad to hear that because that was my that was my response when I first started reading the archives of the hospital. Basically, I could not believe that essentially what I learned was that medical research medical schools in America were all founded on on grave robbing. It done Harvard in the late 1700s, Columbia, can up whatever and whatever they were doing. This was the having to have bodies for the anatomy class was the. Only thing that they did outside of book learning. So they had incorporated this from Europe. This happened in England and France. My response was the same as yours. Total horror and shock. And the thing about it, to Ray, that blew my mind was it enriched. It stopped in Harvard and Columbia and other places before the Civil War. But like so many things in the South, it kept going during the Jim Crow era. And into the 20th century, and my old man was born in 1916 and the guy who was the keeper of the the grave robbing, Chris Baker, he lived in the medical school building and he was he was known as a body man. And they had other people like this at different universities. They were like it was a for you know, it was part of Jim Crow medical schools. You had this guy who was paid as a janitor, but he was really like a professor because he knew as much. He knew as much about surgery as a lot of the medical professors did. And and and Chris Baker was sort of venerating glorified up until around World War II. And this was the thing like for me like, Hey, I would call Chris in the book, right? Oh, Chris. Yeah. Oh, Chris. Yeah. He was and he was, you know, sort of like this figure of, you know, that kind of Jim Crow, old South kind of stuff where like, Oh, he was a great guy and he taught us so much, you know, kind of gone with the wind or something but digging up digging up bodies. But the fact is that in the US, the this is this is why this is why I set it up in the book. I was trying to show what what could have led to someone stealing a man's heart, especially a black man's heart. What could have led to this? And then more got into it. I felt the reader needed to understand. This is the fundamentals of American medical education. And I bring you up today at the end when they found a whole set of bodies skeletons in 1994. And those skeletons are still in the very foundation of VCU medical school because the university didn't want to stop a construction project. And they covered it up. That's, and that's the last chapter of my book. It's called Down in the Wild. And they're still dealing with it. So, I'm like, what, what are you even else to say? One of the other stories that like was small, but, but that black people had actually tried to sue or like tried to pass a law or something to stop the grave robbery and were unsuccessful in it. But it was like, it was cool to see people were trying to fight back and like, the anatomy rights. Yeah, there were anatomy rights in New York City in Philadelphia Boston. And I thought that was good too. And there was a big pushback. And in Richmond, there was a crusading editor named John Mitchell, who somebody should make a movie about too. And he was a tough son of a gun who put out the the Richmond. Well, his magazine was in Richmond. I think it was called the Mercury by my have that wrong. But his he was a tough, some gun who who actually strapped on six guns and went down to Dandell, Virginia to write stories about lynching. So John Mitchell in his in his newspaper called this out as late as the 1890s because black people in Richmond were tired of it, even during Jim Crow. And we're willing to speak up. And they would take prisoners from the Virginia State pen about a mile away and take them over and take out their organs. So, yeah, there were, but all around the country, there was a whole set of, they call them anatomy rights dating back into like, I think like the 1840s or, you know, long ago because either free blacks and sometimes poor or whites would see that their graveyards were being plundered. And one thing I learned, you know, as a white person who grew up in privilege and grew up around churches that had graveyards is that's why there's a whole there was a whole system of a burying bodies closer to the doors of the church and a protecting the graveyards because the working class. Yeah, so yeah, the working class people and often the people of color couldn't afford the protection. And once some some people in New York or Philly, sometimes it was kids were looking through the looking through the windows of the medical school, they go back. You know what they're doing in there and that it led to riots and different states, you know, New York passed some laws and it took along. It had passed along Richmond and in Virginia, but it was never enforced. You know, typical Jim Crow stuff that they just turned the other way until until the practice stopped. I guess, you know, just sort of fizzled out because other people had died. They had different, they did pass a law to regulate it. And it finally did settle down. But the fact it took the 20th century. I think it, I think it's the attitudes, you know, continued into into the into the modern times about people of color and I, you know, I called, you know, the issue. They called it social death or being socially debt. If you had liquor on your breath as a black man, especially or a black woman into a big urban hospital, whether it's Chicago and New York, Philly, Richmond. You were treated, you know, you were the invisible man. And can you. There was one part of the book that I, there was a question I didn't know the answer to. As you talk about the penny death insurance. Can you explain that to me? I like didn't understand it. Well, the reason I brought that in was because the idea of having a proper burial was it was in the 1880s 1890s because of people were afraid, especially working class people or poor people were afraid of having their bodies snatched. The business basic insurance industry started to prosper because people would would pay a little bit. I guess you call it penny insurance, but they would pay a little bit so that they could protect their loved one and actually have a proper burial. And I just never knew. Some of the things in America are so weird and intermeshed, but the whole insurance industry, you know, the whole medical industry, medical research, people's, drawing on people's fears, because they were justifiable fears too. And suspicions that go on today, you know, they're going on through COVID. I've done so many interviews around the country where people often black readers or commentators will say, you know, I'm seeing people. Not really feeling the love about getting the COVID shot. And it dates back to this kind of suspicion. And the only good thing I can. I mean, one of the good things I could say, but the use of the book, it's part of an educational effort at Virginia Commonwealth in history and medicine. They've used it. And on the universities like political had a good story recently where they started with my book and they were, but it was out of Johns Hopkins and they talked about the. A real reframing of the discussion at medical schools about historical trauma and talking about in real ways and trying to understand all of the emotional and psychological baggage that not only black patients, but black physicians. Might have to deal with. So my initial, you know, effort has always been to tell the Bruce Tucker story. And if there's anything redemptive about it, it is that hopefully it will help. Light, you know, enlighten a lot of people and lead to, you know, more equal treatment. It'll never be perfect treatment of people. I don't think just because human nature isn't perfect, but you know, trying to do better. And also reminds me, you know, we talk about this idea that everything's about race and people are like, you're being dramatic. And you're like, nope, it actually. No, if anything, we're be we're we understated. And yeah, and people don't want to talk about it in Virginia now. The governor doesn't want it. He doesn't want these kinds of things in the classroom. And yeah. Yeah. Now, what I'm how has it been since the book came out? Are they are, you know, I can only imagine like me, people are shocked. Have there any interesting responses to it? You know, yes, there have been a lot of interesting responses. And, you know, I'll just go right to the ones that have been more heartening to me is when I've had readers who are black of all ages. And people who got people who are friends like a friend of mine, I can think of from the YMCA who told me that he grew up in rural Virginia around where the loving case took place in Caroline County. And he said, I always wondered, Chip, why my parents would never go down to MCV. And I learned that from your book. And and also other readers, I think, you know, who who said that it helped them to just better understand either their own fears or other people's fears of health care. And in general, I think, you know, the interesting thing to me is if I speak to groups where I speak to them, if I speak to them in the city, one set or a city, I think that's when I speak about the public resources. And then if I speak to more white, conservative readers, frankly, outside of town, it's a whole different thing. And it's like, you know, well, why are you telling the story? You know, like I'm overdramatizing it. And I'm saying, no. No, as a matter of, you know, that's been the educational process for me. If any as a reporter, you always sort of sort of try to keep it kind of even and on even keel, but, you know, I mean, I guess the learning from other people, you know, and learning what I did to become people who got people who had anyone that would have people, and you know, I would have to get people into it. didn't know continues. And the thing, I always say that when I started out, it was like I had this story in my head about the heart transplant raising everything. But it really went from my head to my heart because it really is all about a real wrong and the need to feel empathy. And so the other thing I was writing it here in town, the Black Lives Matter's protests were happening, the monuments were coming down. So I felt like writing a novel about the civil war and the civil war because it was like, I knew it was important, I guess is what I'm saying. And I hope that I could do an adequate job of it. And what happened to William Tucker? So William Tucker, he lived for a number of years. I don't really know when he passed away. But he was governing a while there told me he was just really bitter that the jury's judgment against the family kind of reinforces his sense of racial prejudice. But his son Abraham is still alive. And he's in his mid-60s. And you'll see in the book that he didn't want to talk to, which I didn't blame him. And I was basically trying not to retraumatize him. But since then, he told me he actually had a phone call with me not that long ago. Where it helped him on some level to come to terms with what happened in the past. But back to this idea of an apology, the University issued an apology. But I'm hearing from some of those relatives that they're not so sure about that. So the book is still open. And can you contextualize why the Bruce Tucker case matters in the world of medicine? Well, it matters, first of all, because if you go back to Hippocrates to do no wrong, that's all that was done to him. I mean, his life was forgotten and thrown away. But I think in the world of medicine right now, it matters because there needs to be awareness and sensitivity to people's real experiences and their shared pain of not receiving equal and first-class care. So it matters. And I've been told by physicians who are younger now that they're glad that this is one of the many stories. And there's many, many other stories about it from Henri de Lax and Tuskegee, Syphilis Experience. So it fits on that continuum of stories that shouldn't be forgotten. And I always say also the importance of ethics and morality because you could be in any situation and you could be put in a position where, well, you're going to win something. You're going to win a heart transplant race. But at what price? And I think everything has happened in the US in the past few years, and especially the lack of compassion to society. It's important. It's important that the health care system kind of try to stay or get on the right side of history. And this was the first heart transplant in the South? Yeah. What we say in the segregated set below the Mason Dixon line, it was the ninth in the US and it was the 16th in the world. But it was part of a whole sort of train of transplants that happened in 1968. Got it. OK, there are two questions to ask everybody. The first is, what do you say to people whose hope is challenged in moments like this? People who have read your book, read mine, listen to podcasts, voted, testified, and stood in the street. And they're like, the world's not getting better in the way I wanted to. What do you say to people whose hope is challenged? Wow. Well, I think the first thing I would say is to always go to the light, go to the people that are with you and trying to build you up and hope. And I feel that way about this book, because I didn't do it by myself. I did it because of a lot of different folks around town and around the US who helped me out. So I think hope is something that is not individualistic. I think, for me personally, it's kind of a group experience. I think that it's easy to get disillusioned. And so I think all of us have to find what really is our moral core. Or if we have a higher power or believe in God, what's that? But what's that to me in terms of hoping for everybody, not just hoping you win the lottery. And then the second is, what's the piece of advice that you've gotten over the years that stuck with you? Piece of advice. I would say to trust my intuition. And that came from my old man who was in three wars. And unfortunately, he saw a lot of his friends die at places like Tarawa and Saipan, the World War II, and the Pacific. And he had a lot of interesting experiences on the front lines. So I always, even though I didn't go in the military myself, my dad's belief in intuition and dreams. Because I think dreams are a way that ties you into what you're really about and what you should be doing if you listen closely enough. Boom. Well, everybody, you've got to read this book. You'll learn in time. Thank you so much for coming. We continue your front of the pie. How did people stay in touch with you? Is it Twitter? Is it Facebook? Is it a website?
