    "text": " All right, it is Thursday and here is the question that I have for you guys today. Are women in today's society, particularly in American society, but really just in the entire Western civilization? Are they worthy? I want you to think about this question not to be offended by the question, but are we producing a quality woman here in the Western hemisphere? I want men in the comments to answer that in your day experiences. Are you coming across women that you feel are worthy of honor, are worthy of respect? I want you to just take account, not just yourself, because of course you're going to instantly feel defensive and say, yes, I'm worthy. What are the people that are around you? Your friends take inventory of people that are close to you and how they are behaving whether it's on social media or it's in real life. Do you think that women are worthy of honor and worthy of respect? I want to talk about that topic and I also want to bring up something recently that Chloe Kardashian said, very honest, very from the heart and I just want to applaud her for opening up a very real discussion with other women. Plus, we're going to discuss a porn star named Riley Reed who has said that porn has ruined her life, which is of course not a shocker at all to anybody except for people that believe that it's shocking, that water is wet. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. Let's start from my quotation from Archbishop Fulton Sheen. It's apparently I like quoting bishops that are Catholic on this show. I've been realizing that I do it quite a lot, but I do share a lot of his content. He once said this, when a man loves a woman, he has to become worthy of her, the higher her virtue, the more noble her character, the more devoted she is to truth, justice, and goodness, the more a man has to aspire to be worthy of her. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women. Wow, very impactful that last sentence, so I'm going to say it again. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women. If that's how history could be written or decided upon, let's just examine the present. If we were to examine the present situation in Western civilization in terms of a level of its women, what predicament would we see ourselves in? I think about this often for us because I am a woman, but also because I believe that so much of radicalized feminism is what has contributed to every ill and hour society, which is why I am constantly speaking out against it. It's why I'm constantly telling people and women not to aspire to be a feminist, because being a feminist is of course not about equality, but the destruction of the family units, the destruction of what is now being labeled hetero-normativity, the destruction of the things that I think make our society bright and greater, raising up children in nuclear family units. I was thinking about this topic in terms of women today and the attachment that we have to sex, the attachment that we have to taking our clothes off, we covered yesterday, the daughter of Kelly Ann Conway, her name Claudia Conway just turned 18 after trying various antics for attention. Now she's taking off her clothes and she has signed down with Playboy, of course, because she believes that she can make a lot of money, and she probably can, by the way, the truth is she will make a lot of money selling her cleavage and men that are perverts that are waiting for her to turn 18, have have been waiting for her to turn 18 so that they can see it. What does this say about our society, if we are judging it by this sort of a woman who goes on to only fans and tries to demand to us, that this is about taking ownership over their own body, we're constantly being sold sex, the more a woman is willing to really degrade herself, it seems the more rewards she receives. It's unbelievable when you think about the people that are given the most attention, giving people that did make it on the basis of their talent are now realizing that in order to stay relevant, they have to become sexier and sexier. I talked about this, by the way, even in regards to Beyonce, who used to make really nice poppy, almost destiny child music and has increasingly grown more sexy. She suddenly has to take her clothes off, she's really talking about raunchy sex in a lot of her songs and she goes, oh, I'm married to my husband, I'm talking about my husband, doesn't matter. Why are we having to hear this sort of perversity? It feels especially degrading when it's coming out of the mouths of women, right? When our society is saying, this is the woman, what does the man become? I think we're seeing evidence of that all around, we're seeing and you hear women talk about how men don't respect us and I always offer back, have we become something that is worth respecting, are you somebody that is worth honoring and respecting? I believe that the Yin is responding to the Yang. I also talk about how a huge piece of this is the detachment that women feel from children nowadays. We no longer feel that it is our place to look over children. You're seeing this culturally. There's something very transactional about having children. When you hear people talk about why they're a pro-choice, it doesn't come from a place of respectability, it's no longer an academic debate. It really is about women saying, my body, my choice, and if I have to kill a kid to live my life and so be it, and there's something really demonic about that. It seems to have been a demonic possession that is taking place in our society. This brings me to something that Chloe Kardashian said, which I am going to rank as the bravest thing that she has ever said. Now I do not consume the Kardashian content. I just do not find it to be interesting, even though I watch it in my youth. I cannot co-sign to a woman who has earned her fame being Kim Kardashian for quite literally selling her body and plotting with her mother to release a sex tape. I just cannot get behind it anymore. But Chloe, on a recent episode, it just made headlines revealed in a discussion to her sister as well as Scott Dysick that she doesn't feel as connected to her newborn son who she just had via surrogacy. Listen to her stunning confession. Take a listen. Don't stop. Don't stop. I felt really guilty that this woman just had my baby and you're just, I take the baby and then I go to another room and you're sort of separated. I felt it's such a transactional experience because it's not about him. I wish someone was honest about surrogacy. That is huge. That is really huge. It is something that people do not like to discuss, especially in Hollywood when it really, it really has become all about transaction. Can you afford to not get pregnant? Prionka Chaperchan? She says that she's busy with her career. Her and Nick Jonas travel a lot. They just agreed to find some poor girl who will hold their child. That's the truth. The women that are signing up to be surrogates, it is so disgusting. I think about why. It's because they need the money. Women that are selling their extra doing this because they need the money. Of course, there is a rich person that says, I have the money and I'm willing to allow you to use your body. It is almost the worst form of prostitution on the planet. Way worse than the transaction of a woman selling her body for one night of sex to get money. You are selling your body for 10 months and you are going through a spiritual process of feeling a baby grow inside of you. That is something that is inexplicable. It is inexplicable. The connection that you feel to a child that is in your womb. I have spoken often about how I was so connected to my body that I was instantly able to guess both of the sexes accurately. I told my husband, first time, this is a boy. I told him his personality. I said he's strong minded. He's stubborn. I could feel it in my stomach because of the way that he was kicking me. What kind of a boy this was going to be. I was exactly right. Then I knew that I had a very delicate girl who was a bit more shy and instantly knew that it was a girl. My husband now is amazed by it. He's amazed by how connected I was to my body both times when he thought that I was being crazy. But of course, it's not crazy because you're connected. It's growing inside of you. Of course, you know what your own body feels like and what's happening inside of your body is going to have an impact on you and your emotions. I smile and thinking about it because it's that spiritual and it's that wonderful. When you consider surrogacy, especially surrogacy for the sake of surrogacy, there is something demonic about it. When you are doing it, not because you can't have a child, right? Even worse, right? Khloe Kardashian is able to have a child. She has a daughter true who she grew inside of her own body. Simply because she wanted for her daughter true to have a 100% biological sibling, but she was not willing to have sex with this serial cheater, Tristan Thompson. That's what happened. She didn't want to have sex with them again to produce second child. She decided to borrow and purchase some other woman's body. It's a horrible way of saying it. I again want to assign her all the credit in the world for speaking out on it, but she is correct in her assessments that there is something wrong with this, right? That because she is rich, she purchased another woman's body for 10 months. That woman went through the hormones. The woman went through probably so much more than just what comes with that, right? That woman went through the cravings. That woman went through feeling that child kick inside of her for probably more than 20 weeks. You probably experienced first kicks around 16 weeks, maybe 20 weeks of it's your first pregnancy, only to give birth to go through this incredible God moment, right? And then Khloe comes into the hospital and just takes this baby away into the other room. How are we okay with that, I guess, is my question. We would not allow this to take place or it happening to an animal. Literally right now, if you go to an agency and you say, I want to purchase this cat, right? They will tell you that they will not give you the cat for three months because they want that kitten to be around its mother. They would never allow for a dog to give birth and then snatch the dog instantly, the puppy instantly away from its mother. They would never allow a kitten to give birth and then snatch it away instantly and sell it because they would say there's something wrong about that, right? They would say we cannot treat animals this way. Of course, the kitten at first needs to find its mother's nipple and it needs to feed. For some reason when it comes to humans, we just say, it's fine. It's this process is totally fine. I imagine that woman having just given birth in the same way that Khloe is thinking about her and feeling guilty about it because Khloe's given birth, she knows what happens. She knows that then that woman's body is telling her suddenly to release it knows that she's given birth and the miracle of birth and signals for your body to release milk so that you can feed the baby. So what's happening to this woman is she is going to feel her breasts in gorge and she is going to experience that urge to be able to feed an infant that she wasn't even allowed to really hold. How are we allowing this to take place? How are people comfortable with this? Of course, I know that there are always exceptions to this and sometimes there are circumstances where there is a couple that has been trying to have children for 10 years, something is wrong with the woman's body and she agrees with her sister to give birth and her sister, of course, is both the aunt and the person that gave birth to the child and it's forever in her life. And of course, in the comments, one of you guys is going to give me one of these exceptions but I don't pay attention to exceptions. I pay attention to rules. And there is something deeply demonic about surrogacy and it is no comfort to me that Kim in this same segment and Chloe says she envies Kim because Kim felt fine about the process. Yeah, well, this is your sister Kim who sold her body, plotted to sell her own body transactionally for fame. It doesn't surprise me that she doesn't feel any remorse or any guilt about snatching a child from someone who she basically used because she just wanted to have children. Again, not out of need. Kim Kardashian already had two healthy children when she decided she simply wanted more, okay? And she therefore purchased surrogacy because her body didn't like pregnancy. What's happening to women in this society? If this is how we are going to rate our society according to women that feel nothing when they snatch a baby out of another's arm after they've given birth. And that feel nothing when they're transacting sex, whether it be on only fans, whether it be via a sex tape with an ex-boyfriend or whether it be via Playboy. What does that say about where our society is headed? I think that's where I'm going to have to end this just with the question, are we worthy women? And I think honestly examining everything that I talk about, no, we're not. That's all I have to say about that. We're going to take a moment to speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves. And that is Babies in Their Mother's Room. Preborn's network of clinics is doing the work as they save babies and love mothers. Because of your generosity, Preborn's network of clinics has rescued over 200,000 babies by introducing mothers to their babies through ultrasounds. Preborn receives no government funding so they are entirely dependent on us. Together we are building an army of life to stand against the principalities of darkness. If everyone listening today sponsored just one ultrasound for $28, we could change the world. To donate, dial pound 250 and say the keyword, baby. All gifts are tax deductible. You can use your write-offs. You will never regret saving a defenseless babies life. That's pound 250 baby. Or visit preborn.com slash Candace. Okay, now it's time for some topics to shore. Okay, so if you're a person that follows and or envies people like Amber Rose, Iggy Azalea, Amber Rajakowski, currently a lot of what they're pitching is that there is empowerment in selling your body. Like for the first time, you get to decide how your body is being displayed on the internet. You get to decide what you're willing to give for what price. This is their argument and the conversations that they host regarding only fans. That actually you should be proud of this. And what I always implore people, a lot of the young women that are perhaps being influenced by these people to take a look at is their personal lives. Examen the personal lives of Amber Rose, Iggy Azalea, and Rajakowski. And do not wrongly conflate happiness with money because that's what they're doing. It's yes, you can make money off of your body and you can dictate how you make that money off of your own body if you go on to only fans. But of course, there was going to be a knock on effect in your personal life. And that is where you really lose. And actually, because as you age, there's going to be less interest in your body. So at that point, what you have actually built in your personal life, right? The things that are actually going to matter are whether or not you are in a happy relationship. And it's difficult to get into a happy relationship when the men that are pursuing you do not respect you. This is why Emily Rajakowski, despite being so hot, got cheated on. This is why Amber Rose is not with her baby daddy. Well, there is a porn star, a very successful porn star named, she goes by her show name is Riley Reid. I think her actual real name is Riley, something else, Riley Matthews. But she is making the rounds right now for an old video that just happens to have resurfaced in which she admits that her life has been ruined by porn. Shocker. Take a listen. Lost my whole family. And it sucks. So a lot of times when people ask me if they should do porn, I tell them no. I tell them that it makes life really hard. It makes dating really hard. It makes your family life really hard. It makes intimacy hard. If you're putting yourself out there and the world is now judging you, you have to be okay with being shamed every day of your life. I don't even want to have children because I do porn because I'm worried of the way that people will treat my child. With me personally, my mom was supportive in the beginning. She kind of just let me do whatever that I think it was a good thing. I had a lot of freedom. As time progressed and I became successful, I started to feel like my mom was using me so that she could live a more luxurious lifestyle. And I started to set these boundaries, not giving her money or things like that. It made our relationship a bit more difficult and almost toxic. And so it sucks. I don't have a mom anymore. I don't talk to her. I miss having a mom. I feel like you can't rewind and you can't go back. I don't have that relationship with her anymore. I don't ever think I will. And that bums me out. Bums me out a lot. I talked to my dad and he struggles with my job and the industry. He's also religious. Recently I wanted to go visit him and he said that I can't go visit because his wife, my stepmom, doesn't want me there. I'm not allowed to go visit my dad anymore because my stepmom doesn't like that I do porn. But then he told me that when I was like, can we go get coffee and we could go get breakfast and he's like, I don't want to be seen in public with you. And that just b****** hurt so bad. And it sucks. I lost my family. I don't talk to my brothers or sisters. I think that they all kind of try to take advantage of me and stuff or they're just like my dad don't want to be around me. So do I feel compassion for her? Yes and no. I will always feel compassion for somebody who has lost their entire family because you need family. And so despite the fact that she obviously has a lot of money coming in, it is my understanding that she is one of, if not the biggest porn star that is out there. What does it mean? Who are you spending that money on and with? If you do not have family members, you have a bunch of people who sound like creatures or you said you lost your relationship with your mother because you realize that she was only okay with you doing porn to the extent that it would provide her money. So your relationship with your mother became transactional just as your relationship with the people that follow and love you is completely transactional. They love you to the point that you can put sex out for them. And pornography is just such a deviant category of course, it inspires deviancy. Am I sad for you to have had that conversation with a family member that doesn't want to be seen out in public with you? That hurts. Hearing you say it hurts but it's also understanding if your father has religious belief and has faith that he understands what evil you're putting into the world. We talk about pornography addiction, how it has destroyed men, how it is humiliating men and it is humiliating women. The men that transact with you and watch pornography are humiliated, they're closing themselves in the room, they don't want people to know that they're watching it and then of course you on the other end of that, you're being humiliated. They are paying or not paying to watch you be humiliated. And so yeah, to that extent, I definitely feel bad. I just want to make it clear that for some reason people are trying to separate only fans from what she is doing, it's the exact same thing. Only fans is the updated pornography, I'm sure she has an only fans account. And this is what it is, like women are transacting sex and in place of it, they're having dysfunctional relationships because at the end of the day, yes, there are many men that will sleep with you. There are few men that will bring you home to their mothers and there are even fewer men who have mothers that want you to be brought into their homes. And so it becomes difficult to have relationships. She commented that she didn't think that she wanted to have children. Well, an update she actually did, she recently had a child, she's now a mother of one and she's been talking about how she's getting so many nasty comments and it breaks my heart for the innocent life that she's created. Obviously, no one should be sending hatred toward a child, but you know that that hatred is going to follow that child for the rest of her life, that is the truth, right? This child is going to suffer for the rest of her life because of the decisions of her parents. You're going to say, oh, men, when they get mad at her or girls, when they get mad at her, I'm going to talk about what her mother does for a living, I'm going to talk about why it is that she has money because people are mean and children are mean and they try out being mean when they're in schools. And so, yeah, it's a horrible situation, a decision that she made. And by the way, she's not cleaning up her life, she's not suddenly not being a porn star. She's not lamenting and being honest about the consequences. She decided to choose money over having a healthy and a happy life in a reality. It's not an either or she could have had both and chose a different career. All right, guys, moving into, if we're talking about money and transactions, we have to talk about Patrice Colers and Black Lives Matter because unbelievably, Patrice Colers obviously news broke yesterday that Black Lives Matter is now in insolvency. They're going bankrupt, obviously, it's always been a scam. It was never about Black people. It was about, oh, one woman and a few of her homies extracting wealth from guilty white people as we discussed yesterday. Well, Patrice Colers is now taking to Instagram to tell you that the hate she's receiving for her scam that she conducted and the millions, not millions, but thousands of Black Americans whose lives were ruined because of her scam because they took her seriously and took to the streets and rioted and looted and got themselves arrested or got themselves harmed or worse yet. People died in a lot of these protests, obviously, because they turned violent. People were throwing mollotov cocktails, things of that nature. But she wants to remind you on Instagram that as you're doing these articles, rather than said hate her way, you should feel bad for her. Yeah, I know she collected $90 million to the field for homies, but she's the victim. Here's what she posted on Instagram. She wrote, the last two and a half years, I've been relentlessly attacked by the media. So many lies and so much mis and dis information. They are hell-bent on destroying my life. Even though I've not been at BLM since 2021, my face continues to be used to spread so many untruths. I'm exhausted and I fear for my life daily. The worst is so many people have just stayed silent. Many haven't and I'm grateful for those who have helped combat the dangerous lies. But y'all, I don't know how much more of this I can take. She's hurting y'all. Don't you understand? These are hurting. And I'm hurting reading this. I feel so bad for her. And it looks like I have crocodile dealers and I'm not actually crying. It's because I'm not. But I've learned how to fake cry for Patrice Colors. She's done this act before on Instagram. I remember when a eight month pregnant Candace hobbled up to one of her mansions and knocked I mean, rang the doorbell really politely having no idea that she was inside. And despite that she took to Instagram and tell a big old lie. Do you guys remember that taking place? It might be a lot of documentary when I exposed all the lies and the shoddy financing. Well, don't worry. I'm going to take you down memory lane. Take a listen. Hello. I was just looking to speak to whoever is at this property. Sir. Hello. I don't know if he's going to get someone. I see a very cute German shepherd. It looks like. This morning I woke up to Candace Owens being outside of my house with a news crew. It looks to be maybe in his mid 40s white male black hat and he is whoever he spoke to on the phone has instructed him to record us, which is strange because we just want to talk. And what I see in the driveway are two cars and a sign that says you are exactly where you are supposed to be. She was demanding that I come outside. Hi. Hello. Hi, you're welcome to record. I just want to talk. Are you instructed not to speak to anybody? We're not trying to harass you. We'll gladly leave. We're just wondering if we can speak to anybody. Sorry. What was that? Okay. I just thought this was a house for Black Lives Matter. It's unacceptable and it's dangerous that anybody, any stranger, come outside of my house. We're just trying to figure out if this house is actually being used for Black people in a creative space at all and it doesn't seem that way. What happened this morning is not safety. It's not what I deserve. It's not what any of us deserve. I can't see how this purchase helped Black Lives anywhere in America. I can't even find a Black life on the property. The dog's not even Black. So, what was that? So they're literally trying to destroy us. They're trying to destroy me. They're trying to destroy the movement. And I really just need us to be stronger. Thank you, sir. Have a great day. It still makes me chuckle. It's really just the audacity of the lie that she told on Instagram. She called me dangerous demanding that she came outside. I had no idea she was even inside. I was eight months pregnant with my hands behind my back. Literally trying to destroy us. The crocodile tears. They absolutely kill me. And I don't feel anything for her. This woman deserves everything that she has coming at her and so much more. We are talking about a movement that divided not just this nation, the world. There were people all over the world talking about the injustice that was happening for Black people. And there was just a couple of people that were benefiting because of that lie. Just a couple of people and she was one of them that were collecting mansions around America. So while she talks about this and this information, she doesn't seem to be able to land exactly what that is. She doesn't seem to tell us what it is. She doesn't have information. It's information because there was nothing in my documentary that was misinformation. As if there was, she would have sued me. She definitely had the money to. Everybody should be very frustrated and angry at her. As I said, she's limited the comments on that post because obviously she would be getting destroyed in them. She deserves everything that she has coming her way. All right, guys. I know we've been warming up for Pride Month. I'm so excited and I just can't hide it and sprinkles and rainbows and frosted. Flakes. I'm about to show you the most frosted flake I've ever seen. And his name is Patty Gonia and he's a drag queen and shockingly, shockingly North Face. I remember raising North Face thinking North Face, an athletic company. I'm thinking of outdoorsmen. I'm thinking of athletes. I'm certainly not thinking of a drag queen named Patty Gonia. But that's exactly what they're going to give you anyways. Hi, it's me Patty Gonia, a real life homosexual. And today I'm here with the North Face. We are here to invite you to come out in nature with us. Wow, this is nice. We like to call this little tour the summer of Pride. This tour has everything. Hiking, community, art, lesbians, lesbians, making art. Last year we get a sashay to cross the nation and celebrate Pride. Cross the nation with hundreds of you across the nation. Last year we're back back back again with two new stops at Lanna Gee. Why? Because you're there. In Salt Lake City, we're coming for you. Hi, here we go. Of course, this year all these fabulous speakers will be coming from inside this TV to a nature near you. So come outside and celebrate the beautiful LG HGTV community. This is pretty yay. I don't know what's happening anymore guys. I don't know what's happening. I don't know if we are being invaded by China. I think it's the I now need to believe in the conspiracy. I need to believe that China somehow hired all of the marketing agencies that they're running all the marketing agencies and they're the ones that are suggesting to these corporations that they go this way that they say, hey, here's an idea. You have this customer that loves the outdoors. Why don't you blow up your entire customer base by putting a drag queen in the center of a place where drag queens just don't hang out and that is in nature. They like a nice makeup chair. They like their weaves and they like their nails, but drag queens are not out in nature. So why do this? Has nobody learned from Bud Light? Obviously adding this to the list of places that I will never repeat never shop again. There will be nothing in my home that is from the North Face or Patagonia. It just defies reality. We must be being attacked. We have to. We have to be under attack. This must be Putin. Putin must have done this. Putin is sending drag queens to America because he wants to right the wrong with what's going on in Ukraine. He's going you guys are having a proxy war with Ukraine. So I'm going to have a proxy war with you via drag queens. It's Putin. Believe that. It's the only thing we can believe in. But in the meantime, do not shop at North Face. Okay. Ridiculous.
