If you were creating a short list of luminaries in the field of public health, you wouldn't think that someone named Michelle Luhan Grisham would appear on that list. At no point in her life did Grisham receive any training in medicine or science. Instead, she has a Bachelor of Arts degree in something called university studies. And for the uninitiated degree in university studies is what people get when they don't want to study in a university. Then Grisham earned a law degree, which of course also has nothing to do with public health. And afterwards, for several years, Grisham worked at a State Department dealing with aging and long-term services. And she eventually directed that same department. Those were Michelle Luhan Grisham's credentials. When in 2004, she became the highest-ranking public health official in the state of New Mexico. Presumably the fact that she came from a prominent political family in the state didn't hurt her chances of getting the job. But whatever the case, Grisham's 10 year as the state's secretary of health was unremarkable. She only had the post for a couple of years before moving on. But many years later in 2020, the incoming Biden administration took a very close look at Michelle Luhan Grisham for reasons that remain unknown. The Biden administration apparently believed that Grisham's limited experience in the field of public health from more than a decade ago qualified her to run the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level. This is the department that oversees all public health issues in the entire country. Biden's aides publicly courted her for the job. They said that she was under careful consideration. Ultimately though, Grisham decided to remain as governor of New Mexico. So she didn't want the job. Now, in that capacity from the beginning, Grisham has governed less like a politician and more like a public health bureaucrat with limitless power. For the past three years, Grisham has ruled the state under an indefinite public health emergency protocol as recently as late last year when most of the country had moved on from COVID. Grisham was issuing orders requiring that state workers and hospital employees wear masks and take a regular schedule of COVID shots. Grisham often cited experts like herself to justify these unlawful and increasingly untenable mandates. But by March of this year, the people in New Mexico finally had enough. Grisham lacking the political will to sustain yet another extension of her public health powers formally ended the COVID-19 emergency in the state. Now, it took long enough, but Grisham's authority to issue unilateral edicts was finally gone at that point. Now, put yourself in Michelle Lujan Grisham's position at that very moment. How would you handle the reality that you can no longer rule your state like a dictator? Now, if you're a well-adjusted person who cares about your constitutional oath of office, you'd probably be thankful that the emergency is over, even if it was faked to begin with. You wouldn't want to assert arbitrary, extra-legal powers. Well, suffice it to say that that was not Michelle Grisham's reaction. Instead, she immediately began ruminating about other ways that she could expand her emergency powers. In May, in a conversation that didn't receive any attention from the media, Grisham spoke to Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health about her plan to expand the field of quote unquote public health to encompass everything. Every imaginable policy issue would fall under public health. And she announced this publicly. This is footage that should have set off a lot of alarm bells, but nobody even noticed it or talked about it. Here it is, watch. Everything is a public health issue. Gun violence is a public health issue. Poverty is a public health issue. Environmental consequences from energy is a public health issue. All of these disenfranchised populations, all of the equity barriers are all public health issues. And when we address those, our economy is better, our families are stronger, our risks are fewer, if we want to save the planet. And we want to make families independent. We want to eradicate poverty and injustice. It's going to take a whole new class of young dedicated professionals who are ready to take on the mantle. So I'm thrilled that they're watching and listening and I'm ready to have you work in New Mexico. And there are many other states, including your own home states, deserve you and need you. Let's go fix the world. Everything is a public health issue, says Michelle Lujan Grisham. She says poverty, climate change, gun violence, all public health. Let's go fix the world, Grisham says, as the Johns Hopkins lady, sitting there, public health lady, nods and grins along. Yes, let's fix the world. That's something we can do. Let's fix it. Now, you might be wondering when it became the goal of the public health industry to, quote, fix the world. Wasn't there gigs supposed to be, just to make sure the public is healthy? Public health, make sure the public is healthy? That's what I assumed. Not anymore, apparently. In fact, that hasn't been the goal since COVID. You might remember it was a Johns Hopkins public health expert, quote, unquote, named Jennifer Newzo, who stated that it's a bad idea to riot during the public during the COVID pandemic, unless you're rioting for George Floyd and BLM, in which case, go for it. So public health is not the goal anymore. Now the goal is to pursue social justice, which is what they mean when they talk about fixing the world. Now the goal is to correct every problem with the world and the people who identify the problems are Governor Grisham and other left-wing bureaucrats like her. Now you can think of a variety of terms to describe what's going on here. Mission creep comes to mind. It's also incoherent because if every problem is a public health problem, then public health has outlived its usefulness as a distinct category because it's not a distinct category. If everything is a public health issue, then nothing is a public health issue. Whatever you call this phenomenon we're seeing, it's obvious what Grisham is doing and why she's doing it. Like the rest of the public health establishment, she has realized that she can assume totalitarian powers as long as she can claim that she's addressing some public health matter. The solution is to label everything a public health matter and then she can do whatever she wants. And if she manages to get away with that, then she gets to control everything. That was her approach and she said it out loud in front of a friendly audience back in May, not even trying to hide it. A couple of days ago, as you may have seen, Grisham put the next stage of her plan into motion. She announced a public health order, quote unquote, that prohibits residents in so-called high crime areas, including New Mexico's biggest city from possessing firearms outside of their homes. And in making this announcement, Grisham admits that criminals are not gonna follow the law. The people that are actually committing the gun crime, they're not gonna follow this, she admits that. She also acknowledges that she's probably gonna get overturned in the courts because she doesn't really have the constitutional authority to do this, but she doesn't care. Watch. What your point is that? You took an oath to the Constitution. Isn't it unconstitutional to say you cannot exercise your caring license? With one exception. And that is, if there's an emergency, and I've declared an emergency for a temporary amount of time, I can invoke additional powers. No constitutional right, in my view, including my oath, is intended to be absolute. There are restrictions on free speech. There are restrictions on my freedoms. In this emergency, this 11 year old, and all these parents who have lost all these children, they deserve my attention to have the debate about whether or not in an emergency, we can create a safer environment. Because what about their constitutional rights? I took an oath to uphold those two. And if we ignore this growing problem without being bold, I've said to every other New Mexican, your rights are subrogated to theirs. And they are not in my view. Well, what are you doing? You say about crimes. There are laws against the crimes, so how are there rights? I got it. But again, if I'm unsafe, who's standing up for that right? If this climate is so out of control, somebody should do something. I'm doing as much as I know to do. Have you really think that criminals are going to hear this message and not carry a gun, making Albuquerque on the streets for 30 days? No. But here's what I do think. It's a pretty resounding message. Somebody should do something. Someone should do something, she says. That has been the justification for pretty much every tyrannical power grab in recent history. It's always under the guise of just do something. That was all of COVID, right? It was just do. It doesn't matter what we're doing. We're scared, so just do something, something. And she's doing something. Will it achieve anything at all? I mean, before we get to the question of whether she has the authority to do it, she doesn't. Will it even achieve anything? Even according to her? She seems skeptical of that. But she says that it sends a resounding message. She's not even pretending that there's any legal merit to this. She doesn't even suggest that criminals will obey it. It's all about the message. But what is that message exactly? Superficially what Grisham is saying is that no right is absolute in her words. And that part of it, just isolated on its own, no right is absolute. That's basically true, of course. That's why there's a legal process for removing rights. If you are a convicted murderer, you lose your right to carry a gun, for example. And most people have no issue with that. Certainly everyone agrees that you can't bring your gun with you into prison. When you go into prison, you lose basically all of your constitutional rights or most of them. And most people, again, have no issue with that. The problem is that Grisham is attempting to strip everyone's basic constitutional rights all at once by the stroke of a pen, basically treating everyone in the city like they are convicted murderers. And her reasoning to justify that dramatic expansion of her authority is ludicrous. I mean, there's always been gun crime. What exactly makes it a special emergency now? In that clip, you heard Grisham allude to something approaching an explanation, at least in her view, she says that an 11-year-old child was just shot and killed in a road rage incident near a baseball stadium in Albuquerque, which is a terrible travesty. Of course, someone shot 17 times at a moving vehicle killing the child and critically injuring a woman inside the car. Therefore Grisham says, because of this emotionally charged episode, we need to punish every law abiding gun owner in the entire state, or at least in that city, and maybe eventually the entire state. We need to turn them all into criminals or treat them like they are. Now, if road rage is the issue, then you think that she would ban cars. I mean, you could say that, well, that never would have happened if not for guns. Never would have happened without cars. But I guess she doesn't think that she can get away with banning cars, he gets. So she's settling just for the guns. Interestingly enough, Grisham doesn't display any curiosity about the assailant in that shooting. At the moment that Grisham issued that order ending the Second Amendment in New Mexico, because this 11-year-old was killed, authorities didn't know the identity of the suspect. They didn't know anything about it. They didn't know a single thing about him. That's more than a little strange if you think about it. You have to wonder, what kind of person shoots a moving vehicle 17 times due to road rage? Are we talking about a law-abiding gun owner? Is that what we're talking about? It's possible. Or are we talking about somebody with a criminal history, perhaps? Maybe somebody on probation. Could it be that we're not even talking about an American citizen at all? Those are questions that Grisham very badly doesn't want you to think about. But they're reasonable questions, especially if you're familiar with the numbers on how many felons and illegal aliens are shooting up the streets of New Mexico right now. There's a lot of them. And thanks in large part to policies that Grisham and her fellow Democrats have enacted. Nearly half of all federal crimes in the entire country are committed in states like New Mexico that sit along the Mexican border. And there's a reason for that. It's not a coincidence. The reason is called open borders. But Democrats in the state haven't done anything about it. In fact, during the Trump administration, Grisham refused to call the border crisis an emergency. So that is not an emergency. But now the Second Amendment is an emergency. And it's not the criminals in her state who are shooting people. They're not the emergency. It's the Second Amendment itself. So where is this leading exactly? Again, Grisham knows her order is going to get overturned eventually, which is probably why she limits it to 30 days. She's hoping the courts will take longer than 30 days to strike this down. So what's the real agenda here? Is this order just a trial balloon to introduce this idea to the public so that down the line, these kinds of emergency orders are more palatable? Reading between the lines, you can see that the Democrat Party probably views it that way. Following Grisham's order to the surprise of many conservatives, Democratic Senator Ted Lu along with the deeply neurotic anti-gun Harvard kid David Hogg came out and actually criticized the order as unconstitutional. And they used almost precisely the same language, which tells you that a memo went out somewhere to coordinate left wing messaging on this topic. So here's what Lou wrote. Quote, I support gun safety laws. However, no state in the union can suspend the federal constitution. There is no such thing as a state public health emergency exception to the US Constitution. Hogg wrote basically the same thing. Quote, I support gun safety, but there is no such thing as a state public health emergency exception to the US Constitution. Now, first of all, notice how creepy it is that a Harvard, Brat, and a US Senator are sourcing their talking points from the same mysterious higher power. And we know that these are talking points. They're saying exactly the same thing. Those posts did not come from Ted Lu's office or the brilliant mind of David Hogg. They probably came from the DNC, which is providing messaging on how to handle this. And for that reason, it's worth parsing the messages very carefully. Both messages say that there's no state exception to the US Constitution that allows for public health emergencies to supersede constitutional rights. And that sounds good. But of course, it doesn't go far enough, not even close. There's a reason they say state because they're deliberately leaving open the possibility that the federal government might be able to step in and create such public health exemptions to constitutional rights. They're reserving that power for Congress at some point in the future, even as they say that states can't do it on their own. That's a big deal because if you think back to COVID, some of the biggest infringements on civil liberties came from the federal government's assertion of emergency powers. The CDC, we all forget, nationalized the country's rental properties. Unilaterally, on their own, they did this. They made it illegal for landlords to evict tenants, even if the tenants weren't paying rent. Nothing like that has ever happened in this country before, but a so-called public health agency did it on their own. And of course, the Biden administration fired service members who didn't take the shot. In fact, they tried to have more than 100 million workers and private companies fired unless they took the shot or submitted to regular COVID testing over and over again. The feds set the blueprint for COVID totalitarianism and the states followed. So is that what they're planning for the next emergency? Quote unquote. Will the federal government attempt to use emergency powers to supersede the Second Amendment as they supersede all of our rights during COVID? Now for the moment, thankfully, it doesn't appear that this attempt to unilaterally end the Second Amendment in New Mexico will succeed. For one thing, several law enforcement officials in New Mexico have already come out and said that they're not going to enforce the order. And yesterday, as journalists Ford Fisher documented, protesters, many of them openly carrying showed up in Albuquerque and the police didn't do anything about it. And on one hand, this is obviously encouraging. It shows why we have the Second Amendment in the first place. It's a self-reinforcing amendment essentially. When everybody's armed, it's awfully difficult for police to disarm everyone without violence, and that's violence that no politician wants to be responsible for, at least not yet. But at the same time, this is all still profoundly distressing. It shouldn't fall on American citizens to go out in public and risk arrests or civil penalties or worse to enjoy a constitutional right. The simple fact that this kind of demonstration is even necessary is a huge win for the left. This is a win for the partisans who want to chip away at our constitutional rights bit by bit until they're gone. And we know that because Grisham, the governor, should be imprisoned right now. She is conspiring to undermine the federal rights of American citizens, which according to the president set by the Trump prosecutions is supposed to be a very serious crime. And unlike Trump, Grisham is openly admitting that she intends to subvert Americans' constitutional rights. She's admitting it. In fact, as of last night, Grisham was openly bragging about all this on Twitter. So why isn't every DA in New Mexico bringing charges against Grisham tonight? Why aren't the, where are the Rico charges? Where are the raids on her mansion? Why is she being frog marched down the street in handcuffs? Why aren't they trying to throw her in prison for the rest of her life? That's what she deserves. It's what the left would obviously do if the she was on the other side. Imagine if a Republican governor tried to, I don't know, unilaterally suspend the 19th amendment arguing that women voters are a threat to the country in our way of life. How do we think Democrats would respond to that? No, they'd be saying, bring the federal government and put that person in jail right now. Remove them from power today because of that. That's not what's happening to Grisham. So if this order was a trial balloon, the response from the right has been woefully insufficient. Tyrants have always used emergencies, whether real or imaginary, to justify their power grabs. COVID was the pivotal moment when most of the country laid down and allowed the government to suspend essentially all of our rights for the sake of protecting us against a cold. Career bureaucrats like Governor Grisham, they took note of that. And now she's taking it to the next level. And she's getting really only minimal pushback. It's not hard to imagine where this goes next as we showed you in that video from John Hopkins, Grisham herself has already outlined the plan from here. So we can probably expect a climate change emergency to justify banning cars, a transphobia emergency to shut down non-affirming speech, a racism emergency to ram through a federal reparations plan, a poverty emergency to redistribute wealth. The possibilities are endless. And unless public health autocrats like Michelle Lujan Grisham experience real consequences for what they're doing, then these nation-ending possibilities will become reality. Now let's get to our five headlines. You know, since Roe B. Wade was overturned, the left has lost their minds making abortion their official sacrament. But despite this, the pro-life efforts are still booming. You heard that right despite the narrative that pro-lifers that you hear about pro-lifers, they have not gone away. They've increased the number as one of the largest pro-life organizations in the world, no one's in a better position than 40 days for life to end abortion in each state in a post-Rough America. Four days for life is changing hearts and minds in the most blue pro-abortion states. They've had a record number of locations since Roe was overturned and they grew in both volunteers and locations with about 1 million volunteers in 1,500 cities. They hold peaceful vigils outside abortion facilities. You can help them fight the ongoing legal battles by protecting free speech for their volunteers by giving a tax-deductible gift of any amount at 40 days for life dot com. That's 40 days for life dot com. So we begin the five headlines, unfortunately, with something very strange and disturbing. So no change of pace there, I suppose. Libs of TikTok has the report today about Burbank Mayor Constantine Anthony, who attended a drag show last week. And there was a time when that would be enough of a scandal on its own, right? A public official rather, elected official going to a drag show would be considered gross and outrageous enough to be disqualifying. But that's not the case anymore, so we have to add in two other details. First, this was a drag show where kids were invited and we'll have more on that in just a moment. And while at the drag show, Constantine stood up in front of the crowd and volunteered to be spanked by the drag queen. Here's what that looked like if you're curious or even if you're not, here it is anyway. Let's watch. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I got to be a macho macho man. I got to be a macho. Okay. So first of all, you know that I firmly believe that sex is biological. It's innate. A man is a man and nothing can ever make him not a man. But if it were possible, if it were possible for a man to lose his manhood completely, then that's how it would happen. Then you just watched it happen. Getting spanked in public by a drag queen, you may still be a man technically, biologically after that, but you certainly have now had your man card permanently revoked and there's nothing that can ever reverse that decision. Now lives of TikTok called this out saying that the mayor of Burbank was spanked by a drag queen at an event involving children and the mayor responded to that by tweeting this. He said, actually, there weren't any children at this private 21 plus event, but of course, lying is totally on brand for you. Well, lives of TikTok then posted the advertisement that the drag queen had previously, the drag queen you just saw there had previously posted the advertisement, the poster to Instagram, I think. And here's what the advertisement says. Want you to pay close attention to the wording, okay? Drag queen bingo with Roxy Wood, September 9th, 6 to 8 30 PM and mission $50, $50. People are paying 50 bucks for that. It's at least one movie ticket these days. That's like half a movie ticket, but still way too much. Drink ticket $7, raffle ticket $5. Here's the part. Ages 15 and over, event not suitable for children. Okay, so the mayor says there were no children there. It was an adult event. The ad does say not suitable for children, but it also says ages 15 and over. So what that means apparently is that the mayor and the people who put on this drag show do not consider 15 year olds to be children. And of course we already knew this about them. I mean, after all the left continues to claim that they will still claim with a straight face that children aren't getting gender transition surgeries, even though 15 year old girls are getting cosmetic double mastectomies all the time. So the implications are obvious. What they're saying is that, yeah, well, that's not a child. And even more obvious is the fact that including kids, including 15 year olds and something like this in a drag event is depraved and evil. Now with that said, I want to make one other point. And this is a broader point, but it applies to this situation certainly specifically. So just using this as an example. I think we make a mistake. When something like this happens, we make a mistake when we focus entirely on the situation on the question of whether children were there. The mayor says there were no kids. The poster seems to suggest otherwise. Was somebody under the age of 18 actually in attendance for this event or not? I mean, I don't know. I have no idea. If so, if there was a minor there, then it's grotesque and everyone involved should be in prison. But let's just say that there was no one under the age of 18 at this event. Let's just say that. If the sake of argument, let's just say that. Is that the end of the conversation then? Do we move on? Is there no scandal here? Is there nothing else to say about it? When you see an event like that with the mayor getting spanked by a drag queen, is our only question? Was there, were there any kids there? And if they say no, then we say, okay, well, no problem. No, I don't think that's the end of the conversation. I don't think we move on. I think that there is still a scandal even if there were no children present. You know, this is the same thing that I say with the gender transition industry. Obviously we have to protect kids. Obviously, that's the most important thing. Obviously mutilating a child is unthinkably horrifically evil. But that doesn't mean that everything else that happens, everything else that doesn't involve children is automatically okay. So I don't want to make the mistake of implying that all of this stuff is fine as long as there are no kids there. It's a lot worse when there are kids there. But even with none there, we still have a problem. Right? My point is that it should be a scandal. It should be disqualifying for a public official, an elected official, a mayor to go to a perverted show like this and get spanked by a drag queen. That in and of itself, no matter who else is in attendance, is disqualifying. Why? I mean, you might say, well, there's no kids there. It's consenting adults. It's still degenerate. It's morally disgusting. It's depraved behavior. And we should be opposed to depraved behavior from everyone, especially public officials. But many on the right have long ago adopted this libertarian belief that, well, as long as they're consenting adults and even if it's depraved, disgusting, outrageous, still, we shouldn't criticize it. Think about Sam Brinton before he revealed himself to be a serial luggage thief. Before that, back when he was appointed to his position in the Department of Energy, we still knew that he was a BDSM pervert weirdo who liked to have sex with men dressed like dogs. Now, as far as we know, thank God, no children were involved in any of that. I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if it turned out otherwise. But as far as we know, there was only adults involved in that with Sam Brinton, but I still would have said and I still did say that Brinton never should have been given that job in government. His personal behavior, his personal life should have disqualified him. Yes, it was all consenting adults as far as we know. Okay. The adults were consenting to doing something disgusting and depraved and demented. How was that not justification enough to, you know, for certain consequences, like being disqualified from public office or positions in government? And again, it wasn't all the long ago when everything I'm saying would have been totally obvious. When a mayor shows up at a drag show and gets spanked by a drag, it's like he's getting run out of office the next day automatically because we all realize that there are certain standards you have to hold people to, especially public officials. So the question about whether or not there are kids at these things, again, very important question. We have to talk about that. That's not the end of the conversation, or at least it shouldn't. Kamala Harris was pressed this week and about her position on abortion, specifically when the cutoff should be, right? And does a baby go from being a meaningless clump of cells to being a person with rights? That was the question. And here is her answer or her non answer as the case may be. What is it that you believe, I mean, what week of pregnancy should abortion access be cut off? We need to restore the protections of Roe versus Wade, which we're not trying to do something new. Well, that was been fabulous because it was about viability, which could be anywhere between 20 to 24 weeks. And so, no, no, no, no, no, let's let me be very clear. The Women's Health Protection Act that the White House also enjoys. Let me be very clear. From day one, the president has been clear. I have been clear. We need to put back the protections that are in Roe v. Wade into law since the Supreme Court took it. Congress has the power and ability to pass legislation, to put those protections back in law, and Joe Biden will sign that bill. So that is what we want. But does it need to be specific in terms of defining where that guarantee goes up to and where it does not, which week of pregnancy? We need to put back in place the protections of Roe versus Wade. You are now asking you this question. But we're not trying to do anything that did not exist before June of last year. We are saying it wasn't crafted into law. And that's why I'm asking you for the specifics here, because Republicans say the lack of a precise date in cutting it off. You know this. They say that allows Democrats to perform abortions up until, you know, birth, which is ridiculous, which is not accurate at. And it's ridiculous. I understand that. And it's a mischaracterization of the point. No, the point is the point is we need to be more precise. I am being precise. We need to put into law the protections of Roe versus Wade. I am being precise. I'm precisely avoiding answering anything remotely resembling that question. She says that that's ridiculous. It's not my favorite part of that that exchange there. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous that anyone wants abortion up until birth, she says. And yet she also won't say that she doesn't want abortion up until birth. So this is always the way these people play the game. When you say, oh, you're okay with abortion up until birth, that's absurd. Okay, so you don't want abortion up until birth? Well, that's besides the point. No, that's the whole point. And if we can all agree, like, if you didn't know any better and you watched that clip, you would think, well, I guess we all agree that apparently that abortion, you know, between children up until birth is insane. You've got fully developed infants who can survive outside the womb. Obviously, this is a person. Like we can all agree on that. And if we can all agree on that, and you would think we can based on the way she responded, that's ridiculous, then where's the cutoff? If the cutoff is not birth, where is it? And she can't answer that. Or she won't answer it because her cutoff is in fact birth. That is the cutoff for all of these people. Oh, if not a little bit after that. That is the cutoff. And they won't say it. They won't say it because they realize how terrible it sounds and is, sounds terrible because it is terrible. But that is their cutoff. And it has to be. This is always the point when it comes to the abortion debate, is that obviously there have to be cut, there's a cutoff somewhere. Like there's a point, you've got an unborn child. You've got an unborn child here. Over here you've got a 30 year old man. Everyone agrees the 30 year old man is a person. Well, I don't know if the left would have been great with that. We have a 30 year old woman over here. Everyone agrees that the 30 year old woman is a person. And yet they raise questions about the, well, we don't, the unborn, the fetus, not really a person. Okay. Well, at what point if this quote unquote fetus is not a person and the 30 year woman is a person, then at what, and that 30 year old woman used to be a quote unquote fetus in her past, at what point did she become a person with rights? You have to be able to answer that. You have to be able to. The analogy I've used before is if you can't answer that, if you can't answer it, if you're going to do the Barack Obama dodge, his infamous dodge of, that's above my pay grade when person is saying. If that's what you're saying, then you more than anyone really should be opposed to abortion. Because then what you're saying is, well, abortion might be killing a person. I don't know. And then an abortion, that's like, it's like firing a gun into a dark room. You might hit somebody and kill someone. You might not. You don't know. But if you fire a gun into a dark room without knowing if there's anybody in there and you kill someone, you're going to jail. That's murder, at least manslaughter. Because you knew that there could be a person there and you fired the gun anyway. So if you're not willing to answer the question of when this person will begin or if you're saying you don't know, then what you're saying is that we might be killing a person. So that just doesn't work. You have to be able to answer the question. And what we find out is that when it comes to personhood, there's only two cutoffs that make any sense. There's only two options that make any logical sense. Really, there's only one, there's only one, which is conception. Because that is when this, you know, that 30-year-old woman, we trace her history back, we go back and back and back. What we're going to find is there's a certain moment when that person who's now a 30-year-old woman came into existence and that was conception. So there's this unbroken chain, we trace it back, back, back, back, back. Even when she was in the womb, we find there was one moment when she came into existence and it only makes logical sense to say that she was a person in that moment. If you're not going to say that, then the only other kind of like at least tangible cut-off would be birth. But then you're claiming that something magical, so that's a tangible like cut-off that we can all understand. But it doesn't make any sense because now you're saying that something magical happens as the child emerges from the birth canal. All that's happening is moving locations from the womb to the hospital room. And something magical happens in a moment to imbue the baby with person. That doesn't make any sense either. So that cut-off doesn't work and then we're back at conception. And that's where this conversation always leads. As pro-lifers, we're the only ones. You might not like the answer of when person begins. We're the only ones who can answer it. We're the only ones who have a defensible, coherent, cogent answer. No one else does. If you're not going to say conception, then you're left with something completely arbitrary that you've just come up with on your own. Even if you say something like, well, let's say 15 weeks, why is that it? So 14 and a half weeks, not a person. At 15 weeks, magically, you are. Doesn't make any sense. So she knows all that. But here's the real answer from these people. And this is true of pretty much everyone who supports abortion. And this is also why this conversation never goes anywhere. It can't go anywhere. Can't go anywhere because you can't have a fruitful dialogue when there's one side of the discussion that isn't being honest about what their position actually is. I can't engage with your position or refute it if you won't say what your position is. And what Kamala Harris's position actually is, is that unborn babies are people and we should be able to kill them. That's the position. Every pro-abortion person, that is actually their position. But yeah, obviously they're human beings, they're people, and we should be able to kill them. We should be able to kill babies. That's their actual position. They won't say it out loud. They know they can't say that out loud. So they're left flailing around like Kamala Harris was there. All right, briefly I want to mention this too. The Hill has this report. GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswami said Friday that he would deport the children of undocumented immigrants with their families despite them already being US citizens. Quote, after Town Hall in Iowa, Ramaswami said, there are legally contested questions under the 14th amendment of whether the child of an illegal immigrant is indeed a child who enjoys birthright citizenship or not. Ramaswami is not the only GOP candidate to question US citizenship rules. Former President Trump announced in late May that on his first day back in office he would seek to end birthright citizenship by way of an executive order. Despite the GOP candidates' plans, a majority of Americans said that US should continue to provide birthright citizenship in a poll following Trump's announcement. Only a quarter of those surveyed said that it should end with 15% saying they were not sure. Governor Ron Sanders has also pledged to end birthright citizenship. Now, this to me is treated. The fact that Ramaswami said this is getting a lot of headlines, the media is outraged, of course, and it's being treated like some kind of big deal, some sort of extreme position. But it's like we talked about with abortion. You've got to look for just coherent cutoffs, positions that actually make sense and are defensible. This to me is just makes the most sense. We are against splitting families up, aren't we? That was the big outrage during the Trump years. And they don't talk about it anymore, of course. That was back when detaining someone at the border was putting them in a cage. So there's always been detainment at the border, just like there was under Obama and there is now under Biden. But now, but for that four year period, it was, we called it putting people in cages. So back then, we were told that what made this so terrible is that you're breaking up families, you're splitting families up. And I agree that we don't want to split families up. As a parent, myself, I can't imagine being separated from my children. That's why I would never sneak across a border illegally with my children or without them, especially not with them. A lot of reasons why I wouldn't do that. And one of them is that I wouldn't want to be separated from them and all that. So if we don't want to separate families, then you have a family here and they're here illegally and they have defied our laws and you need to deport them, not because nothing personal, nothing personal against them, but they broke the law. And we have a border, we have to enforce it. And so if you're going to deport them, what are you going to separate them from their kids? Are you going to keep their kids here and send the parents back alone? That to me is a much more cruel way of going about this. So obviously you deport everyone, including the kids. Now, the unspoken thing on the left is that, well, they don't want to split the families up. They care that much about splitting families up in principle, but no, they just want to use that as an excuse to deport no one. So that's what they're going for, obviously.

We got a couple of quick ones here. Garrett says, Matt, please go back to the old show intro. It was so much better than the new one. Well, come on. There have been a couple of a few people protesting the new show intro, but this is, it changes hard for people and one thing you learn in this business especially is that anytime you change anything, it doesn't matter what it is, there can be people who complain about it, but just objectively the new intro is so much better than the old one. Come on. Let's be real about this. Joe Sanders says, I selfish, I selfishly have a wife and kids. Selfish is a good thing, not a bad thing. I've seen an interesting number of comments making this exact point as we've talked last week about the effort by the elites in our society to convince people not to have families, not to have spouses, not to have kids and to live selfishly. I've heard from many people saying, well, what's wrong with being selfish? No, I don't know what Joe, I don't know what definition of selfish you're using here, but to be selfish means that you are not concerned. You do not take other people into consideration. It means that you are chiefly concerned with yourself, which is not a surprise. It's right there in the name. That's what being selfish means. So it's hard for me to understand how you would consider that to be a good thing. Unless you understand selfish to me that you're taking care of yourself, you're taking care of your family, that's not a selfish concern. Selfish means specifically that you are concerned only with yourself to the exclusion of everybody else. And yeah, it's also true, as many people have pointed out, that just because you have a family doesn't automatically mean that you're not selfish. There are a lot of people in therapy right now that are still complaining about their parents and how selfish their parents were. Like there are plenty of selfish parents out there that are selfish spouses. So I've acknowledged this all along. It's an important point too, that just having a family doesn't magically turn you into a better person, but it does give you a unique opportunity to become a better person. It does give you the opportunity every day to focus on people other than yourself. Just like you could be childless and single and not be a selfish person, but it's much easier to fall into that. When you're living by yourself, you're concerned only about yourself and your own amusement. There's no one else that you really have to take care of. And so that's going to tend to bring out of people a certain self-centeredness. It doesn't have to, but it often does have that effect because you don't have all the same opportunities every day to really care for other people, especially not in the kind of way you do when you have kids. Old Fred says, depopulation is the rights version of climate change, it seems. So I assume you mean that depopulation according to you is a fake conspiracy theory? Well, it's not. I mean, all I can tell you is that the birth rate right now, I think, and you can fact check me on this, I think we're at 1.8 kids. I think it's at 1.8, 1.7. Replacement level is 2.1. So we are currently below replacement level. And when your population, when your reproduction level in society goes below replacement level, it means that it's not enough to replace the older people who are dying off, which means that eventually your population starts to decrease. There's no question that that's happening. I guess the only question beyond that is whether there's an actual agenda in place to see population levels decrease. And I think the answer to that is obvious. I mean, we could start with these 60 million babies that have been killed by the abortion industry. A lot of depopulating going on there. Finally, Kate Moth says, listen up, an almost 40-year-old man with a high school education and five plaid shirts thinks he has something to say about women. That's ridiculous. I have a lot more than five plaid shirts. Okay. Don't be absurd.

The state of California has so many bad laws on the books and others working their way to being on the books that it's very difficult to say.

According to the bill, according to the bill, the health safety and welfare of the child includes, among other comprehensive factors, a parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity or gender expression. Affirmation includes a range of actions and will be unique for each child, but in every case, must promote the child's overall health and well-being. Assemblymember Lori Wilson said that affirmation could mean whether a parent provided gender expression or gender expression. And that's a lot of things that we're going to do. And I think that's a lot of things that we're going to do. And I think that's a lot of things that we're going to do. Lori Wilson said that affirmation could mean whether a parent provided gender targeted toys, nail polish, and hair length, according to the Associated Press. Now, of course, it's hard to know where to begin with all this. So we might as well start at the end and work backwards. Assemblywoman Lori Wilson says that a parent will be required to affirm a child's gender identity or else lose custody. And what does affirmation look like? Well, it means providing nail polish and gender specific toys. Now, it wasn't all that long ago that the left pretended to be opposed to what they called gendered toys. Now, they say that if you don't give your kids those kinds of toys, you could lose custody of them. They went from toys don't have a gender to if your boy thinks he's a girl, you better give him Barbie dolls or will take away your parental rights. And they made that transition from one to the other over the span of like two years or maybe more like two minutes. And while jumping wildly from one extreme to another, they didn't even for a moment make a brief pit stop at the correct position. They just did a leapfrog right over it. And the correct position is that certain toys, certain colors, clothing are typically appealing to boys while other toys, colors, and clothing are typically appealing to girls. This is not entirely arbitrary or societally constructed. Girls, for example, tend to be more nurturing and maternalistic, which is why they gravitate towards baby dolls from a very young age. Boys tend to be more aggressive and energetic, which is why they typically gravitate towards action figures and superheroes. However, some boys will not have that aggressive and energetic tendency just as some girls will not display that nurturing and maternalistic tendency quite as much. Some boys will prefer toys that girls typically play with and vice versa. It doesn't mean that the boy is a girl or that the girl is a boy. We're talking about what is typical of boys and girls, not what is absolutely always the case for all of them. Broad tendencies are not absolute. There will be outliers. And those outliers do not delegitimize the tendency nor do they delegitimize the biological sex of the outlier. This is not a hard concept to understand. I shouldn't have to spend five years of my life explaining it. And I especially shouldn't have to explain and don't have to because most of the leftists who now pretend that a girl transforms into a boy the moment she picks up a GI Joe don't really believe that. That's just a pretense they've adopted in order to bring about their desired conclusion. What is their desired conclusion? Well, we're seeing it now in California. This is their end game or at least the end of one phase of their societal destruction and the beginning of a new one. Remember that these people don't really care about transgenderism. They never have. That was just a convenient vehicle, a Trojan horse to do the thing they really want to do, which is to destroy Western civilization through the destruction of the family. This soon to be law in California will be a major step towards that end as it not only sets parents against each other and children against parents, but also, and this is entirely intentional, by the way, incentivizes mothers to create gender confusion in their kids. That's already happening, but now there's an even greater incentive for it because now a woman, and I say woman because it's almost always women who do this, a woman who wants to divorce her husband and keep the kids needs only whisper in her son's ear that he's really a girl that she'll love him more as a girl, that he'll be better and have more fun as a girl. And as soon as that brainwashing takes hold, she'll know that the boy's father probably won't go along with it, and that's all she's going to need to win full custody. That's where this is headed, where it's designed to head. Of course they won't admit that, so instead they'll talk a lot about the necessity to affirm, or as Lori Wilson put it, the duty to affirm, watch. Note that parents affirm their children. They have since the dawn of time. Typically it happens when their gender identity expression matches their biological gender. But what happens is when it doesn't, that's when the affirmation starts to wane, and that's what we're dealing with here. Although it's called the TGI Bill, they're not mentioned anywhere in the law. What's mentioned in the law is the child's gender identity and expression, and the parents affirmation of that, whatever it is, because that is our duty as parents to affirm our children. Now we've talked a lot about this obviously, but it's always worth reiterating everything you heard there is horribly tremendously wrong. Our duty as parents is to affirm our children, she says, demonstrating that she is no surprise a terrible mother. This is a terrible mother, but a mother who doesn't understand the fundamental nature of motherhood. Now there is one context in which it would be valid to say that our duty as parents is to affirm our children. We should absolutely affirm them in the truth. We should affirm who they are, who they actually inherently biologically are. We should affirm them as human beings, as children of God, as male or female. Should I affirm my son if he's confused and thinks he's a girl? Yes, absolutely. I affirm my son. I affirm him as a boy, as a male. I affirm him in reality. I say to him, no, you are not a girl. You are a boy and that is good. That's what affirmation means. And if Lori Wilson means that we have a duty to affirm our children in that sense, then she couldn't be more right. But that's not what she means. What she means is the opposite. What she means is that we have the duty to affirm, to agree with, to validate, to legitimize whatever deluded, confused, inane idea pops into our kid's mind at any given moment. And this is a very dangerous thing because any parent knows that all kinds of deluded, confused, inane ideas pop into our kids' minds every day. So just pulling the most recent example in my own life. Yesterday, my six-year-old son, he asked me if he could go out back and chop down a tree. So he wanted to take a saw and then cut down a large 50-foot tree by himself. And he said he needed to do this because he needed the wood for the fort that he's building. So my six-year-old apparently identifies as a skilled lumberjack. He believes that he's capable of using very sharp instruments to take down very large trees and he believes he can do it without getting himself crushed or the house crushed or anything else. And he believes all this firmly. I mean, in the deepest parts of his soul, he believes it. Do I affirm that belief? No, that is one of approximately 18 million beliefs and opinions and requests and demands from my children that I do not affirm. Because my duty as a parent, despite what Lori Wilson says, is not to affirm whatever my kids say and think, but rather to guide them towards truth and reason so that over time, they'll begin to say and think things that are true and reasonable. That is the duty of a parent. But it's a duty that in California, you'll soon lose your children if you fulfill, which is why you need to get the hell out of that state if you haven't already. And it's also why California is again today, canceled. That'll do it for the show today. Thanks for watching. Have a great day. Godspeed."
