    "text": " Great show today. Stu's here to tell you all about it. Yeah, it's true. We've got a new sponsor today. It's called Spoon Style Forks. We'll get into that later on in the program. Stu is not here to tell you about that. That is going to be edited from this podcast. You will not hear that portion of the podcast. Here's the good stuff. Here's all the good stuff. Oh, yes. It's a fun show today. Bill O'Reilly's fantastic. It's a great show. I will remind you, however, and take this last moment to remind you that the laysTV.com is the place to go. Today is the last day to get your 30 bucks off. If you want to get that 30 bucks off, glazedTV.com. Glenn, I would also encourage you to, of course, subscribe to this podcast, rate and review, and click over to Stu Does America to get my podcast every day. And subscribe there. We start with Rand Paul, and we have an appearance of dah! Andrew Cuomo, don't miss it. You're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program. Boy, do we ever need Rand Paul and some libertarian thinking in our country more than ever. Welcome to the program. Dr. Rand Paul, how are you, sir? Very good, Glenn. Thanks for having me. You bet. Yesterday, during the Senate, let me just play the clip of Rand Paul with Rachel Levine and her confirmation hearing. Listen. General mutilation has been nearly universally condemned. General mutilation has been condemned by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund. According to the WHO, General mutilation is recognized internationally as a violation of human rights. General mutilation is considered particularly egregious because, as the WHO notes, it is nearly always carried out on minors and as a violation of the rights of children. Most General mutilation is not typically performed by force, but as WHO notes that by social convention, social norm, the social pressure to conform, to do what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community. American culture is now normalizing the idea that minors can be given hormones to prevent their biological development of their secondary sexual characteristics. Dr. Levine, you have supported both allowing minors to be given hormone blockers to prevent them from going through puberty, as well as surgical destruction of a minor genitalia. Like surgical mutilation, hormonal interruption of puberty can permanently alter and prevent secondary sexual characteristics. The American College of Pediatricians reports that 80 to 95 percent of pre-pubital children with gender dysphoria will experience resolution by late adolescence if not exposed to medical intervention and social affirmation. This statement of yours, Rand, is responsible for headlines like this. Rand Paul tried to derail Rachel Levine's historic confirmation hearing with transphobic misinformation. The interesting thing is none of it was directed towards her personally or who she is, who was directed towards the question of whether children can consent. This is an intellectual question. It's not a inflammatory question. It's a question of serious consequence. Can a young girl of 12 years old or 15 years old can they consent to an abortion? Can they consent to have their ears pierced? Can they consent to have surgery to change their sex? These are important questions, and most people would argue that children can't really make an informed consent. We have laws against a man having sex with a 12-year-old, even if a 12-year-old says yes, because we don't think a 12-year-old is capable of consenting. They just aren't old enough to make the difference. It's even worse than this. In one of the clinics in England, one of these gender dysphoria clinics in England, 10% of the kids that are coming in are between the age of 3 and 10. My goodness, people talking to a three-year-old and trying to tell them it's fine that they really are of a different sex, see, most of the stuff would be, you know, three-year-olds think they're alien sometimes. I mean, they have no conception of any of the importance of any of these incredible questions, but to let a three-year-old participate in that or a five-year-old or an eight-year-old, and then you've got these loony-toon left-wing parents encouraging this and reaffirming it. And this is what the American pediatricians have said is that if you don't medically do anything and you don't reaffirm it, you just kind of let the kid grow up. Most people grow out of this and understand that it's an aberration, not something that they really desire. Is she going to be confirmed? Well, mainly, she's in a special category now, so the Democrats will vote for her. I suspect a couple of Republicans who want to somehow, you know, send some kind of signal or vote for her, too, but it's alarming. And it isn't about who she is. It's about the idea to my mind that a minor could make the decision and see a lot of this stuff is irreversible. You give a boy, girls, herments, and the ages of 14 to 16, they don't come back. You give a girl, boys, herments. You know, once a girl is given enough testosterone to grow a beard with, their face doesn't go back if they change their mind. So to me here... It's just crazy. To me, it is a little bit about who she is, and nothing about her sexuality or her trans transition to a woman. It has everything to do with her mother. She took her mother, as she was the Secretary of Health for Pennsylvania, she took her mother out of nursing home as soon as COVID restrictions without warning anybody else, hey, you know, maybe you should do that. She also, during COVID, had a report out from her on official health department stationary about how the COVID scare should affect your orgies. And she put rules out, our kids can't go to school. But her priority was if you're going to go to a place where you're going to have sex with several people, here's what you have to do. I mean, the world is a clown show, an absolute clown show. I think this is why she wouldn't answer my question. She refused to answer the question and came up with some empty problem. But she didn't want to answer it because she truly is an extremist. She is so far out there that most of America would recoil in horror if they knew what she was for. But you're right about the practicality of it. Other people asked that question. That was why I didn't dwell on the idea of what she did bring her mom out with everybody else to die. Absolutely. That's disqualifying. And that's most pertinent to whether she can do the job. But there is this big issue of normalizing this idea that a nine-year-old can want to change her sex and you start giving them hormones. And if the parents say no, that the child gets to decide at nine. And that's just wrong. And children just aren't capable of making life-changing decisions. And there is a permanence to this. At some point, when they start giving them cross hormones, meaning that you give a boy girl hormones or a girl boy on buds, when you start doing this and they do it between the ages of 14 and 16, as minors, they're irreversible changes. Do you become sort of this in between? You're neither a boy nor a girl, but you can't go back. A book that came out three years ago that basically says the same stuff, quoting medical science and scientists, warning about how detrimental this can be on children was pulled from Amazon. It's been out for three years. It was pulled for hate speech by Amazon, what, Sunday, I believe. This also goes right into the Equality Act, which if you don't buy into this stuff, if you don't call people by the right pronoun, if you don't affirm the new sexual norms and gender ideology, you're in trouble. And this will affect small businesses. This will affect charities. It will affect churches. And it appears to be written in a way where there is no recourse. You're not going to a court and having this reversed on you. I don't think I've ever seen anything this bad that has a chance of passing. It's insane where we are. I mentioned the story of a young woman in England by the name of the woman. She was a young woman. She was confused. She had psychological problems at the time. She didn't know who she was. She was trying to discover her identity. She read on the Internet about transsexuals. She went in after a couple of appointments. They were very encouraging to her. There was no other side presented. She ended up taking cross hormones and then having a double mastectomy. Now she regrets it. She's worried about whether she knows she's a woman now and she would like to have children. She's fearful that she will be infertile. She ended up having a body transforming double mastectomy. She just regrets it. They've changed some of the rules in England on this now. But this Dr. Levine has said that most of the time she's not for surgery before 18, but she is for street kids. She's for poor kids who don't have parents. You can imagine if you're a homeless 15 year old, there's a lot going on that either your parents have been rotten parents or you have psychological problems or you might be schizophrenic or you might have other problems for the reason why you're homeless. But to take those people and pray upon them and say they don't really need consent and we're going to get the state to sort of approve their hormones. I mean this is really a grotesque that they would take a poor child and put their infuse their beliefs and their extreme views on these children. It's just obscene. Renn, I know you have to run. I want to ask you, I'm not sure if you're aware of what's going on with the World Economic Forum and the Great Reset, but you're already seeing it happen in companies. There is this merger, if you will, between government NGOs and corporations, these public private partnerships and all based on what are called ESG's or ESG environmental, social and governmental mandates. These big companies are already adopting these things like the Equality Act and critical race theory and they're jamming it down people's throats and it's an end run around the Constitution. Let me ask you, as a libertarian, we complain a lot as conservatives about big tech and what they're doing. But I believe and I know you believe private business should be able to do what they want to do. It's right in the free market. But when these companies are aligned so closely with a party and the government specifically and they're doing an end run around the Constitution, what should we do? Don't use them. Don't buy their stuff. Look, Coca-Cola, both my wife and I are incredibly upset with them right now. They came out with this woke thing about you need to admit that you're white and you're a terrible person. You need to admit that you're aggressive, that you're opinionated and that you will apologize for being white. That's the most grotesque racist thing I've ever heard. That is the World Economic Forum's ESG's. Then you have Bill Gates out there promoting that we need to have critical race theory and math. There was a great professor from Vanderbilt, African American woman who said, you know, that's the most racist thing I've ever heard. That Bill Gates thinks my kids can't learn because of their skin. And then we're going to dumb down math and it's showing your work or having too much emphasis on the correct answer is somehow racist. That whole concept is racist. But that's the world we live in. You've got Black Lives Matter extorting big corporations who are now paying for Black Lives Matter people to go riot in different cities. It's obscene. I know a guy works for one of the big truck companies. He says, oh, yeah, if I give $100, my company will match $300 to Black Lives Matter. And I've seen the people who were in the George Washington Hotel, in the Willard Hotel, $500 a night with plane tickets all paid for by big corporations through Black Lives Matter to get people to riot in DC. The people who almost killed my wife and I were paid for by big corporations. Big US corporations paid their way there. So are there enough Republicans that are at least feeling some sort of responsibility to stand up for the Constitution and do something? I guess the danger is that you have to have some put spa, you've got to have some guts, some courage to stand up because it is a culture out there where even by me, everybody's saying I made transphobic comments yesterday. All I did was ask was whether a minor can consent to this kind of dramatic surgery. Nothing I ever said was hateful. I said nothing hateful about these people. I said nothing hateful about adults who choose to do this. But the culture is out there that is so strong that so many people in office are afraid to speak out and it's getting worse. So there's a handful of us that will speak out in the Senate. There's a handful in the house and we just have to grow our ranks. But we have to resist or it's just going to roll over us and we're going to live in this terrible cancel cultural world where nobody speaks out and everybody's afraid to say anything. Silence in the face of evil is evil itself, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Rand, thank you for being one of those people who will stand up. We will help you in any way we possibly can and that goes for anybody left or right that will stand against this nightmare that is happening. Thank you so much Rand Paul. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program. Nicole Malia-Takis is the Congressperson, brand new in the house from New York. She joins us now to give us the details on the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. Nicole, how are you? Great. Great to be with you. I appreciate you having me on to expose what's actually happening in this bill. Yes. I read a lot of stuff. The media is spending this, of course, as this is all going to help those states that are really in need and all those people that are really in need. I don't read it that way. Can you fill us in with the facts on what is in this bill? Sure. Well, first of all, I think what people need to understand is that there's a trillion dollars left over from the previous package. Congress didn't take the time to really identify where the need is, where we could potentially be shifting resources and ensuring that we came out with something that was tailored and specific to the needs of struggling Americans and small businesses. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I want to make sure I understand this. There's a trillion dollars in some fictitious bank account that they've already approved that hasn't been sent out. That is correct. So, and that's education spending to reopen schools. Some of it is PPP money for small businesses. Oh, my. So, so, so, then the interesting thing enough with the education funding is that the CDC said it would cost 25 billion to reopen schools safely across America. Yet they put 64 billion dollars in the previous package with the majority of it unspent. And as you know, many schools, including those in my city, remain closed. And on top of that, they want to put another 130 billion dollars in this package with 95% of that funding, not being able to be spent until after the after the issue is over. So, so, wait, the estimate is that to reopen schools, it would cost 25 billion, but between the unspent money in the last bill and the new bill, they are sending our schools to 100 billion dollars. That is correct. And so, what I say is only under a mismanaged government or when when Democrats are in control, do things end up costing eight times as much as originally estimated. So, so, what exactly is the what do they say? How is what is the response on 200 million dollars for schools? Well, there's been no response. As a matter of fact, they keep insisting that this is for reopening America's schools. We know that's not the case. Number one, because the estimates were nays of what they're putting into this fund. The second thing is that the money is restricted to be used for over a year. So, it's not emergency funding unless they anticipate that they're not going to reopen schools for a whole other year. So, to give you an example, in New York State, my state, Governor Cuomo did receive four billion dollars for school. Yet many of our schools remain closed throughout the state. I mean, just reopened middle schools in New York City. And as you know, the school's chancellor just resigned about an hour ago. And it's because, I believe, really, because he hasn't been able to successfully roll out the opening of these schools. And like the Catholic schools have in our city. Yeah. May I just recommend for anybody who is struggling to figure out how to open schools? The first thing you have to do is teachers, you're to report back to class on Monday, if not, you're fired. That would be the first thing to do to open up schools. Maybe it's just me. You also in this bill are, we are finding now that the school that there is a $86 billion of our tax dollars to rescue Union pension funds. Yeah. I mean, look, that's in there. There's a lot in there, which is why we call it the Pelosi payoff bill, not the actual COVID relief bill. So, it's not just, you know, bail out for pensions, but you actually have a $3.5 billion going overseas internationally for the global health fund for age, tuberculosis, and malaria. You know, good cause. But the thing is, why is the American, why are the American people picking up 88% of the tab for this international organization's expenditures? Because that's what $3.5 billion equates to. And this is at a time when even our diplomats overseas haven't even had access to the vaccine. And the other thing to show you how bloated this package is, less than 1% goes to vaccine production and distribution. And you ask any Democrat or Republican, local leader or national leader, and they will tell you that the vaccine development distribution is the number one thing to getting us back on track. So the fact that it's only equating for less than 1%. And I had to use Siri, by the way, to figure that out because, you know, calculators and go up to 1.9 trillion dollars. But when you calculate it using Siri or Alexa, you'll find out that's something like 0.7% of the entire package is going to what is said to be the number one priority. That is how bloated this bill is. Nicole, is there, I mean, you're new to Congress. So let me ask you, are you, is it worse than you thought it would be or better or about what you expected? Well, unfortunately, it's, you know, it's a very polarizing and my first month wasn't great. It was a very polarizing first month. You know, the fact that we lost the Senate was not helpful because there's no balance anymore. They changes the rules and this procedure. So that way they don't even need any Republican votes. They changed it from the 60 vote requirement. They change it to 51 votes using what's called a budget reconciliation. And so, you know, they've basically shut us out of this process. And now we know why because they wanted to jam all this pork into this bill. And as a New Yorker, I can say, look, of course, I want my city and state to have money. But I also want accountability. And I don't trust this mayor or this governor. I believe that they'll take the federal funds and they still increase the taxes that are driving New Yorkers out. They're already talking about imposing higher income taxes and stock transfer tax. Mayor de Blasio increases the property tax levy every single year. They just increased tolls on our roadways. And so they've taken the money and they're still going to take from the people. And what's interesting about the way the Democrats set up this formula is that they changed it based on population to now based on unemployment rate. So governors like Governor Cuomo and Gavin Newsom are actually being rewarded for shutting down their economies and driving people out of work. So it's very disheartening to see how this is playing out. But I wasn't a member of the New York state legislature, also in the minority. And so I'm kind of used to these types of games being played. But I'm hopeful that we'll be able to actually work together in a bipartisan fashion on something like the president said he wanted to do, even though he hasn't tried yet. So I was just talking to Bill O'Reilly and he said what was happening in the New York House and assembly was that the Democrats are going after Cuomo not because of any of the scandals, but because he's not radical enough. Do you believe that's true or is the Democrats in New York waking up to Cuomo? No, I think the Democrats in New York are getting a lot of pressure from their constituents who are demanding answers and families who are demanding justice. The governor made a bad mistake by implementing this order that mandated the nursing homes except COVID positive patients. Then he underreported it to the public the number of deaths that were as a result of that. And then he stonewalled the legislature when they tried to get answers. And then his own chief of staff admitted that they were covering up the whole thing simply because they didn't want the Department of Justice to gain access to this information. Then he bullied one of the Democratic Assembly members who stood up to him because his uncle died in a nursing home. So I think they're getting very tired of the governor's antics. Thousands of New Yorkers have actually joined me in adding their name at enough Cuomo.com to send a message that they want the governor to resign. And this has only been exacerbated now by the fact that a young woman who is part of his administration has come forward with sexual harassment claims. So I think the Democrats really are starting to get tired of the governor. He's been a governor for three years, three terms. He does use bullying tactics to get what he wants. He is vindictive. And I think that he's out doing his welcome both with the other Democrats in the state but also with the people which is why his poll numbers have just been dropped so much over the last month. So with him and De Blasio, and I would love to know this in California as well, but you are from New York so you might have a good handle on New York. With Cuomo and De Blasio, the wreckage that has been done with these policies, especially because of COVID, are people just wanting to get rid of them or are they tying them also to the policies that are so damaging? Well, they are tying them to their policies because they're the ones who put forward these arbitrary restrictions, these mandated shutdowns that have hurt our local economy that have led to thousands of people losing their jobs that have put small businesses, people's livelihoods out in schools, the parents, teachers and students that I speak to want to go back to school. And that is very upsetting. Children don't have school athletics anymore, which is another big issue. And there's not a lot of these restrictions that they put in place lacked common sense. You can go to the gym but you can't go to the yoga studio. You can go to an ice skating pavilion and skate but you can't have hockey leagues. It doesn't make any sense. And so there's a lot of frustration. New York City was treated differently than the rest of the state. The rest of the state is at 50% capacity for indoor dining. New York City was shut down for so long. And finally, we got 25%. I kept pushing. We got more now at 35% inching up toward 50%. But why are we being treated differently than the rest of the state? So people are upset about this. They see that the governor and the mayor had way too much power. And the governor's power needs to be rescinded. I've said that repeatedly. I've been saying that for months and the Democrats keep dragging their feet. But they finally have to go and do it and take back their power as a equal branch of government and work to just reopen this economy and get children back to school and get people back to work. I have to tell you, I think between what companies have discovered with Zoom and virtual work, etc. And the absolute devastation that has been done to Manhattan and your district in southern Brooklyn and Staten Island. I don't, and I know you won't agree with this, I'm sure. But I don't see New York City ever recovering to the city that it once was, at least for a decade. How are you? How is that area going to pay for all of the services that it needs and have promised when everybody's moving away? Companies are shutting down. You're absolutely right about the policies that have been put in place that are driving people out. I do have hope that New York City will recover, that we do have a mayor's race. And I'm hoping that somebody who will be, you know, really, really try to roll back some of this stuff that the mayor did. I mean, look, whether it be defunding the police, which was a completely ridiculous idea, it's led to crime skyrocketing. We have a lot of mismanagement, a lot of mismanagement of our tax dollars, which is why I'm so concerned with billions more coming to New York. But I do believe that it's up to the people. The people have to be vocal, they have to complain. You know, I ran for Mayor of New York City in 2017. I think we'd be in a better position had I won that election. Unfortunately, this mayor spends more and more money and the problems get worse and worse. So that is the, you know, definition of mismanagement. I think there's a lot of things we could be doing differently to tackle our homeless crisis, to make sure our streets are safer, to make sure that our trains are running, to make sure that our children are getting a good education in person. You know, these are things that I think, unfortunately, government has to be afraid from the basics of what they're supposed to be doing, right? People expect you to keep them safe, give their kids a good education, make sure traffic is flowing, the trains are running on time, making sure that there's an environment where jobs can grow. And unfortunately, they've strayed into all sorts of areas. They got to get back to the basics. And that's what I'm going to be pushing for and speaking out for both here in Washington and when I'm back home in New York City. Thank you so much. Congresswoman Nicole Melea Takis from New York. Thanks for checking in with us. I appreciate it. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program. And don't forget, great hugs on iTunes. Welcome to the Glenn Beck program. It is Friday. I want to tell you about the podcast that comes out tomorrow with Tulsi Gabbard. It is really fascinating. It really is. Yeah, this fascinating. But I think it's important that we, we cover something that you just said. And why do you have this? Sometimes you say these things and they're so profound in the moment. You are such a jerk. What are you? Because of just, you know, you're so rapid fire with so many great moments. And then we miss a jam. And I think the audience may have, may have missed a jam just a few moments ago. And I think the audience wants to settle in, clear your mind. What do you have? And just contemplate this brilliant analysis by Glenn Beck. Sausages, desserts, really yummy cut with a spoon style forks. You'll say 50. What exactly is a cut like a spoon style fork? I know. You know what that is? The copy says cut with a fork, but the actual term for four stakes is cut with a spoon. And there's only a, I was thinking for a sake spoon, not for can I forgot about the word steak. Right. No, and it's an Omaha steak commercial. So why would you remember the word steak? But so are you, I just want to clarify here. Are you cutting shut up? Are you cutting the fork with a spoon? Yes. Can we hear it one more time? I'm sorry Sarah. I just want to cut with a spoon style fork. So is it a fork that cuts like a spoon? Yes. Or are you cutting? You know, you did nothing. I mean, just, there's a reason they gave that to you in 2020. Yeah, I'm just holding up the Hall of Fame award. Radio Hall of Fame. Bring your back. Bring your back. Bring that one out. Hold on. Let me press this button. The spoon style for God. Was that part of your acceptance speech? Did you cut a spoon with a word such a jerk look? I don't know how I got this job. I don't know how I keep this job. I really don't. I listen to other shows. Yeah. I know how talented everybody else is. I listen and I'm like, they don't make any mistakes. They don't say, God. Never. They would never say, they'd never say this cut with a spoon style fork. I know that I listen I don't know how they do that. I know. I must have had pictures of somebody that I never took, nor did I know I have. I thought something and it was in like a pocket of some used jacket or something and it was like. He's got that jacket. You should put them on the air. The Lord is going to use it. I don't know what was in the jacket. I don't even know what jacket it was. I just don't understand why you would need a spoon style fork. It's just use a fork or a shut off. Why would you style your fork out of a spoon? All right. They're too different utensils. Separate your cutleries, all we're trying to say here. It's such a jerk. Wait, what's that? What is that award again? Radio Hall of Fame. Wow. I mean, that's a... What an amazing achievement. Again, for you. I had pictures of somebody in a jacket I don't own. Here's the thing. Could we go back to the show, please? Cut with a spoon style forks. Did you talk to Tom together about the spoon style forks? You know what's so weird? I am more comfortable with this than if you were actually heaping praise on me. If you were saying, you're a great... I would rather have you point this out. That's how sad my life is. Surprisingly enough, I'm more comfortable with it too. I don't you mean that. You feel awkward when people say positive things about you? Which is really nice because it doesn't happen. At least very often. I've removed myself from that position consistently throughout my entire life. Well, here's a great thing. You're standing in my shadow for just the last 25 years. I know. What does that say? What does that say about me? No, it's true. It's depressing when I think about it. So I try to drink a lot. Well, I can't drink anymore. So think how I feel."
