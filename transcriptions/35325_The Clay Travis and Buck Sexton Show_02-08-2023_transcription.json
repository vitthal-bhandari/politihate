    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and bucks X 10 show podcast. Hey everybody. Welcome back to the clay Travis and bucks X 10 show it's been a heck of a day today and Look, I do think it's worth noting once again that the timing of all of this is incredibly suspicious To believe it's a coincidence that on the same day What may be the most clear evidence of a Biden bribery scheme from when he was vice president same day that the fbi informant Information is seen by republican members of the oversight committee. They drop this federal indictment against uh, donald trump very hard for a lot of us to think that this is Just happenstance right it's very difficult thing very difficult for us to understand Um because it's not I think that's really what it goes. I think it's I think that they figured you know what it's go time because before the narrative can really fully uh formulate about The biden crime family. I mean, I truly believe how could you not? That the bidens were accepting bribes I truly believe that hunter biden knew he was getting paid off for at least the perception of favored access to his dad who was then vice president and That was the whole scheme. So that means he is a corrupted person And it is impossible for the american people to expect that joe biden is Well, honorable or ethical right? I mean here is he was asked about this uh by the white house press corps some of the white house press corps And his response shows That he thinks he can get away with treating this whole thing like it's a joke play clip one Congresswoman, man, see may sisters standing evidence That the item by the way, you sold out the country do you have a response to congressional republicans? Where's the money? I'm joker mr. President to a point in molar So It's all a big joke. That's all funny It's it's just uh, it's just hilarious. It's all malarkey Well, okay um How exactly are we supposed to explain millions of dollars? going to Hunter biden what what was it for you've seen the new photos? There's like 9 000 more photos that have been released of hunter biden doing, you know, just the stuff that he does And and what you see is because joe biden is actually so corrupt And I know maybe it seems like how could you really? Pull these things together. How why why would I make the case that these things there's some similarity because? He is so corrupt Uh, it is not surprising. It should not be surprising to anyone That he's willing to do effectively anything any bidding on the left. He's a compromised person Joe biden does not have an ethical core He is a pass through for the desires of the marxist Lunatics who now run the democrat party and who are the ethos of the democrat party So for example, I mean yesterday He was out there saying That it's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children terrifying families And criminalizing doctors they're not anybody else's kids. They're all our kids He's he's pulling think about this old man joe biden who is you know, and out of touch Uh, you know white guy super senior citizen Right. He's he's now playing the oh, he's so tight with the lgbtqia plus activist community This is the guy who we're all supposed to think oh, oh, yeah, he's all about transgender surgery for 12 year olds That's that's really important. He's pushing hateful bills The same guy I know it seems like oh, but what about the the documents and and the the payoffs and You know all the other things we were talking about today, but you have to understand You're seeing this across the board joe biden Is a representative of what the left has become And he has no there is no moral compass. There is no filter. So you're getting it. He is a pass through he is a vessel And this is why when they say things like criminalizing doctors targeting transgender children um You know We're trying to stop in some states in this country Kids from making a horrific decision A horrific decision that could ruin their lives When they're not capable of making that decision and let's just really call it what it is These are kids who need Psychological counseling and help and support they do not need puberty blockers and you know removal of genitalia surgery joe biden 80 year old joe biden is an advocate for this stuff now He is saying it is it is evil. It is wrong That they're trying to stop these procedures from happening. You know how many medical procedures can you think of Where you see it and you say to yourself that is awful Well, the more you learn about what they're doing to people with these surgeries and I mean when you see the photos And learn about the long-term complications you realize this is Self mutilation that is what is going on some of us don't really give a damn about what they say on msnbc Or what delusions the new york times editorial board lives in Some of us don't want to be subjected to the psychological fashions of the left that make them think that this kind of process doing these things to kids is Like a core human right or something Somehow for all of human history have existed didn't need to do this and now suddenly it's it's the the new civil rights struggle of our era You know they they removed skin from someone's arm to create a fake male genitalia. We're supposed to think this is normal This is a good idea There was a reporter who asked biden as well. She she said I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl Texas Can I speak so what a transgender girl? So that's a male thinks he's female right? It's it's really hard to know a transgender girl in texas who told me they're afraid And they're considering leaving not just their state, but the country Why do you think this is happening? So I want everyone to understand what's really going on here. Yeah, I know we've talked about the trump documents a lot We understand they're weaponizing the doj also understand they're they're coming through your children. That is reality And They're setting it up so that anybody who doesn't think that some kind of gender mutilation sure surgery Remember we're talking about kids here minors not even getting into the adult portion of this although we could do that too uh They're setting it up so that if you think That kids should have to wait until they're adults before these decisions are made You are engaged in a fear campaign that may make them leave the country. Let me tell you this right now No person of any sense is going to leave the united states Because their trans child Isn't getting the full gender surgery that they want But there are some really crazy people running around. There are some people who are um Completely deluded And joe biden is if not one of them certainly willing to speak on their behalf So i'm trying to say is that this is all tied together the demonization of the unvaxed by joe biden Their fault They're the ones, you know with his angry beaty little eyes shouting at everybody They're killing people because they don't want to get the shot all a total lie A provable and obvious lie. He is a man with no soul He has sold his soul. He sold that for that old corvette and a beach house and a presidency That was handed to him by a party Who doesn't care that he has dementia? Who doesn't care that he hasn't had an original or brave thought in his entire life? They don't care So all of this ties together The same man who was Sending his doj on this mission of trump destruction And with it The shredding of our republic and our constitutional freedoms Is the same man Who had his son running around as the bag man collecting millions for the family? Gotta take care of pop 10 for the big guy And is the same man who demonized the unvaxed because that was what his party demanded even if The vaccine had worked really well What he did was awful, right? I mean, you shouldn't be saying that people who are uncertain about an experimental but the vaccine Didn't stop the spread at all at all zero zero And yet Here we are No consequences for him whatsoever And now he's advocating the the old man who ran as a uniter of the country somebody who would bring America together um he Tells everybody that that's the plan and then he gets into office and he's he is more divisive than barakobama was He is more destructive and I know some might say well barakobama really pushed Further faster and then biden is just finishing the job at some level. Okay, but I think you could you could see that joe biden has been in his first term a A president who is more destructive of any foundational unity in this country. Look what he's done with the doj You know, obama. I had a lot of problems with obama Obama didn't have the doj locking up mid romney. He did have the irs going after tea party groups I'm not I remember but i'm just saying I mean this is This is unprecedented truly unprecedented stuff And it's all rooted in lies and it's all rooted in cowardice And I know that a lot of people say oh joe biden's not calling the shots Yeah, but that's always been that has always been the point He's doing exactly what he was told to do, you know He is the prison guard who is beating the inmates who knows they're innocent You know, he's the gulag prison guard that knows that this is all a sham But he just he wants his peace. He wants his cut. He wants to stay where he is Otherwise we think about this as he had has he done anything to make the country feel like We are one country since he came into office one thing I mean, yeah right now he's prosecuting his chief political rival But if you step back and look at a little bit more what you can see is Everything he has done has been meant to divide the country and to undermine foundational Not just freedoms, which of course he's done but foundational conceptions of What this country really is erroding our southern border destroying our sovereignty letting our cities turn into violent chaotic hellholes Spending us into oblivion and now prosecuting his chief political rival This is the country we live in now. It's it's tough stuff. I I'm not Not in a position to soft battle this and I don't think it will be right to I we're heading of into a very dark period for the country What can we do? Well, we have to remember who we are what we're all about and not lose sight of the truth in this process not lose sight of Who what it is that we're trying to fight for the country that we want I don't want a country where we can lock up our political rivals to I want a country where we all agree Nobody does that but that's not what we have now So we figure out what those next steps will be Or let's talk about something positive for a second here.

These are our neighbors It's cruel and it's callous or somebody else's kids. They're all our kids Joe bines is a disgusting person just to be very clear a a moral reprobate reprobate a he is uh spiritually grotesque Notice he does the what's wrong that people are being fired for being gay with hold on where is that happening? And who's even talking about that? But then he connects that He connects that to Kids getting transgender surgery. Well, hold on. Hold on a second These things have nothing to do with each other Absolutely, there is nothing to do one has nothing to do with the other. Why is he putting him together? Creating a false narrative of moral blackmail so that parents who go hold on a second Why is my school telling my 10 year old that he's a she and now they're a therapist that want to refer him for medical treatment That can never be reversed. Hold on. It's like oh Well, you're like one of those bigots You probably think that people should be you know fired from their job because of of their sexual orientations like Wait, no one has nothing to do with the other One is just why are we doing gender mutilation of children? But see see what Joe Biden does see how dishonest he is And and I know today's a day we're all spending all this time talking about Um, the weaponization of doj and what he's doing to his political rivals Yes, of course, but i'm showing you this man has no core He will let donald he wants donald trump to go to prison He wants his chief political rival. He doesn't care what this does to the country. He thinks he's the good guy in all this The same guy who thinks you're a monster if you don't want uh, little kids Getting puberty blockers thinks that donald trump should rot in prison for the rest of his life That is what we're dealing with here So I I think it's important to understand what the full parameters are and you know, I don't even have time to get to this today but you have a judge in washington a judge in washington has ordered well, I guess I do a little time to get to it a female only spa with compulsory nudity To admit transgender women with penises After the owner said the facility was for biological women only a pre op trans activist Complained and sued and a judge cited if you're an all women spa The guy with the penis has to be able to sit next to you because he says she he says he's a woman A judge just ruled that It's all it's all tied in This is soullessness. This is moral corruption. This is madness This is the biden regime And I think it's necessary to understand What it is that we are facing This is not just a political squabble. We are entering a period where spiritual warfare is what we need to be thinking about Because that's what's underway right now. There is a fight for the soul of a nation that is happening right now And the other side Are acting in a fashion that is demonic And they think they're with the angels So you have to understand this they're not going to stop. They don't feel guilty. They don't feel bad about any of this No quite the contrary We'll talk to Julie Kelly about this in just a second The tunnel to towers foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices america's greatest heroes have made for us Heroes like marine core corporal sath rasmuson sath was one of five marines killed in a training accident when his osprey helicopter crashed in california He was just 21 years old seth is survived by his wife and high school sweetheart avry and their infant son Tunnel to towers reached out to avry within days of seth's death to tell her she would receive a mortgage free home Avry didn't have to worry about where she and her son were going to live or how she would pay for it because of financial security and support Provided by ton of the towers ton of the towers has helped over 1000 military and first responder families navigate the worst of times by removing the burden of a mortgage payment Support our nation's heroes and their families donate to ton of the towers foundation Please because we do so every month you can join us in this t2t.org. That's t the number two t.org All right, welcome back to clay and buck We've been having julie kelly on now for well really the whole time clay and i've been doing this show together But stretching back for months. She was telling us that a federal indictment of donald trump was coming in fact She said at one point it was a hundred percent and then more recently a hundred and ten percent And now we know that prediction Unfortunately for the republic but that prediction was Accurate julie kelly is the author of january 6 a book i recommend to all of you and also a writer for american greatness She joins us now Julie You're right. Let me just ask you is there any surprise So far in how exactly the charters have been laid out or how this has gone down No, not so much related to the charges for classified documents what i find pretty surprising and actually very shady Is the fact that d oj and then jac smith who took over this investigation in november of 2022 Litigated this entire case behind the scenes closed doors grand jury in washington dc They then last month Basically moved all of it to florida realizing they had a venue problem Or i think they got very favorable repressant rulings by the chief judge arrel holland dc Who is an obama appointed judge? And a breeze in part as an in court She does not try to hide her contempt for donald trump So they basically conducted the entire investigation washington dc Then it looks like last month moved it to dc And the new york times reported all they had to do was read to a grand jury in florida The transcripts of what had happened in washington dc So it doesn't even look like the same process unfolded in the southern in in miami district that it did in washington dc if that's a new standard of justice That should alarm people Across the spectrum So it looks like this grand jury in miami kind of thrown together read whatever happened in dc came down with the seven counts Um, and of course it as you have reported donald trump will be arranged in miami on tuesday Wait, wait, i'm sorry julie. Can you just so the the grand jury in miami was read Explain a little more was read what happened in dc and made the determination based off of that That's why it looks like boc that is with the new york times Was recording and that was the first outlet that disclosed this florida grand jury All of the proceedings have been happening in dc before a grand jury grand jury in washington dc Then all of a sudden the new york times reports this week that there's a grand jury that was impaneled in may And apparently they've been hearing a few witnesses But one expert said oh, this is no big deal all they do is take all the transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in washington And they read it out to the grand jury in miami and that's how they determine their charges That sounds pretty shady don't you think i'm not a lawyer But uh, it's really beyond the pail because everyone sort of assumed that these charges would come out of the dc district court And they suddenly changed it to miami realizing that any of the alleged crimes, especially the obstruction count Would have happened in pombeach at marallago So this will probably be pretty good evidence for um team trump To uh to accuse the prosecutors of misconduct which were already hearing Some rumblings about um, but this is not it does not appear to be a normal procedure, especially in a historical case The first federal charges ever against a uh, a former president So julie you saw this coming Obviously and uh and told us that this was going to happen i wanted to get your take on Where this is going next what what do you see because i've just seen from twitter and i mean this is my belief as well This isn't even though there are more indictments coming But this isn't even the last of the federal indictments is that how you see it and and what's going to happen if it plays out As you think it will well This is going to be nothing compared to the multi count felony criminal indictment that jax myth Will ultimately issue related to trump's uh role in the events of january 6 As we talked about for a long time, and that's going to be the big bomb shell Um, this i think people are kind of like, okay. Well, krest by documents. Did we see them? He obstructed? This is not as As dangerous to donald trump as the counts that it will be coming down from jax myth. He's took over two investigations the krest by documents and january 6 So potential counts in that indictment bop could be seditious conspiracy as we've talked about obstruction of an official proceeding which seems pretty certain Conspiring to obstruct congress tampering with evidence, etc The seditious conspiracy one is a big one though. That is what 10 members of eopepers and proud boys have been convicted on That is sort of tantamount to treason It's no americans have ever been convicted of it until the january 6 prosecution Of course not a difficult guilty plea to get in washington dc But that i believe is the direction where jax smith is now moving So you will have dual criminal cases court cases Happening at the same time one in florida one in washington dc while donald trump is trying to run for president This is what the biden garland wiesomonoco Doj wants to happen And unfortunately for america that is exactly what will happen We're speaking to julie kelly author of january 6 how democrats use the capital protest to launch a war on terror Against the political right julie There I think one part of this everyone understands right now that this is election interference effectively this is meant to Already skew the election Whoever whether trump is the nominee or not. I mean looks like based on the polls he's going to be but they're interfering in the 2024 presidential election with this but one piece of this that I think it's it's hard for um a lot of us, you know, I self included two-time trump voters who celebrated his his presidency To just comprehend Do they do they really think they're going to be able to lock him up in a prison and that people will just be okay with that? Do you think do you think their eventual goal is to put him in a cell or is joe biden Going to maybe step in and commute the sentence or something. What do you think happens? It's such a great question. I don't know except for the fact that yes They do want donald trump in hanckuff. They do want him in prison The democratic base they have ratcheted these half of our country Up to this point of bloodlust that is really sort of terrifying Um, but this is exactly what people like lisa monaco the deputy attorney general Long time obama loyalist. She was in on the russia collusion hoax. She is running the department of justice This is a fulfillment of their what now seven year Criminal prosecution into donald trump trying to get him in hanckuff and get him in jail and they want to do this Um, not just for political reasons But because they this is a personal personal professional mission for these people at the d oj and in the biden regime and If they were to do this, what do they think the reaction of the american people will be about institutions like the d oj? I mean this everyone saying this is you know third world dictator banana republic Defeat your opposition by throwing them in a cell somewhere I if someone tells me that's how they feel. I have to look at them and say yeah, that is how this feels They want us to feel that way. They are so not drunk with power But they are authoritarian They want people to realize that they have this Authorian power that they will use it to crush their political opponents and that there's nothing we can do about it Box they want us to realize the power that they have that they have no boundaries They have no oversight by congress They have no guardrails in federal courts like the dc district court They get whatever they want they bring these cases before dc juries made up of voters in a city that's almost 100 percent democrats They know they're going to get their way. They know the only thing we can do is complain about it right harsh letters You know make threats The congress etc etc impeachment that's not going to happen They want us to realize the power that they have And that they will use it to crush us everyone from Donald trump to his his lawyers his close associates Down to the indiana mima who walked through the capital for 10 minutes with the maga hat on They love this they don't want to pretend that they're that you know, this is rule of law and constitution even though they say that they are good little marxis and They they are enjoying every minute of this. They don't care what it does to country or the constitution What do you think july because you know you you've been very close to all this because you've seen um, the machinery of destruction that the dc Judicial system became with regard to january six defendants. I mean there are the fact that there are people that spent You know 18 months in solitary confinement in the united states for non-violent crimes people who weren't armed who did nothing violent who didn't even destroy property That should shock the conscience of all americans it happened it happened under joe biden who poses as this Grandfatherly united when really he's the most divine. I actually would argue now. He's more divisive than uh, than brock obama was I think joe biden is in a league of his own And What do you think we what do you think we can do about this like what when you saw this up close and personal? I think you understand the mentality of the other side What's the proper way to respond? You know back. I wish I knew it's very easy to despair and I try not to allow myself to get to that point when i'm covering these hearings and especially these jury trials What these prosecutors and fbi investigators are allowed to get away within court? These juries who are so partisan Admitting in a jury selection process that they are democrats that they consider these people insurrectionists and traitors You know that they attend left wing demonstrations in washington dc and they are still seated on these On these jury panels. Um, I just don't know. I mean, you know, we have a very slim majority in congress right now Uh republicans in the senate have been silent for the most part as this has uh has gone on And so I really I I don't know I mean I guess the best we can do is keep exposing who these people are what they're keeping people love And you know just hope for the best for our country But I agree with you joe biden is a Contemptable man. I think he's probably he is the worst person to ever sit in the white house on every single level And he has put people around him who are just as bad as he is including mary carlin Who is to your point kind of puts on the grandfather lee. I'm here rule of law. No, he's not Uh, you know these people there's only one more time Yeah partas and hacks across the board Um january six how democrats use the capital protest to launch a war on terror against the political right? That's julie's book if you want to understand the current moment Knowing the history of how we got here as it's told in that book is uh, well worth the read julie Thank you so much as always and also you were right.
