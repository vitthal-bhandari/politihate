    "text": " Folks, here's a question for you. Is AARP really a seniors group or have they become a marketing arm of massive insurance companies? A lot of people want to ask that question. As Senator Rand Paul recently pointed out, UnitedHealthcare pays AARP roughly $800 million per year. This explains why AARP supported the Inflation Reduction Act, which had nothing to do with inflation, but did give billions of tax dollars to big corporations. If you're a senior citizen, it's time to drop AARP and instead join the conservative alternative, A-Mac, the Association of Mature American Citizens. They're fighting every day to pass common-sense policies for American seniors. They're working to preserve Social Security and Medicare past health care transparency, secure election integrity, and protect our children and grandchildren from the left's dangerous agenda. Join me and more than 2 million Americans nationwide and become an A-Mac member today for as little as a dollar a month. How much do you do that? You go to amac.us slash justnews. I'm A-Mac, A-M-A-C dot U-S slash justnews. Good evening America and welcome to this. Just the news, Real Americans Voice Special Report, Gender Identity, Biden Redefined Sex and Schools. I'm your host, John Solomon, tonight in partnership with our sponsor Heritage Action for America. We're going to explore the Biden administration's efforts to overhaul Title IX. Now, that's the landmark regulation that outlaws discrimination in education based on biological sex. But the Biden administration now wants to change the definition of sex to also include sexual orientation and gender identity. In a nutshell, the proposed rule changes from the U.S. Education Department will change how sexual harassment and discrimination is defined and how educational institutions must respond in the future. Additionally, the rule changes will likely include new protections for students who identify as transgender. Over the course of the next hour, we'll be joined by lawmakers, government officials, activists, and female athletes to explore what exactly these rule changes mean for you as a parent and how they can impact your child's experience. In the classroom and on the playing field. And here to kick things off is an expert on Title IX, Sarah partial Perry. She serves as a senior legal fellow at the Me Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation. Sarah, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. It's great to have you. Now, before we get started, you've really worked in this area for a long time. Can you give us a brief overview of your extensive background? Sure, I was senior counsel to the assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education under the Trump administration. And our office was tasked with drafting the interpretive guidance on Title IX after the boss versus Clayton County decision. That was the opinion from the Supreme Court in 2020 that expanded sex harassment and sex discrimination in the workplace to include gender identity discrimination. And so that was a needle that we had to thread there. I think we did so exceptionally well. We also developed a new rule to ensure due process protections for both accused and accuser in sexual harassment and sexual violence cases. And those were due process protections like the right to call counsel, the right to be cross examined, the right to submit evidence. So we had both sides of the Title IX debate front and center and much of the work that we did. And we're able to, I believe, really make America's classrooms safer at the K through 12 and at the collegiate level for biological men and women. Yeah, so you leave behind a good plan after the Supreme Court ruling, then the Biden administration comes in. And now they're tinkering. In fact, it's probably a little bit more than Tigray. It's a pretty big overhaul. What exactly is the Biden administration trying to do to Title IX right now? Well, actually on both those issues, we've just discussed the sexual harassment and sexual assault regulations. They are going to be rolled back so that there is a guilty until proven innocent assumption, removing all of the abilities that we put into place to make these sort of quasi judicial proceedings and to divest government bureaucrats with too much power invested in one Title IX investigator on college campuses. And I think more consequently for the athletes that are going to be on the program, they propose to expand the definition of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. And then the S.H.I.E.P. has Title IX is written on a sex binary and it uses language like men and women, boys and girls, each or both. It's very clearly the case that Title IX, which dates back to 1972, we're getting ready to celebrate the 50th anniversary. It's going to have a significant impact on sex programs, sex-based programs, and sex equality in education. Yeah, these are pretty monumental changes. If you're a parent or you're a student and you're worried about this, what is the next part of the process? What should we be watching for over the next several weeks and months? Well, that's a great question. I am the parent of three teenagers, and I've had to actually simplify this for them as well so that they know that there might be a very impactful change coming. Currently, the rule is with the Office for Management and Budget as part of the Administrative Review under federal law that these new regulations take from each federal agency. OMB is the last stop before a rubber stamp of approval. Once that happens, it will be sent back to the Department of Education to be published in the federal register. And when that happens, we will notice an opening for notice and comment, 30 days at a minimum, for everyone in the country to submit their concerns, their questions, their frustration at this particular role. And we're hoping that as soon as that public portal goes live, if we're not able to slow it down or stop it at the OMB stage, that we can really force this administration to reconsider its efforts to fundamentally redefine sex in education. Yeah, this is a big deal. Now, a lot of times when changes occur and watching this because there's a problem, but was there any indication that the Trump era Title IX policies were not working? No, there weren't at all, in fact, on either forefront, whether it was the Title IX rule that we instituted on the college campus sexual assault proceedings or whether or not it was the fundamental application of sex-based distinctions under Title IX in K through 12 and higher education. None of those were subjected to any criticism whatsoever, that there were particular problems, and that's actually something that we've raised in these OMB meetings indicating that there's no proof and no even statement from the Department of Education justifying such a significant overhaul on two different aspects of Title IX, which has worked to achieve its outcome. Sexual equality, men and women in education for 50 years. So it's not only not needed, it actually complicates the waters on something that's been working very, very well for 50 years. Yeah, so we got about 45 seconds left. If there was nothing broken with the rule, what's really going on with the Biden, Mr. Why are they making these changes? I think it's very obviously a craven political attempt to garner capital before the elections in November. I think it's very clear that there's going to be quite a bit of bloodshed during midterms, and I do think that this is an attempt to galvanize a very left-wing progressive political base before it happens, and we are very, very anxious to make sure that women are not used as political props, and that Title IX continues to be applied the way it was always intended to be. Yeah, so important. Just real quickly, if they want to follow the work you're doing, Sarah, what's the best way to stay in touch with you and the Heritage Foundation? You can find all my writings at heritage.org, or you can follow me on Twitter at SarahPPerry. That's such an important issue. We're going to be tracking this all through the night and all through the rest of this year. Sarah, thank you so much for your time today. Thanks for having me. Folks, when we come back, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudson will be here to discuss the initiative he is leading with 15 other states. To weaken the federal government's attempt to dismantle Title IX, stay tuned. We'll be right back after these commercial measures. If you've been a longtime listener of my podcast, you know already that gun safety is very important to me. Muzzle stick is helping gun owners like me enhance gun safety with their big brightly colored chamber and barrel flags. If someone were to hand you a firearm with a muzzle stick chamber flag in it, you'd be able to identify it very quickly as unloaded. Muzzle stick believes that every unloaded firearm should be unloaded, the chamber filled, and clearly marked with a flag. Do you know someone who keeps a loaded gun out of the safe for personal protection? Muzzle stick also makes bright barrel flags that clearly mark guns as loaded. While muzzle stick doesn't recommend keeping a loaded firearm, the reality is that some firearms owners do. Having a firearm marked loaded clearly lets others around you that may not have that fire handling experience. Know its status and it's there for something they would not want to handle without experience. Muzzle stick is not intended to replace the rules of firearm safety. It offers firearms rapid clear identification which could result in saved lives. With the holidays right around the corner now is the perfect time to stuff your friends and family stockings with muzzle stick chamber and barrel flags just because you care. Head over to muzzle stick m-u-z-l-s-t-i-k.com today to place your order. That's muzzle stick m-u-z-l-s-t-i-k.com today. After all, you only have one life to live.

Now these proposed changes by the Biden administration to Title IX are already receiving pretty good pushback from parents and government officials, including our next guest, the Montana Attorney General Austin Knudson who has put together a remarkable coalition to oppose them. General Knudson, great to have you on the show today. You bet. Thanks for having me. So you have put together this 15 state coalition to push back on the Biden administration. They don't mess with that online in the way you're thinking of doing it. What is the genesis of this and what's the reaction meant to it? Well, the genesis is you've got the Biden administration trying to step in here and roll back. What is a really good rule? The Trump administration in May of 2020 came in and did a formal rulemaking which had never been done before. This stuff had always been done just informally and with guidelines out of the education department. The Trump administration came in and actually put in due process for allegations of sexual harassment, sexual abuse at schools, whether that's universities or whether that's and in K through 12 public schools. That has never been done before and they're great constitutional due process guidelines that they were put in place and the Biden administration now wants to come in, take all that out, do an informal rulemaking, roll all that back and go back largely to the way it was under the Obama administration which was largely no due process Kangaroo courts. And that's the concern here. Yeah, and we've seen the courts in some cases really roll back certain actions that were taken against students that were just simply unwarranted because of that sort of Kangaroo court mentality. Obviously most of the attention has been focused on the changes for transgender athletes competing against female biological females but a lot of the due process is what most parents are concerned about, right? There's a very big concern that if an allegation comes out that both sides the victim and that the accused get that sort of due process and fairness and equal treatment, why would the Biden administration want to take that away? I think it's pandering to their base but look John, it's like this. Imagine if the Biden administration put out guidelines today to every criminal prosecutor in the country that said, hey, you know what, you're no longer going to have due process for accused. You're no longer going to provide a constitutional right to a lawyer. You know what, the prosecutor is also going to act as the judge and the jury against the accused. That's crazy but that's exactly what the Obama administration did under Title IX and that was that was actually headed up by then Vice President Biden, right? And that's what they're proposing to go back to now. That's literally what they were pushing in 2016 and that's what the Biden administration wants to do now. They want to throw out due process. We have due process in a constitution for reason in this country. The accused have rights as well and the system works through and if you're found guilty, well, then you're guilty. But you are innocent until presumed innocent until you are found guilty in this country and that's very important and that's what we're trying to protect here. Yeah and in education environments, there can be lots of emotion, a lot of things go on and that's why that due process is there for that protection. Now you and your group wrote a letter to Captain Layman, the assistant secretary of the US Department of Education. You mentioned some very interesting. You pointed out that she was the one doing this back in Obama. Now she's back for round two with Biden now. What do you think is driving her? What is her role in this foot popping that's been going on? Well, she's clearly biased. She clearly has an agenda here and whether it's her personal agenda or as I said, whether it's coming from President Biden, you know, he was in charge of this under the Obama administration. I think the result is the same. You've got an official in place here who's got a clear flagrant conflict of interest. She was involved in this rulemaking before. She needs to recuse herself and remove herself from this process right now because she's not being unbiased and that's what we need here. So she she should step aside. Yeah, that was a really important part of the letter that I think a lot of people have grasped onto. Now, if this were to get through, if the administration were to come forward, does your coalition of 15 states, do you take the next step? You go exercise those federalism, those state rights and you do you super potentially go to court to try to block what's going to happen here? Absolutely. That's not a discussion that we've had formally among the states, but I can tell you that certainly what Montana will do. I have no trouble believing that a lot of our sister states will join us in that. This is too important to to important of an issue. Title IX was put in place to protect all female sports. I mean, that was that was one of the abject goals of it. And what this new rule will do, it'll it'll be a real hindrance to to women's sports. It's also going to have serious implications when you start talking about education that's being taught to your kids. And we've seen those controversies coming out of Florida. Right. You've seen those countries in a couple other states and you've seen states step up and pass their own legislation to combat this. So yeah, we are absolutely prepared to pursue the administration if they go forward with this. And I think that's very likely. Yeah, that's something we're going to definitely be watching. We got about 90 seconds left. I want to ask this title line change is part of a larger culture war that's been going out in America. And we've seen it now play out with the reaction against Disney, the reaction against the fund the police, the reaction against critical race theory in schools. And now this entitled line in women athletics. Do you think the tide is turning? Do you think the base of America, middle America, the good Montanans of the world, are have sent a large enough message to Washington now that, hey, you keep going down this path, we're fighting back. It's not a free pass anymore. Are we at that tipping point, you think? I think the sleeping giant has been walking up, John, I don't think the Biden administration is listening. I think they're going to push forward regardless. I mean, we've seen whether it's on this issue, on energy issues, on foreign policy, they're interested in pandering to their coastal elite. So I don't think they're going to stop what they're doing. But look, it's issues like this. Joe Biden has single-handedly been the best proponent for school choice in this country that we've had in probably 30 years. You've got a lot of parents who are now paying attention. They're going, whoa, what's going on with our schools, what's coming out of the federal education department. And that's the reason that we're seeing such a push for school choice in this country. So there's upside to this too. But unfortunately, I just don't see the administration backing off of these radical policies. I think they're just going to keep pushing forward with them. Yeah, well, that's what makes the great work that you and your other attorneys general in this country have been doing. They've been fighting in the courts and reversing a lot of things that it turned out to be unlawful. And I think we have another battle on our hands with Saddle Line General Caduce is an honor to have you on the show today. Thanks for all the work you're doing. Hey, you bet. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. All right, folks. When we come back, we'll be joined by Kansas State. Kansas State Senator Renee Erickson. Stay tuned. We have a lot more to discuss about the Saddle Line. Why does this commercial break? When I'm away, I trust my home security system to keep criminals out. But this blew me away. A cop buddy warned me about an even worse crime they're seeing. It's called house stealing. And I could already be a victim and not know it. Criminals start by picking out a house. Like mine, then they assume our identity, which is easy because everything about us, including our home and property is online. Then they forge a home transfer document and take over as the new owner of my house. That's house stealing. And then they can take out loans using your equity as collateral. My home is my most valuable asset. That's why I protect it with home title lock. First things first, check on your home's title to make sure it's still in your name. Do it now at home title lock.com and use promo code free. Bill send you a scan of your home's title and your first 30 days of triple lock title protection is free.

All across this country, there's a push back now against some of the woke policies affecting education, whether it's title line or parental rights and nowhere is that more true than in the great state of Kansas where our next guest joins us. State Senator Renee Ericson who's been leading that fight in Kansas for quite some time. Senator, great to have you on the show today. Thank you. It's great to be with you, John. This has been a momentous week. You were right there. You created the Fairness of Women's Sports Act. You've been pushing it for a couple of years. The governor, Democrat Laura Kelly Vito's it. There's also been the Parental Rights Act this week. The Kansas Senate took some pretty big action. Tell our audience what happened this week in the Senate chamber. I'm happy to and I'm happy to report that after, as you said, a long hard fight for fairness in women's sports. We were able to get that done. We over-wrote the governor's veto 28-10 today. We needed 27 votes. So very excited that that happened. That will ensure that Kansas girls and women have a level playing field when it comes to sports competition. So the governor vetoed it last year. This year we were able to override that veto. It will now go to the house where we will work hard to make sure that we get it overridden in the house. Then we'll have those protections in place for girls. I'm sorry, go ahead, John. No, that's a momentous. Just a momentous moment in the Senate. Yes. On the parents' bill of rights, that was the bill we brought this year. Just reaffirming that parents are the most important educator in their child's lives and affirming the right to them to know what is being taught in schools. So there's a process for questioning that. I am very excited to let everyone know that we over-wrote the governor's veto of that bill as well today. So great policy for parents, great policy for kids today. I'm very excited to be a part of that. Yeah, middle America speaks with one voice. It's really been a remarkable journey. I know this wasn't easy. I know a lot of work when it says, as you step back, what point did this system turn around? When we see the Title IX issues, when we see the parental issues at school board, when did education bureaucrats say, you know what? You're no longer in charge of your kid's education. If I want your daughter to compete against the biological male, they're going to compete. If I want to teach them critical race theory or something else, I'm in charge here. What does that mindset start to seep into our great education system? Yeah, great question, John. And this has been a long process. I was a public educator for 20 years before I ran for the legislature. And I can tell you 20 years ago, this was not the case. However, it has been slowly being implemented, I think, in curriculum, in classrooms. And it sounds very reasonable, how they frame it. However, we're talking to the point now that parents, their authority is being usurped by the public school system. And we should be partners in public education. However, at the end of the day, the school system is designed to meet the needs of the students and parents are the authority in their students' lives. And I don't know if you're familiar with the situation that just occurred in Oklahoma, but a teacher went on saying, you know, if your parents don't like what you're doing, if they don't agree with how you want to live your life, I'll be your new parent. And so, unfortunately, we've seen that mentality creep in. And the bill that we passed today in Kansas simply affirms the right of parents to be their primary decider in the moral and educational upbringing of their children, common sense. And so, I'm glad we got that done. And believe you me, it's not the end of it because we're in a bigger fight. And we will continue to fight for parents' rights. Yeah, it's not only a common sense victory. It's a popular victory. 88% of Kansas parents said that they agreed they should have the primary say of their child's education. So, you're meeting those constituents' wishes with that. I want to turn to a second. Obviously, there's been some big victories in states, whether it's Kansas, Florida, a lot of big changes here. But at the federal level, Joe Biden is trying to tinker with the Title IX policy, which, by the way, has been very successful in bringing women's sports on par with men's sports. Want to make a lot of changes. How concerned are you? We got about a minute left. How concerned are you that Joe Biden at the federal level may try to undo what the states are putting into place? Well, sadly, we know that they will use any means at their disposal to further their ideology and their agenda. But we're on to them. Parents are on to them. Parents are engaged. If anything positive happened from the pandemic, its parents woke up and they're seeing what's going on and they don't like it. And so, you're right. It was the grassroots effort that pushed this forward. It was the difference between last year and this year, John, and sure, the Biden administration, they're going to come at us. But I think the Supreme Court ruling in Boston made it abundantly clear that ruling was about employment law, not education, and we will fight that. Yeah, there's no doubt. And that you have in Kansas is a remarkable set of victories this week. And next week, we'll watch the House and see what they do. We got about 30 seconds left. What's the best advice you have for your other federal legislators and other states you might be considering doing what you just did? No, that you're on the right side of this issue. Be persistent. Form those relationships with the people you need to and depend on the grassroots. Parents are engaged and we need that voice and the legislature. We need that public education. So, just persist. We might lose it one day, but we'll come back and we'll be successful the next. That's clearly what Kansas says, show and persistence in the grassroots. How about that? Senator, congratulations on a great victory. And thank you for joining us today. Thank you so much, John. Great honor to have you on. All right, folks, we're going to take a quick commercial break.

Now that we've heard from some lawmakers and experts on what the consequences of the Biden administration's proposed rule changes to Title IX would have on female athletes. You know what? I think it's a good idea to hear from the athletes themselves, get their thoughts on having to compete against transgender females. Joining us now are two student athletes to give us their perspective on this matter. Please welcome Macy Petty and Chloe Satterfield. Chloe, may see a guy to have you on the show. Thank you. Hi, thank you. Yeah, great to have you guys. Chloe, I'm going to start with you. In your experience, you were playing tennis in high school against a transgender female. What was that experience like both from a physical and a mental standpoint? Yeah, so I was a varsity tennis player all four years of high school and I competed against a transgender female and I lost. For me, you know, I wasn't a scholarship athlete. It wasn't part of the NCAA, but it was still a pretty tough loss. It's no one wants to lose when you're competing in sports. I mean, that is the entire point of sports is to win. And part of the fun is being able to compete in a fair competition to, you know, see what your skill set is against someone of the same level. And during that match, I mean, I figured out pretty early on that the playing field was not very fair. This athlete was stronger than me, faster than me, more agile than I was. There are just differences that I couldn't make up for and I had been training my entire life at a high performance academy. We'd spent thousands of dollars on training, for weight training, all kinds of training and there was really just nothing I could do. And, you know, at the end of the day, I lost and I took it with a grateful heart, you know, I'm glad to be out there on the court, but it was definitely a strange experience. I mean, I got over it and I can't imagine what a college athlete would feel like in that kind of situation. But I mean, it really just goes to show that no matter how much money or training you pour into yourself, at the end of the day, when you're competing against someone like that, there's nothing you can do. And it was pretty disheartening. You know, that was a few years ago, actually, but I mean, I still hold on to that. Yeah, no, biologics matter. There's no doubt about it. Macy, you're currently an NCAA college athlete. I can't imagine the amount of hours you've had to put in to get where you are today. Describe to our audience how hard you had to work to earn your scholarship and what your thoughts are about the idea of having to compete against someone born as a biological male competing as a transgender female for your spot. Yes, sir. I mean, the hours have been countless. There have been conditioning tests and doing everything I can to increase my vertical, you know, weight training, speed training, all of those things, even doing things like changing my diet to make sure I'm peeling my body correctly. All of these things, just to have one more advantage on the court, you know, I know that there are so many other girls in my conference fighting to do the exact same thing. And you look at people who their vertical is so much higher than mine, just because of biology. I think it's a really important thing to note that a men's volleyball net is seven inches higher than a female's net. And that doesn't have to do with any personality trait that might be characterized with, with male or masculinity. But because of biological facts and the advantages that are given to you when you are born male. So having someone playing on a net seven inches shorter than they should be as a biological male, it's very disheartening. As a female athlete, like I said, I've worked really, really hard to get where I am today. And so to see people using these advantages, to just take advantage of all the hard work that all of these girls have been put in and have scholarships taken from them, championships taken from them. Like, I know how much these things mean in the hours that they have put in. And just being taken advantage of it's really heartbreaking. And I know so many athletes have expressed that now. I think we're beginning to understand the consequences. Basically, you both are ambassadors of young women for America. And you both could partner rally at Georgia Tech where the NCAA D1 women's swimming and diving championship was being out in the league, at Thomas was there. What was that experience like Chloe? So let's start with you. Yeah, so I was one of the people that helped organize that rally at Georgia Tech. It was definitely a stressful experience. It's really hard to mobilize people, especially with an issue like this that's so controversial and it shouldn't be controversial. But I think people are scared to speak up because they think that there's going to be this cancel culture that's just going to destroy their futures if they speak out about this. So the main issue we had was just getting people to come out. But we had a great turnout in the and all that hard work and stress was completely worth it. We stood outside of the campus rec center for multiple hours in the heat and moms and dads and siblings of these female swimmers were coming out. And some of them were in tears. You could just tell they were so like upset about Leah Thomas's participation in this competition. And they would come up to us, they'd shake our hands, they'd pass on the back and they would just thank us. You know, thank you for being out here. It feels like there's nobody fighting for us. So as a student on campus there, you know, it was certainly encouraging to know that there are people that support us because there were protesters right across the street yelling at us. But at the end of the day, knowing that we're doing something good for these families and for these athletes was all worth it. Yeah, it had to be. Basically, how about you? What was that like? Yes, sir. I would say heartbreaking is an understatement. Just because as a female athlete, I know how much these girls have been working for this. And these parents have watched these girls fight for this probably from a very young age. And I have never been anywhere close to a national championship. So I know how much it means to them to even be able to participate in the race and they knew that they lost before they even walked in just because it was stolen from them, you know, and you know, you look at Swimmers likely at Thomas who used to be ranked what 472 in the nation and now number one in women's swimming and they knew that they lost before they even walked in despite probably 10, 15 years of hard work for this very day. And so like Chloe said, we watched the heartbreak in these girls as they were leaving and the parents, they were all supporting us because no one could watch what happened in that arena and walk out and say that this is okay or that this is liberation and this is what America is about. You know, they knew that this was wrong and that these girls were products of injustice and that somebody has got to stand up and speak up about this. Yeah, and that's what you guys have done. And I think a lot of people are rallying around you. Chloe, was there any point when you were competing in the ultimate loss to a transgender female that you felt unsafe or uncomfortable? Is there any moment of awkwardness that competition is going on? I mean, I would say the only awkwardness is just the fact that they know what they're doing. Is it right? I mean, even if they think that they're email at the end of the day, they know that they have biological advantages over us. And so I don't, I wouldn't say I felt unsafe. I was never in a locker room with this individual. If that was the case, I would certainly feel uncomfortable and I would, I would fight that till the day I left the competition. I mean, that's unacceptable. But at the end of the day, they know and they know what they're doing and regardless of whether or not they feel bad about it, there's that tension there when you're competing against someone like that. You know, like, I am here for the right reasons and I work for this and you're stealing this from me. And I think that at the end of the day, they do recognize that and that's where that awkwardness comes from. Sure, sure. That's right. We got about 90 seconds left. Macy, you testified recently in support of Tennessee, say women's sports belt. What compelled you to do that? Well, so I originally testified in South Carolina twice and then through my participation with young women, with young women for America, I was given the opportunity again in Tennessee, which I just couldn't turn down, you know, women's sports is something that I hold so near and dear to my heart and then it has given me the educational opportunities that I have today because of my scholarship. And so the threat of that for the future generations and my daughters is very disheartening. And so I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that that doesn't happen. So any girls that might be watching this, it's not as scary as that looks, especially if you have an organization like young women for America who help you every step of the way. I really encourage you guys to speak up because this is what these policymakers need to hear. They need to hear the girls who this is affecting the here and the now and that these opportunities, we're not going to let them be taken away from us. That's such an important thing. We got about 30 seconds of that real quickly. If you had one piece of advice for other female students, what would it be? We'll start with you, Macy. Yeah, so as an NCAA athlete, I am very scared of NCAA and the power that they have over me because of my scholarship. And I would just say, like I said, I don't want future generations for this opportunity to be jeopardized. And so I would encourage you just by how scared you are, speak up because your voice is heard. Chloe, do you agree? Yeah, completely. I mean, we have a responsibility to fight. So don't be afraid. Stand up for what you know is true. I know your families must be very proud of you. You articulate your brave and you've got bright futures ahead of both you. Macy, Chloe, thank you so much for joining us today. Folks, stick around. We'll be right back after the commercial break. A lot more discussion than you have. Welcome back, everybody. Joining us right now is a true champion of collegiate women athletes. Senator Marshall Blackman for the Great State of Tennessee. Senator, great to have you on the show. It's good to be with you. Thank you so much. You have been championing Title IX in fairness and women in sports for a very long time. We just heard earlier in the show from a show from a Trump Education Department official who said the Biden administration is trying to fix something that's not broken. That these changes with Title IX are not really necessary. What do you think is really going on with the Biden administration? What the Biden administration is trying to do is to change gender definitions. What they would end up doing is ending the ability for women to be able to compete and succeed and win when it comes to sports. Title IX was put into place so that there would not be discrimination against women in sports. Look at the doors of opportunity that it has opened for women. Whether it is college softball or tennis or golf, you look at the number of collegiate golfers that go on to the LPGA. You look at the opportunities for track and field events and some of the women who had built their careers around going forward with track and field events after the Olympics. Women that have become star athletes as gymnasts and then have had brilliant careers because of what is there. Also, you look at the way it has inspired young women to learn how to work together as a team. Learn how to compete. And John, I will tell you that today as I speak, there are thousands of young girls in Tennessee that are on the playground with the basketball shooting hooks or they jump off the school bus and they run to the end of the driveway. They grab that ball. They are shooting hooks because one day they want to play for the lady balls at the University of Tennessee. Now that's about dreaming big dreams. And Title 9 has opened those doors of opportunity so that for these young girls, those dreams come true. And if the administration is successful in changing Title 9, what they're going to do is end that opportunity. And those dreams that those girls have is they're out running that 1600 meter, that 800 meter, as they are running that track at their high school dreaming about one day being a true global competitor, being an Olympic athlete. Yeah, so much to aspire for. So many gains have been made in the last half century. You recently had a chance to talk to a Champions winner. Riley Gaines, she had to compete against Lee at Thomas recently. What was that personal experience like and what sentiments did she convey to you? One of the things that I took away from that conversation with her was that sense of disappointment and that she was not given the credit she tied for fifth place in in her heat and tied with Lee at Thomas. And the trophy was given to Leah Thomas and because they didn't have two trophies. So the NCAA chose to give the trophy to Leah and Riley was standing there empty handed. I don't know if they've ever mailed the trophy to her. They said they were going to mail her trophy to her. But this was her moment also and to treat them unequally, I think was just a source of disappointment. And she swims for University of Kentucky. It had to be a source of disappointment for them also. So this is if you're going, you need to treat people equally and fairly. And the NCAA, because they have chosen not to address the issue of biological males competing with biological females, you end up with situations like this. And John, I I I fault the NCAA and their leadership and their committees for not stepping forward and supporting Title IX and not stepping forward and addressing women's competition in sports. Yeah, it is kind of hidden behind a rock for the last six months or a year. This is part of a larger culture war. And I think you created perhaps the most memorable moment in the recent Supreme Court nomination hearings for Judge Jackson. You asked her, couldn't she define a woman and she couldn't. What has happened to America that the culture wars have become so crazy that we can't even give a definite initiative. Well, we got about two minutes left, Senator. Yeah, you know, and while I was home over the Easter break, I heard so much from people about this that they were just astounded that she would not. And of course, this was part of a series of questions that dealt with woke education, a woke kindergarten program that taught five and six year olds to choose their gender. I couldn't get an answer from her there. I moved on to asking her about Justice Ginsburg's decision in the ruling on the case US versus Virginia about the by and women being admitted to our military academies. And Justice Ginsburg had said there were enduring differences between male and female. I couldn't get her to answer me if she agreed Justice Ginsburg. So I asked if she could give me the definition of the word woman because I was moving on to talk about Title IX and talk about women having to compete against biological males. That is an issue that will end up before the Supreme Court at some sure. So I wanted to see where she was on that. And I was really quite surprised that she would not give an answer. But it shows you how far left they are pushing and how they're trying to erase the word woman. And not have that as a part of our lexicon, not have Title IX to open these doors for opportunity for children, not having those protections around women so that they have an equal footing to compete and be a part of competition, a part of. And what it would do is open the door. Let's say you've got a women's lacrosse team that ends up being made up of biological males. Our women's softball team are a tennis team are a swing team. And this is what the future could hold if the Biden administration gets their way. And you're exactly right, John Solomon. This is a big part of the culture war that the left is carrying out against the American people. And how's that potential to demoralize the next generation of young women's senator? You've been such a champion for all those women in college sports. I know they're glad to have you in the quarter. Thanks for joining us today. Happy to be with you. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, folks, stick around. We'll be right back with another special guest. And it's time for Merit Attackin for America. Right after these commercial mess. Welcome back, everybody. Boy, I was just thinking about what Senator Blackburn said that women's sports as we know them in college athletes has about to be changed in Biden has his ways. What a profound thought. Well, we've got a perfect guest to wrap up the show today. She's been on here many times before. She's the executive director of Heritage Action for America, our sponsor and partner for tonight, Jessica Anderson. Jessica, great to have you on. Thanks, John, for having me. Great to be here. It's a great conversation we've been having. I can't at one. And I want to ask you straight out. If these Title IX changes take effect, if the Biden administration manages to get these regulations changed, what is life going to be like for young girls and young women in college sports? So it's incredibly unfortunate what the Biden administration has put forward with this proposed rule for Title IX, which would actually add gender identity and sexual orientation to the Title IX regulation. So what that means, John, is that any federal school that receives federal programming would then be forced to require men to share women's sports, locker rooms, bathrooms, any sort of mixed gender facilities would now include men. So it's essentially an attack on women. And it's certainly an attack on women's sports. If these Title IX proposed rules were to go forward, like we think they will sometime this May. Yeah, a lot of people are watching this. And you've been the field general for so many important grassroots efforts, whether it was the Georgia election integrity efforts, the defeating Build Back Better. What can everyday Americans, what can the grassroots do over the next 30 days or months to try to make a difference, to try to stop this if they so want to do so? Well, the good thing is, is that this rule can be stopped, or at least it can be slowed down, John. So if you go to saverswools.com, we'll have a portal up where parents activists all across the country can actually provide comment to the rulemaking process and voice their concern. Talk about how this Title IX rule would completely upend and go to war against women, against girls sports, our sanctity and safety and bathrooms and locker rooms. Submit those comments. The goal here is that we would slow the rule down and not allow it to be implemented. And hopefully that will then not only slow the process, but when this rule eventually ends up in court, there will be hundreds of thousands of activists comments opposing this rag that then can be used to justify the opposition if this ends up in court. So there's a lot parents can still do, a lot activists can do. Visit saverswools.com to take action today. Yeah, it's a pretty easy thing to remember, save our school. That's pretty good. This is obviously part of a much larger culture war that the left has been imposing on America, whether it's critical race, the transgender teachings. What is going on and has America begun to step in its back and say enough is enough. We've seen it with Disney, with Ron DeSantis in Florida. Are we reaching a tipping point in this culture war? Well, the Biden administration has waged an all-out war on all of our American institutions, our families, our businesses, our children. And this latest wave of woke ideology that's going after women's sports, it's going out after the very definition of what a woman is, is just indicative of how far left or how woke the left and progressive agenda has become. And so parents are sipping up, they're standing out, they're going to the microphone and they're saying enough is enough. Let our kids learn, take the indoctrination, take critical race theory, take this Marxist view of the world out of our schools, out of our curriculum, out of our sports and let kids be kids. And so I am empowered by parents across the country. I'm encouraged by it, John. And I think the momentum is going back in our direction to let kids learn and get this silly indoctrination that is ruining America out of our classrooms. Yeah, there's no doubt. Now you've had a lot of chance to talk to parents to be on the front lines with them as they go through the training, get to learn what you're doing at Save Our Schools. What's the most important advice you can give to a parent, a grandparent, a guardian who wants to get this issue right and stop what's going on in Washington? It's very simple, John. See something, say something. If you see something that looks a little bit off in your child's curriculum, that book that they bring home, their syllabus, say something, raise it to the teacher, raise it to the principal. If you're not getting the answers you deserve as a parent, then we can walk you through how to issue a FOIA request. Hold that information forward, have more transparency from the schools so that way we have enough, we have enough support to go to state legislatures like what was just done in Virginia, in Florida, that put parents back in the driver's seats of their kids' education. So the number one rule, see something, say something. If you're a parent of a school-aged kid, get involved in your children's education, know what they're learning, and ensure that it lines up with your values. And thankfully, John, there's a community of activists, of parents, all across the country that want to help. Heritage Action is pulling these resources and people together through the Save Our Schools effort, and we'd love to have anyone that's watching tonight's program join us. Yeah, it's definitely the ultimate toolkit, saveourschools.com. Jessica, always great to be partnering with you on these specials and to have you on for all your wisdom.

We're committed to getting the facts and leaving you to make up your own mind. We hope we helped it with that a little bit tonight with the conversation we just had.
