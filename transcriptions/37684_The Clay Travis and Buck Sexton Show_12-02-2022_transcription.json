    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in to the start of the clay Travis and bucksxton show everybody all across the country Thank you for being here with us a Racked and stacked day. We've got Stacey Abrams apologizing for not a maskless photo Put maskless photos big hat tip to the excellent website out kick dot com for breaking the story Clay your team high fives all around on that one. We've also got New York state rolling back the indoor mask mandate But not the school mask mandate and the CDC the breaking news here is There's still recommending masking and high transmission areas Why is this such a fight at this point cases are down and I we asked that rhetorically of course We'll tell you why we're gonna get into why The cases are down almost 50 percent last couple of weeks been an enormous change in the covid positivity rate, right and the covid covid rate of Spread of hospitalization everything. It's obviously just the end of the season It's the end of the season and they're acting like this is because or we are in a situation where we should be thanking Defoucheeites and the people around us for what they have done here for the situation of the lockdowns the mandates the vaccine Passports all of it and if anything else you have to remember they're going to try to tell you that they did everything right and That everything that they're doing is right and will continue to be and clay What I want to say is I refuse to allow this I Refused to let them act like the science change. We found out new stuff We did everything that we were supposed to do that the promises they made about stopping the spread and trend Mission of the virus that masks work. This is a hill. I will gladly die on unmasked It doesn't work. It didn't work and they're crazy Well, this is significant right we need consequences For public policy failures We need to know that there are Issues when you're totally wrong whether it's defund the police which Basically no one in America now is even arguing they were ever in favor of buck like you can't even find the Democrat now Who says defund the police is a good idea. That's after everyone was arguing for basically six months defund the police was the way to go I think there's one just give you a thing on Fox News this morning Who was it just to be fair? I think there's literally Cory boy. That's good Cory Bush She's still arguing in favor of it as of this morning is refusing. This is on Fox News calm refusing to back away from Defund the police this was their main story which is what I was thinking about but you'd go so there's really really funny There is what there is at least one Democrat who is still and you know what I Actually have more respect for core. I didn't have much respect for Cory Bush in the first place Because she was if I remember correctly One one of the women who was sleeping on the steps of the Capitol to get an unconstitutional eviction moratorium But she also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her own private security while arguing that police needed to be defunded She's important clay. Yes, but but at least she's sticking to her guns so to speak on this one, but There need to be for everybody out there dr. Lena Windbuck. Are we talked about this yesterday? When I saw her CNN hit My jaw dropped my it's rare that I see an opinion. I mean this is a woman who a few weeks ago was saying Every kid needs to be mandatory Vaccinated you need to have domestic travel restrictions for the unvaccinated you need to have medical grade masks on every kid in school And suddenly she said all of that can go away. This should be a parental decision And it's as if what she said before never existed and this is where I Think we need to keep hammering this for everybody out there No, you can't suddenly just pivot and change everything that you've been arguing for two years and the crazy thing is Did you see what Lena Wind tweeted? I mean this is this is wild buck. She said Uh before there were two camps for and against pandemic restrictions. This is just what she tweeted yesterday Now there's a third pro restrictions earlier, but recognizing it's a different time now This group wants to move on from vitriol and divisiveness to nuance and compromise This is her Washington Post opinion piece. I'm saying wait a minute We have been the nuanced group buck you and I have been arguing look at the data for years Address elderly people we've said this on the show how many times we told our own parents get the COVID shot get the booster You're over 75 years old. We're telling our audience out there Hey, if you're morbidly obese like Stacey Abrams, you probably should get the COVID shot Right if you are in ill health, you probably should get it But my seven year old doesn't need to be treated the same as my 75 plus year old parents This is a different world. That's what we've been arguing and all of a sudden these scientists can't say oh, we're the nuanced group No, no, no, you were wrong We were right and there need to be consequences Politically for your wrongness and the one place where they're really digging in still is one of the areas where they have the least Data to support them, but where clearly there's an emotional component of this and that's on the situation of kids Why are we sitting here talking about I'm I'm I don't even have kids Clay's got school-age children's this affects him more directly than it does me But why are we sitting here trying to fight that fight? Because they're now claiming that they're going to continue with the masking of children in New York at least for weeks if not months Until they can get the higher level of vaccination. This is now be now they're acting like we got to get all the kids Vaccinated and that's the issue they are neurotics and they are hysterical This is the problem we are facing now and they're sacrificing children because they're not in a position to say hey adults Stop being crazy and they have really trained themselves. I mean psychologically emotionally the Democrat Party has viewed this entire COVID restriction regime as a function of whether or not they're good people. I mean you still have James Carville for example, remember how I said to you? This is all about creating we talked about this yesterday and everybody I think Knows what I'm about to say about how when everything started to fail clay to fill that emotional hole that people had from all the fear and everything else They didn't turn on the government. They turned on the unvaccinated Here's James Carville saying he wants to punch him in the face. I wish you'd do his pass a lot to Make you immune for my ability if you punch some acts Unvaccinated person right in the faces, which I'd really like to do if you ask me when you know What's my first reaction to you if you You're not vaccinated in this you don't have any medical reason not to be your piece I mean I would help James just you know, you're right Face he wants to punch me right in the face. That's what he's saying. I'm unvaccinated by the way I think I like my chances I was gonna say give it a shot if we got Jimmy now I've got him I've got him by like 30 years and probably 30 pounds So it's not exactly a fair fight. It's kind of like when you're a girl, and you're having to swim against boys Which is what's going on in the Ivy League? That's why we have weight classes for boxing But I think I would take James James Carvel and I actually at times think James Carvel is really entertaining To me this is a sign that he doesn't know what the date is right because if he there are a lot of people out there of the James Carvel Ilk who are Democrats that convince themselves that they did everything right and the only reason COVID still exists is because People are unvaccinated. That's not remotely true. That's not what the data shows I think the primary reason now there are a lot of reasons. There are still people I mean clay walking around New York City. There are double masters outside right now I mean still yeah, I'm walking into the studio there I see double masters outside also saw an NYPD detective who came over flashes badge that I love what you and Claire doing High-five to that guy. I appreciate it. Maybe he can help me sneak into a restaurant whenever I'm back in New York City I think NYPD would have us covered here. But anyway, yeah The the reality I think is that there are there's now that the primary motive for the apparatus is To maintain Control of the dissent and to always have in the background, you know, they're gonna they're gonna loosen the leash clay But they're not gonna take the leash off of us That's that's one aspect of it and then for the people the mass of Of those who have suffered from mass formation psychosis and I love that term because it sets them in since it sets them off into fits of rage Their biggest thing is We can't have been wrong this whole time those stupid Trump voters can't have been right They there's a huge ego component of this where they just you keep saying that the day the data Clay there are people now who will look at the most obvious and clear data. They'll look at what is it? Williamson County versus uh, Davidson County Davidson County side by side and they'll say I don't care It doesn't the numbers don't matter them anymore those anti-maskers Trumpers anti-vax mandate people They're the bad people clay. They should get punched in the face. They can't be right We're here to tell all those folks. No, you were right and the other side the libs the fauciites were wrong big w wrong And here's the other thing I think is worth mentioning Even as democratic governors in places like Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and even in New York buck uh with catty hokal Start to walk back their restrictions It's important to recognize the governors can walk back their restrictions But the cities and the local school districts where many kids are attending school still Are not walking back simultaneously, right? So I think this is a little bit of a bait and switch Because we know that the media many people who cover Certainly left-wing politics are not very smart and they're also biased But buck I don't want us to overlook just because the governor walks back a restriction statewide Doesn't mean that the vast majority of kids in a state Still could not be mandated to continue to have to wear masks and I think some of our people out there listening Uh may not understand that and I think it's going to create even more tension And even more conflict at a school board because this is like what's going on in Virginia The woman that we had on yesterday. She said wait I was told if the governor didn't have this restriction that mask mandates would disappear Maryann Jensen who came on with us yesterday, but the reality is these local school boards and these dictatorial mayors Can still have power over whether or not your kids are required to wear masks the lesson of what we're seeing right now for me and I think for anyone who's paying attention to this clay is that the Science didn't change the politics changed. That's not just trevorn saying that now and it's it's accurate But that's not just about what's going on now. That has been the case the whole time They have been making policy and judgment calls under the rubric of the science when it was really the politics That's been true the entirety of the pandemic really from the beginning And I would even argue going back into the trump administration There were a lot of politics involved in went what lockdowns when member quomo and and fauci and early on They made this political right trump wasn't listening to the science enough I think you listen to quote the science as in fauci too much This has been the case the whole time and everyone who looks back. I think I think they realize and they see that Um, and if they haven't seen that they should see the stacey abrums photos of her on mass yesterday Which we should talk about because now she's had to apologize clay in 24 hours We've gone from but it's black history month to yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just a big liar a big liar She still is lying though, buck and I want to talk about that when we come back because The photos that we have up at outkick and you can go check them out if you go into outkick.com She said she just took her mask off to read to the kids for a short period of time and to take that photo because it was Will we'll play the audio for you? But no pushback from cnn to the fact that she's lying and there's clear photographic evidence of her lies If you're a homeowner, there's still time to save yourself an extra 500 to a thousand dollars a month We're talking about refinancing your mortgage. We're still seeing some incredibly low rates and makes it worth your while to call American financing You'll get a free mortgage review explaining all the ways you can save some big money There's more to refi than just a lower payment It's also the ability to save tens of thousands of dollars of the life of your loan Think what you could do with that extra money You don't want to give money away to the bank, right?

Uh, it's a crazy day crazy day all around um But buck I we were talking about stacey abrams as we went to break there And stacey abrams I think is going to get crushed in the georgia governor's race Now we don't know who exactly the georgia governor nominee is going to be but I think she's going to get crushed But we talk a lot about what obligations There are to tell the truth not only for politicians, but also for the media that covered them Stacey abrams spent the whole day at that georgia school without wearing Uh masks. We had it at out kick. I got it sent to me. I passed it off to our readers Thank you for the people who tipped me off to this and sent me the photos And then stacey abrams went on cnn Last night erin bernette show And said listen to this. Uh, she made a mistake and she apologized But she claimed that she just took the mask off for a few minutes to read a story Let's listen to this. Uh why from stacey abrams. Yes. I will say this. I went to read to kids for an african-american read-in day I approached the podium with my mask on I followed the protocols I told the kids i'm taking my mask off because i'm reading to kids who are listening remotely as well And we were socially distanced the kids were socially distanced for me I told them that's what I was doing and then the excitement after I finished because it was so much fun working with those kids I took a picture and that was a mistake Protocols matter and protecting our kids is the most important thing and anything that can be perceived as undermining that is a mistake and I apologize So she's still lying Still lying and and buck erin bernette like this is where I don't know how busy erin bernette is in prepping for an interview or whether She does her own stuff But this was widely distributed all over the internet after we broke that story yesterday morning about stacey abrams and the masks at outkick Why wouldn't erin bernette follow up and say you say that you just took your mask off for a short period of time Yet there are photos on outkick Uh or just photos on the internet of you inside of that school all day long not wearing a mask If you were truly doing your job and holding a public official accountable You would immediately push back because that's a clear why that she's telling and there's photographic evidence that she is lying CNN didn't say a word the cnn audience would turn on any host who would would Point out that stacey abrams is lying because the st the cnn audience would view it as attacking a black woman on tv That's that that's just where that's just how cnn audience views it doesn't matter if she lied The identity politics are what matters much more to them and I just also point out here Notice how stacey abrams talks about this. It's like a member of the fauci palette burrow I was social distancing social distancing isn't a thing anymore remember what it used to be Everyone knows it's total nonsense, especially in the era of omicron But just though the whole pretense you didn't care you're important You're used to being treated like you're better than other people Especially little kids you have to mask up when it comes to these covid protocols and you got caught that's it bottom line I also love two things one She's dropped the you're racist if you're criticizing me angle Which was her first response on sunday if you remember when the first photos went viral Now the other thing here is she's acknowledging that wearing a mask inhibits learning Because when you're reading a book If you notice this you immediately Annunciate i've done it with obviously my own kids But i've gone in for reading days for elementary school kids and you hold the book and turn it around everything else She said she took the mask off to allow that to be seen better.

What is going on here? We have somebody who knows this backwards and forwards heather mcdonald's with us now She's a senior fellow at the manhattan institute contributing editor at city journal and the author of the excellent book I've got a copy of it at home the war on cops or latest piece and city journal the guardians in retreat heather Thank you so much. Well, thank you so much for having me on bucking clay. It's an honor the guardians in retreat Tell us about this what's going on Oh, it's another example of white calling that is happening across our major institutions Uh the the art institute of chicago, which is one of the great museums in the world Uh decided to terminate its docent program Not because the docents were doing a poor job or they weren't communicating effectively with students But because they were overwhelmingly white and that in today's world in institution after institution Uh is a sin that you simply cannot overcome Uh, and so they've decided to give up on highly trained free labor that has introduced generations of chicago children to the greatest masterpieces of world civilization Replace them with six paid Art educators who will be chosen not on the basis of knowledge But on the basis of the utter irrelevancy of race If you're a white or if you're especially a white male and you are not trans or gay Uh, you are finding doors closing to you across the culture Heather I appreciate you coming on and the work that you have done on police and the data and the danger Relative to the way the media covers it is truly extraordinary Um, and so 1995 was the last time this many police officers were killed as we just saw in 2021 Why are in european based on the data police under attack like they have not been In basically a quarter century in this country. What is the data telling us? Well, the data is telling us that uh in the first half of of 2021 Ambush assaults on officers were up 91 percent as you say 2021 overall was the highest since 95 What's going on here? I believe is the effects of ruthless relentless demonization of the police on the part of The the elite democratic establishment and that includes president joe biden joe biden had the utter shamelessness Uh in october during police week to memorialize slain officers in dc To bring up his constant theme that blacks in america were somehow under assault From police officers and that our criminal justice system was not meeting out fair justice That is a complete lie. None of the data shows that even left wing criminologist if they're forced with the gun to they had to be honest They will acknowledge that what drives the criminal justice system is crime not race Uh, but but biden even as recently as october has been Sending that message and criminals get the message you also have things like the progressive prosecutors Whether it's george gaskall in los angeles or the recently elected alvin bragg in new york city Declaring publicly announcing that they are not going to prosecute the crime of resisting arrest I can think of nothing more corrosive to respect for the rule of law than sending out a message that our prosecutorial establishment does not regard Uh the disrespect for officers the refusal to go along with with lawful orders as something that should be Absolutely punished when you allow as we saw with the third precinct in minneapolis during the first outburst of the george floyd race riots in in late may of 2020 that police precinct was torched it was burned to the ground it was deliberately abandoned On the part of the city's leaders because they did not want to have bad videos showing them You know engaged in strong combat with the black lives matter rioters When you allow the the symbols and the reality of law enforcement to be so destroyed You are destroying everybody else's safety. We do not have to accept this This crime wave that is taking down the young the elderly the law abiding We do not have to accept it. It is not normal We have to start enforcing the law again without regard to the consequences of disparate impact Which is why everybody's backing off of law enforcement because they don't want to have a disparate impact on minorities When you back off on law enforcement to avoid a disparate impact on minority criminals The first people who suffer are the law abiding minority victims Speaking of heather mcdonald author of the book the best-selling book the war on cops Heather is the pivot happening now because one of the big things we're discussing today on the show Is not just the move away from masks and uh and various mandates Because there's an election looming and more and more people are realizing how stupid and pointless a lot of this stuff was Is that happening in a different way or on a different subject when it comes to the soft-on crime policies? I mean I mentioned the handing out of free crack pipes That's going on but you do have a brag the d.a in new york coming under a lot of heat for his Just seemingly insane Statement on who he will and won't prosecute Cops are getting refunded if you will in places like austin and other jurisdictions other cities where they were defunded in the past Is the pivot happening or are there places that are still holding out against it? Oh, there's many places still holding out and here's what to look for When if we go back to enforcing the law It will have a disparate impact because black crime rates are astronomically higher there about 13 times higher homicide rate For blacks than for whites So when you enforce the law against shootings Uh, you know blacks in new york city commit about 75 percent of all shootings though They're there 23 percent of the population a black new york risk is 50 times more likely a committed shooting in the white new yorker If we go back to enforcing the law, we will have a disparate impact on criminals and the majority of those criminals are black If the if eric adam's the mayor of new york backs down under the aclu pressure which will happen And he's already said that he wants to collect racial data on judges to see if they are Setting higher bail or or holding violent offenders Rather than letting them loose on the streets at a higher rate for blacks. That's going to set off alarm bills I'm I'm yet to be persuaded that the Long-standing race narrative that says that every aspect in american society that is racially disproportionate as the result of racism Has been dislodged it is going to take people Standing up and saying there are other explanations to ongoing racial disparities and racism. Yes This is a country that had a terrible history and that history lasted very recently In the 60s and 70s even in the north blacks were still being treated with contempt, but we are a changed country Right now the reality is black privilege not white privilege There's not a single institution that is not bending over backwards to hire and promote as many blacks as possible The criminal justice system has nothing to apologize for And we have to combat the leftist narrative that says here's a racial disparity You know, there's not 13 percent blacks in google. That's because of racism and discrimination against black engineers No, it's because of an academic skills gap culture gap whatever So i'm gonna hold i'm gonna hope i'm gonna hope that we've turned the corner on this But i tell you it's a hard haul because the academy and the democratic establishment still remains wedded to the phony racism narrative Heather quickly here you had a stat that i was trying to reference earlier this week The percentage chance that a police officer is shot By a black person versus the chances that they shoot a black person It was something like 18,000 more what what is that stat? Do you remember in your book? Specifically because yeah Currently last year there were four unarmed blacks Allegedly i say allegedly unarmed Because that's the washing post database and they classify people that are trying to grab an officer's gun as unarmed There were four unarmed blacks shot by the police out of a population of between 44 47 million If you look at the number of police officers who were killed Last year which is 73 and you do a per capita comparison And you take into account the the historical rate at which blacks have shot police officers fatally Which is about 42 percent of all cop killers are black i'm sorry This is a lot of numbers that throughout the bottom. Yeah, yeah a police officer is 400 times as likely to be killed by a black criminal As an unarmed black person is to be killed by a police officer So the narrative again as we know as you guys keep keep pressing home But can clay is completely false And you know the other thing that one needs to be saved that the libertarian left and and the level of potential left Always say oh, it's so safe to be a police officer, you know, nothing to worry about these guys have it really easy Well, again, let's look at the rate of of deaths a police police officers or a thousand times As likely to be killed last year as blacks were uh by police officers so if it's safe to be a police officer And you're a thousand times more likely to be killed than an unarmed black is let's for heaven's sake Acknowledge contrary to what biden tells black parents all the time that as far as the police go It is very very safe to be black who should we be worried about? These insane Teen thugs who are going around spraying bullets across city streets Taking down one year old three year olds four year olds last year in chicago alone There was a one month old girl shot in the head a four year old boy shot in twice in the head A six year old girl shot in the head seven year old girl shot in the head nine year old girl shot in the head They're not shot by the cops. They're shot by thugs and those thugs should be off the streets and in prison No matter their race. No matter their age Heather mcdonald. Thank you so much for this time.

It's probably because most sports media haven't covered it other than outkick Uh, this is crazy buck. The ivy league has said This transgender swimmer is eligible to compete in the ivy league championships and now There may be i'm not even making this up The all-time greatest swimmer in the history of college athletics for women is going to be a man who decided to become a woman What what year in the past? Would you have to go to say that? And everyone not immediately erupting laughter thinking it was satire. I mean even as recently as 2008 2010. I mean you remember the movie juanaman With the wayans brothers where the idea was this dude was going to pretend to be a girl and become the greatest wmba player of all time It was played for laughs. That was the satire of oh, there's no way this could ever happen And now in theory, this is a legitimate thing that threatens to destroy All of women's athletics if you can just decide what your gender is And after you've already been a successful male athlete you can become a woman. There's no point in women's athletics. This was actually an early Tip-off in many ways about where we were heading pre-covid You know before the whole covid pandemic happened because the blue check mds Then the same ones that appeared to say during lockdowns Well, we don't want anyone gathering except for blm protest because those are like really important though that that same mentality has existed You've seen this with what you could consider the blue check activist mds On the issue of transgender rights that they will go they will go out publicly and go into all this babble About how oh, but gender is different from from sex and gender identity They create all this language to try to obscure the fact that these are men who are biological men This is an objective scientific reality. They have x y chrome ozone all over in every cell in their bodies And they act like this is not something that is observable and distinct and important And you just you after wonder after a while Why they want to push this so hard? I really believe this there's there's two things one They need a new the left needs a new civil rights struggle a new cause no you get to pretend to be the heroes I mean, there this is not this is not a civil rights struggle. This is the left acting like a bunch of lunatics Okay, that's one part of it the other part of it You know on transgender competition in sports. We all understand this is wrong The other part of it though clay Is that if they can get you to say that a man is a woman and a woman is a man What can't they get you to say? You they'll they'll debase your your ability to reason And what's wild about this is we have weight classes for boxing We have different divisions for sports Let's say in high school based on whether you go to a big school or a small school 5a 1a, however, it's classified in your state We have different gradations of competition based on age yet This situation is taking over women's athletics And you're going to have in the record books The greatest women swimmer of all time is going to be a dude And people out there on the left are either pretending this story isn't happening Or they are welcoming it as if it is some sign of equality Maybe we just need to eliminate men's and women's athletics in general and go back 100% to the days when only men won competitions because women would never win anything if we had unisex competition But there's a very important announcement that we should have to make to everybody about uh the data when it comes to children and covid According to the view The announcement is of course that apparently people at the view Don't actually read anything about covid statistics have no idea what they're talking about But I know you're going to walk us through this in a couple of minutes Yeah, this is next level dumb even for the view Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth"
