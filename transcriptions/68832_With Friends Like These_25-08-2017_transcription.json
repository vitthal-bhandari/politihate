    "text": " This show is brought to you by M. M. La Fleur, which is a women's clothing brand that has a pretty unique way of approaching work style. They're saying is they want to take the work out of dressing for work. And what they do is offer incredibly stylish and classic and simple clothes picked out for you by a personal stylist. They call it a bento box. You answer a few questions online. Then the personal stylist does an analysis of your style and picks something out. And I want to say, since I left Washington, I got rid of almost all of my blazers, almost all of my high heels, most of every single suit that I own, except one, I've one suit. So I don't have very much in the way of work, work clothes, which I am occasionally called upon to dress like a normal human. And I actually have used M. M. La Fleur because it is ideal for the kind of situation that you find yourself in that you have to travel and you have to do a bunch of things in one day. And you want to have something that you can maybe throw on the washer. Everything they offer is machine washable. Oh, that's cool. I've often thought on, hey, it's love it here. I'm here for the ads. It's often said that women have to wear more uncomfortable clothes. And I think that's like, it seems like that's pretty true about the shoes. Definitely. It's like you guys get you guys get really a bum deal on the shoe situation, which I don't know how you stand for it. But you do get more variation in clothes and especially during the seasons. Like when I was in DC, men have to wear men on the hill wear suits every day. And they do that spring, winter, fall, summer, you'll see a seersucker or something or a tan suit, but it's still a suit. And like, I've often thought like, man, you can wear comfortable things. If you wear traditionally, you know, women's clothes during the summer. And I often thought that like, it feels like such a big choice to do that if you're a guy, but it's unfair. That's all I want to say about that. What really is great about and then look for is that it is a kind of uniform, like a suit, it can be super stylish, but it's also you don't have to think too hard about it. It just looks good. And that's what I've always been jealous of as far as like, min suits go, right? Like, you can kind of add your personal details to it, but you don't have to obsess about it. Like there's a thing you can wear, you know, it's going to work. That's true. That's true. That's why every guy in DC open their closet. And it's like, you know, well, not the gay guys, but the, you know, the the fabros and the V-tores, which is a bunch of just a bunch of slacks and various kinds of blue colored shirts. Right. And I believe there was a certain boss of you guys that limited his wardrobe, so he wouldn't suffer decision fatigue. I believe in this decision fatigue problem, which is why I'm glad that you're endorsing this product. Yeah. I should say just the bento box is free. Sign on to mmbinto.com. That's mmbentio.com. A free service, the stylus will pick stuff out for you. It's not subscription based, so you don't have to worry about getting something that you didn't ask for three months from now. And I think folks will like it. It's good to go like it. Hi, I'm Annemarie Cox. Welcome to With Friends Like These, a show about messy coalitions, the possibilities of friendships and the limits of politics. We have a great show for you today. One of my favorite people in the world, Parker Malloy, who is famous on Twitter, is going to be on to talk about Trump's transgender ban, which is recently reanimated. And we're going to answer a reader question, a rather naughty one, which I am spelling K in O-T-T-Y because it is a troublesome and problematic question. But you guys should also be sending in your naughty questions, you know, the sexy time ones, because we are going to be doing an adult sex ed hour with a former guest who is a conference of sex education teacher. So questions that you were too afraid to ask in high school that you might still have, you should send those in to with friends like pod at Gmail. And please just send in any questions you might have that you want us to take on the air. Let us know if we can use your name. And also include your phone number if you actually want to call in to the show. Other housekeeping items, new merch on the krick-of-media website is going to be coming very soon, including a I am fine in Trump adjusted terms t-shirt, which I am personally very excited about. And also if you are interested in seeing this show live and you happen to be in the vicinity of Austin, Texas, and who wanted want to be in the vicinity of Austin, Texas, it is my favorite city in the world, I am doing a live show there on September 23rd, happens to me my birthday. It is also the Texas Tribune Festival, which is this really cool event they've been doing for a few years now. It's basically for politics nerds around the country. With some focus on Texas, they have a whole podcast track that includes recordings of recode decode and on the media, as well as black on the air, which is Larry Wilmore's show of the dearly departed nightly show. You should come. You can go to texastribune.org slash festival for tickets to that. And first up, I'm going to be talking to Jack Jenkins. He is a religion correspondent for Think Progress, and he's been doing a series of articles on the history of Christian nationalism, I think is particularly relevant at this point in time. So stay tuned for the whole show Parker Maloy at the end and Jack Jenkins coming up. Welcome Jack Jenkins, senior religion reporter at Think Progress. Thank you so much for having me. So I've wanted to talk to you for a while, and this series that you're doing is giving me a great excuse. You've been writing about Christian nationalism and Trump. Yes. A rich vein to mine, it turns out. And I thought I thought of you for this week because, you know, a lot of people have been wondering in the wake of Trump's many egregiously loathsome behaviors. Most very recently, that gosh, he did speak this week in Arizona in a way that wasn't particularly Christian, but that's not what people are talking about. People have time been talking about Charlotte's Phil and the hatred that he condoned there. And how odd it is that his business counsels evaporated, but his evangelical leadership circle or whatever it's called, they're right there. Wait, wait, wait, take that back. There's the exception that proves the rule. One pastor stepped down. That's great. Aarbonar. Yes. But other than that, his evangelical base in terms of, you know, polling and also these actual leaders have stayed really strong and he can't seem to shake them. And you feel like it's this connection to Christian nationalism, which might help explain why that seems so unshakable. Right. It's there are a lot of different reasons, but I am of the persuasion that Christian nationalism is a key component, particularly in helping understand why his cadre of evangelical advisors have refused to drop job ship. It is part and parcel of the rhetoric they use to defend him and the explanations they give for why they continue to support him. So let's first let's look at the history of Christian nationalism. It sounds like some other kinds of nationalism that we could name. And there is this weird, like we should, I guess, with any discussion of Trump, you have to foreground. We're not saying he's Hitler, but we reached that stage in American history where it's important to discount that you're not actually comparing people to Hitler. But it's not directly related. Well, actually, I was going to say it's not directly to greater white nationalism, but there is some overlap. But that's not the history of it. Let's get a little bit into the history of Christian nationalism on its own and then maybe figure out how it ties in with Trump. Right. So American Christian nationalism is as old as America and even older. Historians kind of point to some really early revolutionary is one of the first groups to protest for American independence where the people calling themselves the Connecticut Wits. And there were these really bad poets that actually called for what we might describe as a theocracy. It was an explicitly religious vision of America, although interestingly, vehemently anti-racist religious vision for America. But it was explicit Christian nationalism wanting to create a nation state that was bound by God. Now, those folks did not win out. They were their worldview ultimately fell to the side and our nation, the people we call the founding fathers were the ones who ended up setting up our political structures, which call for separation of church state. Well, almost all of them claimed some version of a Christian identity. It wasn't calling for a theocracy. But as America continued to age, Christian nationalism didn't really go away. It manifested in different worldviews and mindsets. And as they continued to debate each other, one thing that started to emerge is something that some scholars refer to as civil religion. Others refer to as Christian nationalism. And that's kind of like the floor. It's kind of like the base level of Christian nationalism that isn't really tied to one party. One scholar I spoke with, Sam Hansbilly, he said that there are three different markers of this ideology. One is that we tend to kind of deem the both the founding fathers and the founding documents as sacred. We often refer to them as in these sort of grandiose terms. And that's not something that's exclusive to one party or another. You also see this consistent narrative for whoever leads a social movement to kind of claim that they're returning to the origin of America. This idea that they're tapping into what the founders really, really believed and we've diverted from it. And then the third aspect is just that we talk about God a lot in political circles. And that is also not a thing that the conservative wing of American politics owns. You see God talk in both the Democratic Party and in the Republican Party. I mean, arguably the Democratic National Convention last year was more overtly religious than the Republican National Convention. Yeah, it was more overtly religious and also more overtly patriotic. And I want to point out, because I think this is something where you pointed out in your articles. I think important for our American audience to understand is that this civic religion idea, the way that we talk about founding fathers and founding documents and the way that we do use a lot of explicitly Christian terminology, phraseology in our public discussions about politics is a little weird on a global scale. It's not something that other industrialized, modernized nations do a lot of. You don't find this fetishization of the one's founding, especially for such a young country, it does seem a little odd, right? Yeah. Other countries have much longer histories and they don't talk about their founding cohort the same way that we do. It's pretty unique to us. In terms of Western industrialized nations, it is a unique aspect of American culture. And some argue that it's tied to the Protestant Christianity that helped found our nation this idea that's scripture and writing is very important. And so our conversations about what is or is not constitutional tend to sound a lot like scriptural arguments and theological debates, but it isn't something unusual for us. But again, this is just the base, the most basic level of Christian nationalism. Over time, it took over new iterations. It became more extreme among different groups. And so you can fast forward to in the 2000s when more modern Christian nationalists emerge. But one of the most interesting and scary historical examples of Christian nationalism is actually abroad. And that is both in parts of Europe, but more specifically in Nazi Germany during the 1930s. And that's the one that a lot of scholars point to as one of the darkest iterations of this ideology that traditionally has something that Americans have not mimicked. But that was when there were a lot of Christians that were deeply involved in the rise of Nazi Germany. And what you see in those Christian circles, we talk a lot about the Dietrich Bonhoeffer's, the past to help resist Adolf Hitler. But you saw a lot of Christians actually support Adolf Hitler and his rise. One of the things, in addition to the economic problems that Germany had in the 1930s and in addition to their humiliation after World War I, they had this deep antipathy towards changing cultural norms, the fact that women were in the workplace, the fact that we had different cultural shifts around what women could say and what people could do publicly. Their version of Hollywood was deeply offensive to more traditional Germans. And so one of the things that the Nazi party kind of ran on was a return to traditional values and that resonated with a lot of German Christian leaders. And by the time that Adolf Hitler was truly rising in Nazi Germany, scholars tell me, they were making excuses for him. There is this myth that they told that he would walk around with a New Testament in his pocket, which was completely false. But he didn't do a lot of work to dispel it. And they would actively push this narrative. They also compared him to Martin Luther, the founder of Protestant Christianity, who was an even bigger figure in Germany. And they would say the same way that Martin Luther came to save Nazi Germany. So too has Adolf Hitler come to save Germany as a country. And so this explicit conflation of a nationalism, Christianity, and this is the key part, a specific leader, attaching this ideology to a leader and that leader's party is something that can get really dark. And I want to jump in just to point out that what I think is really an important, historical echo here, it's so strange, we have to keep saying like, we're not saying they're Nazis. But is this idea that there was some German Christians after World War I who were deeply upset about the vulgar, what they perceived is a vulgar popular culture in the disintegration of norms. And I'm marking that because when I talk to social conservatives these days, that is what I hear a lot about when they talk about why they're supporting Trump over and over again. I'm sure you hear the same thing, is that they feel like they are being oppressed, that their values aren't under assault. And if you point out to them that Trump represents those fallen values, that they blah, blah, blah, blah, I can't hear you a little bit. Although it's more complicated than that, and we'll get into that. But the thing I hear over and over and over isn't even so much abortion, it is you're going to make me get gay married, basically. And that was what was sort of happening for these German Christians during Hitler's rise. And to your point, I mean, I'm equally reticent to try to make any sort of explicit comparisons between Nazi Germany and America today. But when I called a Holocaust scholar, someone who's an expert in kind of the Christian church's complicity in the Holocaust. Robert Erickson, I was saying, you know, I don't want to make any explicit comparisons. He sent me an email saying he'd already written this comparison. Last year during the campaign, he had seen parallels between the German Christians that had supported Adolf Hitler and the kind of fervency for Donald Trump that you found among evangelical Christians in the United States. Not that they're the same thing, but the idea that you make excuses for a leader who might otherwise represent your ideals. This was something that scholars were already taking notice of last year. So, you know, we would do well to not try to make explicit comparisons, but at the same time, historical patterns are important and important to recognize. So, you know, this is something that I just was following because I was interested in, but you're already finding a deep level of interest within its classic communities. And I think this is where we want to get into how it is that his evangelical counsel has not forsaken him, right? I think for some people outside, you know, social conservative circles, there's a top level of dissonance, which is that he is one of the most vulgar presidents we've, he has the, I would say, I don't know, I don't Andrew Jackson's pretty vulgar. He, one of the most vulgar presidents we've ever had personally involved in all kinds of behavior that social conservatives explicitly denounce, right? From adultery to gambling, to avarice, I mean, we could go down seven deadlies, right? And then we would find some sloth, I think, is even in there, right? He's got him covered. And so for, I think people outside of evangelical or religious circles, they're like, how can you support this guy? But what you've written about is that his very fallen nature seems to be a feature, not a buck, for some evangelicals who are trying to do this, this reading of history, or this reading of our current moment, right? Right. Something that has emerged as a narrative within evangelical supporters of Trump is this idea that the lack of knowledge that he has is in some ways evidence of a certain kind of anointing by God. So one aspect that you're hearing a lot in an evangelical circle is Robert Jeffress has been saying this, particularly Paula White said this just this week, one of the prosperity gospel preacher who's one of Trump's most trusted spiritual confidants, is the idea that one, God lifts up specific leaders into power. And two, that the fact that Trump is someone who is in many ways, reprehensible to evangelical values in terms of how you carry yourself is similar to biblical precedent is what they argue. So Old Testament kings like David and Cyrus, folks whose morals were dubious at best were still used by God. And so from their perspective, someone like Trump could easily fall into that category. Now, you might say, well, that could be applied to anyone, but they're willing to apply it specifically to Trump. And I think part of that is because what they'll say in their next breath and what Paula White said in her next breath was that this presidency guarantees them conservative judges on the Supreme Court and in the lower courts. And as long as Trump is willing to supply that, then he can be an instrument of God. And that is a theology that they're overlaying on to him. Now, it's not really consistent. It doesn't seem that they apply the same logic to Barack Obama when he was president of the United States. And Robert Jeffress said that he was paving the way for the Antichrist. But this is still the theology that they're running with right now. And it's why they would be hesitant to abandon them, abandon Trump because from their perspective, he is an instrument of God. In some ways, I mean, they've created their perfect theological echo chamber, right? Like epistemological closure, which is that the more he misbehaves, the more he seems to in their way that they've set it up, the way they've set up their argument, he proves that he is an instrument of God. The more he shows that he himself is ignorant of God, the more he shows that he himself has fallen, the more proof they have that this must be God acting, right? Like that's the argument is that he's fighting for us. And he would not have chosen to do that on his own because he's such a biblical dunderhead. And it even goes deeper than that. One of the things Paula White said in this big interview this week was one of the things you can see as evidence of his anointing is that he surrounds himself with Christians, right? And that's a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? So if people who were his evangelical advisors never leave his side, but then the evidence for his anointing is the fact that he always has evangelical advisors surrounding him and promoting him, it never breaks. Like you said, it's an ecological echo chamber that never has to fall in on itself because it perpetuates itself. As long as he's giving them the judges that they want, as long as he's denouncing the things they want him to denounce, his personal behavior isn't a material issue for them and his personal ignorance of the gospel isn't an issue for them. He's shown like so, like he's zero, he has zero curiosity about anything in the world, but there's something especially comical about his lack of curiosity about God. Right. Right. It's just... And it's, I mean, it's one of those things where, I mean, when he reportedly like spoke to two Presbyterian ministers, he says he's Presbyterian when he's spoke with two Presbyterian ministers in his office, he seemed confused as to what religion they belong to and whether they were evangelicals or not. Or Christians are not. Didn't he like say something about like, are like evangelicals Christian? I mean, I don't want to... Yeah. He seemed confused about that. Yeah. It's a different time to see you confused as to where Mormons fall in a theological spectrum. Well, there's a lot of people. There's... Right. Arguably, evangelicals are also confused about where Mormons fall in their lives. Fair. I love my Mormons brothers and sisters. I'm saying... Kind bars. Yes. Did you guys get your free samples of kind bars? You know what? I don't care if they're free or not. Our office is chocolate-blocking kind bars, and I eat them like kind bars. I mean, I just eat them all the time. Well, do you have a favorite? I like a dark chocolate plus a nut. So I don't care if it's almond, I don't care if it's peanut butter. I just like a dark chocolate plus some kind of a nut or a luvium. Yes. What they do very well with kind is balance the salty and the sweet. They do. They do. Some bars, I think, go too sweet. My favorite bar is actually one of the pressed fruit bars that has jalapeno in it, which I know sounds really weird. It's like kale, pineapple, and jalapeno, which... That feels like a very complex flavor, and I go more for the brute force of chocolate and nuts. Yes. Well, you know, brute. That's in... What is your hallmark but brute force, really? So I think that works out. Kind is offering free sample boxes not to just podcasters, but actual humans out there can get a free sample box of 10 different kinds of kind bars, including... You're stupid if you don't do this. What? It's stupid to not do this. It is, actually. I didn't know how good this offer was. Well, you have to pay shipping. Oh, but it's still great. It is pretty great. You get 10 kind bars, including this pineapple kale jalapeno one, which I have actually not seen in the wild the first time I saw it was in the box. So you go to kindsnax.com slash friends. This is sincerely like the fuel that I use all the time. Kindsnax.com slash friends. That's right. That's it. We'll say another important component of this, and one of the things that made sure this up is, you know, we were talking before about the historical origins of Christian nationalism. The more contemporary iteration of Christian nationalism and the one that you're really seeing preached by a lot of the folks that surround Trump kind of emerged around the Bush era. And these were groups of people who kind of created their own Christian universe, as it were. These were folks who were... They created their own homeschooling systems, where they have books that, you know, insist that the Earth is only a certain age. They insist that, you know, America was founded as a Christian nation. Now, and these are all textbooks that their children read it. The textbooks all cite each other, by the way. But it is... They create this universe. And then some of them ascribe to an ideology that is often described as dominionism, the idea that, you know, humans are supposed to have dominion over the Earth, and they extend that to the political sphere. And so it's the idea that Christians have not just, you know, an obligation, but, you know, a deep spiritual need and charge to take over the American government and all governments. That's a part and parcel of who they should be as Christians. And so when you find someone like Donald Trump who lands into that framework, and they land... He lands into this group that a lot of these evangelical leaders weren't rock stars. They were what, you know, Jeff Charlotte, another journalist who covered a lot of this, referred to as B and C listers within the evangelical world, you know, they kind of forged this weird alliance that has now turned into what we see today, which is that they're the ones who are sticking by him. And when Trump has one of the worst weeks of his presidency last week, the person they send out to advocate for him on the weekend new shows is Jerry Falwell Jr, who's been one of his staunchance advocates and who also articulates a lot of Christian nationalist ideals. So like you said, it kind of emerged out of itself. They took old school Christian nationalism to a very different level. And it's part of what has propping up Trump. And we've been talking about the leadership here. I know it's harder to report on the flock, but I would like to discuss that at least a little bit, which is his leadership is sticking with him. The evangelical leadership is sticking with him. Are there divisions among evangelicals themselves, the actual churchgoers? Because one of the most fascinating, you know, pull findings of the entire election for me, and I think you and I've discussed it just between ourselves, was that although evangelical, subscribed evangelicals largely went for Trump, people who were churchgoers did not necessarily, like people who actually fulfilled the actions of someone who we would think of as being evangelical were less supportive of him. Right. That was certainly true early on during the primaries. His initial evangelical support did not come from, you know, fervent churchgoers in the evangelical realm. But the interesting thing is he's gotten it back by election day and then especially post-election day, even churchgoing evangelicals are included in the percentage that holds firm for him. Now, are there divisions? Absolutely. I mean, you know, one of his staunchest opponents, and most vocal opponents on the right was Russell Moore, who runs the political arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. He's been quieter since Trump was elected, but he was a passionate opposeder of Trump's throughout the campaign. And so you do see some splintering within evangelical circles of folks who, you know, often tend to be more closely aligned to institutions like Wheaton College or the Southern Baptist Convention, things like that, more, more, quote, unquote, institutional conservatives tend to not be as sold on Trump. But there does seem to be a solidifying of support even among those evangelicals who, you know, quote, unquote, held their nose when they supported Trump. I've spoken to a few of them, you know, evangelicals in South Carolina and other places where they don't 100% like Trump, but they do 100% like that neo-gorsage is a Supreme Court justice. And I do 100% like that they're probably going to get more conservative judges in the lower courts as well. So, and actually, to your point, Paula White specifically addressed that in her speech this week, and other evangelical leaders have done that too, where they say, you know, even if you don't like him, pray for him, and then leads into a conversation about judges. So it does seem to me in conversations I've had with, you know, everyday evangelicals that even if they think Trump himself is repugnant, they do, they are willing to make an exception as long as one, they get the judges they want, and two, and this comes up a lot, as long as Mike Pence is also still in the picture, you often hear evangelicals say, well, you know, I'm not really sure about what Trump said, but have you heard about how great Mike Pence is and how godly of a man Mike Pence is, you know, you hear that a lot. And so they, it's left unsaid, but the sense I get is often is like, well, if Trump goes down in flames, we still get Mike Pence. And from an evangelical Christian perspective, he's far more in line with the traditional image of a conservative right wing evangelical Christian leader. Although you pointed this out in one of your articles, and I feel compelled to point it now, which is that Pence himself was a B and C lister to, right? Like he was not considered like a rising star was not did not have a very much of a national reputation, except in so far as he was mocked and ridiculed by people. And he was kind of failed talk show host radio talk show host. But he's been he's been lifted up. And he is he's incredibly I mean, he is very far right evangelical conservative. I mean, I think sometimes we sort of lose sight of that, like, he's not in the mainstream of I mean, he's more like a how he's a he's a freedom caucus guy, right? Not a Senate Republican. Right. And he's I mean, he used to describe himself as Rush Limbaugh on decaf, but the key part of that is that he was still comparing himself to Rush Limbaugh. I mean, his views, a lot of the stuff he articulated when he was in in Indiana are far more right wing than you know, you would you would think given the kind of the tame way that he describes himself. And also, I mean, the thing about Mike Pence is he in Indiana, the form of religion, the version of religious liberty that he articulated in Indiana during that huge fight over, you know, a religious liberty bill that would lead to the discrimination of LGBT people. I mean, that that version was was there were other people who were who are articulating it and trying to pass laws on it, but he became the figurehead for it. And now, you know, he's he's second in command. He's the vice president and were he to become president. That's the version of religious liberty he's going to articulate. And it's one that has been vehemently opposed by even people of faith because it could be discriminatory against other people of faith. But but that is kind of what he has in his cache. That's that's a belief system that he has supported and articulated for decades. I still come down on the side. If you if you put a gun to my head, which more than more these days, it does feel like there is a gun to my head that President Pence is marginally better, but still quite terrifying. He was moved. That's the one thing that people have noted is that when when Mike Pence was governor of Indiana, the outcry and the protests did did move the needle a little bit there. Well, someone who said for for a lot of things with Trump, right? Well, I mean, the thing that the argument that I usually make about Pence is that you can make deals with someone who has actual goals and a sense of purpose or duty beyond his immediate self enrichment, right? Like if someone has some kind of thing that they want, you can you can make a deal with them. Right. I mean, Pence plays the game. Like he's a politician, but still a politician at the end of the day. And that's a thing that you can you can deal with in our framework. I mean, Trump breaks so many of our frameworks because it's not clear what his true agenda is and whether or not he'll stick to it if he has one. Right. Yeah. That means he's completely unpredictable and completely self-involved. So you can't you can't know what he wants or nobody wants to do so therefore you can't make a deal with him. And he's terrifying. Okay. Anyway, I'm trying to think if there's anything else we should touch on and this this covers it. I mean, I guess I as you were talking about the, you know, the flock of evangelicals as you were talking about just churchgoers and and self-adudned and if I'd evangelicals and how they're consolidating under Trump, I did have a thought, which is this is making me just terribly sad. I had a really great conversation with Evan McMullen before the election LDS man who identifies as Christian. I think that's the case. And we were talking about where resistance to Trump comes from. And he placed it in his belief in God, but also just in things greater than himself, right? That his feeling of resistance to Trump comes from when you believe there are things that are more important than you more important than America, more important, you know, than this moment, right? Like that is where you find the sustenance to resist something that's chaotic, something that's maybe superficially enticing because of the excitement, because of the enrichment, whatever, because you have your your eyes and your heart set upon something bigger. And I've taken a lot of comfort in that idea. When I think about the nations, Christians and other people of faith and whether or not we will be able to come together, if things get even worse, things are pretty bad right now. But what you're telling me really makes me think, Oh, maybe that's that maybe that's an illusion of mine. I wouldn't necessarily say it's an illusion. I don't I think there's something to that. I think there is one of the things about institutional norms that Trump and Trumpism shakes is that institutions are shorted up by a by a coalition. I mean, they're they're supported by a broad swath of people because we got to figure out a way to all live together. And but the problem is when individual parts of that coalition become insular, that that means that they can be out for themselves. And not all evangelicals support Christian nationalism. In fact, Christian nationalism is really only a small subset of of white evangelical Christianity. And it's not just white evangelicals, it's spread throughout different forms of evangelicalism. But when you articulate a message that says the most important thing is your vision of Christianity and your core driving idea is to actualize that version of Christianity in positions of power over and against everyone else. And when you demonize quite literally any sort of opposition to that, you know, it is you lose that sense, the sense of having a belief in something bigger than yourself evaporates because the thing that's bigger than yourself is a God that shores up your belief and specifically only your worldview. And that is that is a difficult thing to combat politically and theologically. And so when you see this is why historians get scared when they see people in politics, whether they're Christian nationalists or any other kind of ideology that becomes self-involved whenever they see that land in our political structure, it sends off alarm bells. So I'm not disagreeing with you. I do think that having a vision of something greater than yourself is important. I'm just saying when something greater than you is that you are 100% right, that can be dangerous. Well, it's funny because I actually I would say that that's the difference between a kind of faith that gives you the ability to resist authoritarianism and a kind of faith that holds up authoritarianism is that the faith that holds up authoritarianism is small. That's a small vision of God, you know, like you were making whatever it is that you believe smaller when you say that it just supports what you have to say, right? Like what I found so powerful about Evan McMullen's way of thinking about things was that it was expansive view of faith, right? Like he was not limiting it to LDS tradition or Christian tradition or, you know, you know, monotheism, it was when you believe in these big things, you know, that are a vision of a better and more just world. Like that is how you gain the resilience to fight things that are keeping people down. It's because you can believe in this thing that's bigger, that will give you strength, that will pull us all forward. But the kind of faith that these Christian nationalists are talking about and that I do think it's kind of filtered out to a lot of evangelical tradition that isn't explicitly nationalist. It's a smaller kind of faith, I feel like, you know, like it's a smaller vision of God. Well, I will say one of the interesting things about this and that you brought up McMullen is that to your point, I mean, technically, the LDS church and Mormonism is explicitly Christian nationalist. I mean, they do believe that's right. That's right. That's right. That's explicitly sacred. And yet, you see arguably more overt resistance to Trumpism within LDS circles than you do in many white evangelical circles. And I think there's a myriad of different reasons for that and you need to talk to an expert on Mormon history to really get a full understanding of that. But I think part of it is the Mormon experience is rooted in the idea of America, what it means to be American is to live outside of yourself. Like to both, you can both support your own thing. And the LDS church has done a really great job of trying to protect their own. So I'm not trying to like law the LDS churches, political views and all things. But I will say that that does seem to be a significant difference between the kind of Christian nationalism that's being articulated by these white evangelicals and other forms of evangelicalism right now who were circling around Trump. You don't see a lot of LDS leaders as part of that inner circle. And that might be an alternative vision, as it were. If you're going to be Christian nationalists, there are different ways of doing it. I guess that's where we're going to have to end. It was really good to talk to you. People can look for your series on Christian nationalism in Trump at ThinkProgress. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. So you and I don't share a bed. That's true, Anna. At least not yet. But I guess no reason to rule it out. It might happen someday. We're like Trump and Venezuela. Things. It's always an option. Things might get tight at cricket headquarters who might have to double up on rooms. But parachute sheets is actually, I shared a bed with my husband and we got our parachute sheets and he is super picky and he loves these sheets. The only ad that he's actually asked to come on and be, he wanted to personally endorse this product was for parachute sheets. We have the linen ones. I don't know which ones you have. Fabro raves about the linen ones. They're great. They're great. And I keep saying that I just, I'll just sleep at the foot of the bed, but they don't let me. That's where Leo sleeps. I don't even understand what that joke was. But wait, in their bed, you would. It's a it's a ruffle slash. I'm, you know, that's a joke there. Oh boy. It's fine. So anyway, the linen sheets, I guess, John could have test like they do get shaft softer with every wash, which is one of those things like you don't quite believe. But then it does happen. That's true. That's softer with every wash. Yeah. That was unsure about linen at first. And then as you continue to wash them, just better and better. Again, and also I personally like, and I don't know about you, John, I like a neatly made bed. And linen does take the pressure off of making it perfect. You know, my friend, my friend Walker said this to me, and it really stuck with me, which is if you bake, if you make your bed in the morning, your bed has made your whole life. And if you don't, it's never made. Make your bed each day as if it's your last. Is that no, it's more that it's two seconds in the morning. And then your bed is always made 100% of the time, right? Except when you're sleeping in it, and that doesn't even make sense. I don't know. There's something about the intuitiveness of it that really stuck with me and didn't change my behavior. I still it's a. Well, if people are interested in our rate after our raves about parachute, it's parachute home.com slash friends for free shipping and returns. And you guys probably know they use the returns for habitat for humanity. So that's cool. Not that you'll return them. But if you do, it does go to a good cause parachute home.com slash friends. I just wanted to tell you just as an aside, like I didn't want to pull you in to talk about non LGBTQ stuff because I don't want to just have like, you know, sure. And and I totally appreciate that. You know, I don't want to hold you. Yeah, but sometimes, you know, sometimes very specific LGBT stuff comes up and it's like I, I clearly have thoughts on this. I know you do and it would be weird to talk to a non LGBTQ person about this, right? Like, yeah, that would be kind of weird if it was just like, all right, like I think most people can can can at least agree on that. But yeah, so Parker Maloy, writer it up worthy. That asshole's at it again. Right. So I'm going to, so my point of view on this, I, so when that transgender tweet came a couple weeks ago, that was horrifying. But it did seem to quickly come to light that he had once again, misread the world, misread, especially his generals, as he likes to call them. And lots of people, including some conservative Republicans, came out and at the very least said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Right. With other people saying outright, even some Republicans, don't do this. And his own military said, we're not going to take this as an order, right? We're going to wait for this to go to the proper channels. But apparently now it's, it's going through proper channels. That seems to be from, from what I understand from what, because so the Wall Street Journal reported that it looks like they're, the White House is going to release their like, the memo, the Hells, the Department of Defense to start trying to put this ban into place again, with, you know, and that should be coming sometime this week, probably by the time that people hear this. So that seems, seems to be the case. My, my kind of hope with, with that was that, that he tweeted something completely ridiculous and then forgot about it. But, you know, or that it was just some posturing or something like that. But it, it seems, it seems to actually be a real policy that's being pushed into place. And, you know, the, this LGBT publication, the, the Washington blade or Los Angeles blade, they're basically the same thing. They, you know, they also reported that, you know, they said a White House senior official who spoke a condition of anonymity, said that Pence was the driving force behind the ban. And he's been spearheading the trans ban reinstatement since last May. So what, you know, it's kind of, which, which is, I mean, kind of when it was, when, when it was announced that it was going to be pulled back. It just doesn't make sense to, to tell people who, who want to put their lives at risk, lives on the line that they can't serve in the military. And all the reasons that have been put out there, whether it's the, you know, Trump saying it's the tremendous costs of, of healthcare for trans people, that's just simply not the case. That's not true. You know, and other people will say, well, what about deployment trans people can't be sent into combat, they absolutely can. And I think that there's this impression that trans people are constantly having all sorts of surgeries, which is weird. Sorry. I mean, that is like, that is funny to me. I mean, it shouldn't be, but like the idea that that's would be a life of a trans person would be just constant medication and surgery. That's not what it's like. I mean, right. Oh, absolutely. I mean, like here's the thing. So as a trans woman, I, you know, it's like my day to day is like, oh, I have to take hormones. So, you know, these hormones that without insurance would cost only like $57 a month. It's not super expensive. You know, it's not, these aren't like $1,000 pills or anything like that. They're super cheap with insurance cost me $3. That's kind of just it. And, you know, it's, it's not, it's really not a big deal. You know, if trans people have, you know, and not every person has surgery, but if they have that, you know, the quote unquote, the surgery, you know, downstairs renovations, finishing the basement. I think it's the, you know, if they have a gender confirmation surgery, you know, it might put them out of commission for like six to eight weeks, which is just, you know, recovering from any sort of surgery can be like that. ACL taintics longer. Is something like I looked it up and it's, it's the cost of fixing a compound lake fracture, which I'm sure that happens in the, in the military all the time, you know, so the, and it's something that people would have once and that would be it. So I don't, there's no logical reasoning behind this. The government commissioned a study on the issue before pulling this back. This has been something that's been years in the making of studying and trying to understand the real world impact that this would have. So we've, so we've got that. And you know, there's a 112 page, page report that, that says that this would not be a big deal, that there's no medical reason that trans people can't serve, which remember that that was the initial reason for the ban in the first place, was that it was a medical issue. And so whether you're talking about this from a cost, from a medical stance, or from a readiness stance, there is no excuse to, to do this. And when he first tweeted that out, I wrote, I wrote an article for Upworthy where I interviewed a number of trans people who are in the military. And a lot of them, a lot of them went into, into the military, because they were lower income or homeless, or all of these other factors that exist in society. To then take that away from them, the one sort of outlet where people can have some stability if they need it, which whatever your thoughts are on the military, it's a, it's a, it's a jobs program, essentially. It's a lot of too, like people who are, who are in desperate need in a lot of cases. So, it's really just so sad and so unfortunate that, that we're in this position, where we're going to pull back this policy right after people who may have been in the military and were closeted, were encouraged to come out because they were told it was safe, they're now going to be kicked out. So it's, it's, it's like if don't ask, don't tell was, was repealed, and then they tried to put it back in and they're like, okay, all the people who came out as gay get out of the military. So it's, it's, it's, it's just cruel. Yeah, it's unbelievably cruel. And we should point out also that the Lambda Legal Defense Fund is on this, as I'm sure other human rights organizations are as well. I particularly liked the tweet that they sent yesterday after the breaking news. Trump set to implement transgender military ban. They tweeted out puts on Cape made of legal briefs. And there are legal arguments that are going to be had over this. And it is also clear that there is a lot of support for keeping the current policy in place, in part, because it did take a long time to come up with the army does not like to go back on things that it came up with, right? The, the military, not just the army, the military, once they decide to do something, they really like to keep on doing it. They're the definition of conservative in that sense. Yeah. And I do think this is going to face some problems in the legal arena. But I also know that this is an important issue to talk about in the context of all the fucking dog whistles that Trump has sent in his reign of terror in public. Because that's also what this is. Is it is a message? Oh, absolutely. You know, it's it's it's essentially is meant to meant to suggest that trans people aren't, aren't legitimate, aren't functioning members of society who can contribute things and can, you know, who who essentially just are, it paints trans people as freaks, which is, which is, you know, it plays to his base. And, you know, public policy polling put out, they did, they recently did a national survey, where they found that something like 62% of Trump supporters support kicking, kicking all trans people out of the military. And, you know, if you look at everyone else, you know, people who voted for Clinton, Stein, Johnson, whatever, none of them are like none of their supporters think that trans people should be kicked out of the military. It's just Trump supporters. So it's it's a total dog whistle to his base. And that's I think one thing that's that's going to get kind of, that's that's going to be kind of scary as as his administration goes on. When he gets backed into a corner, he makes a big play to his base. You know, people were, you know, criticizing him over Charlottesville recently. And now we have, you know, this news just sort of leaks out that this is coming this week. So it's like all these things are planned. And then he waits for, you know, the news cycle to take a dark turn on him and he and they just drop this other in, you know, information out there, which is it's just so sad. I've really honestly never felt is as just, I guess, unaccepted, you know, in society, like since I came on as trans, I, which, you know, it's been it's been years. And it's things that things have not been getting better. You know, as trans visibility went up, I don't know that trans acceptance has necessarily followed suit at that same, same rate. You know, now more people know that trans people exist. But they're also very open about hating trans people. And now we have the president of the United States pushing stuff like that. And we have Mike Pence behind the scenes pushing stuff like that. And that's what really scares me about the people who, who think that if we just impeach Trump, things will be great. No, it puts Pence in charge. And Pence is he's a smooth politician who will implement these sort of hateful policies, but then, you know, cover them in language around readiness and cost, you know, make it make it sound better politically. And it's hard because a lot of times I'll say stuff to I'll say, Hey, this is like last night on on on Twitter, I said that this is really harmful. And this is bigoted. And this is just this is horrible. And I had people in my mentions, you know, saying to me, saying stop with this identity politics. And it's one of those things where it's just like, how do I defend myself? How do I defend other people like me? You know, if every single time they're gonna be like, why are you focused on identity politics instead of things that matter? And it's like, because Trump is making these things that matter, things that are happening in the world. And it's just getting it's getting darker and more harmful. And I, you know, I really don't know how things get better from here. I hope they do. But I don't think I don't see any time in the in the short term things, making a turn for the better. I am torn about how to respond because I feel like as your friend, I want to tell you things are going to be okay. But as a political analyst, I agree. I mean, I can tell you as a friend that I'll be there for you. Sure. And I know, I know that the people who are really great allies will continue to be there and continue to use their voice for good. That is not even a question. You know, that is something that I cherish my like my friends who will go out of their way to stand up for trans people in any given situation. It will just be like, hey, knock it off. That's not cool. Because sometimes it's hard constantly having to defend yourself or constantly having to defend other people like you. Where it's good if you've got like a friend or an ally to kind of step in every once in a while and, you know, kind of be like, okay, you take a breather. I'm gonna, I'm gonna push back on this whatever horrible thing in the day. But a lot of these, a lot of these issues, you know, like, you were just, you know, saying lambda legal, you know, going to fight this in courts. You know, who is going to be appointing people to courts? And, you know, the Supreme Court is, Gorsuch is very, very, very conservative on this issue. And he, I don't picture him ever giving this a truly fair, you know, even handed look. And I imagine that every other person that Trump puts on the court, you know, however many it is, will kind of look at it the same way, which is why I think that, you know, if someone honest, if someone really wants to, really wants to help trans people, I think it's important to, to elect a democratic majority in the Senate in 2018, which I know is a very, very difficult path. But that's the one thing that will prevent Trump from, from putting extremist far right people on the courts for the, for decades, you know, which will have lasting harmful effects. That I think is the most important thing here, in my opinion, because there is no check on him. It's very few Republicans are willing to stand up to him on, on these sorts, sorts of issues, you know, and it's great every once in a while to get some good news like, oh, three senators voted against a, or three Republican senators voted against a historically unpopular bill like that. It's kind of sad that it's like, hey, there's this bill with 15% approval and it's going to kill a bunch of people. And it's like, oh, we were able to peel off three. It's like, that's something where it should have been, you know, it should have been a massive majority of people voting against that just because it's, it was political suicide to vote for that. But they did because when Trump puts things out there, they're afraid he's going to tweet about them. And you know, they're afraid of stuff like that right now. So I think it's, you know, if we really care about checks and balances when it comes to the courts, when it comes to, you know, Congress, even, you know, keeping, keeping tabs on, you know, what he's doing, I think it's important to elect a Democratic majority in 2018. That's, that's why I, while I think that the talk about impeachment and talk about investigating Trump is, is important. And those things should continue, you know, investigations should totally continue. But the focus for the sake of marginalized groups, of all sorts, for the sake of voting rights, for the sake of trans people, you know, all of these things, 2018 has to be a big focus. These bras are far more comfortable than doing an ad with guys about bras. That's uncomfortable. And bras are usually uncomfortable and bras shopping usually sucks. Most women have bras that don't fit them because the process of getting fitted for bra is kind of intrusive, as you might imagine. I have not imagined now you can. And I think people just don't want to do it. So you kind of get sized once and then you just buy that size. But Third Love has a fit finder that they figure out what kind of bra works for you. And whether it is, you know, a t-shirt bra or a soft cup bra or a dimmy bra, I know this is like, probably sounds like a foreign language to you, I guess. Well, it's just like, you know, I'm in a gay couple over here. I mean, I have just like, like my contact with bras is so, so low. It's like, I mean, I just don't think about them. I don't come across them. I just have like, even like, you know, you know, John's got bras in his house, right? I don't. I don't see them. You literally like don't really know what a bra looks like, probably. Like it. I mean, from the movies. Yeah, from the movies. Well, Third Love has these great bras. They have a bunch of different styles too. And like I said, the dimmy cup and the t-shirt bra, but they also have a halter back bra just to get really in the weeds for the ladies or whoever else might be interested in wearing a bra. There's a lot of trends right now that you have bra straps showing, especially kind of like tank backs and spaghetti straps. And the trend is to have your bra be pretty enough that it can show, especially in the back. Really? Yeah. And these race are back bras have like a laced back. So if they peek out from under your shirt or dress, like it looks like intentional and cool. Our society is becoming a burlesque show. I know. It's it's Germany after World War one, I tell you. I'm going to go on the hustings in more ways than one campaign for purity. But they have this fit finder. They have all these really cool options. They also sell underwear. They also sell bras in half cup sizes, which is a thing I didn't even know existed. And you may be a half cup size. It's if you have half a boob. It's it's not what it is. It's as if you have half a boob on top of your boob in a way, because you're it's a half more. And you know, you're in between sizes. How much more words are on that page of yours, you think? I'll get out of this fast because I just need to note that you can try their bras for free. You pay $299 shipping. You can have it for 30 days. You can wash it. You can wear it. You can cut out the tags. You can do whatever it is that you need to do to find out if a bra is comfortable for you. Thirdlove.com slash friends. Thirdlove.com slash friends. I think this is actually a really good segue to a piece of listener mail that I got that I thought of you as someone who could be helpful in responding. It is from I won't say who it was from because we are in this place. We haven't quite worked out how to give people's permission for sure that they want to use their names, but I'll read it. Hi there. I am a military spouse of a deployed infantryman with a four year old son. It is hard to put into words how infuriating the last year has been. I've called my senators, asked my friends to do so, and march to the women's march. I want to run for office someday. I want to do the right thing and go to rallies and protests. I want to be as active as possible. But if I'm honest, I am afraid. If I wasn't a mother, I know I wouldn't feel this way. But now that I am, I'm terrified of getting injured or killed for doing what's right because then who is there for my son? I imagine the count argument is, well, we are afraid to and we don't have a choice to stay home. What kind of person do you want your son to emulate? What kind of world are you helping to give him? I know there's no excuse for silence, especially as a middle class white woman who's enjoyed white privilege her entire life. I can't describe the emotional turmoil this has caused me the pull to answer the call to action at once felt with an equal pull to stay at home safe with my son who needs me. Thank you for reading. Wow. Well, I mean, I think it's clear that she her heart is clearly in the right place and that she's very that she's thought a lot about this, which is, I mean, half the battle, which there's definitely got to be some major credit there. Right. And I think that she's articulated the truth about some people, this is something we talked about on the on the show last week. Some people don't have a choice about being involved in this, right? Like you, right? Like this isn't this fight is your fight every day of your life. Right. People like her and me can opt out if we want to, but she also hasn't opted out. Let's make that very clear. Like she's engaged. And she's just being very honest about about her fears, which having fears is normal and human. And we all have to have to kind of think about how we balance our actions versus our fears and understanding which ones are rational, which ones aren't. And I mean, these are all sadly very rational fears. Yeah. But there are there are a lot of ways she can get involved and still make a physical presence. Right. That. We'll make a difference so that other people can be present at these things where we can agree, like the numbers matter. I think you're totally right. That there's no true substitute for a physical presence, but everybody has to make their own decisions on what they're comfortable doing. And there are other things you can do to help in these situations. You know, when these larger, these larger scheduled marches, you know, like, you know, the larger, the women's March, the science March, and all of those, you know, these are planned ahead of time. And one thing you can kind of do is, you know, if these marches have infrastructure, you can have organizers and websites like, just it's good to check that out and see if like, see if there's anything they're asking for. Maybe they, someone needs someone to help make signs or drive, you know, drive or donate, donate money or, you know, food or stuff like that. Like there are, there are ways you can, you can help that aren't necessarily, you know, the, you know, marching, right, the physical being in the March. I do want to say that I do think that's what people also need to look at, though, is the physical infrastructure of a March, right? Like, we need more marches and rallies and protests and vigils. I do believe that. I do think that that is what puts an issue on the map and what makes it impossible to ignore. So I hope that that is something that people take away from this. And this woman who I think, I want to say also, if you write this kind of letter, you're probably doing a lot. You know, like, clearly, she's doing a lot. Yeah, she puts so much thought and, you know, if you've put that much thought into things, you clearly care, which is, I feel like she personally is maybe off the hook for this, you know, she, she personally sounds like she's doing a lot. But I highlight her letter because I do think that everyone needs to ask themselves for real, you know, can I do this? Is it possible for me to do this? And if I don't feel safe, why don't I feel safe? And is there something that I can do about that? Right? I just finished reading this amazing essay by Gary Will's in his book about the 1968 election about the students mobilization March on Washington, which is like the third largest March on Washington to protest the Vietnam War. And he talked about how the students have well planned it was. I think the women's march is similar, but they had this entire infrastructure for the students March that included training marshals to for nonviolence to intercede for and when people got in each other's face. You know, they had people handing out water and food. They had people, you know, organizing carpools. Like that happens for any huge March. And you can be a part of that. And also, like, they're things like vigils, but they're sometimes regular protests and and watches that you can go to. And I think those count too, not just the huge marches, like anywhere you can be, like a huge March might be a target where you don't feel safe. Right. Go to something else. Yeah. And to your point about the importance of being there, I mean, I see a lot of people say things about, well, does this marching and protesting really make a difference? And I think it absolutely does. You know, just just last weekend, we saw what what happened in in Boston. I mean, you had this tiny group of, you know, white supremacists or white nationalists or whatever they call themselves these days. Alt right, all light, whatever. Free speech advocates is the latest thing. I don't think they actually mean that. So yeah, that's that's got a kind of lovely, very euphemistic, you know, things where it's like, Oh, if you're counter protesting me, then clearly you hate free speech. It's like, no, we just don't like racists. But the massive response to that, the massive counter protest, I know, just watching, watching that from, you know, want to online, you know, is kind of, it gives, it gives me hope in really dark times sometimes, where you see that and you're just like, there are so many of us that care about these things. And then you read the news that other marches that were planned, other pro, other quote unquote free speech protests have been canceled or moved online or whatever. And it shows that it works. And it's important. And it's not a matter of, you know, one thing I think that a lot of those, you know, the white nationalists crowd, you know, what they do is they they show up with, you know, with guns and militias and all that stuff where it's, it's meant to it's meant to silence. Terrorize, terrorize people. Yeah. You know, but when you can get a big group of people just to make their presence known, and it's not in a, in a we're going to scare you into silence kind of way, but it just we're going to let you know that, that this is what we stand for type of way. I think that that is one of the most powerful things you can do. And, you know, in our democracy, you know, it, it lets it sends a message to elected officials to the, to your neighbors, to let them know what you care about and maybe influence what they care about. And also, it reminds people there are more of us than them. There really are, you know, I mean, their Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. We should never, ever, ever, ever forget that, you know, and the people who want to repress the rights of others want to do that because there are more of us than them, you know, and, and one thing they can never deny is numbers. They can never deny that. That's why Trump is so obsessed with crowd size. Yeah. And you, the most powerful message you can send him is, is making a crowd. So we need to make more crowds. So Parker, thank you. I think we got to a place that's actually relatively uplifting compared to where we started. Although let's never, let's not forget that people should be engaged on this trans ban too. Do you have any recommendations specifically for people who might want to be engaged on this? And this side is tagging you out on Twitter, like, Hey, Parker, you can take the day off. I got it. Like what, what else can people do? You know, I think that there are really the best thing people can do right now is to check out organizations like Lambda Legal or Human Rights Campaign or National Center for Transgender Equality or Outserve is another one because they're going to have some sort of strategy and they're going to need help that goes beyond just trans people and goes beyond just, you know, the LGBTQ community. It's we're, this is something that that straight cis people, you know, can can help out on. And I'm sure that we will need their help. I'm just not sure how that's going to be just yet. Well, stay tuned. I'm sure it'll come up. And one thing that people can do, I just want to remind them that in your everyday conversations, you can speak up for trans people. And that counts, that matters. Absolutely. Like if someone says something transphobic to you or around you, you know, like, don't let it pass. Like, that's, that's, that's part of this fight is just to let your acceptance be known. It's not enough, but it's part of it. And people should should know that. So well, yeah. And a lot of a lot of people don't necessarily realize that they're, that they are, that they are saying something that is either based on incorrect information or based on, you know, it's just ignorance and not malice. And those, those types of conversations, just, you know, popping in and being like, Oh, hey, just FYI, you know, that, that thing that, that meme that you shared isn't based on, you know, is, isn't accurate. Trans people aren't actually, actually monsters, you know, whatever the case may be. There's read up on it, be educated. And you can eat after midnight and don't turn into granddlands. All right. Thank you so much, Parker. Thanks for having me. We'll have you back. And that is it for this week's show. You can find in the show notes, the Twitter handles for all the guests, as well as the show's Twitter handle. And again, the email for the show, which I'll say with friends like pod at Gmail. And also any relevant links, links to Jack's articles and links to articles that Parker has written. And I wanted to thank everyone who's been giving feedback so far. We've gotten a ton of really interesting questions. Again, it would be helpful if you included in your question, if you have one, whether or not we can read it on the air, how to pronounce your name and your phone number, if you want to be included in an actual podcast. You guys help. You're a vital part of the show. We could not do it without you. Thanks so much. We'll be back next week."
