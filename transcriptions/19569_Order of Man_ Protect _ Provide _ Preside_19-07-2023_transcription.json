    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Kib, what's up, brother? Great to see you. Still looks like you're on your... I was going to say vacation, but I think that's what I thought it was originally. But you guys actually... What do you do? You travel for a couple of months every year, a month or two? Or what is it? Yeah, I mean, we probably travel a little too much anyway, but this is our plan every year. To take our kids, move somewhere temporarily for a short period of time, experience of another culture, and build up to it. Asia's been having the girls learn French for months leading up to this trip. And it's, I don't know, it just makes it great. Super great. Yeah, that's cool. Right on, man. Well, I'm glad we could still do this podcast because you and I have talked about it. It's good fuel for us for getting through the week and thinking about things that... There are some really good questions today that I saw, and it gets us thinking about things that, at least for me, I don't always consider so readily. So that's part of the reason I enjoy having these conversations. Yeah. Me too. Me too. Always, as always. In fact, I agree. I looked over some of these questions. I'm like, Yeah, these two good or so. And even last week were great. Yeah. Yeah, they were good too. Yeah. Quality questions is improving. One quick announcement. I didn't mention this before we got started, Kip, is really guys right now, if you would, if you're ever on YouTube, I would suggest and encourage and ask that you head over to YouTube and you follow us over there. It's done really well on YouTube lately. Things are starting to pick up, and I see a lot of momentum over there. I still do feel like our accounts get throttled. If we look at our accounts, we have on YouTube just under 300,000. So let's hit that 300,000 mark. And if you look at other channels that have 300,000 subscribers, and these are all organic subscribers. This is nothing I paid for. I mean, this is something we've built over eight years, but our views are so low relative to, and I'm always skeptical and cautious of saying, well, we're being shadow-banned, because that's what everybody says. It kind of sounds like whining, frankly, but also there's some gimmicks being played. And I know there is because I've talked with men who run very, very successful YouTube accounts, and they've gone through the analytics, the backend analytics of our account, and have said, yeah, there's some shenanigans taking place. Things are adding up. Yeah. Yeah. So anyways, we're going to keep playing the game a lot of times. People will say, well, just don't be on there. No, we are going to be on there because we can reach as many people as we do, but there's other avenues as well. So there's two things that we can do. We can, we can retreat and withdraw and say, well, I'm not going to play on their, their playground because there's these rules, or I'm going to play on that playground by their rules because it's their playground, but I'm also going to see what else is available. So I just want to flood everything and do everything we can to get this message of restoring and reclaiming masculinity out out to the masses. Totally. Totally. And you get to see Ryan's pretty face and the new backdrop. That's a bonus. I mean, that's just, that's just gravy right there. You know, guys, consider yourselves fortunate. So in hindsight, someone made that comment. I think, because every so often, well, actually, that's how I know, I think that's, that's my, like, cheap way to determine how that episode did is pretty much from YouTube, right? Because you have podcast downloads and every so often we go over those, but not too often. So I'll hop on to YouTube and just kind of, oh, hey, that one, that one had higher success. It's not a good indicator. Yeah. It's all I got, man. I know, but I can say I can get you the, I can get you the login credentials or get yourself your own credentials so you can go and and pour over the data. Regardless, every so often, I'll see comments on there and YouTube's brutal already, but it was really funny. Someone made a comment. I think last week saying this, this podcast is just watched is just valuable to watch just to see Ryan's gorgeous face. I think that was like the extent of the comments. The most true, the most true comment that was ever made on YouTube. You know, what's interesting is if you look at the, you look at the analytics and the demographics of audiences, you can see across different platforms, whether it's Instagram or Apple podcasts or other podcast players or Twitter. It's usually, it's usually about 85% men, roughly 15% women on YouTube. It's 80, 85% women. So I don't know. Maybe they just want to see our face and they just like, it's not really 85% women. I was going to say, is it really? No, it's not really. I was totally shocked. I just thought maybe the women want to see our faces, but I don't think that's the case. I mean, generally speaking, YouTube is a male's platform too. That's, that's even interesting. I'm sure you've heard the, those statistics that the majority of people that actually watch YouTube are men, women rarely utilize YouTube. It's very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I'm actually pulling up the statistics while you're not, you're pulling up the comment about you being handsome. I just want to screenshot that really quick. Absolutely. Let me get that real quick before YouTube takes that one down. All right. Well, you go ahead and get into it. And I'm going to pull this up while you're doing that because now I'm curious about the demographics over here. I don't know if I can tell. Oh, yeah. Here we go. So here it is. So we want to take a guess. What percentage of our audience on YouTube is male. I bet it's like 90. Tired 94%. 94% male. You know what's interesting? It's 94.1% male 5.9% female. There's like, that's a, that's accounts for everybody. So anybody who listens to our podcast believes in male and female. Pretty much is what that's telling me. Because there's no others. There's no unspecified or there's no other in your trans male or female. There's no, no other little weird things. Also, the biggest demographic. This is interesting. What do you want to say as far as the demographic of age? What do you think is the biggest 10 year. Age demographic for listeners for our podcast. 20 to 35 year olds. That's pretty good. So they do it in increments of, you know, 25 to 35 to 45 to 45. So, okay, 25 to 35 years old. 30% of our audience. So almost 60% of our audiences between the ages of 25 to 45 years old and 95% of them are male. Interesting. Yeah. Makes sense. Right. That's who we're talking to. Right. I mean, it makes sense. Yeah. I mean, it's going to feel starving for this kind of information. Like they like young men aspiring ambitious motivated men are itching for this type of information to apply in their lives to better their families better themselves better their businesses better their bank accounts. This is the information guys are after. And fortunately we were able to stumble into that. Eight and a half years ago, and we started this thing. Yeah. Well played. All right. I have two questions from the iron council today to learn more about the iron council go to order van.com slash iron council will keep you updated when we open enrollment. The best way to do that, you can sign up for the newsletter, but the other way is pretty much just stay connected. So connect with Mr. McLauren Instagram and Twitter at Ryan. Alright, I had two questions from last week. If you're okay with just inject those really quick and then do this week's questions. Okay. Let's do it. Sean. I know both of you read a lot of books, especially the monthly topics in the iron council. Is there a specific book or novel you revisit once a year for the enjoyment that it brings for Sean. If I remember correctly, we, the last question we answered last week was books about mental or emotional health. And I think we said, I think I, in fact, I know I can't think of man think of and man search for meaning. Those are two books that I read pretty regularly. Another one that I read pretty often is the war of art by Stephen Pressfield who's been a multiple guest appearance on our podcast. That's a, that's a good one. I read the road by, what is it McCarthy, or McCarthy is that is that right. You guys are I'm slaughtering that. But the road is really good about a father son combo in a post apocalyptic era trying to survive. I haven't read that one multiple times. I only bring that one up because I recently read it and it was really, really good. So it's entertaining for you. Yeah, entertaining and the lessons learned in there about the love between a father and a son. I mean, just powerful stuff. Yeah, Cormac McCarthy. And he's written other books. Blood Meridian is one, no country for old men is his. Yeah, there's some others as well, but the road is really, really good. And also on that note, that's one thing I'm trying to infuse more into my life is more fiction. You know, if you would ask me this question five, six years ago, even maybe two years ago, all of it's going to be self time. Yeah. Yeah. And now I don't think it is. It's actually really, it's a really good way for me to unwind for me to even learn things that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. Jack Carr series with the James Reese thrillers are really, really good. I would highly recommend that. We just had a guest come on Remy Adelaide gay with his newest book called, I'm I forgetting chameleon. So, oh, and then also I just got a book in the mail from Jim Schocky, the, the hunter that a lot of you guys know is hunters. And he's got, I think it's called call me hunter. And it's a, it's a fiction, it's a fiction book. So a lot of these authors are actually beginning to migrate more into fictional work for a reason. And a lot of them are really, really good and entertaining. Yeah, that's great. Like good learning books that are we touch as a man think if I read that multiple times over and over. Yeah, I'm not sure why because it's also a short book. Same as War of Art and these are simple reads. Yeah. For agreements, I read that book numerous times usually. Yeah. But I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown. I just love his books. So I've literally read every single Dan Brown book and I see the Da Vinci Code. Like did he do Da Vinci Code? Is that him? But he's best of all four. Yeah. Yep. Those books. So I love those books and I'm a nerd. So sometimes I'll listen to like a Star Wars book or a Harry Potter books. I knew you were going to say that you are a nerd. Probably that. You probably read Twilight to the, no, I didn't. Yes, he did. I've been to your house, Kip. I saw him. I think you have to be a female nerd to enjoy Twilight. I don't think you actually enjoyed those books. Guys, don't let Kip. Actually, I think in one of our YouTube videos, he actually left it up behind him and he got to take the Twilight series down before he hit record. So it's in there. You got to dig through it a little bit. Yeah. It was, I was a guest on a geek podcast. So I just inject that nerd every so often when needed. What's the appropriate, the politically correct term? Is it is a geek or nerd or? I don't know. There's, there's another one. There's got to be more in there. When I was in college and I was nerding out and like hacking and utilizing Linux is cool and you're like geeking geek was the correct cool term. So you never call yourself a nerd. It was a geek. Yeah. I don't know if that's evolved. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know either. I've never been in that category. So I don't know. In my geeky days. Yeah. What's talk distros of Linux all the nerds right now are all getting excited. I don't even know what you're saying right now. So that's just, you know, our YouTube count just went up quotient. All right. What else? What's next question Cody Cody Brunner. My wife and I have decided to end our marriage. Well, let me back up and say I ended it. And now we are sorting through the steps of what's next throughout this marriage. My first I have struggled so much with being selfish versus honoring my boundaries. They were nonexistent for the most part. What advice would you give guy? Would you give guys on how to determine when it is selfish and when it is a boundary. Let me elaborate in saying I don't believe that a boundary is inherently selfish, but can be seen that way by other parties. I'm struggling with making that distinction internally. Well, I think the I don't really particularly agree with the premise of the question and the premise is that selfishness is negative. That's the undertone of this question. But why is it negative? Like you have to stay away from selfishness. Otherwise you're in the wrong. Yeah. Why is it negative to be selfish? Now, if it comes at the expense of other people or it's excessive or you're not serving other people and you're not participating in your family dynamic or business or culture. Yeah, I think it could be a problem, but you could say that about anything. So I think we need to remove the stigma of selfishness being somewhat of a negative. It really isn't. And a boundary can be selfish boundaries typically are. You know, for example, your ex wife is communicating with you in a certain way. I don't want to make assumptions about why you guys are not married anymore because I don't know. But if she's not communicating with you in a respectful way. And you don't like that. That is selfish because you don't appreciate being talked to that way. And it's also a boundary. So it can be both and boundaries are typically selfish. I have this boundary in place because I don't like the way that your behavior or your communication makes me feel. I'm putting this boundary up so you don't step over it into my space mental emotional physical space. So I don't think it's wrong. What do you think about that do you think it's inherently negative to be selfish. What are your thoughts give No, no, I totally agree with you. In fact, I love that distinction. I don't think I would have made that distinction that like we do that that we assume that if it's selfish it's negative and then, and then we give grace of like, Oh, well, you can be a little selfish and you're not okay to be selfish sometimes it's like, well, no, just it's about the priority of things. And are you putting yourself before certain things too much right what's the impact of your selfishness. You want to use that term. And shouldn't we all be right shouldn't our happiness be self derived and not be dependent on others shouldn't we care about, you know, ourselves and and and and purposely seek out things that find enjoyment and fulfillment in our lives like those are all forms of being selfish. And I don't see anything wrong with any of them. And I like that. And also you can't make decisions in a vacuum in life. If you do something positively in one aspect it's going to spill over into positivity in another aspect. So I wrote this down here and this is a little a little iteration here but self selfishness leads to selflessness. And let me explain what I mean if you're a little bit selfish. Well, I'm not even going to say a little bit if you're a health healthy selfishness will say that. If it's healthy, then it's going to lead to selflessness for example, if you take time out of your day and you do it appropriately I'm not saying like blow up your day because you want to go to the gym for example or step all over other people's priorities like yeah right so get up an hour earlier before everybody else is up and get your butt into the gym. That's selfish, you know, but it's not really impacting anybody negatively because you're doing it while everybody else is asleep. But what's nice about that is you tell me this. Can a man who is 10% body fat. Is he going to be just generally okay I'm just speaking in broad generalities here like you guys are capable of discernment when I say this but can a man who's 10% body fat serve his family and his business more effectively than somebody who's 35% body fat. Everything else being equal. Of course he can. So is it selfish to take an hour out of your day to go into the gym and to eat right and to make sure that you're making these sacrifices. Of course it's a beautiful thing because now you have the energy and you have the mental stamina and you have the focus and the clarity and the innovation to be able to serve your family to be able to show up more powerfully for your clients to be able to serve your employer. It's just better that way. So if it's healthy selfishness, it can lead to self selflessness. And here's the last point that I'll make. I've always thought about when when does a male become a man. Is it an age thing is it a maturity thing like at what point would we consider a male no longer to be a boy or an adolescent, but to be a man. And I think after spending about nine years thinking about this question. And then he has the capacity to not only serve himself, but then to turn his abundance and his prosperity and wealth out for the benefit of other people. So if I'm broke. And I'm and all I'm thinking about is like making my bills and I don't have any money to give the charity and I don't have the time to be able to donate to charitable organizations or spend time with my family. And if I'm worried about me and mine because I don't have the capacity to take care of myself, then I'm not being manly. If on the other hand, I'm making enough money in abundance that I can provide for myself and also I can provide for my children and also I can donate time to coach sports teams. And also I can give to charity. I think we would all, all of us agree that that person is more of a man, because he's learned how to harness raw resources, take care of himself, and then turn those things outward. In the spirit of Cody's question, maybe, maybe let me ask it this way. Is there an area where boundaries are too much where where we put too much boundaries in relationships and that comes across some would flag it as being selfish, or it's just negative and it doesn't serve him as much. And where does he lay that down, right? Where's that balance or how does he check himself to know that there's not enough give and take, right? Or he's just like boundary, boundary my way, my way, my way. And it's really, you know, coming across in a negative impact in this relationship. Yeah, I think I think it can, where boundaries can be taken too far can be taken to the extreme. And what I wrote down here as you were asking that question is, are they relevant? Because I think it's easy to set up a bunch of arbitrary boundaries. So a relevant boundary might be with your wife, for example, might be, hey, hon, you're not going to spend unnecessary amounts of money. And here's the budget and we're going to work together to be able to create the solutions to these problems and we're going to make sure cash flows right, but you're not going to spend more than we have. And that's a hard boundary. And if you continually and habitually break and cross that boundary, we're going to have some serious, serious complications in our relationship. And that's important to me because as a man, it's my job to provide for my family. It's my job to make sure financially the mortgage gets paid. And there's enough money for food on the table. And there's a little bit left over to be able to go on vacations or trips or spend on who knows what. And if you continually break that boundary and cross that, that's an issue. Maybe on a more silly level because I can't really think of anything, but I've seen guys that make up all sorts of rules, some of which are uncommunicated rules about nothing and everything about how the grass needs to be mode or how the house needs to be kept and how the, you know, the car needs to be parked in the garage. And you know, is that really a boundary or is that just something you'd like? And if it's something you'd like, for example, like, let's say you come home from a long day and there's a certain way you like the house to be kept. Like if your wife stays at home and she's the homemaker and she's taking care of the kids, I think that's a reasonable expectation. I go out and I do this work. And your job is to be here because we've agreed on it. Like, I think it's reasonable to expect that the house is going to be kept well. That's your job. Right. That's the dynamic of our relationship. Is that a boundary? No, it's not a boundary. But it's something that I think should be communicated so that you understand what her days like because you know what if little Timmy has to go to the dentist, and then she's chauffeur and all the kids all over the place every day. Like, we don't see that stuff. And so why is the why is it dinner made? Why is the house clean? It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe she had other things going on throughout the day you're not aware of, you know, so I think there's things we'd like to have done a certain way. If you communicated, I'm not saying they shouldn't. And then there's boundaries which are hard and fast. Like, you will not cross this boundary. And this is where I draw the line in the sand. Yeah. One of the distinctions that you made that I think is spot on is what was the intent behind the boundary. Right. So as Cody looks at his boundaries, it's like, why this one? Is it so you can serve your family better? Is it so your family can be safe? Is it better for the relationship or is it like control? This is the way I like it. And now you're just flexing some some superiority over someone else for some worthless reason. Right. So connected to the intent is one of the key things that I picked up from what you said. Yeah, I think so. I also think a lot like we hear from a Christian perspective is you will be judged by the same scrutiny that you judge others. And the reason I bring that up is with regards to boundaries and preferences, we'll call them. Like a preference would be like, I like to have the house clean like this. That's a preference. That's on a boundary. It's an ask maybe. Yeah. You should honor her preferences as well. Right. So if if you're asking her to, can you flip that mirror around and say, honestly, that you're willing to do that for her. I know I wasn't always in my marriage. And I won't say that's the downfall, but you add that to other things in the relationship and it causes problems. I have high expectations and preferences. I want those things to be honored. But if I examine it, was I really willing to do the same for her? And the answer is no, not, not as much as I should have. Yeah. Yeah. Real quick, nerdy psychology thing. So it's called the fundamental attribution air. And what it is is we attribute other people's shortcomings or lack of performance per se to their character. But when it comes to us, we hold on to the reasons. Right. So it's like, well, am I delivering? Well, not probably where I should, but you know, job is tough. And you know, I got this and this and that and that. But when it comes to my judgments towards her. Well, you know what I mean? It's because she's this way. Right. And we don't attribute any other possible, you know, variables into our judgment towards others. There's a quote that I heard in Ben Shapiro says this quite often. And I don't think it's his quote. I think he's quoting somebody else. He says, never attribute to maliciousness. What should be attributed to ignorance or stupidity, I think is what he says. But I think that's typically the truth is that we'll go back to your spouse. Like she's not doing the house at a, like not the way you like at a malicious intent. Yeah. Like she's not going to get you a moth today. Right. She's not even, she doesn't even have enough free time in her day to think about how she can get it's you. Okay. Like you're not as important as you think you are. And so, and I won't say it's stupidity either because it's certainly not that. But it could be ignorant. It's a form of ignorance. It's ignorance. And look, we hear ignorance. If I say, Kip, you're ignorant. Okay, that sounds like an insult. But if I say, but it is kind of insulting in that, in that manner. But the definition of ignorance is just not knowing is literally unaware. Yeah. Yeah. It's just not knowing stupidity is knowing but doing something dumb, right? Doing something different. That's that's stupidity. Ignorance is I just don't know. So how do you address ignorance by talking about it. Hey, hun, you know, I've noticed that the house is a certain way when I get home and, and it really causes me a lot of stress when I get home when I see, you know, the books and toys and everything all laying out. And it's just really nice to come home to a straight house. But maybe I don't understand the full picture. Can you help me understand? And then she's like, Oh, yeah. Well, we were busy today. And this and that if it's an anomaly, that's, I wouldn't even worry about it. But if it's a constant thing, like try to figure out her day, like, Okay, tell me what's going on. How can I help? What can we do? Yeah. But it's typically just uncommunicated preferences, like I talked about earlier. Yeah. With a bunch of covert contracts and frustrations and still walking, right? Instead. Yeah, exactly. All right. Charles Phillips, my girlfriend suffers from anger issues stemming from anxiety lately has gotten better, but from the flare ups are worse. How can a man best lead a loved one through their anger and anxiety issues therapy is ongoing to address the issue long term, but more in the moment is where I struggle. I'm going to say something that's controversial right now. She's your girlfriend. And I don't know how long she's been. You guys have been together. I don't know if there's kids in the mix. Like, I don't know the details. But without knowing the details, I want to tell you she's your girlfriend. I hope you understand what I'm saying when I say that. If I need to be a little bit more clear, let me see it this way. Are you sure you want to commit forever to this person? And that might be controversial. People might not like what I have to say, but you know what, this is going to impact your life. This is going to be tough. If she's angry now and she's in therapy now and she's dealing with these issues now, unless something drastic changes and maybe it does. Maybe she has a growth mindset. And if she does, great. Like, see if it improves and see what you can do to help. But if it's been ongoing for years and years and she's always dealt with this, you have to ask yourself at this point before you pop that ring on her finger. Is this some is this the game I'm willing to like, is this the field I want to play on? You agree with that kid or disagree. And we'll get into more some more details. But what do you think about that? No, I totally agree. I mean, one thing's for sure. If you're fighting and things are tough and trust me, people have this thought that they think, Oh, well, when we get married, it'll be better because I don't know. So me, Luz, pipe dream idea that things are going to get easier. They're not going to get easier guaranteed. They are going to get more difficult. So, yeah, hey, if you're willing to commit commit, right, but just be very clear on what you're committing to and that the probability is going to get more difficult for sure. That's, I mean, we have to address the elephant in the room. I mean, if we're like, we say we're here to serve men. And if we're here to serve men, then you really have to ask yourself, is this the game I want to play? If it is, what, and all right. Yeah, go ahead and think about this, Ryan. You know, this as much as I know, we could probably say most difficulties in marriages are the bag is the unfinished baggage that both people bring into the marriage, project on their spouse. And then they spend the rest of their marriage dealing with that. Right. So choose someone that has dealt with some of it or has minimal amount of things to bring in the table. And you do the same so you can serve your spouse in the most appropriate way possible. Right. But those are those are the hardships you're going to experience is all the trauma, anxiety, depression, stories, whatever you want to call them from their childhood and their upbringing. And it's going to be thrown and projected on you in a very unfair way. And that's what marriages. And also, I think it should also be that you guys talk about what your problems are. That's a deal breaker for me. Yeah. We talk about a boundary. If we're, if we're unwilling, if either one of us are unwilling or unable to communicate with each other, I'm not interested in that relationship. So I think you should ask yourself what your matters are possible. Nothing's possible. And you know, look, what if we kick all of our problems? Under the rug for a while, like we could do that. I can do that. I'm unsure enough to do that. Like anybody I would date is mature enough to do that. But that's not what I want. Like I don't, I want to address it early and often so that we can come to some, some mutual conclusions on the things that we might be struggling with because it is going to be a struggle. There's a perfect woman out there. There's no perfect man out there. There's going to be a struggle. Okay. So what can you do to address these anger issues? I think going to therapy, even letting her do her personal therapy, but I even think doing something together would be valuable. And I'm not saying in exchange or to replace her personal therapy, she needs that. But I would go actually if therapy is proven to be valuable, I would try to do something together, maybe with another therapist, because that might give you some tools. Right. So if I've got a tool or I've got a project that I'm working on, I'm building a bed for my daughter right now. So it's, you know, it's, it's, it's almost done. I've got 80, 90% of it done. And this weekend I was putting some supporting brackets and things like that on it. And I needed to make some certain cuts. Well, I didn't have the saw that I needed to make those cuts. So I went to Home Depot and I bought the miter saw that I needed made the cuts easy, easy, easy, right? Easy to get it done. When you have the right tools. Now there's another awesome. There's another way I could have done it. I could have just drawn it on there and I bought it and saw it with like a hand saw. I could have got a miter box, which improves it a little bit, but still I got a saw with my hand like there's other things I can do, but I have the best tool now, which is the miter saw. That's the tool for the job. You might not have the tool for the job. You need to expand your toolbox, because you can't build the bunk bed. If you don't have the right tools, you can't have a thriving marriage. If you don't have the right tools, you can't work her through anger issues. If you don't have access to the right tools, you can bang your head against the wall. And you can do everything you think you're supposed to do. But if you don't have the right tools, it's not going to work. And so you need somebody to introduce you to these tools. That might be a therapist. Now, because you have the tools, maybe it's different communication styles, maybe it's activities, maybe it's learning to give her some space or some some margin so she can focus. Maybe it's how you respond to her when she is angry. If there's tools that you can learn, I would want to know what those things were. I don't have those tools to give to you. But there are people out there who are qualified and you need to seek those qualified people to use our analogy about Home Depot. If I need a miter saw, but I go to Bath and Body, I'm not going to be able to get my miter saw Bath and Body. What am I going to do? Like cut it with like, like hack it with a pillow. Okay, so you need to go to the right place to get the right tool, and then you can perform what it is you're trying to accomplish. And in the spirit of the tool analogy, make sure that you can deliver on the tool right because that's the other thing is like most suffering exists where in our interpretation. And so one of the best things you can do, Charles, is make sure that when those flare ups occur, that you're not reacting to them, right? That you're suffering isn't like, Oh my gosh, your anxiety is horrible because I'm now reacting based upon her, you know, her flare up and what it means. And now, you know, I'm feeding the fire. So, and that's what's super tough about this. But make sure that you're not adding to the fire and adding to the problem based upon how you're reacting. Yeah, I mean, have you ever been around somebody who you're like, man, I just really feel good when I'm around that person. And I can think of people that I'm around where it's exhausting to be around. And it's just, it's too much. Yeah, it's like depressing. Yeah. So we as men, I think, should be the first, right? And we've heard this term, maybe you have, I've heard a lot is, and I didn't know what it meant to be wild to interpret it but hold space. You know, women tend to be a little bit more susceptible. That's probably not the right word. A little bit more sensitive to their emotional decision making process. Right. And because of that, you're going to see a generally, but you're going to see a lot of a lot more spikes peaks up and downs peaks and valleys, right. And our job is men is not to be emotionless. I'm not saying that. But if you can hold the space, then in those highs, you can bring her back down to earth. In the lows, you can bring her back out of that pit that she might be in. But you can't do that if you're not on neutral ground. Can't do that if you're not holding the space. And I'm not saying allow yourself to be a victim either. I'm not allowing. I'm not saying like if she's in an I rate, you know, rage that you have to take it and listen to all the, you know, her berate you or your face. You know, her berate you or yell at you or call you names or profanity. I'm not saying that at all. But if she's upset, you can be an environment, a container where it's like, okay, be upset, hun. Like, what's going on? How you feeling? What can I help you with? These are things I wish I would have done better. But that idea of holding space is a valuable one. Greg Kleber, moving more into leadership. I've given more thought into the important qualities to grow to embody the essence of leadership and myself. I believe the most important quality of an effective leaders to take initiative to be the first to live and act as an example of anything you would as, as those whom you lead. I'm curious what your thoughts are about what you both feel are the hallmark, hallmark traits of a vital and effective leader that I might be missing here. I realized my thoughts might be a bit vague, but I was attempting to span the overall situation. Yeah, it's an interesting question. I saw this one and I don't want to give a cop out answer, but I've tried to look at this a little differently than just giving you a laundry list of items that you should do. We can do that. And maybe we'll get to some of those points, but here's what I would suggest is that the quality traits of a leader are the ones that he doesn't currently possess. Like, that's the most important quality a leader can develop the one he doesn't possess. Right. Like if, so for example, I don't have any issue with initiative. Greg, you said initiative is the most important. So does that mean I can check leader off the box. I have no problem with initiative. I have no problem motivation zero problem with drive. You know what I do have a problem with empathy. So what's the most important leadership characteristic I can develop. It's not initiative. I already have that. It's empathy. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So I think I think if you really want to be a leader, there isn't like do these 10 things. There's things you're already good at, which is probably why you're in a leadership capability. And I look with Greg, I mean, I see him like I see him in the eye. I see him given his comments and sharing his insights. He's a leader, man. People follow him. I listened to him. I'm inspired by him. The way he communicates the message he shares. There's credibility. There's weight behind it. I see it. Yeah. So you're already in that position. And now what we should be identifying as leaders is what can I do to be better. Like what room for improvement do I have? So it's the one you don't have. Well, let's give a couple of items, but I would like to know if you would add anything else to what I just said, Kip. Yeah. It's an interesting school of thought, right? So there is there's some evidence and it's it's not in contradiction to what you just said, but it's like a different angle of this that that leaders should take what they're good at and become extraordinary in them. And the reason why is because there's already a national talent, right? And, and that the idea that when you're an extraordinary key elements, those end up not improving in a vacuum and end up bringing other areas up. Does it make sense? And so you'll get better momentum from a from a development perspective as a leader. If you focus on something that you're good at and become amazing at it. Now, with that said, that same school of thought will say, if there's leadership traits that are quote unquote toxic, you have to address them. And, and I would say empathy, integrity, there's a couple elements that I think if like you're lacking in those, you got to sure them up. But let's say like as an example. I'm really thinking, I wish I had a really good example. Geez. Yeah, I can't think of a really good example. I can pull up some pillars later, actually, or maybe even another time, but, but the point is is you will get better momentum in development if you focus on what you're already good at because you already have a passion around it. And they use examples of like other leaders that are like, here's a permanent example, Steve Jobs. You could ask the general populace and people at Apple, Steve Jobs was an amazing leader and people would say, yes. But then you could also ask, well, did you was Steve Jobs like a complete jerk and the like, Oh, yeah, that guy was a jerk. Well, hold on. How is that possible? Right? Like, that's a negative trait. Yeah, but he was so brilliant that people give passes in other areas. And so that's the, at least that's the school of thought around that idea. See, and look, I take that scenario with Jobs and I agree with that, you know, that assessment. Like, I'm not interested in being that kind of leader personally. Yeah. Especially one that that that's that way anyway. Yeah. I'm not. I'm not interested in that. Like, I'm interested in creating a big movement and organization with what we're doing here, but I care about the individual too. And I care about what goes on behind the business. Like, what's their personal life like what they struggle with? I got, I'm interested in that. And that's the kind of leader I want to be. Could I, could I be more effective as in growing this organization if I was more hard, maybe I don't know, but I'm not interested in that. Like, I know what I want. Yeah. And I want to serve people. I wrote down some things here that I think might help. I mean, there's the laundry list of items with regards to leadership, you know, initiative is one he mentioned empathy is one I mentioned integrity is one you mentioned. But there's a couple here that I think are a little outside the box. Number one is you have to be a great communicator. Steve Jobs was a great communicator. I'm a pretty good communicator. Like anybody who leads effectively is going to communicate well. And it doesn't mean that there is one communication style. It means that they know how to take a message and deliver it in a way that's relevant to the person they're communicating with. That's all powerful communication is. And so you need to change it. If I'm talking with my seven year old, it's going to be different than the way Kip that I talked with you. So is one is was the way I showed up for him. What if I showed up for you the way I showed up with him. Would that be effective communication? No, of course not. It'd be ridiculous. So we need to have the ability to adapt. Number two, this one's a little outside the box. Optimism. I think leaders are optimistic. I don't think they're unrealistic. I don't think they're pie in the sky people, but I think they're optimist. I think that they believe that the sky is a falling though either. Right. There's a problem that can be solved. There's a solution to this. There's a path forward. Yes, it's hard right now. But if we do this work, then it will be better. Like the leaders are optimists. Another one is their problem solvers. They're not problem identifiers. Everybody's problem identifier. If you were to go ask a hundred people, Hey, what's wrong with society today? Everybody would have an answer. But if you ask the same people, okay, part two, the question, what should we do about it? Significantly fewer people would have an answer to that question. So leaders are problem solvers. They see the problems just like everybody else, but they see a path forward. And the last one I wrote here is humility. Meaning they don't need to be the center of attention. They don't need to always be the one on stage. They don't need to be the one with the eyeballs on them all the time. Sometimes it's necessary because a leader, you need to cast vision. You need to inspire and motivate. You need to give direction. And sometimes it's necessary for you to get off of the stage. So there's room on the stage for somebody else to stand. If you can't do that, if you're filling up every single space of the leadership development growth of others, we sometimes are the bottleneck. I've talked about that a lot within our organizations, or man and iron council bottlenecks bottlenecks bottlenecks. What if I'm the bottleneck? And what can I do to get myself out of the way to allow space for other people to come in and fulfill roles and duties and responsibilities and perhaps do a better job than even I could do myself. Yeah, I think just to latch on the last thing is just just servant leadership. And like when when we get to a point where it's not about us and we're creating opportunities for others, now you're a great leader. When people can say, Hey, I'm in Ryan's circle and there's no doubt that like he wants the best for me. He's coaching. He's helping me. And that the intent of his leadership is to better me as an individual. Are you joking? Like imagine that kind of relationship with your boss where it's not like trust is here, but it's no longer trust. It is, you know, they're there for you because they want to see you win and they want to support you in it. Man, like it. If we can get to that level as leaders, I think it's profound. One last thought, Greg, and this isn't like a, this isn't one of those traits, but this is one of the things to consider when you think about leadership is we often look at our abilities. And I'd say a lot of your traits are thinking kind of in the space of abilities. And then we look at our effort and we'll go, Oh, you know, I got these abilities and I'm putting in effort. But the last thing that we consider is what is your impact. And it is fully possible that you can be an amazing leader and bust your butt. But the impact is negative. And that maybe you're hitting numbers from a work perspective, but you are even awake of disaster because you're not connected to the impact that you're leaving. And what another way of saying the impact relationships. And what are we doing for other people. So don't lose sight of the impact. Yeah. The only exception I would say, or the only issue I took with that and I agree so much with you on that about the impact that you said, you can be great. You can be a great leader and have the hard work and all that stuff. But if you don't have the impact, I'd argue that if you don't have the impact, you're not a great leader. Yeah. Yeah. Or you're getting the short game, right? Like you might have success like at work, but it's, it's short lived because your support and those that you're, you're leading are falling to the wayside right that the analogy I always use is like, we're going to be doing something that you're doing. And you're going to be doing something that you're doing for a moment Everest. Awesome that you planted the flag that is your whole crew dead because in the process of something, right? It's like, yeah, we don't want to summit and everyone's dead, right? Right. Let's summit and everyone lives and we all make it down the mountain together. I thought you brought up a good point to when you said when it's not about you. And so I wrote this question down. But how do you know when it's not about you. You can tell if it's your leadership is not about you. And this is how your employees or your subordinates, your family members are going to know it's not about you. When they F up and you still have their back. Yeah. That's how you know it's not about you because if you're one of your employees messes up and cost you 10 grand today and you lose your shit and you lose your mind and you demote them and you berate them and you make them feel guilty and horrible and you undermine them. It was about you was about the $10,000. It was about the bottom line. If on the other hand you put your arm around them and say, Hey, look, who you messed that one up. Like, that's a big problem, but you know what? All right, we got a problem on our hands. We have a problem on our hands. So, what are we going to do about this. And I allow let's say I'm talking to you, Kip. I allow you to come up with some solutions and say, Hey, yes, those are good solutions. Here's another thought. Here's another thought. Kip, look, I know how you must be feeling today. Look, I'm feeling it too. I'm angry. We just lost $10,000. I'm frustrated. That's going to hurt our bottom line and impact our ability to serve other customers. But I also want you to know stuff happens. And I think we can get through this. In fact, I'm so confident that we can get through it that after the end of our $10,000 loss will actually be better off because we're going to learn new systems and procedures that are going to help us make more money down the road. And we're going to grow from this. You're going to grow from this. I'm going to grow from this. Chalk it up to learn. How much better do you feel? Like, I wish I could say I was always that way. It's hard. It's hard. When things go south. That's how you know. That's the way you know who what was it about? Was it about that person or was it about you and your bottom line? That's how you know. Yeah. Good question. All right. Travis Neville. How do I help support a buddy that is in a toxic relationship with his girlfriend and her family? My friend has been in a relationship with his girl for 25 years. Sometimes and it's getting worse. They fight constantly. It's about the smallest things like he wore the wrong shoe laces, not kidding. We were working out the other day and he has to call to wake her up at 2 p.m. and they fought because he was at the gym. He is a good guy, but he's the only person in his corner. I'm the only person in his corner. He has no family. So I feel like if he's hanging onto this broken relationship and hope of having a family again, the family doesn't respect him and treats him like crap. They control every aspect of his daughter's life. He constantly talks about how bad it is, but won't break away. How can I set boundaries with her? How can he set boundaries with her and the family and try to improve the situation or is it a lost cause? So how does he have this relationship with his buddy? Right? I mean, that's the bigger. Yeah. You're not going to like my answer. You've already done everything you can do. I know you have. I know you have because you're asking this question, which means you've tried other things and it's not working. Travis, brother, you've done enough. Anything that you do now might actually be inappropriate because he's not interested in it. So, like when do the thing that's making you sick? Travis, tell me this. When's the last time you appreciated being nagged about something that somebody already told you about? Even if they were right, like when's the last time you appreciated that found value in that, acted on that and felt better because you did it and changed your ways because of it. Never. Never. You've already done everything that you can do. So just keep doing that. The hard part for men is that we want to experience results. We want to change people. We want to see their growth and progress. You don't have control over that. And so the best thing we talk about is all the time. You know, this is the core of sovereignty. Doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do. And how do you know is that would you still do it if you knew that it wouldn't produce the results that you desired? Would you still be this guy's friend knowing that he's never going to implement the things that you're sharing with him that you know would positively impact his life? Would you still do it? Yeah, it'd still be his friend. Then be his friend because that's the right thing to do. He's done, man. He's done hearing about what you think. He's done hearing about the boundaries. And even if he isn't, he's not willing to implement it. The only exception to that is if at some point down the road, he has enough and he comes to you because you've created a friendship with him. And he said, Travis, man, you were telling me something last month and God just wasn't in the space to listen, but you were talking about boundaries. What was that again? That's a new opening for you to be able to have this continued conversation, but the balls in his court. Don't go steal his basketball. He's the one who needs to make the shot. He's the one who needs to go play the game. You can't go over there and hog the ball. It's his game. So you can coach him and you can consult him and you can counsel him and you can befriend him and you can do all the things that you're doing right now. But at the end of the day, if he's not willing to do it, that's on him, not you. Congratulations to you for doing everything that you could. Now, leave it alone. Just be a friend. Just invite him to the lake. Just invite him to dinner. Go on a hunt. Don't talk about his girlfriend anymore. Don't talk about all the things that he's doing wrong and what he should be doing. Talk about baseball. Talk about sports. Talk about hunting. Talk about lifting. He clearly cares about lifting. Talk about with his next competition. That's it. And that's also really nice because now you can have a fun relationship with a guy. And you might be his only outlet. His only reprieve from whatever else is going on in his life. And now he enjoys being around you, which is good. That's what you want. Because at some point, he may or may not come around and want to have some other conversations, but you've already had the conversations. Just stop now. And him letting go of it's going to he's going to have a better relationship with his buddy by letting go of those expectations of the way it should or should not be as well. It's just a it's just a shitty answer because it's like, so what do we want to do that produces results? Just can't. Nothing. But that isn't the answer. The results. Yeah, it is. What? And even if he did listen to you guys at the root of this entire comment that Ryan just said is the idea that there's a major difference between people taking action because they've outsourced their life to someone else. And I'm just going to do it because Ryan said so versus someone finding the answer for themselves or coming to the conclusion on their own that they need to do something. There is a night and day difference of those two situations. And one will progress or one will give results. The other one, he'll take some actions. It won't go the way he wants it to go. Then he'll blame you that he listened to you. That's not how change is done. He has to figure it out for himself. Yeah. I think about the analogy of lifting weights and this might be helpful because this guy's fit. You know, he's in the fitness. If I went to the gym this morning and I took a picture before picture of me going to the gym and then after I took an after picture. What do you think if that's what I was basing my performance on or or me being active in the gym? Do you think I'd go back? No, I wouldn't go back in here. Because I didn't see a result. I was like, I looked at him. I looked the same. I'm sore. That's the only difference between the before and after I'm sore. And tired. Tired. So I'm not going back. But what would what would a fitness guy tell you? Be like, no, just what should I do? You ask him? Well, I didn't experience any results. What should I do? You should go back tomorrow. You could do that for a week. You could do that for a month. After a month, I think you'd start to see some progress if you don't. You might be doing it wrong. But it takes a long time and sometimes doing the right thing, the best course of action is if you're doing the right thing, the best course of action is to keep doing the right thing. Even though you're not experiencing the result that you desire, yet you will. You will. Yeah. Ryan Chambers, considering the current deterioration of traditional gender roles, what are some potential future challenges that you see for sovereign masculine men in the next five to 10 years? Well, I think it's more of the same. I think the biggest confusion that we're going to have is the biggest challenge we're going to have is confusion. We're going to be confused about what our role is. And we see that with feminism. You see men who want to step up. You even hear women who are like, I like a strong, assertive, take charge kind of guy. And then you look at their man and they're not that kind of man because, you know, the woman's out in the workforce doing the thing that she's doing and she's trying to be the man. It's like, okay, well, you say you want a stronger sort of man, but your actions speak otherwise. And you're going to see more and more of that. You're going to see these more and more women who are acting more like men, more men who are acting like men. And neither are going to be fulfilled. Like we see the data. We see the numbers. We know how miserable people are. We know how miserable women are if they don't decide to have a family. These are generalities. I'm not saying they're on exception. There are. But we see the numbers. We see the data for guys who don't feel like men. We see declining testosterone rates. We see depression and anxiety and suicide rates as high as they are for men up to four or five times a month. Or to five times higher than that of women. Like these are serious problems. And so I don't think there's going to be new problems necessarily, but I think they're going to be exacerbated. And then I also think these problems are going to be perpetuated by governments who want to undermine what it means to be a man who want to undermine what it means to be a woman. And then is there really any question why nobody's fulfilled. You took away half the equation. You took away 100% of the equation. Man plus woman equals fulfillment. And we continue to take those out of the equation. We conflate what a man is with a woman and vice versa. And then we expect this is going to create some sort of fulfillment and satisfaction in life. It's not. So the best thing a man can do is be a man so that we can create space, hold space, as we said earlier, for women to be women. If we can't fulfill those roles, then they are left believing, even if it's just perpetuated by governments and school institutions that they have to do both roles. I mean, they can, but they're going to burn out really, really quickly. So we need to step up as men strong righteous, bold, capable, assertive protectors providers and providers so that the women in our lives have the space to be kind and lovely and empathetic and nurturing and supportive. Not, not, that's not bad. I'm not saying it's bad. Some people interpret that as it is. This is a partnership. And when we both fulfill our responsibilities, both sexes tend to be happier. George Sykes, how do you know when you're following God's will as a four year recovering codependent almost one year recovering alcoholic and addict and a brand new Christian. I'm struggling with following God's will. I do not know what he wants from me. Nor do I know how to know what he wants from me. And I am. And am I a mess on some days. Thanks, Shelman. Love you all. When you start to believe that you have things figured out, I would question whether or not I'm now relying on God. I've got this. I'm good at this. Man, I'm doing awesome. Look at me. Look how great I am. I'm successful. I'm thriving. Oh, I don't think we're following God's plan anymore. Because that isn't he wants you to be humble and grow. He wants you to be me. He wants you to, like you said, to grow and you don't grow by believing you have everything figured out. So George, if you're confused, you might actually, that might be a pretty good indicator. You're following his plan. Like, I'm confused. I'm frustrated. I check in every day. I don't know if I'm on the right path. I'm trying to do good. I'm trying to follow his plan. Those are all positions of humility, which means that you're on the path. You are on the path. It doesn't always feel comfortable. And that's that's the hard thing. I mean, that's like anything, right? When you're you're on the path to business growth, there's a lot of painful lessons in there. When you're on the path to physical prowess and physical fitness, there's a lot of pain, like physically painful lessons in there that you have to work through, whether it's just general soreness from lifting or maybe it's a potential injury that you're in. And trying to overcome. I've had plenty of both. So I would say that that's a pretty good indicator that that level of humility that you have, because it keeps you asking if you're on the right path is, and as long as you're doing that, praying daily, reading scripture, coming to him with an open heart and humble heart and then approaching life, not from the position of you know, but here I am to learn. Direct me. What should I do now? And then do it. And by the way, also evaluate it too. Like you should evaluate. Hey, you know, I did this thing. Here's the thing that I think Christians have a lot of Christians get wrong. They pray for things. Like, give me things. God, give me success. Give me notoriety. Give me this. Give me. Oh, I want this. Like, please help me have the money for this. Like, give me this. Like, oh, I'm in this tough situation. What should I do? Give me the answer. I don't think it works like that. I think you need to do your part. And your part is, here's how I try to pray. God, I'm in this tough spot. I'm going through. I went through this divorce with my wife and my family is falling apart and I'm struggling. And I'm on my knees and I am so lost. I'm so confused. I'm emotionally distraught. It's horrible. I never thought I would find myself in this position. What should I do? No, that's not it. Here's what I think I should do. I've spent time thinking about what I should do, how I should approach it. Can you tell me? Can you let me know? Am I thinking this right? Like, help me understand if this is the right path for me. And then I try to stay in tune with the decision I made. Like, God gave us agency, right? Like, he gave us the ability to choose. Imagine that you give a gift to your child. You give your child a brand new set of Legos. And he never opens it. He never plays with it. He just leaves it somewhere packed on the shelf and all it does is collect dust. How much did he honor that gift? How much did he appreciate that gift? He didn't at all. And so if you have free agency and free will and you're not exercising it, you're spitting in the face of God. He gave you that to use it. But you use your agency, make decisions. I have faith that you can make decisions. I trust that you can make good decisions with my guidance and my help and my support. So make frickin decisions. And then you can come back to me and ask if you're doing it right and I will guide you. But you have the power to make decisions and shame on us if we don't make those decisions and exercise our free will. Oh, and I think if, if George, if there's a sense of like, man, you know, you're paralyzed by paralysis, you know, like you're over analyzing this and you're just like, I don't know. Well, what's God's plan? Period. Right. And get clear on the intent of what he would want and then act in that direction in that general direction of like, you know, back to what you're saying, what does he want you to grow. Try to serve other people. Yes. Right. So start in those areas. And you're going in the right direction and then fine to. Anytime I get arrogant, I just know that I'm not following his path. I start to get too big for my britches. You know, we hear the pride comes before the fall. Anytime you start to feel like that, you know, you're deviating from the path. But if you're humble, like that, open, I mean, that's pretty simple, right. And I think that's, I'm, I'm not a biblical scholar, but that's a, that's a biblical principle. Humility. And anytime you get overly confident and arrogant, you're on the wrong path, buddy. You better get off that path, or he'll bump you off that path if he needs to. Yeah. Because the intent is for you to grow. Right. Which is where I'm at, in my own life. Like, I was pride. Like, I didn't take myself off the path. I got bumped. I got, you know, foot stomped off the path. Like, like 300, like foot to the chest into the pit stomped off the path. And, you know, it's hard, but also there's a lot of growth happening right now. All right, what's next? Brandon Bonner. My son is three and a half years old and is becoming aggressive, hitting his little brother and his mom. He doesn't really try to hit me, but you can tell sometimes he wants to. And then you're like, Oh, my God, I'm a father. What kind of strategies have you found that work with discipline or discouraging young kids from being aggressive. Bro, you fight him. Fight his ass. Of course. Of course he's trying to hit you yet. Of course he's trying to hit you. Of course he's trying to fight and kick and kick people in the balls like you need to fight him. Okay, so please don't take that out of context. I'm saying jump on Amazon today and go by yourself some mats. And five o'clock is father son beat down WrestleMania every night Monday through Friday. Totally. And then what you do in those moments is you teach him appropriate use of physicality. So if he, and he's going to try to do this. He's going to try to punch you in the nuts. And your response is, Hey, we can be here and we can wrestle and we can play and we can fight. But when you do that, I'm not going to play with you. And then the next time he does it, you stop playing. You stop fighting him. And he's like, Oh, I don't want that. Okay, I'll be better next time. If he tries to bite you or any of these things. Like the terms he used, what was the last thing? How do I was like, check his behavior? This is the part. You're right. How do I strategies that worked with this with discouraging young kids from being aggressive. Don't discourage it. Harness it. Don't do it. Harness it. Especially for boys because look, if you discourage it, it's not like, Oh, I discouraged it. Now he's better. He's healed. No, it's all mass. It's going to lash out. Yeah. And it's going to lash out in a different way. It's going to go shoot, shoot up a mall or a school in 20 years. Okay. Like, don't discourage it. Encourage foster and harness it. And that's your job is a man. And his dad. So go spend 200 bucks or whatever it is. And send me a picture, by the way, you're in the iron council. So you better send me a picture in the next couple of days of you and him on mats fighting. And if I don't see that, I'm going to be disappointed. Yeah, getting some gloves to like there's yeah. Yeah. And it's great. Yeah. It's like, don't. Hey, don't hit your sister. But here's a punching bag. You can hit all you want. Yeah. Like, Oh, you want to fight cool. Matt's five minutes. Be there. I'll see you there. And get after it. Yeah. I'm a throw down. Brandon, if you haven't read the boy crisis, I would recommend that book. If you have a boy, a young boy, before he gets any older, read that book. And then you can utilize that as some counsel for us on how we can show up powerfully for our boys. Yeah, he has some interesting. And I think Jordan, Jordan Peterson is reference this data as well. The importance of rough and tumble play is the term they use and how sons and daughters learn boundaries. And I've learned a lot about social interactions through not telling them not to hit, but teaching them how to react in constructive environments. Yeah. Totally. All right, man. We got one more question. Okay. One more. Let's do it. Yeah, let's get it done. All right. Clayton Biden. Last week you mentioned online dating apps. See, we knew it was common. What's his last name? Biden. Don't judging. Okay. What are some of your thoughts, opinions, challenges and experiences regarding online dating versus meeting people face to face, considering how the dating market has changed over the past 20 years, I believe many men today are afraid to approach people in real life and feel safer swiping away virtually. And then he asks, do you see any role of artificial intelligence or AI on dating app programs? Well, there's definitely less risk approaching if you want to call it that approaching women online. Totally. Yeah. Because you don't have to deal with a consequence of getting rejected. I mean, there's still a level of rejection, but it's not as significant as a woman saying, no, you can't have my phone number. You know, well, and I even think it, it could be better. But like, like, let me give you this way. So if I'm excited about chatting with some chick online, and I don't. So don't like, you know, read into this. But if I if I'm excited about chatting with some chick. And, and I'm in the context of what we're talking about, then I'm willing to like, and you're even pausing, right? Like, it's not even immediate reply, right? It's like Ryan, write something and I, you wait 10 minutes and you reply. It's like, of course I'm witty. Because I'm 10 minutes to like, come over with a great response. Right. Like, funny. And yeah, so all the communication is going to be superior because there's all these massive gaps. I can imagine doing that face to face. You say something, then the person just sits there for like five minutes. And then they say it's like, you know, we have to start another conversation. But that's exactly what's happening. Right. And, and so the conversation is always going to go how you want it to go. Or it's going, you're going to read it in the context of where you want it to go. Because you're adding meaning to the text and everyone has all this time to prep the perfect response constantly. Yeah. Okay. So fascinating. It is. But you know, also, it's amazing too. Like it truly is amazing. So I think about it is amazing. I'm big into analogies obviously. And so here's one for you. Imagine you're a builder and you want to build this big beautiful home. And you've got a lot of business and you're trying to build these homes. And so what do you do? You go out and you invest in a high end air compressor and a nail gun and you get the right tools. Right. So let's take a nail gun. Beautiful. You get the two before us. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And you, I mean, seamless. It doesn't exert very much energy. The nail is driven in on the first one. It's very efficient, very effective. It's good. Does that mean that you shouldn't know how to hammer a nail? Because sometimes you may not know how to have the nail gun. And you still should know how to hammer a nail into a stud to create this, this home that you're trying to build. But just because it's available or just because it might be easier doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. I think you should use both. If you're in the dating space. I mean, what greater way to test an approach by doing it online when there's zero risk at all. You know, and so it's a great way to test your approach with women in a non threatening environment. I mean, there's no consequence to you for trying to approach a woman. Or strike up a conversation online like there is in person. So, yeah, use both. I do. I was going to say, I remember someone making a comment once with you and I on this podcast. Maybe there's a question where some guy said I'm, they, I can't remember the language they use, but they use some type of language that was like, they haven't met them yet. Like they were chatting up a girl online. Yeah, that's like, whoa, hold on guys. That's not a relationship. So, let's be really clear. This is a great tool. But ultimately, yeah, it should drive to actually face to face thing. Yeah. But I wouldn't say the same thing. So, here's where, here's where a lot of men go wrong, I think in dating is they have two high expectations, not for the women they want to date. But for the way that a thing will go. So, if you approach a woman with the expectation that you're going to get a date with her and she's going to be your next wife or maybe you'll get lucky and you'll get laid. And you put all these things in place that you want to have happen. It's going to create weirdness and awkwardness for you, which will naturally be communicated to her. So, what I would suggest is just drop the expectation. But you still, and I'm, again, I want to reiterate, I'm not saying the expectation of having a beautiful, lovely kind, whatever you're, you know, the woman that you're after. I'm not saying that. I'm saying of what will happen. And if you drop that, then you can just go have fun. So, if you're in the grocery store and you're trying to figure out how to approach women, then you should try to make the gal in line at the grocery store. Right? We'd like to make our laughs like not to get her number, not to get a date, just like just to see if you can make her laugh. Because if you can make her laugh then well done, you know how to make a woman laugh from nothing to now she's laughing with you. Right? Or, yeah. You know, you're at the, you're at an encounter. There's a woman that you, she's like a customer service rep at the, uh, at the car dealership. You got your car service dad and you are the DMV. That's even better example, the post office with the DMV. And she's miserable, of course, cause all of them are miserable. So just see if you can get her to smile. Just see if you can say something like, Hey, I'm here's, here's my goal day. Like I'm going to see if I can do something or say something to get her to smile. And that's it. And if you do, you're like, Oh, cool. That worked. And that builds a little bit of your confidence. When you're at the gym and you see an attractive woman, like don't go hound her. You know, but maybe there is something that, that you can say like, Oh, excuse me, are you using, are using this bench? I see some weights, but clearly she's not using it, right? Cause you know she's over there, but it's close enough where maybe she could, but it also gives you an opportunity to say something to her. Just say that. Hey, I know you're over here, but we're using this too. And she's going to say, Oh no. Okay. Cool. Thanks. That's a little win. You've got to strike up a conversation from nothing and you created an opportunity for yourself. So we had to drop those expectations of what could happen. And by the way, you should also, if you're trying to date women, you should also talk to ugly women because you don't care if an ugly woman responds to you the way that you want them to respond, but it will help you improve your ability to talk with. Pressure's not as high. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So you should talk with everybody. Guys too. And I'm not saying you're gay. I'm saying that learn how to approach people, learn how to communicate with people. Because if you can do it with a dude or you can do it with an ugly woman, then it's going to be easier when you see that attracted woman you'd really like to take on a date. Yeah. That's funny. Here's a, here's a challenge really quick. I read this. This is before TED talks were TED talks. This is a long, I'm dating myself here. This is a long time ago. And I'd even remember who the speaker is, but if you Google paradox of choice, there is this Google talk from this psych, the neuroscientist and he talks or psychiatrists that talks about there's always a paradox of choice. This is what I think is the challenge facing people nowadays with online dating before you lived in a village. Man, there was like five girls. If you happen to date the one you liked, that was maybe the prettiest or the kindness or whatever, and you married her, your confidence in that selection was super high. But now what's the possible, what's the possibilities for you? Millions globally. And so what happens is there's a paradox of when we had too many options available to us, we will question where there are choice was the right choice. That is the dilemma because now it's, oh, I'm going to marry my wife. The possibility of you going into that marriage with the idea that maybe she wasn't the best and there was better options or endless possibilities will alter the confidence that you have in the relationship. And here's, here's the rub. Statistically, if your confidence is high during the courting process, that will determine more success in a marriage than any other thing. Interesting. Like momentum, momentum is really what it is. But if you go into it like statistically like, ah, you know, we'll make it work. Oh, no. If your thought is I'll make it work or it will get better. Look at that thought process that it's not ideal. It's not the ideal state, but we'll find a way. That's a disaster. So be very careful with this idea of it's going, I think it's going to statistically be more difficult for people to make lasting commitments because of the availability of options placed before them. I don't know what you do with it. It's reality. It's the reality of living. It's craziness. Well, I think what you do with it is you use it to your advantage knowing that you don't have to settle for somebody you're not excited about. I mean, yeah, there's how many women make sure you're planning. Yeah. And then, you know, in the meantime, making yourself capable of attracting high quality, high value women, you know, and you should focus on that and you should focus on how to communicate with women and men and how to approach people and how to make people laugh both women and men. It is just isn't an issue. It's just not an issue if you're doing those exactly or maybe you are. I don't know, whatever, but I would just get the point. Get the point. Awesome. All right. All right. Should we wrap it up? Yeah. You went long. I'm going to be in the process of getting those battle plans ironed out before you join us in the IC. Yep. Let's see that. All right. Well, kid, I appreciate you, man. I'll enjoy the remaining time that you have there. And guys, appreciate the questions. We will be back on Friday until they go out there, take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life.
