    "text": " It's the Late Show Pancho with Stephen Colburn. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, my next guest tonight is a stand-up comedian, writer, and actor. He wrote and stars in the new film, Fire Island. Babe, you don't need a boyfriend. You just need to learn how to protect yourself a little bit more, because all this romance bullsh-t is making you way too vulnerable. You're like an open wound. Yeah, but I want the romance bullsh-t. I like the rom-com stuff, like kissing in the rain and standing outside my window with the boom box or confessing things in a gazebo, what's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong with that. It's just like that doesn't happen in real life. The only real thing is you and me. F*** the rest. Fine. If you're so invested in this, I will try and get laid. Please welcome to the Late Show Joel Cambuster. This is crazy. I used to get grounded for watching your show. So this is very surreal. That's wonderful. It was too scandalous or something too late. It was lampooning a part of politics that my parents happened to really love. Oh, so I hope they're watching tonight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not. The new movie Fire Island, you're calling it a gay pride and prejudice. Yes. That... Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Sure. Yeah. Propray for pride, not exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, tell us how you made the connection. Have you always been a Jane Austen fan? I have always been a Jane Austen fan. When I was little, we would watch the BBC mini series with Jennifer Ealy and Colin Firth. Colin Firth, yes, Ironic. Yeah, that was sort of my mom and I was like yearly tradition. We would watch that together and I'm a big fan of the Joe Wright version as well. And it wasn't until I went to Fire Island for the first time that I actually brought the book with me to read for the first time as an adult. And I was so struck by how relevant it actually felt to my experience going to that island and sort of navigating these weird sort of class systems that gay men sort of have created for themselves. Oh, wow. Yeah, and I went with Bowen, my co-star in the movie, and he, you know, I just turned to him at one point and I was like, wouldn't it be funny if I wrote a gay pride and prejudice set on Fire Island? And he threw something at me and everyone booed. And it just became this like threat that I would, you know, threaten to write year after year. And then, you know, we kept going back to the island and I would bring different Jane Austen books with me. And it just slowly started to crystallize and I realized it was, you know, as dumb as it sounded. A really good idea. Are there parallel characters? Like, are you Darcy? Are you Elizabeth? I'm Elizabeth. I'm Elizabeth. And it's Bowen, Jane. Bowen is Jane, yes. Okay. And Conrad Rickamora, who's in the movie, is my Darcy. I think he is, you know, no offense to Colin Firth, but I think he's the best Darcy out there. So for the people out there, the people out there who aren't from the New York area or don't know the history of Fire Island, what's so special about Fire Island in this regard? So Fire Island, and actually it's just a small section of Fire Island. The Pines and Cherry Grove, it's just a strip of land off of Long Island. And it is, you know, close to a century, it has been a safe haven for queer people to escape to where there are no cars, there's very little cell phone service, and there are no straight people either. And so, yeah, it's been a really, you know, it was really transformative for me to go for the first time because I don't think a lot of people realize sort of the weight that queer people carry around with them navigating straight society day in and day out. We love you. But to have an opportunity to have the other. To have an opportunity to go, you know, and to have that weight lifted suddenly was really, really powerful. Yeah. Well, you also have cast in this movie, The Great Margaret Show is in the movie. Is she Lady Catherine de Berg? No, she is Mrs. Bennet. She is her Mrs. Bennet, okay. You a long time fan of it? She changed my life. I mean, she completely blew open sort of my own conception of what was possible for myself in this industry. I don't think, I mean, I can draw a straight line from All American Girl to this movie because I think that show was the first time I ever saw myself represented on screen. And I think, you know, I just remember sitting like inches away from the TV watching that show just being enthralled and yeah, it wasn't until I saw Margaret that I thought, oh, I could do that. I could be an actor. I could be on television. You're not just a performer and there's not just a star of this. You also wrote it. You're also an executive producer of it. Do you enjoy being the boss? Yeah, I guess you could say a lot of pressure. A little bit of pressure for that. A little bossy. It was really gratifying though. I think like I've always looked up to people like, you know, Issa Rae and Phoebe Waller Bridge and like people who have our multi-hyphenates and who are doing it all. And so to get there and actually have the opportunity to do it and to be really good at all of it was really gratifying. Yeah. Now, I understand that comedy wasn't the first choice that originally you wanted to write dramas. Yeah, I actually happened. So I went to school and my emphasis was in playwriting. I really like, I wanted to write like eventually for the wire. You know, that was like my big dream in college. And I kept writing these plays that were very serious. They were, you know, about matricide and incest and like people would come and just find them to be so funny. And I was always like, what is happening? And it was just something that's in me. I think, you know, it developed as a defense mechanism growing up and I just couldn't help but write really funny characters. And so eventually I moved to Chicago to be a playwright and an actor. And I got really frustrated, I think, with, you know, at the time Asian people, we weren't having the conversations we're having about diversity right now. And so I got called in to be a Chinese food delivery boy like five times, I think in one year in Chicago. And I was really frustrated with that. And I decided to try stand up because it felt like the only outlet where I could be myself and really, you know, tell an honest version of myself on stage. And the rest is sort of history. There are some very famous lines, if you wouldn't mind, try something. There are some very famous lines from Jane Austen in general but also pride and prejudice very specifically. And I'm wondering whether you could translate them from early 19th century England into modern day fire island vernacular forest. Okay, yeah, I can definitely try. This is possibly the most famous one here. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. So that one, I think, translates pretty seamlessly into everybody knows if you're a guy with a big **** you have a lot of options. Stop like that. Not going to get better than that. Or so I've heard. Yeah. Fire Island is streaming now on Hulu. It's Joel Kim booster everybody. Joel, thank you so much for being here. This has been the Late Show Pacho with Stephen Colbert.
