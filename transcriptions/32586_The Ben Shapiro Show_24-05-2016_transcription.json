    "text": " Leftists love to play the I Can't Believe You're even upset about this game. Here are the rules. Leftists say or do something totally outrageous and stupid. For example, they say men should be able to use women's restrooms. Or maybe they say that kids should be forced to learn about homosexuality in public schools. Conservatives then respond by saying this stuff is insane. What are you people out of your minds? What the hell is wrong with you? Leftists then feign horror that Republicans should be so upset about these issues. Why are they so upset? Why can't you just be tolerant? Conservatives are just so angry all the time. Yeah, we're a little pissed. We're pissed that you can't leave characters that we already know and love alone. We're pissed that you won't leave us alone to make your own icons you jerks. Today's episode of I Can't Believe You're Even Upside About This comes courtesy of Hollywood. On Twitter, the hashtag GiveCaptainAmericaAboyfriend is trending. This is master level trolling by Leftists. They want to take an iconic American comic book character originally directed at children and teens and make him a homosexual. Moreover, they want to make that character who's supposed to be an embodiment of 1940s traditional morality and masculinity, an advocate for 2016 leftist social values. So Captain America for people who don't read comic books, he was encased in ice while fighting against Hitler. He's released from the ice like Rip Van Winkle decades later and his old fashioned love of America and belief in traditional moral values makes him an anachronism. That's why he's an interesting character. He's described in some of the later day comics of the ones they do now as sort of John McCain in the 30 year old body. Now the left wants Captain America to stop fighting fascism. Instead, they want him fighting to protect the world from Christian bakers. From the left nose, Captain America is iconic to three generations of Americans. And so they're looking to troll the right by conflating his American flag shield with the rainbow flag. And if conservatives say Captain America's traditional mission and personality, which by the way includes protecting traditional families and his own traditional love interests with all these been women, if they believe that's skewed by turning him into a parochial champion for gay rights, then we're the bigots, right? We're crazy. The left wants to simultaneously claim that being gay changes nothing about a character but that it's desperately important for characters to be gay. And they hijack already popular characters to do it instead of inventing new characters. Nobody cares. Conservatives don't care that they made Iceman from the X-Men gay. But people have a right to expect that the characters with whom they've identified for the last 60 years ought not be changed at the whim of the left. According to the left, however, popular characters can be shifted just on a dime. Alexis will trot out the actor who plays Chris Evans, who by the way hates me, to say that it wouldn't matter if Captain America were gay. That would be awesome. They already did that with Mark Hamill and Luke Skywalker, which by the way would make his original love triangle with Han Solo and Princess Leia even weirder than it already was and it already included incest. Leftists are now calling for Julian Anderson to be cast as James Bond. Yes, a chick to be cast as James Bond, which makes zero sense given that Bond's entire mo is that he's an ultra masculine womanizer, a woman picking up and having promiscuous sex with sophisticated men isn't a spy superhero. That's a normal Tuesday night in a dive bar. The Rogesh charm of Bond relies on the differences between the sexes. That Bond is a seducer, right? He's seducing women, which is actually conquering, right? But he's counterintuitively also a man of honor. That conflict doesn't exist for women. It ain't hard for women to conquer a man. All she has to do is give him a time and a blade. When it comes to pop culture, the left cheats. They can't invent a gay Captain United States or a female Jane Bond because those characters wouldn't be as popular as Captain America or James Bond. So instead, they'll try to steal those characters and twist them to fit their agenda. That's annoying. It's actually a betrayal of both the characters and the audience. Listen, we didn't buy the Captain America tickets because we wanted to see a make loved a bucky and we didn't buy James Bond because we want to see some sort of metaphor about female empowerment. It's boring, but the left won't stop and they won't stop complaining. If anybody challenges their stupid, irritating, immoral attempts to destroy the characters we once loved. I'm Ben Shapiro. This is the Ben Shapiro show. I'm not the best guy. I tend to demonize people because they don't care about your feelings. So I have a new theory about America and that is that we have now been trolled into absolute insanity. We've just been trolled into insanity. We've lost our minds because the left has lost their mind. And just a quick further note on Captain America, there's nothing wrong with saying that Captain America who's supposed to be a traditional representation of masculinity, yes, it changes the representation of masculinity if the guy is gay because part of masculinity is the idea that you're going to father children and that you're going to protect those children and protect women. It turns out men don't need other men to protect them as a general rule. Women do. This is because women have less upper body strength. The gang. It's because they're genetically different from men. Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman. When a man protects another man, it's not the same thing as a man protecting a woman. Everybody knows that. And that's why so many traditional heroes are straight, right? Because the idea is a man saving a woman is something that actually happens in real life. That's actually something that's necessary in real life. Go to countries where men don't protect women and see how well the women there do, right? Freedom is based on the notion that men are honorable, protect women, make children with women that they love and who love them in consensual fashion and then protect those kids. That's what civilization is based on. So yes, that's a slightly more important story to Western civilization and to individuals than a dude having sex with another dude. So yes, it makes a difference to character and character development. What kind of masculinity you're attempting to portray and the same thing is true in the bond context. I mean, the idea that you're going to make a female James Bond, it doesn't work on any level on any level. It doesn't work because the whole point of bond is that he's seducing these random beautiful women. And as I said earlier, a woman seducing a bunch of guys, you could be making trainer and seduce a bunch of guys, right? I mean, as Amy Schumer is fond of saying, it isn't hard for a lady to catch a bleep, right? It ain't that tough. What I'm going to say with bond is that who is the studded sky that he can get all these beautiful women? Nobody's asked her ever asked a beautiful woman. How is it that she can get all these studded skies? I wonder really as a toughy. Okay. So here's the thing. Left has made everybody's own nuts with their crazy trolling that we end up with just a crazy politics. We've all lost our minds. I think the greatest success of President Obama and the modern left is that the right absolutely went bonkers. And so now we have a bonkers left and a bonkers right fighting with each other for bonkers America. And the sad part about all of this is that normally when empires destroy themselves, normally when great, when great civilizations destroy themselves, it's because we reached a low point. All the troubles America's had in the past are actual troubles. Like for example, slavery, a trouble. We had a civil war, right? World War II, a trouble. We had a giant world war today. Which bathroom should we use? Let's have a huge war and fight each other and destroy each other and destroy the country and kill all the things the country's founded on because we need Caitlyn Jenner to be able to whip it out in the ladies room. This is how we've gone nuts is that there's not even an underlying conflict that's so grave that it requires this kind of insanity and anger and rage. But that's where we're going anyway. Anyway, so speaking of the trolling, the latest element of the trolling, we're going to show you the left's trolling. And the left's trolling is what has created our crazy politics. So let's start with yesterday. There's an officer named Officer New York. He's one of these officers in Baltimore who was who was arraigned by the by the politically motivated prosecutor and brought up on charges in the death of Freddie Gray. Freddie Gray was a 26 year old career criminal. He was arrested after he was carrying an illegal knife and ran from police. He was put into the back of a police van. He was not buckled in, right? He was handcuffed, but he was not buckled in. Apparently then in the back of the van, he was sort of banging on the back of the van and they stopped suddenly and he fell over and he and he the momentum of the stop pushed his head up against the back of the van and he and he broke his neck, right? He ends up dying from that a little bit later. And so they tried to try the cops. They tried to claim that the cops originally, first they tried to claim that they murdered him, right? They tried to claim that they brought him into custody and just murdered this guy for no reason. By the way, most of the cops are black. They then tried to claim that it was purposeful negligence, that they were that it was manslaughter, that they didn't care if this guy got killed and that's why they didn't buckle him in. In reality, the new orders, excuse me, that you were supposed to buckle in prisoners. That only changed about a week prior to the actual incident. So this officer was acquitted. They said it's clear he didn't mean to kill Freddie Gray. No, it meant to kill Freddie Gray. It's a terrible accident. It's really bad that it happened, but that doesn't mean that they purposefully pushed him down to the van and then rammed his head against the back of it or that they didn't buckle him up knowing that he was going to break his neck. I mean, honestly, if we're going to prosecute everybody in America who doesn't buckle up and then somebody gets killed, you're going to be prosecuting an awful lot of people. It turns out that most people who don't buckle up, it's because they forget and they're in an older car that doesn't have the beep beep in this particular car. It's in the back of the van. They don't have that system. In any case, Meghan Kelly had on Black Lives Matter leader, Deremicassen. Deremicassen is a troll. So when we talk about trolling, Deremicassen is a troll. He's a guy where he's had no career at all. He became prominent in Ferguson when he started tweeting about all of the evil, terrible things white people were doing in Ferguson and the federal authorities and the state authorities and the police. And he became very prominent because he was tweeting a lot and he gave up his regular job to become a full-time troll and where Marty McFly's vest from Back to the Future, except in Blue. And that's he always wears this. He always wears the thing where it looks like he jumped ship like in Back to the Future. And Deremicassen is now a national figure. It's funny because he ran for mayor of Baltimore this year. He won less than zero votes. People who are not yet born voted against him. He drew, I think, his 1% of the vote in Baltimore, which is where he's supposed to be popular. So he's on TV and Meghan Kelly's talking to him. Listen to the level of delusion for Deremicassen. And then you wonder why people are going nuts. This is why people are going nuts. And who caused it and how remains to be seen? But you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're positing to the audience that these cops did it. And I'm telling the audience thus far the evidence doesn't support that. What I'm saying is that there's one troll. So you don't know what the evidence in other five cases in either do I and that's why I'm excited to, to follow the cases. Well, I know why I was trying to buy a jury and it was, and it was a hung jury. So they were not able to conclude. Yeah, which again is not a good. And then the next, the next case that was tried by an African American judge concluded that there was no case against this officer. One case. So we are looking forward to the next five. And that's important. We'll see the next five. You know, even now that you have a knock guilty verdict against officer Nero, you continue to tell this audience that he did something wrong. No, what I continue to say is that I'm looking forward to the administrative review and that we do need to take a holistic look at the laws in the state of Maryland. What did you do? It is still, are you in Maryland in Baltimore city, it is okay for officers to hog tie and choke hold citizens. We don't think that that is okay. That's a separate thing. Okay, so you look at that, but what did officer Nero do? So I've already said this to you, Megan, is that this officer was involved in this case and what it says, what the judge said is that the officer was not criminally responsible. And this means that we need to continue the fight to make sure that the laws hold officers accountable. He had no responsibility as noted in the judge's decision today to intervene when he saw others misbehaving and that is important. We should push for policy. That's not what the judge concluded. He did not agree that anybody had misbehaved. No, he didn't. Thank you. I got to go. Okay, and Megan Kelly is totally right. If you read what the judge said, he didn't say that. He didn't say there was wrong doing, but the law just can't hold this guy responsible. What he found is that there's no evidence that anybody had done anything wrong, that this was an accident. Accidents are bad. Tough. You know, that's that's sad, but that's that's life. And Freddie Gray, by the way, did resist arrest and Freddie Gray had a long criminal record, which doesn't mean it's good that he got killed. But this idea that they just hog tied an innocent guy and then basically beat him to death, which was the original narrative. That is in true, but it doesn't matter. Right? Facts when conflicting with the left, they don't matter. Dramakessen says this guy basically should have been prosecuted anyway, even though he can't name a single shred of evidence the guy did that the guy did anything bad. So there's that, right? And then and then more trolls. So there's this professor who was on MSNBC live and he's a Morgan State University assistant, professor Dr. Lawrence Brown. And he's talking about the same Baltimore case. Listen to what he has to say about policing in the United States. You mentioned that there was an African American judge. We have a black mayor. We had a black policeman. But you know, American policing was founded on slave patrols. This system of policing has been always exacting disproportionate violence against African Americans throughout the history of this country. So I don't think that, you know, people here who are living in the communities where there's a high level of police aggression, a high level of police brutality, they're not going to be happy with this. I think there's going to have to be a lot of discussions about the criminal justice system right here in Baltimore, Maryland, whether or not it can in fact deliver justice for people living in disinvest their red line black communities. Remember prosecutors are used to working with the police. So is it even possible that they're going to deliver the best case that they can deliver? That they're going to be the strongest prosecutors they can when they're working with police? This is not case stuff. So the police in Baltimore, by the way, are majority black. There was a black police chief, a black prosecutor, a black mayor, a black attorney general, a black president of the United States and majority black city and a majority black city council. All of that is because originally policing was slave patrols. Okay. I'm not sure if this professor is aware of it, but police existed in the north too. It turns out that police have existed all across western civilization for literally more than a millennium, right? So this idea that there were no police, like this is not, it's nonsense. But again, he's just throwing out terms like we need to fix the criminal justice system to do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To do what? To go keep the state capital in Raleigh, evsent a thunderous message rolling out across America. That North Carolina is no longer a pioneer in advancing people of color, people who are gay, people who are gay, people who are living on the margins, instead many, here want to go back far back to a darker time. There's is not a place to relitigate each and every issue. But what other messaged did state legislators think they were sending? What did they intend when they seriously responded to this? what did they intend when they seriously restricted access to voting embraced the constitutional amendment that the night rights to gays and lesbians place more restrictions on abortion enacted a flatter taxes is a heavy okay so this is now he's listening off a bunch of things he doesn't like any saying that these are the same thing as not letting men into little girls bathrooms right so you're looking at this and you're going you're out of your mind these people are out of their mind and then just put the cap on it joy joy bayhara who is just oh my god i mean it's like god took all the annoying he took all the content of the annoying jar and poured them into one human joy bayhara on the view she's making the case here that that abortion is an affirmative good so again the trolling is just out of control the left is become more more truly back in the nineteen nineties they used to claim that they didn't like abortion they wanted safe legal and rare that was an incoherent position but at least it wasn't openly trolling joy bayhara says that she loves abortion abortion is an affirmative good abortion certainly it's a woman's uh... decision to make without consulting her husband that's not what with no i i didn't agree with that so it's a little hardly with that disagree but i'm telling you if it was me and i want to do it i don't care who tells me what to do it's my body i do what i want but it's also a child it's your body but it's your it's also your spouse's child so i do not take that into consideration that it's your spouse's child as well it's my body just after that not take that you don't take it that's my body it's your body with a with a child that i said to me if i want to get my tubes tried and and i had like a few kids already and he's like no let's just have sex i don't want to use a condom i'd get the tube side not telling that either without having the time it's my tubes they're my tools okay and and this is this kind of stuff you look at this you know like you're missing the entire point of the conversation we're not talking about your tubes we're not talking about your appendix no one cares we're talking about the baby that's inside there you just ignore the entire point and you've got all these other women there including people who are conservatives supposedly it's Nicole Wallace over on the right i think and jettie dia Bila in the center and they're both just going along with this to the extent that they're saying well you know shouldn't you at least consult your husband because it's his child too who that's not the question the question is is it a child if it's a child then you don't get to just sit there singing it's my body it isn't your body it isn't your body it's another body is another person's body but it so this trolling makes people insane so the trolling makes people insane and it leads people to the conclusion no matter what these people have to be stopped and i understand this i get it i so get it i really do believe me i've spent my entire life fighting harder than you fighting harder than the trump people the trump people were giving money to these people Donald trump gave money to these people okay i spent my entire life fighting the left my entire life fighting them and yet we're now being told that if we refuse to stand up for trump then we're doing something deeply wrong we're doing something terribly wrong Dennis Prager i keep mentioning him because i have so much respect for Dennis Prager as a moral voice Dennis Prager has a column today talking about his response to his conservative never trump friends he mentions me by name as well as a couple other people like Jonah Goldberg and Bill crystal and Brett Stevens in George well and basically what he says in the end when he basically says is i could not live with my conscience if i voted to help the america destroying left win the presidency in any way i don't understand how anyone who understands the threat the left and the democrats pose to america will refuse to vote for the only person who can stop them right only trump can stop the left right now and therefore you don't have a choice but to vote for him okay totally get this argument totally understand the logic totally understand the emotion and i will say this i think you and i said this many times i don't know how many times i have to say it but i said this many many times i fully understand and i sympathize with the position i disagree with the risk calculation i sympathize with the position Donald trump's a horror show he'll be better than hillary i understand that and if you're an honest person who believes this then when somebody says Donald trump's a horror show your answer should not be no Donald trump isn't a horror show your answer should be yes and hillary is a worse horror show right that and that's that's perfectly acceptable when Donald trump does something wrong you call it like you see it but you say he's still better than hillary i get it that's fine when i'm beginning to see in the movement and this is the trouble right this is where i say that conservatism is now being perverted the conservatism is being taken over by trump that the body snatchers have arrived is people who are moral voices not saying yes trump is a horror show but he's better than hillary i'm seeing people say well trump isn't so bad well trump isn't so bad and when you when make accusations against him when you say negative stuff about him it's not true people just ignore it will pretend it doesn't exist there's a tendency for every human being all human beings there's a real tendency to just get rid of difficult moral conflict by making the other side of moral conflict disappear right so if you're trying if you're leftist and you're trying to say Syrian Muslim refugees should enter the united states and somebody says those people are a security risk well then the easy thing to do is say well no they're not a security risk they're not a security risk at all let them all in that would be ignoring the problem in pretending that something doesn't exist that exists i'm seeing the same thing happen with people who want trump to be elected because it's very difficult to live with the psychological dissonance of saying Donald trump is a bad man who will do bad things but he's better than the other person that's hard to live with so instead what people are beginning to do is advocate for trump there's a difference between i'll advocate against hillary and therefore vote trump i'll vote trump to stop hillary and i want on trump to be president those are actually two different propositions people are identifying these two things when people make the i'll vote i'll vote for stalin to stop Hitler argument when they make that argument understand that when we allied with stalin to stop Hitler we were still fighting stalin okay during world war two we were still fighting stalin there's an actual competition for territory that we were going to control in the aftermath of world war two in the middle of world war two this is why there was a race to Berlin right the reason there is why not just let the russians do it they could have sacrificed their lives the reason is we didn't want the russians taking over western europe there was a competition even then this would be more like the equivalent if you're arguing in favor of trump as president not against hillary as president so we have to use trump because he's our only vehicle but in favor of trump as president you're now arguing that we should have made stalin president to stop it not that we should have allied with stalin to stop it or that we should have given him ultimate power and i have to say i think a lot of the people who are again who are yelling at those of us who are critical of donald trump understand something we're the only thing that's leading donald trump to even pretend to care about you we're the only reason trump is even pretending to care about conservatives because he's trying to consolidate us behind him and so he's making overtures to the conservative movement you guys are the sold out you guys are the said we're on board with trump once trump has gone board you're in the car he locked the doors there's no escape right the fact is that we're the ones outside the car saying we're not getting in the car unless you pledged to xy and z so even if you disagree with us you should be thanking us for pushing donald trump to the right okay all of that said the trolling has driven americans nuts particularly people on the right we've we've now gone full-on okay well they're disconnected from reality fine screw it we'll be disconnected from reality too so donald trump is now coming out and he is attacking the clinton's not on the basis of real things he's now attacking the clinton's on the basis of vince foster okay so i'm the basis of vince foster now for those of you who don't remember the nineties and i know i have a lot of listeners who are younger even than i am i was only 16 when the nineties ended so yeah i understand for those who don't remember okay vince foster was the deputy white house chief deputy white house counsel under the clinton's he was found dead in 1993 in fort marcy park he had shot himself in the head okay there are a lot of people conspiracy theorists who suggested that he had not killed himself that in fact the clinton's had killed him right the clinton's had taken him out and they had killed him because he was involved in whitewater whitewater was a scandal about a corrupt real estate deal in arkansas involving hillary clinton's rose law firm and and her husband the governor of arkansas well now now we have donald trump and donald trump has come out and he has and he is trying to dredge up this this vince foster routine in order to attack hillary clinton and his bizarre kind of line of attack here his his basic argument is that the clinton's probably killed vince foster he's not going to say so but the clinton's killed vince foster and the way that he puts it is so typically trumpian it's it's just it's typical trump his trump is a conspiracy theorist but he never wants to own his conspiracy theories he always kind of wants to just put it out there so i mean donald trump is a he's he's a bright bar comment troll right and we've decided to to elect him president because again you want to elect a bright bar comment troll president to stop hillary i get it don't tell me the bright bar comment troll is anything but a bright bar comment troll when that's what he is here's what donald trump said about vince foster and this is this is what's it really is amazing so so he says that the clinton's have dodged all of this and then he adds let me see if i can find the direct quote because the direct quote is just too amusing let's see here it is he said quote it's one thing with her it's whether it's whitewater or whether it's vince or whether it's been gazee it's always a mess with hillary clinton and then he continued by by saying i love this one he said let's see that the theories of pal play were quote very serious and the circumstances of foster's death were very fishy quote he had intimate knowledge of what was going on he knew everything that was going on and then all of a sudden he committed suicide i don't bring fosters this is so it's so trumpian i don't bring fosters death up because i don't know enough to really discuss it i will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder i don't do that because i don't think it's fair okay this is the equivalent of that that passive aggressive teenage girl who calls for friends is you know i'm not bringing up that i think you dress like a whore because because i know anything about i'm just saying people around the school they keep saying that you dress like a whore they dress like a little hooker and you know i'm not going to bring that up because i think it's mean but like people are just saying you dress like a whore okay everybody knows the teenage girl is saying you dress like a whore right i mean so so donald trump is accusing the clinton's murdering vince foster but no he would never do i've never said and he provides himself this sort of bizarre avenue out where if you say to him why are you throwing out conspiracy theories about vince foster then he says i was springing it up you know as people were saying people who are these people people were saying i hear from a lot of people a lot of people a lot of people say this a lot of people say this right and he did this routine if you recall he did the same routine about Ted Cruz's dad being involved in the kennedy assassination i'm not bringing it up because i think it's real but the national inquiry is said and i better tell you this you can believe me believe me they don't print things that don't have any substantiation you know this this is trump's routine so trump is is throwing out these crazy things and people on the right are saying okay fine well you know we let you you're trolling us well we'll troll you it's kind of funny i mean honestly it's kind of funny or we're kind of trolling we're trolling right and so donald trump and and we're willing to go along with it because donald trump also says he's going to fight dirty against the clinton's now i'll explain in a second why this is not beneficial but here's donald trump explaining why he's bringing up all these old issues against the clinton's i understand the clinton attack machine i got it and i think it has to be dealt with somewhat but i think maybe carl i don't like doing that i don't like doing that but i have no choice when she hits me on things i just have no choice so you have to do it it's unfair and you know they're dirty players they've been dirty players historically and i have to fight back the way i have to fight back all right and then voters will make up their mind as i said if it's in context everybody i think will understand it um but i hope you guys both just you're right i mean it should be issues right you and her on the issues i would rather have policy and issues you got to right policy and if you sound it and you first of all any of the donald trump ever wants to discuss policy and issues uh yeah right yeah yeah i mean the last time donald trump saw message discipline or issue discipline yeah the last time donald trump saw discipline is when she was whipping him at a bds m club i mean like the he never seen discipline before so that he wants to talk about about issues is ridiculous but people give him the benefit of the doubt because he's attacking the clinton's they're trolling us let's troll him right back with trump this is just trollery it's just joyful trollery here's the problem if you're the person in the middle and you're the person who's just watching this from the outside you're not an ardent trump supporter you say okay the one need a broad red stuff is kind of legit a woman actually accused him of rape they never dealt with it it's actually an issue and then he comes back with this vince foster stuff vince foster wrote a 27 page suicide note okay vince foster committed suicide because he didn't like being embroiled in this particular scandal so he shot himself when if you are going to be an attack dog like trump is and that by the way this is the part of trump i like okay part of trump i like is the attack dog that's the part i've always liked this go back listen to the show from the very beginning i've always liked donald trump attack dog it's my favorite part of donald trump here's the problem if you're an attack dog if this is what you do if you and and one day you hit hillary clinton with the frying pan that is one need a broad right you hit it right in the face of the frying pan okay good if the next day you hit her with a rubber chicken like vince foster now you just take out a rubber chicken you're smacking her with the rubber chicken people are going to assume you're a clown because you just hit her with a frying pan and now you're hitting her with a rubber chicken and that's sort of what i think i think trump is actually discrediting himself here by making attacks that that are not relevant just as political advice stick to attacks that are actually stick worthy don't just throw things out there because you haven't taken the time to actually research them but again trolls on the left bear trolls on the right and so here is a trump staffer explaining that when donald trump is talking about all these scandals from the nineteen ninety he's actually doing don he's actually doing the clinton's a favor here is donald trump surrogate michael kon is also the guy who is called donald trump's patriarch and he's and he's on with chris ko-mo here he is talking about how donald trump is actually trying to help the clinton's he defended bill clinton for years he said the same allegations that you guys are talking about now we're a waste of time we're wrong we're hollow that bill clinton was a terrific guy that he was a great president that the impeachment was wrong that it was a waste of time and hillary clinton said donald trump was one of the smartest best business men in the united states on several occasions now she's attacking him on these ads so she's bad too so she's bad too so she's bad for saying that she's great now going after all he's doing is he's giving the facts no no he's giving the facts he knew the facts then in the 90s when this was all happening and he said he was all privacy was a private citizen who was friendly with the clinton's and he tried to protect a friend all right now it's a different game it's 2016 my the presidential michael's the republican presidential nominee if you decide to run for office and people say hey you knew quomo back then used to say he's a guy i will always deny that you say but i will always now i'm running against them quomo's a bum that makes it okay absolutely come on because if i was telling the truth if i was telling the truth then it's absolutely he was lying then he's not lying he was protecting a friend there's a difference so again this is trollery of the highest level right so we've got the trolls on the left and now we've got donald trump's people out there saying well yeah he was defending the clinton's from all this stuff in the 90s but that was just as a friend now he's really mad about it now he's really upset about any things it's worthwhile so trollery from the left brings trollery from the right and so now we're just a nation of trolls that's all we've become the troll dolls and we have troll doll hair candidates and it's just it's a disaster all the way around all this has also created some odd alliances and very odd alliances and this is why it feels like the nuclear bomb of politics has hit because people are finding themselves in camps with people they never wanted to be with or or liked before so now all of a sudden you've got new gingrich who's ripping mit romney new hickinrich wants to be donald trump's vp's ripping mit romney and he's in the exact same camp he's in the exact same camp as alex jones so alex jones is a full-on conspiracy theorist false flag guy every time something bad happens in the united states he says it's a false flag for the government to grab more power he said it about sandy hook he said it about a number of things he's a real conspiracy theorist he and donald trump are on the same side which means that he and denis preiger are on the same side it means that alex jones and denis preiger and david duke and new gingrich are all on the same side it makes for some very weird bedfellows right it makes for weird bedfellows because this is what campaigns do but the weirder the guy at the top the weirder the bedfellows right david duke wasn't prominently mit romney alex jones wasn't prominently in support of mit romney right but they are certainly in prominent support of donald trump and this is creating some very weird bedfellows and on the other side we've got some weird bedfellows too so now i'm somebody who i've said i can't vote for donald trump for all the reasons i've expressed a thousand times i can't vote for donald trump as it currently stands if he changes maybe i'll change if there's new evidence maybe i'll change my mind i've said that and now i'm on the same side as people i can't stand like john hundsman right john hundsman is saying he has concerns about trump here's the former utah governor speaking presumably in english not in mandarin chinese as he did in one debate i i have said that i'd support the party's nominee and he is our party's nominee and so therefore i i i try to look for the good uh certainly i have uh i have uh uh uh concerns about some of the things he said uh in stylistic approaches but then i say uh okay he has a unique opportunity to bring together constituencies under the republican banner that really have never been joined before maybe to bring back the uh ragan democrats to bring folks into politics who have become disenfranchised and feel that the system doesn't respond to their needs anymore so to the extent that uh he can counter a mood of cynicism uh you know that that's probably a healthy thing in politics uh and we'll see i mean that the campaign is just ramping up and okay so you can stop here so i i say so john hundsman apparently is on the same side as all the rest of that crew but the people who are in my sense so here's the worst example of a person who's supposedly on my side and this is again when we reach a point in politics where you have to make difficult choices the easy thing to do is minimize the difficulty of the choice so on the one side the people who support trump you have people minimizing the risk of trumpism the risk of trump trollery and conspiracy theorizing in big government the risk of donald trump telling people that they ought to hit protesters and telling people that he wants to change the first amendment and telling people that he doesn't see any moral conflict between israel and the palestinians and telling people that women bleed from there wherever and telling people that it's okay to mock the disabled and p.o.w's you have people minimizing all that on the one side because they like trump and on the other side you have people like david brooks david brooks i cannot stand david brooks's work i think david brooks is not a republican i don't think he's a conservative i think david brooks is just some guy who works for the new york times who they call a conservative because they don't know what a conservative looks like if the conservative came up and punched them directly in the jaw so david brooks has a column today and he's a guy who doesn't like trump like me he's a guy who doesn't like trump but i like trump i just like trump for good reasons david brooks dislikes trump because david brooks is basically a democrat so david brooks comes out today and he writes a column in which he openly praises at length he openly praises and talks about the absolute wonders of hillary clinton right he actually comes out and he praises at length hillary clinton and what he says about hillary clinton is that she is quote unquote warm and caring this is what david brooks says okay which makes him the first human being to ever say this ever right what he actually says this is this is what he writes today he says she has dedicated herself to public service from advocate for children to senator she has pursued her vocation tirelessly really i mean she actually laughed about defending a child rapist she is endlessly corrupt i will talk in a second about her corruption because there's a bunch of it that's breaking in the news but hillary clinton is super duper duper corrupt and david brooks is now defending her so when i say that that conservatism is easily corrupted that is true from both sides the trump people corrupts conservatism if they are willing to say that trump is a conservative and overlook all of his flaws as a human being and as a candidate just to back him the same thing is true on the other side if you say trump is not a conservative because he's not hillary clinton if you say that that what we really what conservatism really is is what david brooks thinks it is you're destroying conservatism if you say conservatism really is what donald trump says it is you're destroying conservatism conservatism is neither of these two things conservatism is the set of ideas that actually founded the country and have nothing to do with creased pants for david brooks or strong man politics from donald trump all of this is really i mean look it's difficult to talk about this stuff and it's very disappointing to talk about this stuff if you don't think that there are folks like me who are you know look who are desperate to rah rah our guy it's much more fun to be a cheerleader than it is to be somebody who goes to a game and and has to critique both sides because you're trying to be honest about the principles of the game but i can't but i think it's important that we do that you can still vote for donald trump and critique him by the way as i've said you can still say donald trump is all these bad things but at least he's not hillary clinton that's an honest argument i even agree with it somewhat but you can't make the case that donald trump is the new face of conservatism and not say that he's not corrupting conservatism because that's utter sheer ridiculous garbage and meanwhile hillary clinton still can't despite all the trolling from the right hillary clinton is one of the left's trolls and so she is trying desperately to to claw her way back into this race and i really think the momentum is not on her side hillary clinton is struggling to respond here's hillary clinton going after donald trump standing in front of the seiu which is a major american union what little we know of his economic policies would be running up our debt starting trade wars letting wall street run wild all of that could cause another crash and devastate working families and our country trump economics is a recipe for lower wages fewer jobs more debt he could bank up america like he's bankrupted his companies okay weak t i mean ask yourself how can anybody lose money running a casino really okay this is weak t weak t because people look at hillary and they say you made all your money speaking in front of goldman sachs very weak t and speaking of corruption you can't accuse donald trump of being corrupt when you're hillary clinton everyone who has ever surrounded hillary clinton was probably at risk of going to jail okay the latest person who's at risk of going to jail is terry mccollough terry mccollough was he's now the governor of virginia but he's a super duper duper corrupt fund raiser for the clinton's he raised two hundred seventy five million dollars for the clinton's during the nineteen nineties uh he actually personally guaranteed the one point three five million dollar loan on the chapicle house that allowed hillary to establish residency in new york he's super duper corrupt and now they're in they're they're investigating the fbi is for his time as a board member of the clinton global initiative right so he may go to jail over all of this but hillary is supposed to be the non corrupt candidate yeah right there's a reason why polls show that she's unable to to rise above trump and and his trollery so the the trolling of america continues to pace and it's not going to stop anytime soon in things i hate i'll talk a little bit more about this trolling because this is the the left has moved up from beat from a party of principle to a party of trolling like bernie sanders isn't actually he looks like a troll but he's not actually a troll bernie sanders actually speaks mainstream left he speaks hardcore left thought right he actually speaks ideas they're really bad ideas which is why everyone thinks they're dumb but he speaks thought most of the left is now focused on on this trolling politics we'll get back to that in a second first a quick thing that i like so i decided i'm gonna do kind of children oriented movies this week i can't remember whether i did this one or not i don't think so but um did you searching for bobby fissure have an unsearching for all the fish people i don't think so it's searching for bobby fissure is a really really underrated film this is a film from the nineteen nineties with ben kingsley and laurin's fishburn uh and uh and it's about this this kid who's a child prodigy and chass named josh wateskin and it's a true story and it's about his kind of father struggles with competition and you have to have a killer mentality how do you win without becoming a mean bad person uh and it's really just it's a wonderful wonderful film a really enjoyable here's what the trailer looks like why do you want to send the play chess oh i don't he does he taught himself in a game where winning means the world tell me is the next bobby fissure somewhere in this room a channellish has begun their son creates like fissure he sees like him inside you're playing not to lose josh you've got to risk lose and you've got to risk everything i was wondering if you could keep him from playing there's no you're killing not to play in the park he loves it just makes my job a harder than your job's higher oh god yeah that's it my son has a gift he's better at this than i have ever been at anything in my life you have to have contempt for your opponents because if you don't think it's a part of winning your role trick or trade you have to hate them but they don't they hate you they hate you josh get out of my house to put a child in a position to care about winning and not to prepare him is wrong you better apply but i have to learn this is the way it works maybe it's better not to be the best it's a really good movie it's a really good movie and it's worth watching it's good for adults it's good for kids it's it's a really terrific movie okay thing is i hate so back to the trollery so hillary clinton is now going to meet the female goes busters she's gonna be on ln this is just more trolling okay female goes busters isn't in it in of itself a troll so i can speak objectively on this because i hate the original goes busters i'm one of the five people in america who thinks it's a terrible movie um and i can't understand for the life of me why people are so worshipful of it i think it's it's absolute garbage and try but people love this movie i know lindsey and and yeah lindsey and math is both are about to leap the camera and and strangle me to death um but i don't like the original goes busters so i can speak objectively about this no matter how much i dislike the original goes busters there is no way it could possibly be worse than the new ghost busters this new all female ghost busters this looks like this will be the worst movie ever made i mean legitimately the worst movie ever made so here is is the trailer for the new all female ghost busters i think i've shown it before but since i'm going to subject you to all sorts of suffering on today's show here is the the trailer for the new ghost busters uh uh it says 30 years ago four scientists saved new york this summer a new team will answer the call it's a class for apparition that's okay she seems peaceful my name is erin gilbert doctor of particle physics that's stuff one everywhere by the way in every crack very hard to wash off we have dedicated our whole lives to studying the paranormal now there's sightings all over the city there are people out there that need our help paltzbent you're a brilliant engineer oh erin no one's better at quantum physics than you we can provide a real service i'm joining the club you guys are really smart about this science stuff but i know new york and i can borrow a car from my uncle you didn't disclose that the vehicle was going to be a hearse it's a cadillac okay this movie looks like death right on a stick let's go let's go oh oh did you want to sorry i'll let you i'll let you next time is it doing stopping someone is i can't take it anymore this this looks so awful in every possible way it looks awful um and it specifically cast female because female empowerment yay okay so so yeah so you've got this garbage with with oh female ghost busters now we're really showing them in that we're equal to them by stealing their properties and pretending that we're as good at it as they are and being inferior we're this movie will be 78 percent is good as the original ghost busters is apparently the theory here uh and it won't even be that it'll be like 30 percent is good not even like the original ghost busters so they're doing that so what happens hillary is going to be on ellen to to neither one of them have been with a man in years but hillary is going to be on ellen's show with the female ghost busters because female empowerment yay and everybody who and this is the left trolling game again anybody who's up tight about this like did you make a movie specifically so that we vote for hillary clinton because if so if you took an original movie that a lot of people like i decided to make it crappy just to make a point about how hillary needs to be president you're all stupid and annoying right if we say that sort of thing oh well you're why are you going so crazy it's just women playing ghost busters what women can't be ghost busters i don't know screenwriters did you think black people can't be physicists apparently you think they're only street smart subway token operators right so the whole thing is just the left's trollery never ends the movie looks terrible hillary interacting with these people like oh if it weren't for hillary we would never have had a shot in life to be successful actresses because there weren't successful actresses until hillary was presidential mama nate whatever okay stupid stupid really stupid annoying okay plus uh my only question really is if hillary does meet the female ghost busters are they going to attempt to kill or capture her okay finally final final points about the left's trolling so the obama i will say this obama has been a transformative president because his trollery is he's a troll master level 40 chess playing troll so here's just more evidence that valorary jerett who's his right hand woman she she does she doesn't interview on 60 minutes they profile valorary jerett and valor jerett is sort of the brains of the operation supposedly and they ask her about obama's accomplishments listen to her list of obama's accomplishments and see if you can spot the trollery i keep thinking of the president's elections and those posters that said hope change and in his final year and office where's the hope and the change you can't even get a supreme court nominee a hearing well the hope and change nora doesn't come from washington then the hope and change comes from the american people and the president's still extraordinarily optimistic about the future of our country i mean just look at what's happened in the last seven years our unemployment rate going from 10 percent down to five our automobile industry back ending two wars 20 million people with health care many for the first time okay great deal to be proud of in terms of our accomplishments did you notice the massive trolling there so there are a couple things that are trolley right i mean first of all there's the obama care stuff all the prices are going up people are losing their doctors okay but the real trolling there is ending two wars ending two wars that's the real trollery there there are still people being killed in afghanistan gang 73 percent of all casualties in afghanistan have happened under this president and as far as ending the war in iraq yeah that's been a real that's gone fantastically well as isis takes over the top half of the country and iran takes over the bottom half that's been just wonderful so this is why people people feel like they're being gassed let they feel like they're going crazy and so they go to the guy who says fine i'll gaslight right back i'll just do crazy stuff look at me i'm a clown ha ha my funny like a clown do you and go get your shine box i mean that that's that's and so that that's what this entire election cycle has become and as decent thinkers fall into the trap of supporting any of this they're just becoming part of the troll universe a whole other universe filled with trolls wonderful and colorful trolls but trolls nonetheless and we'll be back to cover all of the trollery and all of the fun and all of the horror and and the zombie apocalypse that is sure to follow i'm ben Shapiro this is the ben Shapiro show"
