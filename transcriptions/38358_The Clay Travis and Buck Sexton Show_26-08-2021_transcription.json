No, I'm hearing a moment, but This is the opening paragraph of the Wall Street Journal story that just came down the US ambassador in Kabul has told staff there Four US Marines were killed in an explosion at the city's airport and three wounded A US official with knowledge of the briefing said at least three US troops were injured But again opening line of this sentence from their story at the Wall Street Journal US ambassador in Kabul has told staff there four US Marines killed in an explosion at the city's airport three wounded That is per the Wall Street Journal. We bring in now Kristi no I'm governor and Governor I imagine you're hearing that news as we are just now in real time. What is your reaction? It's horrific. I can't imagine what their families are feeling right now and they're watching their loved ones Serve their country in a situation. They never should have been it because of failed leadership by the United States president So, you know, this is a situation that Unfortunately, we're gonna have to continue day by day to get through but we absolutely have to recognize that the Responsibility for this lays on the administration and that when we get all the Americans Safely to a position where they can be protected that we need to dig into how this ever happened and hold people accountable I want to say too for everybody out there listening We're trying to bring you as much news as it happens as we can I know that a lot of you have friends family loved ones that are in the military Many of you listening to us right now may have friends family loved ones who are among those who are in Afghanistan Right now and we know how difficult hearing news like this can be for you But we're trying to bring you the latest updates as we as we get it and that news just came down We're talking to governor Kristi no one governor It's difficult to even Understand how much of a disaster this is for our country to have failed The Joe Biden administration to have failed on this level I know we're still dealing and grappling with the tragedies that are unfurling in real time But sooner or later we will go back and we will review the decisions that were made here if We are in the process of having had Donald Trump impeached over a phone call When you watch what's going on in Afghanistan right now There have to be significant consequences for the Biden administration with one of the biggest failures in Decades in American history. Maybe the biggest and most of the people who are listening right now is lives What needs to happen here? Well, let me be clear clay that Everything has to be on the table Because what what I've been struggling with is two different things in this situation number one I served on the Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives for years And there's protocols to withdrawing from this type of a situation the Department of Defense the Pentagon There are boxes you check there is normal standard operating procedures for how you withdraw troops from a war zone and from an area that's dangerous like this and President Trump laid out the blueprint Perfectly when he withdrew our troops from Iraq He defeated Isis first and we were able to withdraw from a position of strength So absolutely I'm trying to figure out what was a decision that was made by this administration and what was just inept and idiot Decisions that were made by leaders that weren't protecting our national security interests every single day And that's really what we're gonna have to get to the bottom of and boy We are absolutely gonna hold those accountable for who made those decisions or who overlooked the importance of keeping our American troops and our American citizens safe No, no, it's black. I appreciate your perspective on the issues in Afghanistan And we will continue to update everybody over the course of the show about what is happening on the ground there and what the security situation is as it Seems to be rapidly deteriorating. I also wanted to get your View on the situation here at home. I would argue that we're in a period where freedom Individual freedom is under greater assault than at any time in my lifetime But because of covid because of the vaccine mandates the mask requirements all these different Regulations that are going into effect now. They're private companies now the federal government's getting involved You had before you the opportunity and and if you want to add some some context to exactly what the bill would have done by all means You're the one who's actually the governor in South Dakota But you had an opportunity to sign something that your Republican led legislators Republican Dominated legislature would have put forward to protect individuals on the basis of conscience from being forced by private businesses in your state To get Vaccinated why did you oppose them on this? Why are you unwilling to go forward with that? Well, that is not true Number one in the state of South Dakota The people have been more free than anywhere else in this country during this pandemic We never once closed a single business never once issued a shelter in place never mandated anything such as masks or requirements at all Okay, that's analysis. What's not true? What is not true is the fact that this bill was proposed to me and brought to me by my legislature I have two legislators who drafted a bill that they can call themselves into session if they have the support of their colleagues to bring it to me And place it on my desk. Will you sign it bill is unlike anything that is proposed in this country? And the reason that I am I am not in favor of their bill is because I'm a conservative I'm a conservative that respects the Constitution and I believe the leaders today are overstepping their authority We live through 18 months of hell so in what in what constitutional analysis to you under your state health authority not have the right to do this Because these guys in this bill are trying to make a government that's more powerful and that is bigger that will step in between the Relationship between people and their employers and will make decisions for them and when I'm not governor anymore How do I know the next governor won't use that exact same precedent to use it to limit the freedom? But you are the governor now governor known and and right now we're at a point where there are mandates going people are having to get shots Right now people are facing losing their jobs Right now why not be a person who is taking a stand in favor of individual freedom Which I believe is actually the primary purpose of the Constitution. Why not do that? There is Nobody in this country that would wouldn't say that I know other governor took more heat over defending liberty and freedom than I did This I'm anything governor Ron DeSantis might disagree, but keep going You invited me on your show let me talk go ahead if you think if you think that I have the authority to step in between This relationship, then you think Joe Biden should be able to mandate vaccines to everybody in this country as well That's not true. You have more power at the state level. You have plenary power. He has that I just disagree with your constitutional analysis Government must be constrained by the Constitution. It is not conservative to grow government and to tell and dictate to businesses If we did that buck then you're saying it's okay For liberals to tell cakebakers that they have to bake cakes for gay marriages that Liberals and government have the ability to tell nuns and hobby lobby that they have to provide contraception to their employees Now conservatives like myself they fight that government overreach tooth and nail we tell Employers that they have a relationship with their employees and South Dakota is a right to work state This bill that these legislators have discussed are pro labor. It's pro union There's no other bill in this country that is written like this bill We have in South Dakota and I will get up every single day and continue to fight for my Curiosity because this is the second time no I've covered I banned vaccine. No, this is this is not I understand I'm not asking you about the rest of what you've done during the process of COVID I'm asking you about what you're doing right now Conservatives were a conservative matter madam That I've made in this country. I would like I would like to ask you another question I would like to ask you another question. It's actually my show so tell me this when you initially opposed the Transgender bill from your legislature. You said it was because and by the way, I don't work for the South Dakota legislature So I don't know it's something there were some revision some some changes you want to it Did you ever actually get those revisions and sign a bill to protect women from having to compete against men and sports in your state? Absolutely, I've got an executive orders in place right now that protect girls sports in K-12 and college athletics I already have drafted bills But I'll be bringing when we go into session that will be signed into law That was not the question with those bills that were brought to South Dakota Those bills would have immediately because they were so flawed Would have ended up in court and I wouldn't have been able to enforce anything So your executive order will not end up in court is that the contention? It will not absolutely not and neither will the bills that I'll be bringing because they will be drafted correctly that can withstand challenges in court So I'm glad I'm glad to hear that there was follow up on that and just to be clear then so you will under no circumstances sign Anything and wherever it may be in the process here that would prevent private businesses I mean I just why not so it's because you think that big government because the other side is going to do this that you're talking about unilateral Disarmament and saying that Joe Biden is going to push this at the federal level He's going to do this no matter what you do Why not use your power as the governor of a very red state to protect individual rights from the from vaccine mandates by businesses? You can do it under your state authority You ask every single family that's living in a Democrat run state right now What happened when the government overstepped their authority took away their rights and freedoms? I do not have the authority to dictate what you're asking me to do I will not step out of my role as government and I will not governor and I will not go forward and do something That I don't have the authority under the Constitution to do I will give people every tool that they possibly can have to fight and I will fight for them And I will make sure that I'm going after ensuing the Biden administration for these vaccine mandates And I will go after and continue to defend their freedoms and make sure that I'm not requiring my state employees to get vaccinated I have already banned vaccine passports here and that is exactly the respect that I have for this country When you have a leader buck like you're asking me to do when you have a leader overstepped their authority, especially in a time of crisis That's when we lose this country and what you're asking me to do is no better than what these liberals have done the last I think you're I think you're ducking and I think you're refusing to take a stand once again That's what I think so we're we are free to disagree on this issue But you have a state that would back you on this you have the votes in the legislature if we want to go forward with it And you have someone has to be in the vanguard here for freedom someone has to actually say enough is enough For that written bill that those two legislators have they absolutely can bring that bill call themselves into session and bring it to me And I'll evaluate it. So will you sign it? I mean you said by the way, you said you would sign the trans bill and then backed off of it We know that happened. Would you sign this bill or not? That is not true, Buck, and I don't know where you haven't been to South Legislative session and hurt these debates Let me ask you this as we got a hit a break here in a sec. What is your view on? Masks on school children. We've got all sorts of craziness going on as it pertains to kids being required to wear masks in South Dakota What's your perspective on that? Our kids are not going to be wearing masks and in schools Our k-12 system I think overwhelmingly Everyone agrees that it's best for kids to go back and be in the classroom and to do that in the environment Where they can learn and be successful All right governor We do appreciate you coming on the show and talking to us about all these issues And we certainly are all aligned on getting all Americans out of Afghanistan as soon as possible We look forward to talking to you again soon Sounds great.

It's a heck of a deal do it now Welcome back to the clay Travis and bucks sexton show we are going to bring you up-to-date information Every every second here a segment here for the whole day of course on what's going on We have we have the horrible news about four Marines killed in action in Afghanistan from the suicide bombings three Marines injured and Dozens of Afghan civilians killed and injured we're gonna follow up more analysis on this We will have a Lara Logan from Fox News joining at 205 now just just because I know that it seemed like why are we talking about Something that's not this for a moment And first I would say thank you to governor Kristi gnome for coming on and for being willing to hear an opposing point of view The the gnome camp the comms folks from gnomes team pretty but I mean they didn't demand but they very strenuously wanted the opportunity to come on because there's been a lot of pushback and publicly including from people like me about What seemed like an unwillingness to go forward with this bill in the end? You know we can get into the specifics of it, but in the aftermath of the transgender bill Issue in South Dakota then there was more criticism over this the gnome camp wanted to come on and they wanted to discuss this And I didn't want to walk away from it Have a lot of respect for governor gnome has done in the state of South Dakota about COVID specifically have praised her multiple times on my show and I think clay one thing that That has to be remembered here is you know We're trying we have to sometimes hold in our own minds and whatever way that may be people in positions of power who are on our team Want them to do the best for their people and I disagree with the governor's Analysis that she doesn't have the power. I think I made that very clear I'm sorry for anybody there was any cross talk and also You know if there was any inability to hear some parts of that But I think it's important to know that right now We're being overrun by man mandates are gonna hit all over the country and if no one is going to stop They're just gonna get you with private sector mandates are gonna get you with federal mandates Everyone's gonna be getting the shots soon unless someone comes up with a way to stop it That's what we're heading for clay and that's very frustrating And I think also part of it is I'm angry about what's happened here in New York City And I would love to see governor gnome be the beach head of sanity and freedom from these Mandates and so that came across in an impassioned way But the gnome camp knows that I have a lot of respect for what's going on there and and just want I just want to say all that and also respect that you wanted to come on and actually talk about it what people disagree and I've been straightforward and transparent about this for a long time People disagreeing doesn't mean that you disagree about everything under the Sun But you and the governor have a disagreement the governor came on and wanted to talk about that disagreement I give her credit and her staff for reaching out and wanting to come on and look We're not gonna run from people who disagree with if I call someone out in public and they want to come on this show We're gonna I'm gonna have them on the show and we're gonna actually have the discussion on air Yeah, I mean that's that's the way it's good above the show as well like we believe the First Amendment Should be alive and well so you are not like CNN You and the governor had have a disagreement and so you could pretend that you don't have that disagreement or Her team can say hey can we come on and talk about this and you guys can go back and forth arguing the two perspectives I think that's what healthy debate should be we'll come back and update you on the latest in Afghanistan But we want to tell you three words from an injured veteran define what tunnel the towers foundation does They gave my life back my freedom back not just for myself, but for my family these words so powerful We're nearly 20 years since 9-11 and the foundation is honoring heroes with 200 mortgage-free homes for gold star and fallen First responder families with young children and for the veterans and first responders with catastrophic injuries These homes bring hope and improve lives help tunnel the tower support even more heroes and families in need By donating $11 a month at t2t.org Remember never forget donate $11 a month to tunnel to towers at t2t.org Your generosity helps to ensure that we truly do never forget nearly 20 years later t2t.org Welcome again clay Travis bucks accident show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We're doing our best to update you on the situation on the ground Statement by the Pentagon just released We can confirm a number of u.s. Service members were killed in today's complex attack at Kabul airport a number of others are being treated for wounds We also know a number of Afghans fell victim to this heinous attack our thoughts and prayers Go out to the loved ones and teammates of all those killed and injured Buck what this does is it changes the calculus around what had always been a disastrous on-the-ground situation and Unfortunately, this is what we have been talking about now for a couple of weeks that we had allowed the situation on the ground to become so untenable That the overall violence or chances of violence were increasing and unfortunately we saw it just a couple of hours ago and our brave soldiers for Marines killed at least three wounded in this suicide attack and Right when the moment that we lose American servicemen and women clay it just raises and everybody's minds the the stakes it raises the sense of heightened risk that everybody else in the ground is going through right now and We often talk about politics and political decisions here and we discussed the Biden administration the lack of of foresight planning tactical Acumen skill that has very serious consequences. That's what we're seeing here It's this isn't this isn't arguing over whether the marginal tax rate is you know 35% or 37 or whatever This is life and death. This is the national security of the United States that is involved here and of our people most important the most important obligation that our government has is to keep our people and yes to keep our soldiers out of harm's way and This is its tragic and I just can't help but think about the families of those Marines right now and you know clay. There's also part of me that can't help but also immediately go to What's next we're not out of there? We got thousands of soldiers on the ground. You've got hakani network swirling around in Kabul you've got people that Clearly wish us harm that are already being picked up in chatter from the various surveillance Apparata sees that we have there and this is going to be a situation where I mean the Biden administration honestly I feel like is in hope and pray mode in a lot of ways. Yeah, they're trying to get people out. There's things going on But what escalation can they really do here now in response to this threat? They're not in charge of security on the ground Yeah, and the silence from the White House and really from all spokespersons and everybody else remember This is as recently as yesterday basically Gen Psaki was bragging trying to brag anyway about how well the evacuation had gone from Afghanistan and now we've got dead American soldiers as a result of the incompetence of this administration and to your point things may get much worse on the ground before they get better and Again Joe Biden nowhere to be heard not answering questions Not discussing the reality of what has become the biggest foreign policy disaster Since Saigon in 1975 and we may have an issue here Where we're gonna be leaving a lot of Americans on the ground in the first hour of this program Sean Parnell told us He thought there was a hundred percent chance that American citizens were gonna have to be left behind which could create a Iran hostage situation like Jimmy Carter dealt with and you've already got Biden's approval ratings tanking the failures at the border The failures with the murder rate the failures with inflation Everything that Joe Biden is touching is turning to crap effectively and this is the biggest mess in decades generations of American foreign policy Let's open up the lines and hear from some of you out there and especially if you're in contact with anybody who's on the ground in Kabul Or you know anybody who's working to try to get Interpreters SIV holders Americans should put Americans first of course and I mean to Give us give us a call 800-282-2882 We also have real-time updates for you on this story at clay and buck calm Linda in Chicago, Illinois Welcome. Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to really call and compliment you on your interview with Christine Oh, and how well you did it because the things that you said to her were what I would have said and what I would have asked her And I had wanted to hear from her What she had to say in response about the the you know the women's sports thing And other things and I really and I want to thank you for pushing back a bit with her and It made me a little I'm all about not what people say, but what they actually do and so because talk is cheap You can say any people politicians say things all the time that I agree with but then if they don't Actually do it. I you know, I've I've gone away from wondering about what people have said because so but I thought you did a really fine job and and She did give me some answers that I Appreciated knowing her stance. It made me I'll feel a little less because I was very pro-Christian. Oh, and then when she did what she did with the with the you know The transgender bill I mean anybody who's wondering you can go and watch the Tucker interview with her Tucker Carlson interview with her months ago on that one And I would just say watch that interview and come to your own conclusions about what you what you think And then for a lot of people on the right there has been in the last couple of days some pretty substantial pushback and the gnome camp is Going after people publicly on social media very aggressively in response to so look sometimes You know, we've all been at the Thanksgiving dinner table And we you know, I mean clay is a you know, clay's a guy of those sports I mean if I sit down at the Travis table and I say the Tennessee Titans are gonna go Oh and 14 or something this year. It's gonna get a little contentious Doesn't mean that you're not sitting at the same table and you're all part of the same family But I think if we're gonna get the right answers I think we need to push sometimes and I think that there's a there's urgency right now They're they're lining up all the mandates all the state push all across the country and I mean I think a lot of us really want to see something that will prevent a continuous regime of Vax passports needles in arms and this is obviously very personal to me because of what I've been going through here in New York City So Linda that was that was the intent and I'm if you felt the interview was illuminating then I Really appreciate that and and we try and like I said It's within the family folks I'm today we can't always agree on all the things all the time on the right You know a lot of people that became big Trump supporters clay in the early days and conservative media I remember they were very opposed to president Donald Trump But then people forgave them because they figured out what was really going on and what the Trump movement was all about No doubt by the way update on Afghanistan and this is cowardly But probably not surprising the state department says they will not have a press briefing today So we're talking about the silence the void the absence of responsibility that we are seeing from the administration in control right now The state department just said we're not talking at all to the American people now Maybe the White House is going to have a press briefing really what needs to happen Buck And I think you probably agree with me on this is Joe Biden needs to come out directly address the American people Apologize for the failures of the afghan evacuation and he needs to personally call all of these marine families certainly at an absolute minimum and We know they have a ton of people out there listening to us right now who have family may have family serving in Afghanistan You've heard the news for Marines killed three wounded in this explosion worst fears confirmed remember We hadn't had any casualties in Afghanistan in 18 months I think if I'm correct about this leading up to the evacuation it had been fairly safe on the ground and now Everything has gone It's gone to complete hell I mean frankly if you look at what's going on right there and we're concerned that it may get worse from here At least that's what the the data might suggest is where we are headed But I want to tell you about my my friends and also my family specifically my wife I've been getting relief from everyday severe pain. She's been getting hooked up. She looks she trains people She is a she is an incredible athlete. She does all sorts of training whether it's Pilates Whether it's spin all these different things and a lot of times you get worked up and physically Need weakened you just need to be able to get back and not have any pain and that's why she loves relief factor It's all natural and it is taken care of all of her recovery from workout pain It can take care of your aging pain all different sorts of issues 100% drug free created by doctors based on scientific research helps your body reduce pain and inflammation buck I know your mom and dad also were using it and they love it. Absolutely. It's brought great relief Particularly for my dad who's had some knee pain and loves to get out there on the golf course and just be active day-to-day And relief factors really helped relief factor is 100% drug free. It addresses joint pain knee pain hit back shoulder pain You name it because relief factor goes to the source of inflammation hundreds of thousands of people have ordered relief factor And about 70% of them go on to order more join the more than half a million people in order the three week quick start for only 1995 go to relief factor calm or call 800 for relief to get the 1995 three week quick start develop for you Go to relief factor calm or call 800 the number four relief relief factor feel the difference Welcome back to the clay Travis and Buck Sexton show phones open 800-282-2882 800-282-8882 and we've got Victor in Orange County, California on the line Victor. What's up? Yeah, guys, thanks for have a couple of Well, I think we lost Victor. I think he's can we hear him? Yeah, can you guys hear me? Yeah? Hello, yeah, man. Yeah, you called us here. Are you guys there? Yes? Okay, so the governor of Shout Dakota I do think she has a point if you mandate this if she does this then what's gonna stop the next administration from doing the same thing Well, okay, I mean the difference between let me just say this there's a difference between a mandate, which is California Yeah, I understand but so let me just explain there's a difference between a mandate that requires something Right like I am mandating you do X and a mandate that guarantees your freedom from Something which doesn't require you to do anything and I think that's a significant difference right and you can use the mask example as an You know to kind of think through it what people are arguing for buck and I other people I'm a parent is the right to choose whether or not your kid wears a mask That is the freedom to make a choice That is not a mask not wearing mask mandate. That's the freedom as a parent to make a choice a Mandate which is what's happening in many blue states is we are demanding that you do this and so what I think and buck You can explain exactly that but I think there's a difference between a mandate requiring an action and a mandate that makes clear that you aren't Required to do something those are two fundamentally different. We don't live in a false like libertarian utopia Where business is I mean just takes out the coda for example There's a there are licensing authorities in that state for for funeral homes for For chiropractors if there's a lot of regulations that you have to go through There's a minimum wage in the state of south there There's a lot of things that businesses are told they can and can't do sometimes having to do with safety regulations other times having to do with Economic regulation and I just got to say I mean on this this point that you know Oh the Biden administration will do it so we shouldn't do it You'll notice something here the mandates all go in one way The left uses its power to force people to do things in this case to force needles in your arms And we have to find out a way to get that to stop We have to find a way to get it to no longer be the case the federal government has a lot of coercive power Especially for example with hospital systems, but just in general and they're saying they want private companies to do this States under their health authority and also under anti-discrimination Discrimination law have a lot of leeway, but just even under their health department Leeway they could determine that forcing people to take a vaccine that we haven't even had now What I'm doing a third booster shot. We don't even know What that's going to be we haven't done the real trials for this that that's not safe And they won't make they won't allow a private business to make people do it the same way that you can as a private business Decide you're not going to serve certain people because of immutable characteristics There's a lot of case law to support doing something to protect freedom or guys We can all just sit around and hope that the government doesn't just come for us in one way or another Which is where we are right now. That's that's my feeling on it and you know, I see it in New York They're making everyone get the shot Well, we have power here lots of governors have made a decision that they're not going to allow vaccine mandates They have done that in Florida. They have done that in Texas. They have done that in Tennessee I believe in Georgia, Oklahoma. I could run through a long list Arkansas I believe as well a lot of red states have made that move and so I think it's an interesting question to debate on a philosophical level and again the other thing to factor in here is Every state legislature Legislature is different right there are lots of unique Specificities in each individual state But but that is look I mean again. She wanted to come on the show. They requested an opportunity to come on the show and Very clear, but it was their ask that they wanted to come on And if you see some of the exchanges between the governor and some other conservative pundits in the last 24 hours or so You'll see this is this people feel very strongly about this very it's it's gotten pretty contentious Because it feels like if we're gonna surrender Yeah, or how about this? How about going on offense in favor of freedom instead of playing the oh, but Small government game. That's the that's the question that we face now. We've been trying to say let's play the small government game for a while We are now defending on our one-yard line I mean they're about to start forcing needles into your kids arms everybody clay and I know it that's happening So we can either try to rally against this in a meaningful way or you're gonna end up like everybody I know in New York getting the shot one way or the other and we're talking to Alex Barrington by the way tomorrow about all of this because he's been so great at analyzing the data and telling us where everything is headed and You're just now starting to hear people Recognize oh wait Israel which is one of those vaccinated countries in the world they got more jabs and more people's arms than basically any country The vaccine is failing after about six months and so there's a panic setting in inside of the Biden administration dr Fauci everybody else You've got all these different states making illogical decisions governor of Oregon masking we're now required outdoors All of this is lining up in a pretty colossal mess And so figuring out how to fight this is going to be I believe the number one battle that we're fighting as we move through the fall in the winter when it's naturally a Big issue by the way breaking news wall street journal will continue to break this down for you at least 60 Afghans killed in the Kabul explosions as well as the four United States Marines No group has officially claimed responsibility We will talk about the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and what it means going forward here in the United States when we come back We're also going to be joined right after this break by lilyra logan from fox news who spent a lot of time on the ground in the middle East we'll see what she thinks about all the chaotic images coming out of Afghanistan She has had a lot of experience in that situation. It should be a really interesting conversation to be sure A seismically important day in the world of news and we will continue to break it all down for you Thanks for hanging with us You're listening to clay Travis and buck sexton on the ei-b network"
