    "text": " Finally, some good news. Thursday, September 27th on CBS, the comedy that took on the world and the legendary voice that changed the conversation, Murphy Brown is back. I will insert here my own personal testimony, which is that the Murphy Brown show is one of the shows that sort of formed my idea of what it meant to be a female journalist. So I'm super excited about this reboot. Emmy winner Candace Bergen returns to lead the charge along with original castmates Faith Ford and Grant Shawd. This time around Murphy anchors a new morning news show that tackles the issues of the day and she's going to head to head with none other than her grown son Avery played by Jake McDormand. Tyne Daly in Nick Dodani ran out the cast and what promises to be the funniest of the moment comedy from original creator Diane English. Check out trailers, interviews with the cast and behind the scenes footage at CBS.com slash shows slash Murphy dash Brown and Facebook.com slash Murphy Brown CBS. No matter which way you lean, funny is funny and Murphy's back bringing the laughs. It all starts at Thursday, September 27th at 9 30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific 830 Central on CBS. Hi, I'm Anna Marie Cox and welcome to With Friends Like These where we talk about the differences between us without letting them divide us. My guest this week is writer and comedian Trevon Free who I have known for long enough that I do not remember how we met. I think it may have been Twitter. We also have mutual friends at The Daily Show where he has worked. He's also worked at The Ringer where I have friends. He now works on Samantha Bee's show and I know people there. In any case, I was going to talk to him about comedy because that is the main way that I know him and I was excited to talk to him about the impact of the Me Too movement on comedy, the impact of sort of generalized wokeness on comedy and social justice. But that is not what we talked about. He will have to come back to talk about those things. We talked about something else entirely which is what it's like to be one of the few out bisexual black men in the entertainment business today and how as a kid growing up in Compton, he navigated his awareness of being different without knowing exactly what kind of different he was. It actually turned out to be one of my favorite interviews I've ever done on this show. And then also a perennial favorite interview, Tommy Vitor who you may recognize from other podcasts on the Crooked Media Network. He stops by to talk about the new Pod Save America Initiative Vote Save America. And then finally just a few thoughts from me on the cabin on nomination. So I am excited to have you on. I've wanted to have you on for a long time because I want to talk to you about comedy and I want to talk to you about sports. And I was doing some research or rather more accurately, my crackerjack producer, Cat, was doing some research. And I was so excited to have you on to talk about those things. But it also turns out and correct me if I'm wrong here, but you are bisexual. Yes. And and let me check my notes. You also black. Absolutely. Turns out those two things can tell exist. Well, I mean, I'm going to toss it to you. Do you want to talk about those things? I can anything. You tell me. We'll do it. Well, because you know, I only ask because you have actually been in the news a little bit lately because of this show you're working on. Yes. And which is called tell us about the show. Shows called him or her. It's based primarily on my life, my dating life. And with some fictionalized elements, of course. But yeah, it's just a show about what it is like to be blackmailed by sexual dating in America in 2018. And I actually I could just let you start there because what is it like? It's complicated. Because I'm thinking like I've thinking like life is already complicated for the things that we already know about you. Yeah, it makes it makes dating a lot harder, specifically because like I'm what they would call or consider like Kinsey three. So I'm like, right in the middle. And I have like basically no preference for any particular. You're in the middle of that side. Yeah. And so not in the exact middle. So you're not like a five. No, no, no, I'm like, I I'm just gender blind at it basically. So it really, it can really make things a lot more difficult when you're dating because like you end up encountering people who feel different types of ways about who you are as a person. And some people love it and are completely fine with it. Some people have a lot of questions and you feel like you're like being interrogated in like Guantanamo Bay. And yeah, it just it's all over the place, but it it's landed itself to some really create like instances and stories in my life. And I felt like there was no representation of me on TV anywhere. And so I took it upon myself to try to create a show. And in the copious research that I did, someone pointed out that actually it's really strange that there's not more representation of male black bisexual people because it's a kind of big proportion of the LGBTQ community. Yeah, it's 52% of the community is and you would think we were like these like there was like seven of us in the whole world. The way TV looks. Yeah, I can actually like off the top of my head. Like I cannot think of anyone. Yeah, I did a panel for out outfest. And it was about by representation in media. And it was me and five women. And they one of the questions was when was the first time you saw yourself represented on TV or in film or in media. And everyone had an answer except me. And I said, I've never seen it. And I threw it out to the room. I was like, anybody in here ever seen a character in anything and no one had an answer. Yeah. So basically you'll be it. I will be a lot of people. Yeah, I'll be the beginning of this hopefully larger thing that happens. And I asked you if you wanted to talk about it because I also know that there is it's not always fun or good or freeing to be the representation. Yeah, I mean, it's it's one of those things that like over time when I discovered there was so little of it, it was just like, well, I guess someone has to do it. And I don't mind being the one doing it if no one else is. I'm like, I hope to inspire more people to get on board and get comfortable and feel feel good about it. But I mean, there are people in the industry who are fairly well known people who refuse to be out about it. And I wish that would change. It's such a weird time for people to feel like they still should be in the closet or that it's like not safe. Because those numbers is what makes it safer. The more visibility you have, the easier it is to exist. But yeah, I think as far as I know, I mean, I've talked to so many people about it. Like, do you know anybody? Do you know anybody? Like, no, I was talking, I talked to Lena Waithe about it like recently, like at length, and I'm like, we were literally trying to figure it out. And there was like, no one the closest we came to a name was like Frank Ocean. It's a good one. That's a good name to have in your back pocket. Man, that was the closest we came. And like, I don't even know if he's confirmed he's by or we just kind of like infer from the information he puts out. So yeah, it's just me and Frank. Again, that's good company, but you're right. That's very happy to share the table with him. That's not a lot of people. And I'm curious, do you think it's something about bisexuality in particular that keeps some people in the closet? Like, they might be more comfortable coming out as gay or sometimes you hear queer as kind of a coverall? Yeah, I think it's in part, at least due to the stigma that's existed around it for so long. And people wanting you to be in one box or the other and people not willing to not being willing to do the work of explaining who you are as a person and finding it easier to just do one or the other. Because I get messages from people who are still closeted about their bisexuality who are like, it's just so much easier for me to do this one thing or like, I don't want to have to like tell my family or whatever the case may be. And when you couple that with, you look at for however long in the last like 10 or 15 years, being bi has been basically a joke on TV shows and and things like that where it's been dismissed as like not a real thing. And even people like Dan Savage, like only in the last couple years decided to acknowledge that it was a real thing. And I think that makes it harder for people to want to speak up about it when they're like, why put myself through this when I can just either be one or the other. I can be in one box or the other box straight or I can appear to be straight or appear to be gay depending on who I like settle up with. But I think for me, I want to be as visible as possible so that people can start to free themselves. So as someone who knows you in person, I can say that you are hard to ignore. You are a very tall, imposing physical presence. And I'll just forgive my gender normativity here, but you're definitely like a dude's dude. No, yeah. Present yourself. I mean, I for more former Division One athlete, yeah, like you're I mean take it how you will. I would say that you're a dude. I don't mean that as any kind of insult. No, I mean, I talk about that. I talked about that yesterday, actually. I don't know what was I don't know if I was doing an interview or something. You're doing so many interviews. We talked to you. We're gonna forget you talk to me. Oh, no, actually funny enough. I talked about it today to interview ideas this morning. Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. You're in demand. Okay. Just about I do acknowledge that I have a I guess you could call it heteronormative privilege where I don't people don't look at me and assume I'm not straight or they don't talk to me and think of me as anything. And I can I still like run into people who don't know and will say certain things about people when I have to like tell them like you're talking to a member of that community. So when I was like younger in high school and things like that where I saw kids getting bullied for being perceived as queer, like I didn't have to go through that because to them seemed like a straight guy and I was dating girls because of the time I really didn't know anything else in terms of like I knew I was different but I didn't know what it was yet. So I never had to deal with that and I knew I was lucky to be able to go through those years unbullied because of people not being able to quote unquote clock me as anything other than straight. And but I also like lately have been thinking about what about me or my personality or even my style is a result of me also trying to protect myself from that. So like do I dress the way I dress because I want to or do I dress the way I dress because like growing up that was what I needed to do to be perceived as normal or straight. And like what about me would have been different had I embraced or were able to embrace my complete self at a younger age. Like you see kids now as young as like five six seven eight nine declaring their gender sexuality and like what that expression would look like if I were declaring they don't know which is also like a perfectly fine thing to do. Right. And I don't I don't know what part of my identity was solely built on survival and protection and what part of it is actually just like who I would have been regardless. So because you grew up in this sort of heteronormative privilege and you're an athlete and you're in presentation you know a dude and you didn't have bisexual representation you could look at I am curious what was it like discovering that that's who you were. How did you begin to know because it isn't it would be I imagine it would be difficult to kind of figure it out. Yeah because I didn't have any I didn't have anything to go on I didn't have any examples of like oh this person I'm like that person like I didn't have that like so it was very difficult in the up until like 14 15 16 when I knew there was something other than attraction to women which I like I know I was like I know I'm not gay I know what gay is but I've never really heard about any other types of sexuality and it's like I know I like women like at the time me and my girlfriend were having sex and I was very much enjoying that. It was cool. It was something great to me. So yeah it wasn't like this feels weird or this is like not like what I would expect it to be like no it was great and I knew I was like I definitely like this but what is this other thing and I didn't have a word for it and I didn't know I knew I couldn't really talk to anybody about it because I grew up in like a pretty religious family and so I just kind of like spent years kind of doing my own like research and I kind of I kind of grew up. Okay now I have to stop you it's a little uncomfortable but when you say research I mean it was really just me googling things. Okay I was like are you yeah like I mean yeah it was just me literally googling literally like that kind of research not like people research no I mean this person that person. No I had no access to people I had no access to anything other than women like as like because if anyone when I was in high school was gay or anything other than that they definitely weren't out about it. I know no out kids from when I was in high school especially like growing up in content and so when I luckily for me like the family or the the computer in our home was in my bedroom so I spent a lot of time just like googling and reading things and then I like started learning that there were other letters in that acronym and also that was around the time AOL instant messenger was a big thing and so I was also meeting people around the country or world who were also in different sexual groups and then so I kind of grew up through conversations with other kids and people on the internet and like articles about sexuality and that kind of steered me in the direction of like okay there's a word for this now I know what it is and now I have to figure out how to wrestle with that and deal with my like I've been fed all this religious stuff and I feel like I'm supposed to not be this now how do I deal with this and so that was what kind of like what college was like it was college college which is basically me deprogramming like self-hatred and getting to the point where I was like oh no like I'm supposed to be me and there's nothing wrong with me and I'm awesome and if you don't agree fuck you like like that that happened like maybe around 20 where I was like I'm done fighting like who I am and because it it felt like a fight like you shouldn't feel like you're fighting against your natural state of it's like your body wants to be alive like your body will do a lot to keep you alive before it can't anymore like that's why you can't hold your breath until you die like it's like a natural instincts and so I felt like I'm fighting natural instincts and so up until like when I got the freedom in college to explore dating guys or doing like any type of sexual anything with guys after that happened for the first time that's when it really kind of solidified where I was like oh okay so I'm a person who very much enjoys men and women and that's who I am and like I'm not gay I'm not straight and since I'll I forget I literally sometimes forget when I'm talking about certain things or having conversations when especially because people ask me about men generally when it comes to things and I have to remind myself I don't speak for straight men which I forget sometimes because I'm not one so I theoretically I don't know I can't speak to a completely hetero male experience because I don't live one and so but oftentimes I get asked about things that are kind of just heteronormative or explaining things about men generally and I have to remind people or mine myself like this is also coming through the lens of somebody who also dates men and women and it will color it you have to take that with that grain of salt.

I want to back up just a second to the like the research you did and the exploring you did because I'll you know be transparent about my own where my mind goes there is a part of me that's like oh you would look at porn right like that's the kind of thing that you you you do when you're trying to explore your sexuality but it really sounds like to me and it was pretty serious for you that you were reading stuff like you're like trying to figure out psychologically like who I am yeah I'm very clearly like I was you're looking for information and I think that's maybe something people don't realize yeah but this isn't just about what feels good yeah I was like reading articles I like legit like I can still remember some of the like what they looked like on these like crazy websites but like weird colored backgrounds and like different colored texts that people were writing on their blogs and shit like I very clear I was doing a lot of research like I really didn't like back then also like porn wasn't what it is today like especially on the internet like this we're talking like 99 it's an it was an ASCII actually people didn't realize that it was it was very much photographs and so it wasn't it wasn't doing anything for me like porn was still very much on VHS and I know because I had a couple and my mom found him it was still VHS and magazines so that I wasn't like I'm on the internet like today man that would be crazy you could find so much stuff with a very basic Google search so like for me like you google bisexual or you google gay in 1999 and you definitely not getting what you get today well I'm pointing it out because I'm trying to find kind of a point of connection here and I'm thinking of for me when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I was like oh my god that explains so much you know like it was just I had a thing that described my experience right and it just and I could like fit I was like I now know what it is that I that I am right at least in this one category right and I I'm seeing is that so that was a little bit like for you like like oh this yes this is who I am it totally just like you just feel like the pieces of you have finally been like put together the puzzle is finally like put together and now you just spend the rest of your life like mending those pieces as tightly together as you possibly can when you when you get a word for or some type of uh explanation identity or part of your identity right you get to figure out what your identity how you identify or what you or what they tell you your identity is and how you choose to then relate to it or how you choose to interact with it and I should be very clear I'm not saying that bisexuality is some kind of disorder but I'm just trying to think of like no no yeah yeah absolutely no I told it and I was also thinking about how when you said bisexuality was like considered like almost literally just a joke it was a punch line um the one of the ways it wasn't a punch line just because I have disorder in my head now is it was considered almost like a sign of bad character like it's what villains were a sign of a villain in like a tv drama right they like both men and women can't trust them right I still like search eBay and places and I find really old magazines and books about like oh I found an old time magazine about by so the cover story was bisexuality and from like the 70s and I found like these old books doctors had written and what was the other thing um it was time magazine it was the something else I was thinking that I also found but like yeah just like looking for old stuff like that to read and see what people actually thought about what it was and it's really fascinating how just and I you you will tell me if these questions get get too personal or uncomfortable but um I trust that you will but I'm also thinking about how like I do think people probably misunderstand bisexuality I think that it is we because we don't see it because we don't hear it talked about um because it's the silent T right silent B sorry um an lg tvq um I think a lot of people are like oh well that's like you know every once in a while you might right get drunk at a party and kiss his guy right but that's not what it is no not even even a little bit like I think it's because it's a mix of for so long we've thought of sexuality as too rigid to begin with and it's because of that that like someone at a party like doing whatever what could be branded something else is why someone who actually lives under that identity deals with the downside of it so like people who like I still get people who like say why don't you just like come over to our side and it's like oh like what do you mean like come over here it's like I'm on your side and I'm also like not on your side like it's not about like picking a team like you have a designated team and I have a designated team it just happens that my team uh plays in both conferences I was waiting for how you're going to do this sports metaphor there I would say that Trayvon your ringer that's what you are yeah I mean it's it's more of those things you'll play for any team and you're very good yeah like wherever you need me I'll go so it's it's because of like the history of I mean if anything you can blame homophobia on a lot of the problems that by people deal with because gay people had to spend so much time pretending to be by to get to be in gay and so then that became a stereotype and it's like all you trace all the way back and it's just like we just took the brunt of all of it and now in 2018 we get to finally start to define and clarify who and what we are in our in our communities and with our identity and so it's it's it's still a lot of work left to do when like even today and like almost 2019 there's one of me out here doing this and on the on the grand stage when I know for a fact I'm not the only one you mentioned in talking about you know growing up and coming to terms with your identity that you your family's very religious and you struggled with that a bit what what happened there I mean thinking back to when I was maybe early high school I remember when I was still going to church with some level of regularity there was a guy who came to our church who was like one of those reformed gay guys who now has a wife and may I think he had a kid and was like there to teach us to like we can whatever is alien you we can be you can be different and I felt like I think in retrospect as an adult looking back on this I can now see all the things that were happening or like the church knew there were gay kids or or kids who were different and wanted to just blanket it under through the entire group of kids of the church and do it as like a catch-all and I remember going to this thing and know like hearing his story about how he used to be gay and I think drug addict and all this stuff and then he like God changed him and I remember at the time being so afraid of hell and all those things where I was like maybe like this guy can like help me like figure out how he can't right how to not how to not be this and like I would love to know what that guy is today by the way but I remember telling him him remember him saying something about like if you want to talk to me in private or whatever like feel free or whatever and I remember telling him like I feel like I'm struggling with my sexuality and his response being it was because my dad wasn't around and at the time I got it know any better some like okay I'll take your word for it maybe maybe that could be I'm not a scientist but you're a grown-up who's a reformed gay and I'm just like like a kid so at the time I was like okay but then as time went on I was like that's just just not right like that just can't be like this is only getting stronger as I get older and so once I got out of when I got to the point of my life where I didn't have to go to church anymore I stopped and I just got tired of hearing certain things about gay people and hell and all that stuff and yeah that can get old I would say yeah like you're just like I'm having a hard enough time on my own buddy like spare me and so when I got to high school I remember my cousin I hadn't gone to church in a while my cousin asked me to go to church with her and by this time I had already just like finally cleansed myself of the religious part I just spent like the first two years of my college life just deprogramming and like meeting other gay people who were like out and happy and like except had accepted who they were and I was like I want to be that I want to be free of every single day feeling like there's a god hovering above me who's just looking down on me in shame and and it's like why well then why did you make me this way if if this is so bad and then over like days and months of thinking these things you've I finally was just like enough like I've had enough like I if if this is what gets me to hell fuck it like oh boy you mean that quite literally yeah like right like if we hear fucking going out guns blazing I'm gonna have all the fun in the while I'm living this life it's gonna be amazing and then by that time I just I started to slowly put myself into queer spaces where like I wasn't afraid to be around people who were gay lesbians so that because people might think I was which was like a fear in the beginning and then like my best like one of my best friends still today who's lesbian we went to I went to Long Beach State and we went to like Long Beach Pride together with like a group of us and I had like the best time and I did that thing where I ran into a person from my class who also wasn't really like out and we had that moment where we're like you you like that spider-man meme we were just both pointing at each other and the spider-man costume and then oh yeah the acknowledgement of like yeah like this is what this is what these years are for right and so over time I just became more and more comfortable where like I was telling friends and people close to me but I wasn't like going around telling everyone but also if people knew I wasn't gonna deny it and by that time I hadn't gone to church in a long time and my cousin had invited me to come to her church because she earned her her family or like very into church and she knew that I hadn't been going and she wanted me to like get back into it and the so I decided to go with her one Sunday and at the end of the service the pastor asked everyone to stay because he had an announcement and the announcement was that they had discovered that someone who was working in the church in one of the leadership roles who also worked with kids was gay and that they wanted this person to leave their post and they didn't say them by name excuse me they didn't call them out by name but I found it to be so offensive and so gross that one by doing this publicly when this person does leave their post everyone will now know who they are and every member of this church will know what person is no longer in charge of what group they've been in charge of for however long previous to this and it just reminded I felt like that happened on purpose like I needed to be there that day to have that experience and that was the pretty much end for me and I didn't find anything religious until late and like maybe around 22 23 when I started reading more just general spiritual type stuff it had nothing to do with any particular dogmatic type religious or religion or anything like that where it was just like here's a way to better yourself mentally and spiritually and think of God in a different way and that kind of reshaped my relationship to to God and quote-unquote religion but as far as going to a Baptist church or anything like that I was like I was just done with it um Michael Arsenault is on the show a couple weeks ago and he has I think is kind of similar experience although he's also says that God is is still really important to him for uh yeah I read his book he's great I love my yeah he's great he's great everyone should buy his book too um I guess everyone is buying his book yeah I believe it's a bestseller so yeah um so part of your story that I'm really curious about is that you did come into your own in college which I'm gonna be for me that's young like it took I I was very late bloomer and you came into your own you decided to be who you were despite the fact that you didn't see a lot of people like you right and where do you think that came from and I'm gonna give you just a little bit of like a throat-aligned if you want to take it which is I wonder if your sense of humor is playing a part in that I I think you I think you're right I think it does definitely it's hard to do comedy and be funny and because that that it comes from such a deep place within your identity and it's such a big part of who you are but I think I think that definitely played a part in it because it's something you can't when you're thinking about how you view the world you can't take that lens off so I would I would agree I think it's that and I also think it it's partly because I grew up whether it was like a good thing or bad thing with uh not a lot of fear because of where I grew so like I kind of almost became numb to what it meant to be afraid of thing like it's almost like I've broken my body's defense mechanism that would probably save my life which is like what I'm supposed to be afraid I'm not kind of thing like those people who like can't feel pain and they'll don't know their hands on a hot stove or something um because I saw so much crazy stuff growing up like I've seen people be murdered and I've seen literally like everything you can imagine um and so when you're that close to that kind of stuff you one realize how short and how precious life is and how quickly it can be taken away but you also you're like if that if watching what I've seen in one instance in my life which is like a group of people literally be gunned down with an assault rifle um if that doesn't scare me like what is like just owning up to who I am even though there's no one for me to look to and just like doing just seeing what happens like it's if growing up where I grew up couldn't kill me like this can try um I don't know I don't know how successful you'll be but it was just like I had I had people around me who just were what they were and when I got when I felt like I got to a safe place where I could at least start to explore what it was and figure out what it was and then be around people like my best friend Sasha uh who's lesbian and like other friends of mine who are queer um it it made it easy for me to go yeah like this is me and even though I don't see anybody like me I think I think I think this year I made two friends one I made one friend who was five this year just I know one other black by man who's a friend who we became friends this year and up until then it was like I didn't know I know a lot of by women like there's there everywhere and they're out and they're proud um but I was just so drawing along like being me and I felt like it came to a point where I had to stop looking and just start being I had to decide like when you look at history somebody had to be first or second or the first visible example of something and I was like you know what I don't want to think of myself as this like uh grand person or like whatever you want to call it but the Jackie Robinson of bisexuals yeah they have pretty much like if that's who I have to be like I'll do whatever I'll do it um and hopefully we can get people to follow suit um because it it really is in some ways like an isolated experience to not have it to not have someone to talk to about it who can relate in that same way um I mean to to also to that point I don't know a lot of by white man either I know a lot of gay men um black and white um but not a lot of by of either and I know they're out there I think they're just waiting for you Trevon I think I'm here guys right I feel like we need to do like our own Coachella or something just like get us all in one place and exchange emails a group text yeah like a massive group text yeah well I I really appreciate you coming on you are always a joy to talk

little bigger than the last one they're bigger and 100% rat free except for the human ones we had a bit of an infestation of the ill place we had a toilet that exploded and destroyed the place below us and you couldn't flush while we were recording so yeah it was it was not a perfect office listen to the segue so speaking of like bigger and better things yes speaking of like grand plans speaking of expanding democracy democracy tell me about this thing and I was gonna say the other segue I was going to use is that since I'm not in the home office very much I'm ignorant of a lot of the bigger crooked media plans apparently guys have an HBO deal too so interesting oh yeah well that'll think anyway tell me voting about voting so one thing we hear all the time from people a couple things one my vote doesn't matter doesn't make a difference either way two that the process can feel a little bit intimidating like registering can feel a little bit harder than you think finding your polling place can feel hard it's maybe it's hard to get off working a day so what we wanted to create was a website vote saveramerica.com that is like a one-stop shop for how to register to vote how to pledge to vote how to find out if you're registered if you're not sure tell me more about the pledging to vote so you just you click out you click a button and you pledge and we get your email and we'll remind you okay and then in the same site you can find all kinds of volunteering activities and opportunities near you so if you live in Texas and you want to knock on doors for better or work you can do that if you want to knock doors for your congressional candidate you can do that you can find all those things all in the same place and if you live in a safe place as they say you can find ways to make calls for because I live in Minnesota Minneapolis so well so you guys have some cool congressional races but I mean you could make you could make calls you could find a phone back to make calls into wherever you want and then additionally there are some very cool and competitive Minnesota races there really are you guys have some good stuff going on and then lastly it's not ready yet but you will be able to get a sample ballot that explains to you who's on the ticket in plain English all kinds of ballot initiative information because those can be weird and complicated like what is a bond on prop 4 to like write stuff like that we try to write it in plain English and you can get a sample ballot and fill it out so that when you go into the voting booth you're not taking through lots of stuff unsure what to do you've like pre-prepared it and you would that be right down to the very local races like for state legislature yeah wow because that's the stuff that I think I even as a seasoned political reporter when it gets down to the super local races my excuse is one paying so much attention to national races so yeah time but like I think that imagine for just the casual kind of consumer of political news yeah directions on how if we can cut this together it makes sense but like I think you guys could be pointing towards people resources for finding out more yes I mean the in in it's funny when we were first talking about creating the site my response was how does this doesn't already exist and it just doesn't because it's actually really complicated to pull together information from 50 states because voting state by state rules are different deadlines are different deadlines change week to week you know tanya and shiniqua and niki on our team like they were this whole team was building this this site and pulling together information like literally calling secretary of state offices in various states to try to get it all and it is incredibly painstaking like data entry that took time and effort but I think it will be invaluable it does speak to the fact that our process isn't that great but I really think people will find it useful we're trying to make it easy we're trying to help people understand the matters and just talk about the stuff in plain english that they can understand I think people don't understand that it is unusually and unnecessarily difficult to vote in america it is right like that because it is considered a state level issue states make up because you guys talk about this and we've because voter registration and voter access has become more a part of like the democratic parties like top line level issue people may know this but it is really a patchwork accessibility a patchwork of like what the rules are of who like how things get you know proportioned and it seems like it's always changing that's because it often is always changing right yeah like if you live in california you can get a ballot sent to your house you can fill it out and vote by mail it's the most wonderful way to do it yeah it's a great way to do it some states have same day registration but in some of those states you have to register somewhere different than you vote because that makes no sense so we're not explaining this stuff to re-intimidate people but to say these rules these deadlines and things will be spelled out it'll make it as easy to be possible you can and i guess i'm saying it because if you thought it was if you were intimidated well that's because you were supposed to be yeah right it's because there are people in power the states that have the really complicated systems tell me tell me tell me do they have something in common yes is there the weird like venn diagram where we can see states that have overly complicated living systems and what they might have in common i think there is i think uh for some reason republicans don't want young people people of color people that aren't rich to vote people have a accessibility access access problems with other things you know they have trouble getting to polls yep and sometimes they even cynically use the the disabilities laws to make it harder to vote oh and if you've ever had any brush with the law well then god forbid right you can be in congress but you can't vote for it that's right a lot of these states it is i mean and this is the most cynical thing that has happened in over the decades and it's it's i think the number one issue that's the most voters experience and yet don't realize is up is a political problem that they could solve that they have a say and just saying and this year's a big year for a variety of reasons uh there you know it's obviously just matters in terms of checking trump but it also matters because we're about to go to a census year so they'll be redistricting so all the gerrymandering we complain about uh we'll get addressed on a state-by-state level but also like if we vote for a lot of great democratic candidates for secretary state positions they can help put forward laws that make it easier to vote that reduce some of these voter suppression tactics and uh you know level of playing field a bit i will repeat the thing that i said after trump was elected that i i wanted to be wrong but still sometimes kind of rears its ugly head and my most paranoid fantasies which is i do feel like the republicans often behave like a party that thinks it doesn't have to worry about winning fair elections anymore yeah that's right it's it's it's hard it's so frustrating it these they're very good at consolidating power once they get it with these undemocratic uh tactics and it takes extra work to fix those so that's why registered to vote everybody vote save america vote save america dot com we built this thing offer code friends no oh wait sorry there's no there's no commerce associated it's a it's a gigantic some cost that we just think is important so no offer code yeah koffer code uh friends all right please vote all right thank you tell me thank you great to see you so just a few final thoughts today first of all i want to give you a trigger warning because i'm going to talk about the cabinet hearing that's supposed to happen on monday taping this on thursday should happen on monday may or may not happen and i'm going to talk about sexual assault and giving you the trigger warning is reminding me that the cabinet hearing itself and all discussions of it should probably come with a trigger warning at the very least they should be accompanied by a banner across the bottom of our television screen with the number for the national sexual assault hotline which is if you didn't know 800 646 hope it's one of the very sad signs of the time i now have that number memorized and i'm not kidding about the need for it after the clearance thomas i need a hill hearings reporting of workplace sexual harassment went up 79 percent after each report about a high profile sexual predator that national sexual assault hotline sees its calls go up about 25 percent and that's without many people taking into account that these discussions need to be accompanied by some kind of trigger warning or some sort of outreach to people who are being triggered because every time we talk about this these allegations are triggering people the men and women who have been through it the victims and survivors and i think this is true and important to recognize but i think some of the assailants are triggered as well the idea that this sort of national conversation we're having brings up traumatic memories for the people who are exposed to them is sometimes kind of part of our discussion and i think it's usually just taken as a given but i actually think that people being re-exposed to memories of their own trauma is the most important thing about these discussions we're going through a national conversation in which people are being forced to relive re-examine reprocess and re-evaluate things they never thought they'd have to think about again and i know this includes survivors it includes me i think and i hope that it includes the assailants because i think there are a lot more people out there like Brett Kavanaugh than there are like Harvey Weinstein i think there are millions of people probably mostly men who did something once who did something once that they maybe not think of as stupid or embarrassing or a mistake or maybe they don't think about it at all and because they've lived more or less above-board lives since then they've never thought of themselves as part of the problem we've talked before about how simply benefiting from male privilege makes one's part of problem we've talked before about how simply benefiting from male privilege can make you part of the problem but i'd like to take this opportunity but i'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that people really dig into their memories and re-examining that people really dig into their memories and maybe re-examine that one time you maybe went over the line because we've gotten in the habit of thinking that men aren't really sexual predators that there isn't really a problem unless there's a pattern even though we recognize it only takes one experience with being preyed upon that makes a person a survivor but if that's true if we can agree that a person can be scarred for life by just one experience with sexual violence then maybe we need to reckon with what that one experience means for the person committing sexual violence for what it's worth i don't think that one mistake one incident should mean the same thing as being a full-time predator but i think it has to mean something because it definitely meant something for the person on the other side Neal"
