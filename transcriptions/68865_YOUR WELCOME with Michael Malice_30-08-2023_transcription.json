    "text": " The White Pill is available now at whitepillbook.com. This episode is brought to you by Patriot Gold. Good afternoon Michael Malice here. Let that be a welcome for the next hour. I have been waiting to have our next guest on for a very long time. I am super excited. This is going to be a very wonderful episode. We have Hire Hichek here. She's the creator of Libs of TikTok. Hire, you have probably had more effect on our culture than pretty much any politician out there. It's really interesting because your Twitter account, which was just reposting things, has caused meltdowns from coast to coast. You've been docked. Taylor ends came to your house and your family's house and so forth. Now you've chosen to embrace it and be out publicly with your name and face. Can you talk a bit about what led to that decision? Yeah. Thanks for having me Michael. It's great to be here. I've been looking forward to this as well. It has been quite an insane journey. After I was docked, I kept waiting for the final dog thing, which was to be my face, put out there, right? Because I've never been here to the name, but I know I'm like me who I look like. I grew up, I've always been super private and I never had public social handles. No one was able to find pictures of me. The first single day I kept waiting and waiting and the suspense just was killing me. I'm like, this is me. I'm proud of what I'm doing. I am going to put my face on it. I'm going to, I guess the word is come out, expose the face behind it. I finally did that a couple months ago on Tucker's show. I think the word you're looking for is pride. Right. How do you go? What's happening here? So, how would I expect that? Okay. So, I'm going to, I'm your Orthodox. You keep kosher. Yeah. Don't call you on Shabbos. You're not going to pick up the phone. No. Right. Separate sets of plates. The whole deal. Yeah. Okay. So, I'm going to tell you a story, sit back and the listeners will watch the, enjoy this too, of when I grew up and I'd had a mystery since I was a kid and you as someone who's an observant Jewish woman can give me your honest opinion. Okay. There's no wrong answer here. It's just a fun story. Okay. We're born in the Soviet Union in Ukraine. But what's now Ukraine, get off the boat. Russian was my first language. My parents were no dummies. So they sent me to Yeshiva instead of public school because they knew in a public school what would be done with me? Cabin experience. Go get drag shows in Yeshiva. What's that? You don't get drag shows in Yeshiva. That's right. So, I had to, I wear the Tsitsis. I wore my Yamaka. You know, when I'm in school, I'm passing as a, you know, observant kid. But you know, they knew I was an immigrant and they knew what that meant. So and so forth. And I remember very vividly, it was second and third grade. It was me, the whole class is there and the teacher goes, who doesn't keep kosher at home? And I look over to florist, the pansky, who is the other, like, Russian kid in the class and she just goes, and I kept my hand down and Mark, who was the other smart kid with me, raises his hand. And my memory is wrong, but it almost sounded German because they're like, come with me. They take Mark, take him out of the class. He comes back like an hour and a half later crying. They called in his parents. It was a whole situation. Okay? A girl I went to Yeshiva with Rina Azizo, I ran into her as an adult. We reconnected. We had a fun time. Her and her mother Barbara, they both live in Brooklyn. I had this conversation with them. We did not have a good answer. There's two scenarios. Okay. And it's just bothered me all my life a little bit only bothered me. Did they, the administration think that we really kept kosher at home and so on and so forth or they like, look, they're fresh off the boat. We know what's going on. As long as they're playing ball in school, we're going to look the other way. Rina and her mom had no, they were like, we're on the fence. In your opinion, as someone who's a member of the community, what do you think was the most likely answer? Um, right? I would say, yeah, like if this happened today, I would say definitely the second option. But I mean, if this happened like decades ago, like I think people were like, maybe much more naive than and much more close minded and judgmental. So it's possible with the first option. Yeah, which is just kind of crazy to me because you're not keeping kosher in the Soviet Union. You're barely having food. So the idea that I'm going to have milk and meats, I'm going to have milk at all is just so crazy to me. But, um, and it's also because they weren't dumb. I mean, they knew the deal. So at the same time, it could be either one, right? Yeah, it really could be. I mean, I don't know how many years ago is this? This was the early 80s. The 80s. Okay. So like, okay, so my grandmother is from Russia and like she had siblings that actually died of starvation because there was there was no food. So, um, were they that naive? I don't know. It's possible. Okay. So we still don't have closure. I want to go there and like ask like, Hey, were you here? Like, you've all the answers to all of your life questions. So let's also talk a bit about your work because I have a friend Deborah. So she wrote a book called the end of gender and she speaks about trans issues. Um, it's Steve, uh, Gavin McInghis. I had a chapter in him in my book and then you write and the introductory quote to that chapter is from him. And he had said, I want to apologize to all the transgender people threatening to kill me and eat my family. You are not mentally ill. It seems like this is such a space where it's acceptable to respond with murderous rage at the slightest bit of challenging or questioning of a narrative, which is historically extremely recent. So I can't imagine, you know, you're the sweet little like Jewish lady, like, how are you like, what amount of hate and animosity are you dealing with to be the target of all that? So I got dozens of death for us a month. Or you know, like sometimes it's outright like, hey, watch out tomorrow at this time. Sometimes it's just like, I'm coming to kill you and sometimes it's like, I wish you die. I hope you die. You should kill yourself. Like, and this is with time. I get times and times of these disgusting, nasty messages. And these people, I think, are severely broken, obviously. If you can send that message to someone that you don't even know, just because you don't like something that they put on social media, there's something deeply wrong with you. And I think that when you realize, when you have that understanding that someone is just projecting their mental illness and their their daddy issues onto you, it's much easier to deal with it. And honestly, it doesn't really bother me. Like I completely ignore it. Once in a while, I'll post about it on Twitter. I have files. I want to say three police reports for like really specific death threats. But it's not something that I worry about daily. It's not something that I feel like gets me upset or sad or anxious. Like I completely ignore it. The issue, I think, is when you see sort of higher level people using those same tactics. So when it's a troll on the internet who has four followers and they have, you know, they open their account a couple months ago and they tell you they're going to come kill you, it's much easier to ignore. But then you see these like political commentators, these people with really large followings, like openly wishing hormones to people just because they disagree with their politics. That's where I think there's a there's a massive problem. Yeah, if you look at like Steve Scalise when he got shot, there was it wasn't this big hand-ringing and like, Oh my God, what have we done? Let's take a step back. It seemed there was just still even more escalating doubling down. Brett Kavanaugh is a good example of, you know, he had to go on Martha McCallum's show on Fox and talk about how he was a virgin until he was 20. They follow his family to the restaurants and there's a lot of people who are kind of being like, well too bad, you shouldn't have the Supreme Court and decision so and so forth. And I can even make the argument that's even more defensible because he's a public figure and he's, you know, on salary and his tax payers pay his salary. I can maybe make that argument. But you're a private citizen who's just reposting data that other people have posted already. But it also seems kind of that, I mean, let's also talk about when they showed up at your house, your family's house. Can you walk us through that story? Because that must have been a really moment for you. We're like, okay, things just got real. It's kind of breaking between the computer and my real life. Yeah, it's just one more thought on that. It's funny because like all posts are publicly available at for like a drag show. And then if like there happened to be protests at the drag show, then the last comes and says like, oh, lives of TikTok is colluding with the Proud Boys and lives of TikTok organized protests. And I'm like, I'm just posting, you know, publicly available information and you guys are coming and like saying them somehow responsible for any kind of violence that happens. So doesn't work the other way around too. Like if you criticize me on your on your social media platform with a million followers and I get that first, like, is that your fault? But no, obviously it only goes one way. But yeah, so it was on Passover actually. Oh, wow. Okay. And so Taylor the Ryan showed up at my house and I'll just know that she wrote in her article that I'm an Orthodox Jew. So she knew it was Passover and she came to my house during a Jewish holiday, which is disgusting. And hold on, not just for the read for listeners here. It's not just a Jewish holiday. This is Passover. This is the big one. You know, this isn't, you know, right. It's not like what's the moment the trees. I already forgot like my own mirror, whatever it is. Yeah. This is Passover. Yeah. It's not like the the dress up one, you know, where we give like gifts of candy. Yeah, poor. Yeah. It's like a one day thing. Right. This is like a eight day holiday. It's very serious. It's probably, I mean, the preparation for it is like month sometimes. So this is this is like a really serious. This is a real holiday. And she showed up in the middle of the holiday. So we've actually, it was. I got interrupted just to give people the idea of what you have to do for Passover. You have to go through your house and like all the cupboards and everything. And if there's like a scrum of bread, you have to throw it out. Like it's really like some kind of insane top to bottom scouring of your house. If you're doing it correctly. And in fact, in the Talmud, they go over it like I had to, my dad who wanted to kind of be very proud of my Jewish identity, forced me to be Talmud. And to read Talmud, it's not only Hebrew, it's Aramaic. And you have to know it perfectly every sentence before I go on to the next one. So I spent like a month on like one page, but it's like, okay, if you have see a mouse with a piece of crust in its bread and it runs into the wall, is your house already safe for Passover? What if? Okay, you have a white mouse that runs into the wall with a crust and then a black mouse has a crust that runs out of your house. Does that count? So it's, I mean, talk about anal retentive. It is really a very, very intense program if you're going to do it correctly. So again, Taylor knows this perfectly well. Of course she knows that. Yeah, we're literally, we have completely different foods for eight days. Everything in the kitchen gets locked up. We have new spices. We have everything. Like top to bottom, deep clean. So like you said, so she shows up in middle of this holiday. Now the holiday is divided into there's the first half, which is, which is like the holy days where there's also like the no electricity, no driving, no doing work, going to synagogue, all that stuff. And then there's like three more days of the intermediate days where it's like still considered like part of the holiday, but you're allowed to use electricity and we don't have those laws. And then the second half, it's again, the holy days. So she came in the middle days actually. She didn't come on the actual holiday or else we wouldn't have built in that picture of her. Right, that's right. Yeah. But so she shows up at my house and let me backtrack. Sorry. I opened my phone after the first these first days, right? We're not going to use our phones. I hadn't been on my phone for two, three days, right? So I opened my phone when the holiday ends and I have tons of DM on every social platform, emails on every email address I own voicemails, text messages, what's up? You name it, everything from Taylor the Rents. She was coming at me from like every single way she can. And I ask a question. Do you think that was her way of showing you how many ways she had of getting to you? Yeah, I think the whole entire thing in general with like a scare tactic. Okay. Got to that in a second. But so I opened my phone and I have these messages. And then I see a message from one of my friends and he said, he's like, I don't freak out, but they found your name. And I'll just tell you this was, this was that Dylan. We were okay. Because we, because we were working together, he, he was helping me a lot with the TikTok. He was involved. And he was, he was incredible. He was amazing. And he knew how terrified I was of this happening. And, um, so he's like, don't freak out. They found your name. And then I opened and there's a link to a tweet and it had my name on it. And I, my heart literally stopped. And I remember exactly where I was standing. And I was like, Oh my God, this is happening. Because I knew for a while that like it was inevitable. Yeah, of course. Yes. So I'm like, Oh my God, this is, this is happening. Like I can't believe this is happening. And then I see all the messages from Taylor the Rens. And I'm like, who is this lady? I know I didn't do that. I'm like, Happy your days. Happy your days when you didn't know what it was. So I'm like, it was like just, it was so overwhelming. It was so, it was like just so insane. Um, and I was like just trying to figure out what to do. Um, and I was like, okay, I'm totally going to ignore that, right? Because that's, you know, the best way usually to deal with these things. So I like completing or her. She was, she called me. I'm not even kidding. She probably called me 20 times on my cell phone. Like call after call after call. I just declined all of them. Um, and then. So I was just like, I don't know what was going to happen. And I was like, are they even going to post the article? Like if I don't even say anything, are they going to post it? I don't know. What else did they know? Because they were like going to do this whole expose. Like what else did they know about my life? Did they find like an old coworker who hates me and they're going to write terrible things about me or like they find where I went to school and, and my bank accounts. Like I had no idea what was coming. Um, so I was just like, I was just like waiting and I was just like, okay, there's nothing I can do right now. Um, let's just see what happens. And I didn't say anything to Taylor. I didn't answer anything. Um, Can I ask you have a good support network? Are you close to your family and things like that? Do you have any siblings? Yeah. Yeah. My family was getting a kick out of it. They were just like, they were like kind of funny. Um, this was again before we really knew what would happen. And so I thought I was like, okay, they're going to post the article. It will have money. Do they have a picture? Do they not? Like I had no idea, but I'm just going to wait it out. The next day my relatives are calling me and they're like, this lady Taylor, I just shut up at my house. Oh, wow. And I was like, Oh my God, like this lady is serious. I'm like, okay, they're like, what should we say? I'm like, don't talk or like don't engage. So if you went to like three or four homes of people associated with me and then, um, and then I was kind of again, like still, like, I still don't know what's happening, right? Do they know what I looked like? What else do they know about me? Is it just my name? I don't know. So I'm like, we're just going to, we're just going to wait it out. I didn't, I didn't say anything really on Twitter. And then finally the article came out and I read it and it was like, it was kind of, it was kind of like underwhelming. Like it was just like, this is her name. That's it. And I'm like, okay, like you went through all, you went to four homes of my relatives and like made her something better for just to, just to share my name on Twitter. Like what, what was the point of that? There was, she didn't know anything else about me. There was no pictures. There was like, there was no information about me at all. And there was no comment for me. I hadn't given her anything. No one who's door she went to gave her any information. So it kind of was, I think it was, it was kind of dumb. Like, I don't know. I think she, she probably thought she got like the scoop of a lifetime. So she was like so excited. I think she actually made her look worse at the end of the day. She got so much backlash. So much. Yes. And especially because like three weeks earlier, she had been crying on NBC or whatever it was about being docked and people sharing her information online. And then she does it. So it was like, it was like so perfect that it was her. Because I think that really helped people rally around me because she's just so unlikable. And she like, anything she does, it's just like people just want to hate on her. I mean, she did do something wrong. She did docked me. There is a reason, but she's also just so unlikable. So I'm glad it was her out of all people. Her book's coming out soon. Are you going to read it? I think it came out already. She's been like pushing it. Oh, okay. I didn't realize it's out already. Yeah, I'm not familiar with it. The thing is just like everything she's right.

This funny that you said this and this kind of speaks to your Russian heritage. I had a friend staying in my house once, my buddy John and I went to the gym. And I come back and I was living in a townhouse. So there's like each apartment had its own floor. So there's four apartments in the whole building, three apartments, excuse me. And so to get into the door to my apartment, you have to be buzzed in, right? So it's really hard to get in. And I come back to the gym and John's like, oh, you know, some was knocking at the door looking for you, but they're looking for Jimmy and I sent him away. And this was one of the moments I've told the server before where I realized there was like a Russian mentality, an American mentality. If I'm staying at someone's house, I'm not answering the door. Like it's like it would never enter my head to answer the door. And especially in those situations, if some lady's at the door, I'm not answering that door. So I'm glad that your relatives didn't need to be told. You know, you should be friendly, let people in and they have much more of this suspicion that if someone's knocking at your door and you don't recognize them, nine times out of 10, it's probably going to be a headache as opposed to, hey, we brought you a present. Here's the lottery. That's not how it works. So I think this kind of heritage speaks to this healthy distrust and also understanding that people like her aren't just like, oh, you know, I'm just trying to share news and inform. It's like, no, no, no, I'm trying to give this person consequences because this person is doing things that I don't approve of. Well, I will say that one of the houses that she went to, my relative answered the door and she is, she's not the type of person you want to mess with. And she calls me after she's like, this psycho crazy bitch, whatever, just came to my door. I said to her flying and yelled at her. I said, are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? Get off my property. You're crazy. Whatever. It was, it was, and she's like, and she just like ran away. She was so scared. I thought that was really funny. But yeah, like if someone's coming to your door, I think that's the way to deal with it. Yeah. So I mean, it's, it sounds very clear to me and it's very clear in retrospect that you had no clue that this account was going to be this huge and influential. I'm sure you're just bored one day and you're like, look at these crazy people. I'm just going to repost them instead of just sharing with my friends. Can you talk about how it started and then how it blew up? Are there like some key moments where like someone, you caught someone's attention and then it just exploded? Yeah, exactly. Like you said, and people ask me, like, how did you come up with an A? And then I'm like, I don't know. I just typed it into Twitter and that's how it happened. I didn't spend a million dollars on brand, on branding and, and on, you know, research, market research, like literally just like it came to me. And I was just like, I feel like I want to share these crazy videos because these people are crazy. It's also very entertaining. So, you know, why not? They were like lives and it was from pick-up. So it just like made sense. But then like a couple weeks, I would say, or maybe like a month or two in, I got a shout out from Joe Rogan. And all of a sudden, like my phone's blowing up and people are like, Joe Rogan just mentioned you and then like went to watch it. I was like, oh my God. And I think I got like 25,000 followers, which within 24 hours. And about two weeks later, he did it again. And again, over like three days, I got up close to like 50,000 followers. Like he really, Joe Rogan really, really pushed me over the top. Like he pushed me over the 100,000 mark, I remember that. So that was like, that was huge. And then from there, I mean, it's just like, it's just compounded, you know, like slowly people start mentioning me, I'm being quoted in Fox News articles and New York Post and Daily Wire, you know, because I'm breaking really important stories. So, you know, everyone's following and retweeting and sharing. And then also I think that this whole like anti-wokeness specifically for like the gender cults. It wasn't really so popular to speak out so strongly and publicly against it. And I think it was partly because people didn't realize like how really far it all went. And then, you know, I was able to come and show firsthand evidence of like, this is really what's happening. Like it's in your kid's classroom, it's in your kid's hospital, it's in the store you go to like, this is everywhere. It's in every corporation. Like this whole, this full agenda. So I think that it really helped show people what's happening, but also help inspire other people with large platforms to also start speaking out really strongly against it. I had a very jarring moment in the last year because when I was in high school, I was a huge fan of Camille Palia. And Camille Palia constantly talked about drag and how awesome it is. And I was a big fan of it for years because it's the real way to be as like, it was a way to be transgressive. RuPaul has performed in Blackface. There's a drag queen called Sharon Needles, who's born as swastika. Like this is an opportunity to be really, really offensive over the top because the other dates are men addressed. So there is this kind of irony and subversion to it. And I went back and there was this one thing she talked about in her book called Glenda and Camille Due Downtown where it's Camille Palia and a drag queen named Glenda Orgasm going and yelling at all the feminists. And this is when feminists were very anti-pornography and anti-sex. So they were having these protests against like Playboy magazine. She's yelling at all of them. Then they go to this pornography store. I guess I was in high school. I didn't register it when I was reading it. And I just found the video again last year. And she's talking about how we need more like Lolita and we need more of this getting over this idea that children don't have sexual appetites and you know, this kind of manboy stuff. And I'm kind of looking at it was kind of like the end of the usual suspects. And I'm like, holy crap, this has been there like from the beginning, not secret, like staring me in the face. And there's such a big difference between something that is performed at a nightclub where everyone's drunk or high Saturday night at midnight versus a library when you have five year olds. And you know, there's this meme which I'm sure you've seen. It's like, why aren't you reading to elderly people, people in the hospital, veterans. There's lots of lonely people who would like, you know, companionship or inactivity. Why are you specifically targeting kids? I had James Lindsey on the show and he talked about the originator of drag queen story hour. And it was very explicit that this is an attempt to introduce queerness to young children as opposed to the much more benign approach of look, we're just getting kids not to hate gay people. It's like, well, you don't have gay people don't all wear dresses and makeup. You know, this is not being gay. This is something specific and performative. Yeah, I was just going to mention that that paper that James also mentioned that the drag queen who goes by little Miss Hot mess, he himself wrote this paper. And that's the other thing. Like it's just a, they're their whole claim it. It's just a form of art. And no, it's just it's fun. Kids like entertainment. It's harmless. But this drag queen, little Miss Hot mess wrote this paper and basically says that the whole purpose of drag is to clear the family. And it's not, it's they're not even hiding it. It's not a secret. And then you look at their drag names and it's like, I mean, there was a drag queen who performed in a school in California. I posted about this was about a year ago. And I'm not kidding. His drag name was Nicole Jizz. So how can you tell me this is not actual when you look at their drag names? Like they come up with these names and it's like, come on. But I mean, I'm Nicole Jizz is performing in an elementary school. Like how is this normal? But the thing is you can see why this is something that's funny in a cabaret or burlesque kind of for adults. Yeah. And adults who are high or out there to have like the hedonism, that's fine. But like again, and the other thing is the whole point of this lifestyle was you don't have to deal with annoying kids that you can, you know, Fran Lieberwitz, who is another, you know, great pundit, you know, she had this whole bit and her documentary about her by Morris Cours\u00e9. She goes, she's like, she's like, are you kidding me? People used to pretend to be gay to get out of going into the military. She's like, like marriage and like the military. These are the two most confining institutions. And now everyone's beating the door to get in. She's like, this doesn't make sense. This was one of the benefits of being gay that you don't have to deal with this nonsense. So it is very interesting because for decades, you know, this is kind of that slippery slope argument. There was the case, which is like, look, we just want to have, if my partner is in the hospital dying, I should be able to visit them. If I have a will, I should be able to leave it to my partner or, you know, get married. Just just recognize our relationships. It's just the same as yours. And then very quickly, it's like, if you're not teaching your kindergartner about blow jobs, you basically are Hitler. Yeah. And that's why there's this organization, Gay is Against Rumors. Like they were born out of necessity because you have all of these gay people who are not on board with this whole agenda targeting the kids, right? They're on board with gay rights, you know, from decades ago. It's this whole new, they kind of like the activists hijacked the entire movement and they're doing it for a lot of people. Do you so I think it's become kind of a badge of honor for some of these Tiktakers to be on your radar screen, right? And does it not seem that some of them are really trying to be performative to get your attention? I would say it's a very small minority. There aren't you like of the, there are a few that like I know already, you know, like I feel like we know each other and they will like put out videos for me. Like, hey, let's take talk. I'm going to teach today and whatever. There are very few like that. But I would say the majority of them, I mean, proof is a lot of times they delete the videos after I post it. They delete the first one, they go private. So I think that a lot of them are not expecting their videos to go this viral. But you know, I mean, if you put something out on a public platform, you're putting out a video, you never know who could see it. So I think I'm actually doing them a favor by getting them more views because it's obviously what they want if you're putting out a video on a video platform that's made to, for people to see it and, you know, that people crave to go viral. So, so I think I'm actually helping them. And I have seen some Tiktakers actually respond afterwards and be like, Oh my God, I got so many views, like so happy. And I'm like, Okay, great. I'm glad we can help each other. Yeah, yeah. One of the things I've seen in recent months, I think after the Kanye stuff is a rise in like Jew hatred on social media. And it's very funny because a lot of times they will be like reposting you as opposed to just like like brazen anti-Semitism on their on their profiles before I block them. How do you handle animosity for people who are anti semites? Is that something you have to deal with on a regular basis? Um, no, because yeah, I mean, I have, I've seen a lot of anti-Semitism on Twitter for sure. I, it's not often is it directed at me, but I've seen it directed at other people. Obviously, you know, it's, it's obviously bad. And I think it's dangerous, but it, I actually get more anti-Semitism, like from the left, like they'll call me, they'll call me like Hitler, they call me a Nazi and they'll quote that like an article and I'm like, you know, I'm like Jewish. Like, what? And not just like a little Jewish, you know, it's like you're, you're keeping shot in this. Yeah. I mean, we're all the same. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. You're not Jewish. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. You're Jewish. And they'll say that like, not just that I'm like colluding with the prop voice, but they'll say that I'm actually like they're rectoring the prop voice. And I'm like, explain to me how a Orthodox Jewish woman is directing the prop. So I think, um, um, it's, it's really funny. And I think that I'm also not very outspoken about this topic, just because I focused more on protecting kids and the whole local judge. So I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people actually didn't even know what to do with. You know, someone who never really watched any interviews with me might not know. So I don't, I personally don't get a ton of anti-Semitism directed at me. Folks, if the government violates your constitutional rights, please sue them. Sue the government. It'll be a headache. It could take years, but here's why it's worth it. You're not just doing it for you. If you win, you stop the government from violating other people's rights. That's a beautiful thing about our legal system. Each one of us has that power. So let me share an example. For years, local governments around the country have been stealing ordinary people. If someone fell behind a property tax, as the government would foreclose in the home, auction it off and keep all the profits. You could lose a $200,000 home over an $8 tax debt. This has really happened and it happened to thousands of people. It's called home equity theft. But a 94 year old grandmother named Geraldine Tyler sued. This is an ordinary woman, elderly lady in Minneapolis. She's not rich, but the Pacific Legal Foundation represented her pro bono. Geraldine and PLF took the case to Supreme Court and they won. The government can't steal from other people like they try to do with Geraldine. You can make a difference. Go to PLF.org to learn how people all over the country are fighting for your rights in court and find out how you can get involved. The Pacific Legal Foundation is at PLF.org. Guys, this is such a better organization than the crap in Washington where they put out white papers that go in the garbage and doesn't influence anything. This is actual actions that move the needle and help. I love this organization and so glad to have them as a sponsor. Let's get back to the show. What do you think should be done with people who have gender dysphoria? They should get help. They should get mental health help. Well, I mean, the thing is, I read Deborah Sow's book, so that's my guide because she's actually a scientist as opposed to my opinion. The research, according to her, shows that having people transition in many cases is the best approach because this isn't something where you could just take a pill and have a go away. There was a study done in, I can tell you exactly where, but basically, so this was in Finland. There was a leading expert on gender dysphoria on pediatric gender medicine and he did a study and he said that, sorry, one second, it was not Finland. I'm looking at the wrong thing. Basically, they did a study on a group of boys. The average age was eight years old. And they followed them until they were 20. Right. We're always in gender dysphoria. And they found that 87% of them grew out of their gender dysphoria. So there was also that study from Sweden that Elon Musk actually quoted a couple of weeks ago that showed that there was a higher suicide rate, post-sex change surgery. Oh, I'm not arguing with that at all. I'm just saying, I think you and I both agree that gender dysphoria is a real phenomenon that is extremely rare. The numbers are being completely inflated due to social pressures and so on and so forth. I'm just saying with that very small person, and I'm not advocating for surgery either, I'm just saying for that small percent, what do you do with people like that? Right. I'm saying that the way to deal with it is not to cut off their body parts. Oh, yeah. Okay. Or give them hormones or whatever, because there are a lot of studies and reporting that show that that actually end up having a bigger negative impact. I think that we have to help them. It's obviously a real condition. I'm not denying that gender dysphoria is not real. It's obviously real, but what they need is they need, I think they need serious mental health. Health. What I don't think they need is cutting off their body parts. Yeah. Why that? And that in itself is a big problem because the mental health industry is also overtaking my gender ideology. You have these psychologists, and I posted a lot of them on my account, who openly advertise that they will write a minor, a letter, basically in order to get sex change surgery, you need to provide a letter from a mental health counselor that says that you're gender dysphoric and you should have the surgery. So these psychologists openly advertise on the website that they will give a letter after just one meeting to a minor. And if you look at all the lawsuits that are happening now with people who are transitioned and are suing now or people who are detransitioning, oh, everyone that I've seen, I'm not going to say all of them have this, but a lot of them do. They all say that they saw a mental health professional and they were approved after one meeting, after one meeting, a half hour. They're told, yes, you're right, you're trans, you should transition. Here's a letter, go get surgery. The thing that I appreciate your intensity because there's a line that they use, which I find so disingenuous and malevolent, which is they tell the parents, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son, right? And the argument is, look, if you don't do this, your boy or your son is going to kill himself, and they don't talk about suicide rates of people post-transitioning. And I made this point in another context, this applies to everyone, not people gender dysphoria, the thing that you like least about yourself is not necessarily what's causing you the most problems in your mental health. So if people have problems with their body and how they're perceived in gender, and the claim is, if you just do this, snap, you're going to be happy, you're going to be adjusted, and if not, it's the haters who are the problem, that's just not how it works. And if it were that simple, this wouldn't have to be such a movement because if people transition, no one would notice, they'd be living their lives and it would be perfectly fine. So I think that disingenuousness is really a nasty thing that's being told to parents. Yeah, that's what happened to Chloe Cole. She's very open about that. And it's literally emotional blackmail. The other thing is that another common thing that we see among a lot of detransitioners is they all say, like, yeah, I was suffering from something else at the time. So they're actually like this movement praised on minors who have other conditions who are suffering. So whether that is they have some kind of weight issue, right? Or very autism. The co-operability is with autism very high, yes. I was just going to say autism and Project Veritas had a video where a doctor was admitted that there was a really high rate of autism and gender dysphoric kid. So they're actually playing on kids who already have other issues. And they're telling these kids, like, you just go cut off your body parts, go take these irreversible medications, then all your problems will go away. But it's actually not true because they're actually not even paying any attention to the actual real problem. Yeah, the other thing that's just a complete brazen lie and I'm shocked to what extent this is just, I'm not shocked, but I mean, if there was a bit of shame in our culture, this wouldn't be happening, is this claim that you could just pause puberty and then if you change your mind, you can restart it later. Everyone knows, pretty much everyone knows if someone's malnourished, right? You have these cases where kids are like foster homes, they're not given a food or gymnast, right? Their growth gets stunted because of, you know, how they work out so and so forth. It's not like when they quit gymnastics, they're just going to start their nutrition. And that girl who would have been genetically 5'8's going to be 5'8 again. Now she's 5'4 the rest of her life. Or, you know, this kid who's malnourished, North Korea, the average North Korean, I think it's 4 to 6 inches shorter than South Korean because of malnutrition. They have the same genetics. It's not like you give them food and those people are going to get taller. Kids will be taller because the kids won't have malnutrition. But this isn't the kind of thing where it's just like a videotape where you're showing my age. You could hit pause and then you change your mind, you could pick it up later and they claim this with no shame. The craziest thing is that they'll claim that but then we'll also uncover evidence that they actually don't even believe that. So they're claiming that it's not true. No doctor can believe that. No doctor can believe that. And there's so much evidence like that the Boston Children's Hospital, the director of the Pediatric Dunder Clinic, she was on camera admitting that puberty blockers causing fertility. And she also said that they, this was also, I believe a project for her talk video, she said that they're given out like candy. So they're giving out puberty blockers like candy to kids while knowing causing infertility. The FDA issued a warning on their website for puberty blockers saying that it could cause brain swelling. So like we know the side effects of this but while knowing all of these side effects, they'll still give it out to kids. It's just it's crazy. I mean, here's something else that's not discussed at all. And this is it's completely out of a transgender context. Hormones are how animals and human beings are biological animals regulate behavior, right? Everyone knows woman's pregnant, her hormones are all over the place. She's a loony tune. This is extremely common. You know, everyone who's had a kid will tell you about it. Men who take testosterone bodybuilders, which is steroids, heightened aggression, you know, low testosterone's lower digressions is very known. But somehow this claim that if you have gender dysphoria or identifies having gender dysphoria and you're given estrogen and testosterone, you're not going to have any psychological side effects other than positive ones is literally impossible. But it's just a given that if you take testosterone or estrogen as someone who's not menopausal or maybe someone who's a male who has low testosterone, that it's not going to have any consequences on your your brain or sorry, your mind is just completely disingenuous. It's and and they know it. That's I think the whole thing is that they know it. And like I'm a woman. I know all about hormones. Yeah, of course. You know, hormones and balance, like, you know, it's anyone every it doesn't even like, oh, you need to spend my viewpoints. Like, it doesn't even take that much to know that that if you give kids these irreversible drugs, then it's going to have negative effects. Yes, you know what it's like? It's like if someone is morbidly obese, right? Before you get to gastric bypass, let's work on your diet. Let's work on your exercise. Let's work on your eating habits. Let's develop healthy habits that even maybe we can even get you down 50 pounds and then do the bypass, but it could still move you to a healthier place. You don't go straight to, all right, let's put this person, you know, under the knife. Another example, I have a buddy of mine. I don't know if he'd be comfortable me using his name. He was a psychologist or psychiatrist, whatever it was in California. And it is illegal in California. You know how abortions are woman's decision, but in this case, it's the government's decision. If you have someone coming to you as a therapist in California who has gender issues, it is illegal. You might lose your license and your ability to make a living to be like, hey, maybe you're just a feminist. There's nothing wrong with being a slightly masculine woman. Try this, try that. No, no, no. You have to push them towards identifying as transgender and getting, you know, medicine, medicine involved. It's it's trans conversion therapy. Yes, yeah. It's it's like, but the with the bypass example, it's I don't think it's entirely accurate because that it then that example, this person actually has a real issue of being yeah, yeah, like a kid does not have a real issue of actually being the author of the gender like that. A kid can't be transgender like that. It doesn't make any sense. What do you think? I heard this story from Debra so and I'm I don't know if excited is the right word, but it'll be interesting to get your reaction. If this must have crossed your desk because of the work you do, did you know now that there is like this other type where they're trying to get a for lack of attitude term wound in between their anus and their genitals? So they have both parts. Did you not hear about this? No. Oh, okay. I get to be the one to tell you about that. Yeah. So they're basically yeah. Nothing talks to me anymore. You know what? What face you just made? I'll just say there was this Canadian journalist who went to North Korea. North Korea is a very socially conservative country. They don't like even kiss before marriage. It's like extremely culturally conservative and the journalist was telling them about gays and lesbians and they're like whatever. We don't that's we don't know what that thing is. They come back. He comes back and this was filmed at the ostrich ranch outside Pyongyang. So it's a Canadian journalist, the woman guide and the male guide and the ostriches. And he goes, okay, last time I was here, we talked about gays and lesbians. They're like, yeah, yeah, he goes, what about bisexuals? And they just go, what? Like at a certain point, it's like, what like who's coming up with this? So that look at your face, but you're just like, okay, it's just like, all right, I guess we're dealing with this now. Yeah, this is a thing where they identify, I guess, as both genders simultaneously or neither. So they will get a, I don't know what their term for it, a neo vagina in between their male genitals and their anus. Oh, I mean, is that tri gender? I've heard of tri gender. But I never heard of someone getting a surgery to have both body parts. Yep, it's well, yeah, it's a wound. It's not really, yeah, but it's a thing. Wow. Oh, yeah, she, she, I think she sent me a link to photos and I'm like, I'm not clicking on this link. I don't need to see this. I heard of getting, I've heard of getting piercing down there to kind of like simulate certain feelings of what it would be like to have certain body parts. Oh, okay. Well, that's better than like, like, yeah, of course. So like baby steps, maybe that's the compromise. Like just get some piercing. I mean, like I'm waiting for it to be mainstream for them to start like imputaining people and blinding people just because they say that they feel like they should amputate it. It's happened already like a handful of times, but yeah, I saw that woman who like blind herself by pouring bleep around. Like just get a blindfold lady. Folks, Jerome Powell and the Fed raised rates for the 11th time in July, the Hill has warned that it's a mistake that could spark a recession and economists believe this is the last rate hike in the most aggressive rate hike cycle in history. And in fact, they're forecasting rate cuts in 2024. That's why bullish sentiment gold for hedge funds just hit an 18 month high. And in fact, bullish sentiment for silver has risen at its fastest pace in more than five years. JPMorgan Chase sees gold prices at record highs in 12 to 18 months. Rate hikes are typically headwinds for gold. Meanwhile, gold has gone up over 20% since 2022. Imagine what gold and silver are going to be when the Fed stops raising and starts cutting.

Have you so one of the things that seems to have happened especially in Europe, this seems to have been less of an issue in Europe. There's been much more pushback in Europe and some of these clinics have been closing down. Can you speak on to where things stand both in Europe and in the States in recent months? Because this is a very dynamic issue I feel. Yeah, a lot of countries in Europe have been taking action. So Finland bans extreme surgeries for minors. The largest gender clinic in England, the Tabasau Clinic shut down. That was a couple months ago. Sweden also shut down this whole operation which other countries. I know I'm missing a few. I believe Norway. But I think America will follow but it's just going to take a lot longer. It's funny because I feel like we created them and then the other countries followed us. Yes, it's true. The first ones who are like no we're actually getting off this train. We're not into this. But it's also I think just because of our republic and our constitution, these things to actually change them, it just takes a lot longer and is a lot harder. Every time a state bans like sex change surgeries for kids, all this done and there's like 100 lawsuits and then it gets over turns and back and forth and back and forth. So what actually has been changed in America, I don't know because even the Missouri one, the governor signed to Bill Bannigid and then the judge overruled it. So it's like I think we need to wait until I mean we should always think he's working but I think it's going to take another couple of years or a while until we really everyone gets to their senses until we actually win this in the state. I think one of the issues and is I think Americans are often naive to what extent the corporate press brazenly lies and it is a almost like a greatest hits that this isn't happening. Kids aren't being taught about sex stuff in kindergarten or young ages. They're just being taught to accept people different with who are different in some ways or who don't gender conform. And the thing with social media is as you've seen is like here's the picture of the book. This isn't like you don't take my word for it. Here's the photos and these are photos you can't even show on like the nightly news because you'd have to blur them out and these are being mandated or allowed. I don't know it depends on the case I'm sure. Children, we also have kid logic. I remember when I was in kindergarten or first grade in Neshiva and I was scared to go to bed with the lights off. My parents always told me make sure to turn the lights off because it costs money. So it's a good lesson to have and they would have the light on in the kitchen while I went to sleep. And in my kid logic I thought oh my god this electricity bill's through the roof because they like the lights on in the kitchen all night. Well first of all it's not through the roof. The second of all they turn it off when I fall asleep right. But you know I heard this one story about this kid learning about this stuff and he comes home and he goes mama am I gonna wake up tomorrow and be a girl. Because in your five year old six year old brain and you're told sometimes boys can become girls that's how you parse it. You don't understand what the hell's going on. You think girls are gross and boys are cool and if I grew up to be a girl it's the worst possible thing. I'd rather wake up and be a ninja. So that is also an element of this ingenuousness that no one expects even a 14 year old to know what the hell they're talking about. But if a six year old says I'm a princess it's like all right let's go the doctor. Yeah and kids are really like kids are like sponges and that's why they're doing this to kids because you know they're trying they're not having their own kids so they want to take our kids and they want to convert them and make them become activists. But I do think though that kids do have a sort of what's the word like they have it they have they do have like a sensor of like this something's wrong about it. Yeah like you can try I think I think kids do have that like if they see someone strange they'll be like no they do. So it's funny because there's actually a trend right now on TikTok where where parents are pranking their kids and they're saying like hey your new teacher wants to face time you to say hi and they put out the picture of like this crazy looking person like and then the kids go like come home start crying and they're like I don't want to go to school. Yeah. She in jail like every teacher in my teacher and the mother's like yeah she's so nice and the person has like teeth and like hair like like not I'm not thinking about the live look I'm talking about like they look like they're like druggies like druggies and it's just funny it's like and I'm like look at that I'm thinking like kids kids know they see something wrong they know and that's why I'll just do a little book plug here I wrote a kids book and it basically teaches kids like to be able to spot that like predatory behavior like if something feels if something's wrong if something feels wrong if if if a trusted adult is telling a kid like don't tell your parents this keep this from you I think kids automatically know that something's wrong and they should be empowered to actually go tell their parents like they should be empowered to have that open communication and to and to be able to to not fall into into that trap and fall prey to that so that's something that we're seeing in in schools all over and I don't know is is you know part of is part of the answer sort of you know maybe we need to be better parent because I think that that parent-child relationship is is is so important and I think that if that's really healthy and really strong and then I think that a lot of these kids could possibly be saved from from this ideology that they're trying to impose on them it takes a lot for me to get like depressed over something in the news and this is one of the things that gets me depressed my buddy Matt and he encouraged me to use his name came out as a victim to me as a victim of childhood sexual abuse and I went on to talk about it on Rogan because my point was if this happens to you when you're a kid it's not right that you have to keep it private your entire life and to be ashamed you didn't do anything wrong this is something that was done to you and it's important on the rest of us who haven't been the victims to be able to be like if you tell me this I'm not going to think you're a freak I'm not going to think you're dirty I'm not going to look down in you I will treat you and care about you exactly the same because you know back in the day if someone's parents were divorced or their mom was an alcoholic or their dad was violent they had to keep that private and they had to suffer with that their lives and now it's like look it sucks but you know I'm not going to treat you differently as my friend and I'm going to have sympathy for you and I'm going to care about it and this is how these predators work because they encourage the people never to talk about it to feel shame and then they get away with it and when I talked about on Rogan you know I had several other of my friends come out to me so if I know a handful that means I know more than a handful and this is much more common than people realize and this is something so what is shocking to me and just very depressing is attempts by the media to make this a partisan issue or to make this a political issue I would have thought maybe I'm naive apparently I'm naive that abuse of children has nothing to do with who you vote for your views on the estate tax or immigration this is just objectively wrong protecting kids is just one-on-one stuff that any decent human being should care about if you see a kid suffering assuming they're not ugly you make sure you make them feel better and so on and so forth there was just an article in the Globe and Mail last week which I'm sure you saw an editorial by a priest that the headline was the far right obsession with pedophilia is dangerous and it's like if you guys fought this with 1% of the fervor that you fight climate change things would be in such a better place and again you know when some of these republicans like oh you know they're being raped by democrats it's like Dennis has started with speaker of the house you know he went to jail because of stuff like this and the fact that this wasn't made a political issue by the democrats is very interesting to me the fact that it's a conspiracy that these like international like pedophile rings it's like where do you think this pornography is being filmed you know about Jeffrey Epstein like so this gaslighting on an issue that I would have thought is so unobjectionable and black and white to me is very disheartening I think it was it always bothered me and I've been saying this like ever since I started for the past few years that it's like it's so sad that it became political and that the democrats like made it their party platform that they are pro taking kids to adult themed sexualized shows where men are dressed up as women and shaking their butts in front of kids and they're they made it their platform that they want to give kids porn in school and that we need to teach kindergartners about masturbation like it's so it's a wild and I think that it really just got a lot worse the last two months with the with the reaction to sound of freedom and it's like they just proved everything we've been saying like how is this how is this partisan it's it's crazy it's like we and it's it's relatively new because a couple years ago I feel like we all agreed that human trafficking is bad child sex trafficking is bad giving kids porn is bad like these are things that we all agreed on were bad and then all the sudden like they pivoted and now they're you know they're this is the hell they're gonna die on I remember vividly Jocelyn elders who was president clinton's attorney general she had said we should teach kids and my kids come at high school kids like how to masturbate and she got fired immediately her point which is not crazy is that it's a way to discourage them from having sex with each other like maybe it's a better alternative right so it was very poorly worded but it made sense for what it was a shoot and he called her up and he said I accept a resignation like click and like she was out immediately and now it's just kind of a given now a book deal for that yeah yeah so it's it's it's really kind of disquieting and um uh disconcerting and here's the other thing it's not a homophobia thing if you had chippendales story hour or if you had you know a Mercedes the stripper reading the kids in her nipple tassels no one would be like yas queen it's just like what is going on here this is just not for kids but it's it's it's I am do you think things are going in a better direction in terms of this stuff being shut down or it seems to be almost more like it's dividing that one side is doubling down and the other side is as well and it's just escalating in a way so it's interesting because this kind of ties back to something we were discussing before there have been so much highway in toppling this okay specific states right like there are a lot of states that have bad sex sex sex needs surgeries for kids like parental rights and education bills removing gender ideology from classrooms banning drag shows for kids so there is there's there's so much happening on that end but the but the last like I said they made this their party platform they're going to fight so hard for this that every single one of these bills they're coming and they're opposing and they're filing lawsuits and they're getting the adl involved so what actually like practical practically you know day to day has anything actually changed there some yeah but not nearly enough but I think that I think we're gonna get there I really think we will it's just it's just a matter of time I also think that it's very easy for Karen and I'm going to use that as like a shorthand for suburban moms to assume that people are basically nice and they've been taught like okay trump and the crazy republicans but at a certain point when you see kids and pornography you're like oh this isn't like ambiguous you know this isn't some you know be nice to people who are different from you which is a positive message which thing most people agree with and once you see that the people who are saying these things are not only incorrect but they have to be lying like if a doctor tells you you know if you take estrogen it's only in a positive consequences on your mind and your body it's just like this isn't true even for menopol for any female biological female that's when you're something clicks and I think it's also I'm just gonna ask you this one of the things that's very disturbing to me and can you talk about this is when you have these parents who get divorced and the mom decides the kids trans and the dad is just like the courts are just like too bad dad like you know this is a women get custody when we get those decisions and it's it's such a status symbol for these affluent white female liberals to have a trans kid it's like winning the lottery for them uh that is I think you know people respond to incentives and that to me is a very very disturbing one it's really scary and it's always like the the liberal white mom who wants to trans their kids it's like the stereotypical and and it's so sad there's been a few stories there's one really famous one from Canada where where they they didn't give the dad custody because you know he didn't want to trans his kid there's there was a story like that also in Illinois recently so it's I think it's gonna what I think is gonna happen is there's just gonna be a massive divide between the United States and the blue states because the blue states are going all in on this and the right states are going to go all in on against it so I don't know it's going to be it's going to be interesting I think I think we're ready to think some kind of a divide like there was a there was an article I read just yesterday that like some crazy percentage of democrats have considered leaving Florida and I'm like okay great like we like go to California go to Minnesota go to New York and then I think that Republicans will start moving out of those states and then I don't know I mean I don't know what's gonna happen what do you think I think I honestly think that the powers that be don't give a crap about kids or trans or anything they will grab whatever is available to further their power and a good example of this is I'm sure we all remember in 2016 we need more Muslim immigration we need more Muslim immigration refugees welcome here and as soon as that didn't result in votes for them they just stop talking about it they pretended never happened and it's interesting because this was a victory for conservatives but conservatives don't know how to take the win so they just they just forgot about it as well I think we are seeing this is the kind of thing where it very when you have kids it radicalizes people far more than tax hikes oh my insurance rates are through the roof this is like okay this is where people get to the level of violence and under it's very natural you know mama bear right you know if you you're coming for the kids it's like this isn't going to be a discussion like I will end you you know like this is the mentality it's a very primal and a very dangerous because this stuff is going to go on media matters like Michael calls for violence Michael tells parents to go without it. I'm not calling for violence I'm saying people are saying left this is that Glenn Youngkin won by a mass-emergent his purple state based on parental rights and education that's what pushed him over I mean that's like uh even the the Democrats so it's like you know how when AOC talks about riots or the language of the unheard there's an understanding in leftist thinking that when you push people too far it's going to have very dangerous consequences and there's no no easier way to push people far than to interfere between them and their kids this is a it's a dangerous game that they're playing uh the one I want to ask you about is can you explain what these so-called sanctuary states and cities are and what these laws are because it really seems that you can just take your kid go to these states even if you don't have custody and do whatever you want with them and my understanding that correctly that's what it seems like in California also is trying to pass a bill that would make not giving your kid like the gender transition treatment would make that would label that child abuse and then your kid can actually be taken away from you so I think that's where I think that's where it's ultimately in the head and like we mentioned before like we're gonna see insane custody battles we already are seeing some of them um that parent that was imprisoned for like misgendering in Canada um like I want to be surprised that that happens to me California and it's like if the foster care system is like so great and it's really helping kids like this is what's gonna help them right like it's it um and that's what that's what these states like California want to do they're going to take the kids away and they're they want to put them in foster care and then they can groom them um you know into becoming these gender activists or whatever they want um and it's really scary and and it's sad because like I said before like up until a few years ago I feel like we all agreed the kids we don't don't mess with the kids we must protect kids at all costs protect child and innocent parents are the best advocate for their kids in general obviously there's or some cases extreme cases where that's not it's not the case but for the most part parents know their kids about parents love their kids parents well what's best for their kids and this whole movement of like cutting parents away from their kids and telling parents that there's dangerous telling that they shouldn't talk to their parents um taking kids away from their parents you know for not helping them get their brush crops off like it's it's it's really scary um the direction that this is heading um and I think that in the blue states at least it will probably get worse and then we're just going to see a massive divide this is really really heartbreaking because it's very well known and understood that the foster care has rates through the roof of childhood abuse and childhood sexual abuse it is very well known and understood that child predators of any kind go to where the prey are this is in any environment predators go where the prey is they don't have a big sign in their forehead that says I'm a predator they don't look like Jared from subway you know and they're very good at passing in civil society and so on and so forth so to have more kids being pushed into foster care is inevitably going to result in all sorts of extremely disturbing things being done to these children that could otherwise have been avoided and you know this is the kind of this is what leads to things like alcoholism and drug abuse you know unresolved childhood trauma none of this has to do with any political party or ideology this is all very well understood it's on it should be uncontroversial um so I it's it's it's this really it's upsetting I'd I'd falakko a better term and I always say the moment a a democrat um comes out against the stuff I will share it I will retweet it of course yes tell them that they're great I will praise them but I don't I don't know if that's happening anytime soon oh god um all right it really isn't political and it's it's really it's really just heartbreaking it's it's so sad yeah yeah this is not a this is not a partisan I've also bought some of them conservators are being like oh you know this child rapist was a democrat it's like they're probably not voting you know they're they're they're not like their first priority isn't to make sure to vote blue the first priority is to go after the kid and if you think that that if you just weed out like the left and you're gonna save like this is gonna solve the problem you're crazy yeah okay um kaya we're running out of time right it's been your favorite part of this interview um my favorite part of the interview let me think um um I'm supposed to remember the entire hour I would say you're making your story um from when you were a kid in school and they made the kid cry because he didn't eat kosher you are welcome have you ever heard that story that Napoleon used the Egyptians finks for target practice and shot its nose off or maybe you've heard that a French astrologer named Nostradamus correctly predicted nearly 500 years of human history or maybe someone told you that the legendary blues guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in Mississippi these stories are what I like to call historical myths great little tales that may or may not have any basis in historical fact on our fake history we explore these historical myths and try to determine what's fact what's fiction and what is such a good story it simply must be told if you dig stories about death obsessed emperors lost civilizations desperate sieges voodoo black magic and famous historical figures you thought you knew then our fake history might just be your new favorite podcast if you dig it then subscribe on apple podcasts spotify stitcher or wherever you get your
