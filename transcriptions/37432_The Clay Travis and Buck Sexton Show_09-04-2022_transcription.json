    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you as we roll through the Tuesday edition of the program Letting you know where we're headed we're gonna talk about a mom who spoke out against the mask mandate in New York City and has already lost her job Elon Musk Owns 9.2% of Twitter the largest single shareholder. He is now going to be on the board That is going to be an intriguing story to follow as it pertains to Twitter's embrace of the First Amendment Stacey Abrams four years ago was worth a hundred K She ran for governor. She lost. She's now a multi millionaire. We will discuss that Colin Kaepernick is the biggest fraud in the history of sports media all that coming your way plus her Scheduled to be joined in the next hour by Monica Crowley and then in the third hour by Senator Ron Johnson of the state of Wisconsin But right off the top Katanji Brown Jackson is going to be confirmed there are now three Republicans I think buck you got it right when you said that you thought three Republicans would ultimately end up not not quite Nashville Nostradamus level but pretty good pretty good Two of the three make sense and let me explain what I mean by that Susan Collins in Maine has a perspective that has been consistent and that I respect and that perspective in general is I am going to give deference to the president in General and the Senate's job is to advise and consent and look over the nominees But not to say hey, we're only going to support people who agree a hundred percent with us and a Susan Collins credit She stepped up and supported Brett Kavanaugh when there was immense pressure on her not to support Brett Kavanaugh and Really when she won re-election against Cohen I believe was who was running against her the expectation what she was gonna lose She won comfortably Maine trust Susan Collins to make the right decision so I respect the consistency of the principle of Susan Collins when it comes to Giving deference to the president whether he's a Republican or a Democrat and voting for most of the time the nominees Lisa Murkowski senator from Arkansas from from Alaska is in a tough re-election battle right now and I believe she is making a Political calculation that she's more likely to win if she supports Katanji Brown Jackson. That's less noble to me I also think that Murkowski got it 1 billion percent wrong when she voted against Brett Kavanaugh That to me is reason enough not to be a big fan of her if I'm the last converter I would not be pleased with this decision But she's been a bit erratic in terms of whether she's gonna support or not support nominees. She ultimately voted for Amy Coney Barrett So I'm less impressed by Murkowski, but again, she's in the middle of an election The person that I'm disgusted by Fuck is Mitt Romney. That's the right way. I am I am utterly disgusted with Mitt Romney And it's not just about this vote buck in the last few weeks Mitt Romney has said I'm voting for Katanji Brown Jackson. This one got me way angrier He voted against repealing the TSA mask mandate buck He was the only senator on the Republican side remember there were 57 votes 7 Democrats or 8 Democrats whatever it was Actually were willing to vote against the TSA mask mandate credit to those Democrats for getting that right Mitt Romney got that 100% wrong remember buck He said I'm going to defer to the experts even though the experts have gotten almost everything wrong wrong He didn't show up to vote on Defunding the Biden vaccine mandate. This was a big vote. He wouldn't even manage to make it there and Remember he also accused Tulsi Gabbard of treason for opposing war in Ukraine Greg Price did a good job putting all those things together of Cowardis in my opinion from Mitt Romney. So if I'm a Utah voter right now buck I am done with this dude. I want him out of office I think that he is so concerned now with the New York Times editorial board Writing something nice about him and also when he dies one day that is obituary in the New York Times is going to be nice I think he is a fraud. I think he is a chump. I think that he is everything that is wrong with People who get so obsessed with the intelligentsia liking them that they don't stand up on principle anymore And he was the Republican nominee for president in 2012 everybody just when we talk about the the the GOP and some of it Failing just remember that this was the guy. I mean I voted for him. So there was that You know which which now I say out loud. I go whoo, but when I you know I felt that was the better choice at the time He actually was pretty good back then on border issues believe or not He was a big e-verify guy. So there were some things that I could point to I say well, mitt was mitt was better than Better than the alternative But clay there is a there is a specific Republican malady a specific GOP Psychological defect whereby people get into elected office and as you pointed out with the New York Times They are so quick to stab their own side in the back for just the most meager pat on the head From the Democrat elites just just some crumbs from the table of vanity fair and all of a sudden You know they forget about why they got there in the first place what they promised to do for the electorate There are some other Republican senators that I'm sure people are thinking about in this context too by the way good good Historical context there for Murkowski for me unforgivable for a Republican to a vote against Kavanaugh. I know unforgivable We got a lot of people who listen in Alaska buck. I wouldn't vote for her. I know she's got a challenger who's an actual Republican Yeah, she's trying to run basically as an independent and Alaska does have a strong independent street We should dig in less significant. We should dig into who her primary challenger it or or who the other you know Who the Republican is in that race? Because there needs to be that that is a total that is a no-go I mean if you vote if you're a Republican you voted against Kavanaugh you're no longer as far as I'm concerned You shouldn't be an elected officer at least not as a Republican and not even as an independent I think that's outrageous so then you get to Collins who she's gonna be in a tough one and here's here's the thing right you have a likelihood here of a big wave in the house Senate is a trickier game and you know we got to play Strategically on the right so that we actually end up I mean if you have a Joe Biden last two years of term one and I assume of course he's gonna stay in for the last two and not Step down You have the house in control that's helpful you have the house and the Senate in Republican hands Joe Biden's just sitting there getting ready to figure out what the I would I would say for reelection But who knows what the plan is actually gonna be and though the Senate map is not Super good for Republicans going into this midterm. It's not gonna be a easy one. You might end up You know, maybe we get a you know a two or three if we get a two or three seat swing that would be pretty solid I think for the GOP given what the map actually looks like so if we get to 53 5347 make sure my math is right there That would be good. Obviously in the house. I've said 50 plus we got to go 50 plus so Susan Collins I get the past you but with Mitt Romney clay Mitt Romney went marching with BLM with his mask on outside You know I guess when you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars because you basically Levered up and looted a bunch of companies with bane private equity back in the day, you know when you've done that Money doesn't really appeal to you anymore Principal doesn't really appeal to you anymore. You don't want to be in the fight you want people in prominent positions to like you And that's the disease that Republicans have some of them. It's so pathetic again I give credit to Susan Collins for standing on principle as it pertains to these votes and And again, I'm still fired up as we just talked about with Lisa Murkowski I think she's made poor decisions again if I'm in Alaska. I don't want her to be my senator Based on what she did with Kavanaugh, but at least she's been inconsistent right for and and that's not a praise But she's been unreliable in terms of how she's going to respond but for Mitt Romney I mean he's not up for reelection to your point buck. He's got hundreds of millions of dollars If it's just this I would say okay, whatever but to not be opposed to a mask mandate on airlines to not stand up and vote against the Biden vaccine Mandate to be willing to turn your back like that on the vast majority of your Constituent on the vast majority of Republicans across the country that are fighting for freedom I Find this guy detestable now. Yeah, I really do find Mitt Romney to be a detestable person cheap false virtue that he's after and it really is the equivalent of some of these former Republicans Who run over to MSNBC and maybe they still call themselves a Republican or maybe they call themselves Independent and all they do is go on air to trash the side that they supposedly Support and represent or did it some point? It's pathetic. I mean there's a reason why you know the the betrayers and the traders Are in the final circle of hell and Dante's Inferno if there's just something so unseemly about being that person who Turns on your own side for the amusement of those who despise you the left hates Mitt Romney They don't like Mitt Romney. They're not gonna say he's a good guy for this or whatever and but there's some people that I guess are on the right There's a little tiny Percentage that are taken in by this and think that mitt standing on principle now He's doing this because then he gets it. It's just all ego driven. He's just he's just hurting the cause and for what? He has no future in the Republican Party and here's my concern buck. It could end up 51 49 and Mitt Romney could be regularly siding with Joe Biden and the Democrats to get them to 50 So Kamala can break ties right? I mean he could be for the Republican Party if the Republicans are in the majority can get those sweet sweet editorial in the Washington Post about how Romney's a maverick and how he's cementing his legacy and the Romney brand is separate from the tainted Trump we can so we can play the whole thing out right now That's what I'm afraid of is because to your point on the Senate map you could end up 51 49 and Romney could be the Republican who is like Joe Manchin is to the Democrats right now a guy who is willing to buck his own party the difference is You know Joe Manchin is representing a state that voted for Donald Trump by a larger margin than any state in the country So arguably he needs to be serving his constituents by not being a died-in-the-wall Democrat all the time mitt Romney represents you got Yeah, maybe historically the strongest Republican state almost in the country, right? Yeah, I mean Utah Wyoming maybe one or two others in the conversation Yeah, so he has zero pressure and in fact, I mean we could probably open up the phones right now I'm sure that there are a lot of Utah listeners right now who are furious were number one in Salt Lake City buck There's tons of you listening right now in Salt Lake City and I bet you guys are as disgusted with Mitt Romney against not one vote It's the series of votes that he has had or failed to make over the past several weeks Which had been a repudiation of much of the Republican The patterns the pattern here is such a clear indicator because One time you could say all right, maybe his principles, you know I disagree with them But maybe his principles in this one instance that just happened to get him to pat on the head from the New York Times editorial board or or whomever Maybe but time after time. I mean, I think I think he's got an addiction He loves those crumbs from the Vanity Fair Lib table What's also mentioned by the way buck he voted against Katanji Brown Jackson to be on the DC Circuit So what did he see that made him change his mind? This is an important detail for people out there you vote as a senator for the elevation to circuit courts and district courts and everything else Mitt Romney opposed Katanji Brown Jackson on the DC Circuit and then after that testimony after Actually rigorously examining her record. He decided that he was wrong to support her for the DC Circuit This is the flip side of Lindsey Graham, right Lindsey Graham voted for Katanji Brown Jackson the DC Circuit said upon reflection I don't think that she belongs on the Supreme Court. I'm okay with her being on a circuit court I don't think that she belongs on the Supreme Court Mitt Romney didn't think that she belonged on the circuit court, which is a less serious job But he thinks she belongs on the more serious job of the Supreme Court. It's completely illogical He's an imbecile and I frankly find him quite contemptible Yes, but a little bit of fires to fire in prison to start off your morning If you're on the west coast and to start off your day if you're on the east coast in the meantime How about saving some money you can switch from Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile right now pure talk has the same 5G coverage as One of the big guys and they're able to pass along the savings a family of average size on a family plan Saves more than $800 a year.

I don't think fauci thinks we've had enough I think the little pouch Isn't done with us yet and here he is telling you you might be forcing masks on everybody's faces again I don't want to use the word shut down because that that is a rather draconian Concept there to shut down if we do see a serious uptick We should be prepared to pivot and at least temporarily go back to having masking in certain into a sessions Pivot he said notice that he is openly conscious clay Of using words that won't really tell people what's going like he's he doesn't like locked out. He doesn't like mandate He doesn't he won't even he won't even use his favorite mitigation anymore. You know, we're gonna pivot We're gonna be adaptable. It's like this guy says he's just a little propagandist It's all It's also transparently ridiculous to me buck What is going to end up happening is many blue states and blue cities are going to bring back masks We've already seen it. We're gonna talk about this in the next segment if you haven't already heard it If you're a parent you're gonna hear this next segment that we're gonna have About a mom who wanted to speak out against her kids who are preschool age being forced to wear masks She spoke out to the mayor of New York City.

I now think she's in the mainstream I'm paraphrasing his opinion, but all that says to me is buck. Well, so you did a poor job The first time you consider her nomination And now you're doing a better job. No, this is this is all transparent This is ridiculous and a lot of people from utah Want to uh want to weigh in so Let's uh, let's go to julie and dave. They are fired up over mit We've got a lot of utah right now coming in You coming in strong Utah is showing up strong again. We're number one in salt lake city We appreciate all of you listening out there julie and dave. What do you guys both want to weigh in? I guess Hello, well, I was told by your screener that I was to speak and my husband was to be a silent Partner, which is the way it should be you know, yeah in all marriages. They're good if you ask women I think that's certainly true certainly true in my house. No, I'm just kidding No, actually I was going to have him beyond but the screener didn't want us both to speak but so I um You know worry we are lifelong utah residents And we just wanted to weigh in that he is an embarrassment to us in utah And we just want everyone to know that he does not represent Um the values here. We have so many children in the state and the katondi brown jackson thing is just amazing to us Uh that he would side with that given her her Record on sentencing regarding child porn Um, he is not responsive to his constituents. I mean we have emailed him on an issue Uh and it took him like six months to even reply to us and it was a form letter that did not even Address or make sense to the issue that we had um emailed him about You know, we don't know what his angle is Um, but we will actively um Campaign for and support any opponent that conservative that comes up against him. I know there is um talk of our ag Sean Reyes um throwing his hat into the ring against him and we Would be so excited for that to happen Um, I don't know if it's just spite or his ego regarding the trump issue Um and that conservatives didn't accept him as a president but yeah trump endors him um I you know I I think you got a check on that. I remember he remembered the baby secretary of state. I think trump endorsed him Yeah, I remember they had that awkward dinner for him. We did not vote for him Yes, blast go around uh because I could see you know, I could see the wolf and sheep's clothing If you want to put it that way can I just just just throw this out there trump did endorsome back in 2018 Did he okay? Yes, he did well Well regardless of that we know our history his history and and uh, you know I don't know if he's playing a mccain and he just wants to be viewed well in the history books Or the you know like you guys are saying you guys are spot on with what you're saying about him because he is just Well, thank you julie terrible you're a you're a stutes Uh, lister. I appreciate it. Oh, we appreciate everybody We got a lot of people who want to weigh in and look I think it he should have a serious challenge in 2024 And I think what he is thinking he is going to do buck is maybe he's going to run for president in 2024 And he's going to be the rebel and look met romney Is I mean the best description I ever heard of mit romney is he's the guy who's in the photo in fake The fake photo that is in every frame that you buy in a department store Right like mit romney is the bland sort of uh, you know, well kept well groomed White guy who's in every photo in a fit in a picture frame, right? You know if you go into a department store They have the fake photo that's like the standard bear inside of the picture frame That's mit romney. He stands for nothing. There's no depth to him. He is a uh, absolute in my uh opinion Just was I think we're not alone here given given how every line has been lit up with collars from utah on this issue Specifically we've just got utah collars people around the country are annoyed about what he's done too But we got brian in latin utah. What's up brian I Hello big fan buck After the 20-20 election. I would get annoyed when you kept talking about covid rather than a potential fraud in the election But you were completely correct I'm utah voter and definitely didn't vote for romney in the primary and almost didn't vote for him in the general But I was lazy and filled the straight republican ticket. I would definitely take that back and i'll make that mistake again When I heard he voted to keep kids in mass. I was disgusted and I wrote him right away And I got that same lame response that you mentioned earlier that he trusts the experts That's finalist response drives me crazy because it is the leaders that we elected that are responsible to weigh all options Like you mean you know your show for years for years And I recommend to everyone the books get in the game by not seem to live because we can't trust experts They have their bias. They have their their skid is barely in the game And we need leaders who have skinned in the game that'll weigh all options and be reasonable and smart like you guys Thanks. Thanks so much brian appreciate it. Oh, I think naseem to lab is a pro mass guy So we got it. We got to check that one out. I'm pretty sure but the the the stories do reflect buck that experts get things Wrong all the time and the more of a limited expert you are the more likely you are to get the things wrong In your chosen field take it outside of masking look at economist Economists get everything wrong, you know, they can they tell you why something matters after it happens But their forecasts are almost universally wrong. Well, this is also why the history of medical breakthroughs Scientific breakthroughs really breakthroughs Comes a thwart a consensus always. I mean there's there are people because they didn't know something before Usually when someone comes along with some great piece of new knowledge that is true Ever and around them the system the establishment the apparatus doesn't say wow you're a genius They say oh that's reckless. It's terrible. What do you mean? You want to sterilize instruments? You want to wash your hands between surgeries? What are you crazy? You're mucus and blood and stuff on your hands as possible when you go from one surgery to the next That was the state of modern medicine so to speak and so what the middle of the 19th century give or take Yeah, coming out of London they suddenly started saying hey, maybe if we clean our medical equipment Maybe if we sterilize, maybe this could make sense and that was ridiculed by all of the people in positions of power at the time Every major breakthrough comes a thwart the scientific or expert or whatever consensus of the time. Just remember that one Uh, let's see we got bob and Ogden Utah. Hey, Bob Hey, how are you doing today? We're good. What's on your mind Well, going back to the when Romney ran for president back in 2012 I refused to vote for him for the simple fact that when harry re Accused him of not paying taxes for 10 years Romney would even stand up and defend himself And I figured if he's not gonna defend himself. He's not gonna defend the american people So I wrote in bill a cat but much more qualified individual All right, he doesn't stand up for himself steve in salt lake city. Let's get steve in here as well Hey guys something happened to rommy between the first and second debate in 2012 I mean, I campaign for him Dennis Miller was right there ready to go to that second debate and keep going with him And something happened. He didn't even go out to Ben gauzy You know, he did have that good rush of comment But something happened between that first and second debate Back when he was running against obama and i'm still trying to figure out what that was Steve I remember those debates very well and that first debate against obama Mitt romney Absolutely crushed him. I mean it was not close not even even the democrat spinroom afterwards There was kind of a muttering of oh that wasn't good And then in the second debate when the ben gauzy issue came up candy Crowley um Boxed out mitzo to speak and and decided to jump in in favor of obama on the did he call it a terrorist Attack or not and that kind of turned some of the momentum because you know CNN is a democrat propaganda that works. That's not surprising I also think you know the historically there is a pressy you're right He dominated in that first debate Historically there is often the case trump was a disaster in the first debate against joe biden And then just completely cleaned his clock the next time they went The president often does a really bad job the first debate Because he hasn't been prepping as much as the contender has because he's you know the president of the united states So he's worried about everything else But man, I wish we could go back in time and change that first debate That now that i'm speaking about it that trump had with uh with biden Uh because if he had debated the second time in those situations like he did the first one It would have been a utter destruction Get a hold of this listener keith is an exercise an athlete warrior 51 years young he runs a family martial art studio In college keith played football was on the crew team. I was on the crew team too took on the cross and rug B Yeah, you know got up early in the morning, but it was karate that got keith's attention as an adult today He's teaching four or five classes each day No surprise that when he started hearing about relief factor every day on the radio He ordered it the pain he had at his knees and neck from years and years of exercise started to go away as a result of relief factors ingredients It's even empowered him to work towards advanced degrees and other disciplines besides karate Created by doctors and perfected with over 15 years of scientific research Relief factor was made for people like keith and maybe for you too with four key ingredients relief factor is a 100 Drug-free product which addresses joint pain knee hip back neck and shoulder pain Hundreds of thousands of people have ordered relief factor and about 70 of them go on to order more Join the more than half a million people and order the three-week quick start for only 1995 Go to relief factor.com or call 804 relief to get the 1995 three-week quick start develop for you Go to relief factor.com or call 800 the number four relief Uh live more and just enjoy your life more with relief factor and Welcome back to the clay Travis and buck sexton show when your enemy is In retreat that's when you want to press forward That's how you turn a retreat into a route And there are a number of political issues where the democrats Are running for cover now that more people know what's going on now that they understand the reality of some of these positions They can't really make the case not in a midterm election year They can't get away with just appeasing and and doing whatever the woke left says They have to explain some things to the american people. I think one of the areas that is Surprising to many Uh of the biden regime so far is that almost 80 year old joe biden Is somehow now a woke warrior for the trans child agenda or for trans children? I don't think anybody saw that. I don't think they had that on the on the bingo card so to speak I don't think they were expecting this one And here you have the white house being asked about this because this is now a reality It used to be clay when we would have these debates. Hey, if we're really going to you know use different gender pronouns How long until you have males in women's prisons and women competing against men in sports and all these things have how long before and they said Oh, you're just fear mongering or oh we can go back and play all those clips You go find that all over the place editorials five years ago 10 years ago and now it's shut up big it That's not a man. It's a six foot three woman who happens to have male genitalia swimming in that pool. Okay Okay, that's an interesting position for them to take And the white house and this is what I mean by there they're on they're on defense now because people have seen Quite clearly the reality of this left wing agenda policy Or this left wing agenda rather on the policies that it creates here is the white house Here's gen saki being asked by of course be introduced About what the white house's feelings are right now on men competing against women in sports In some places like the ivy league now There are biological males competing against women does the white house think that it's fair Well, I would note that we're not the governing body for the ncna bla or Any other system out there that I believe you're probably referring to the case over in Swimming in the ncna bla we understand how important sports are to student athletes across the country But the ncna bla obviously makes puts these policies in place What I would say uh peter if we look at this broadly is that we celebrated international transgender of day of visibility Last week with a slate of new actions to ensure we are continuing We continue to protect the dignity and identity of all americans Oh blather blather and misdirection clay the question was to the white house should men compete in women's sports This white house is too cowardly or perhaps too savvy because they know how the american people feel to answer Well Credit to peter deuce for asking the question joe biden needs to be asked this question directly himself Because to your point bucky 79 years old There is no way on earth that joe biden who I believe is a sports fan Based on past statements everything Sneaking some clicks on out kick when no one's looking I I think I think he may have been on out I don't know knows how to use the internet, but if he knows how to use the internet then he might have been on out kick I think he's a big eagles fan Historically played sports growing up and so there is a zero percent chance buck That 79 year old joe biden believes that a biological man should be kicking women's asses in this woman pool and Also the democratic base does not believe this either right there's about 10 or 20 percent of democrats that do And everybody's cow towing to that group, but do you think black? Hispanic asian men in particular who are overwhelmingly sports fans Do you think they want their daughters and granddaughters? and uh at competing against men no way and so this is a dodge and it's a dodge buck because Democrats can't figure out how to figure out how to balance this pyramid of victimization because Women are a huge percentage of the democratic base now Overwhelmingly the democrats are made up of women and The transgender community is a overwhelming base for the democratic party. You have to make a choice You're either in favor of transgender rights being so inclusive that there is no difference between men and women Or you support women sports can't have it both ways And I think the overwhelming majority of americans support women sports They believe women should compete against women and men should compete against men And the democrats are afraid to say that because it attacks their base And they know that they're on the wrong side of this issue if there were more than a Handful of actual i'm gonna say actual journalists just people that want to get real answers from this white house There would be follow-on to she didn't answer the questions a very straightforward question The white house factors in on title nine issues all the time the white house factors in on Or will weigh in on any number of cultural and political issues You know they'll to pretend that they don't have a position on this is cowardice But they know that if they make it too obvious the democrats are always hiding what they really believe to fool Unfortunately, you know 10 of the middle of the country Uh, you know metaphorically speaking politically speaking in the voting for them And so this is why they won't answer the question Which is why we have to keep pushing and keep asking because clay their only choices are betray women sports or betray the The left wing lunatic base. There is no third. That's right That's right and they're refusing to pick a side speaking and picking a side Moms have picked a side. They want their kids out of masks a mom in new york city Just lost her job for making that argument you're gonna want to hear this story next Clay Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth"
