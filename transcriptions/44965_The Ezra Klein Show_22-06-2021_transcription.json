    "text": " I'm Ezra Klein, and this is the Ezra Klein Show. I've been wanting to have Sarah Schulman on the show for a while now. I first came to know her work through her 2016 book Conflict Is Not Abuse, which has become a kind of cult classic. It's a kind of amazing, very, very challenging book. The central argument is that we often mislabel conflict is abuse and view ourselves and act as victims of abuse without recognizing the power that we have in the situation, the way we may be part of and have a responsibility for ending a conflict, and also within that frame, not seeing that we then can harm others. It is particularly about the way people who are formed by trauma as they develop more power can then not see that they are the ones inflicting harm. It's a book that goes through a lot of what you might think of as a cancel culture conversation, right? Trigger warnings and schools and all kinds of things that are debates on the left in American Day, but latter's up all the way to Israel, Palestine. It's a really fascinating, strange, distinctive book. It's built around an almost utopian belief in the power of communication, really difficult forms of communication to heal and resolve. And so in some ways, it is centrally about the need to see ourselves as in and put ourselves in communication with each other. I think about it often. But then I saw Shulman was bringing out another book, let the records show a history of Act Up New York. Act Up was this direct action group that during the 80s and 90s reshaped both policy and visibility around the AIDS crisis. Her success, which was remarkable, has slipped into near legend today. But Shulman and her collaborator, Jim Hubbard, have been building an oral history of the group for over a decade now. And she really wants the lessons and structure of that group and that moment to be understood. She calls the book political history, but you can really read it, I think, as a work of political theory. A proposal for our social movements can be more effective by embracing disagreement internally and with the culture broadly, rather than striving for consensus, which is to say that this book is also in its way about the virtues of conflict and the need for really difficult forms of communication. So I thought going into this, we would mostly be talking about Act Up New York, about conflict, about Shulman's theory of how political change happens. But this conversation, which took place a few weeks ago, it also ends up veering into Israel Palestine, which Shulman has written books on, which is part of conflict is not abuse, and which was of course dominating the news at the moment. As always, my email is as recline show at nytimes.com. So I'd like to start by just invoking this era. What were the years of the AIDS plague like, you know, before the treatments? So for people who weren't there who weren't even born yet, how do you describe the scale and the toll of it? Well, the context is really important. So let's go back a little bit. First of all, science observed the pattern that became known as AIDS in 1981, but we now think that it existed for a century and was in the United States in the 40s and certainly in New York in the 60s and 70s. But the first public announcement was the famous New York Times article, July 3, 1981, 41 cases of rare cancer found in homosexuals in San Francisco. So to get the context for that, at the time, there was a lot of talk about homosexuality being biological, that homosexuality was one thing and that it was attributed to a biological source. And for many people's minds, homosexuality itself was a disease. So the first name for this new disease was gay-related immune deficiency. Today, if somebody said gay cancer, you'd say, are you crazy? Cancer can't be gay. But at the time, homosexuality was so stigmatized. And that stigma was there from the beginning. Eventually, the name was changed to AIDS. Now white gay man is now a category of privilege, but in the early 80s, gay people were a profoundly oppressed minority. Gay sex was illegal. In fact, the sodomy laws were not overturned until 2003. In New York City, there was no gay rights bill until 1986. So you could be fired from a job, kicked out of an apartment, and you could be denied public accommodation like restaurant service or hotel. Familial homophobia was the norm. It was virulent. And it was a force of history. It made people have to leave their countries, leave their hometowns, and it put people with AIDS in a position of being abandoned by their families. And physical violence was a sport. It was called gay bashing. And straight people would come into gay neighborhoods for entertainment to hurt people who looked gay. So you're talking about a despised group of people with no rights facing a terminal illness. And so in those first five years, the AIDS community really was about trying to create some kind of volunteer-like form of the social services that people needed but couldn't get. So you had gay men's health crisis, had a buddy system where a person with AIDS might be assigned a buddy who could help them do their grocery shopping. There were organizations that would walk your dog. There was God's love we deliver that was bringing home-cooked meals to homebound people with AIDS. But the political reaction did not really start until ACT UP was founded in March of 1987. In this period, what is the toll in the community like? What is it like to live in places that are the epicenter of the AIDS crisis? It's a mass death experience. And as Vito Russo famously said, it's like there's a war, but no one knows about it but you. You know, one of the really big differences between AIDS and COVID is that COVID is a collective public experience that's discussed on television and people talk about it over dinner. This was a private nightmare. At the time, there was no accurate representation of gay people or people with AIDS in media. The entire media was controlled by white men. The government was in almost entirely white mail. The private sector was dominated by white men. Gay men who were part of that power apparatus were usually in the closet. The people who were affected by AIDS were primarily gay men, women, people of color, poor people, patients, hemophiliacs, and people who were born HIV positive. So it had very little overlap with those who controlled the power apparatus at the time. You quote an act upper in the book Zoe Leonard saying what AIDS revealed was not the problem of the virus. What AIDS revealed was the problems of our society. It was this fisher through which everything, all the ways in which our society isn't working became really clear. It's very resonant of what people say about coronavirus now, but as you say, these are really, really different profoundly different situations. So what did it reveal then? It revealed that most people were not in touch with gay people. Many families had a ban and gay, their gay family members. You know, it's interesting. In the act up, there was only one parent of a person with AIDS who was a full-time act up member that was Patricia Navarro, who was a working-class jacana who had come from California to take care of her son, Ray Navarro. So if the families of people with AIDS had acted as any kind of political force, there would have been change much earlier, but they were almost completely absent. So what was act up for somebody who's never heard of it? Okay, so now we're in 1987. And there's a few political precursors to act upforming. The first was the Bowers decision, the Supreme Court decision upholding the sodomy law. So you're five years into this devastating mass death epidemic. And instead of helping gay people by decriminalizing or bringing in gay rights, the Supreme Court is reinforcing sodomy laws. And this really hit the community very hard. People took to the streets, there were demonstrations in New York and in Washington, D.C., and demonstrations that were held without police permits. So real acts of rebellion. At the same time, a small artist collective of graphic artists called the Silence Equals Death Project designed a poster of an upside-down pink triangle against a black background that said silence equals death. And they we pasted it all over New York. Similarly, a ZAP group called the Lavender Hill Mob did an action. Now ZAPs were a strategy that came from gay liberation. And it's an action that only people who are excluded from power can do because it's involved bursting in to business as usual and disrupting. And they dressed up in concentration camp outfits and disrupted meeting of the CDC. So these were the precursors. Then in March, Larry Kramer, the writer, gave a speech at the gay and lesbian center. It was she famously said, half of you will be dead in two years. People in the audience decided that they wanted to meet and try to create a political response. And a few days later, a group of people met and they chose the name ACT UP, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. And then on in their first six years from 1987 to 93, which are the years that I cover, what they accomplished was phenomenal. You know, in many ways ACT UP was the last social movement in America to be successful. And that's one of the reasons that I wanted to do this book because it's not about nostalgia. It's about the time we're living in right now where so many people in this country want change and they want it now. And they don't have access to activist information about which strategies worked and which ones didn't. And that's my purpose. So in six years, let me tell you some of the things that ACT UP accomplished. They forced the pharmaceutical companies to change the way they research treatments. So that instead of looking for one pill that would cure AIDS, which had the largest market share, they were forced to shift to opportunistic infections. So let me explain that AIDS is a disease that destroys your immune system. And so people would develop dementia, blindness, swollen nerves in their legs, wasting syndrome. All these symptoms were opportunistic infections. ACT UP forced the Food and Drug Administration to allow people with AIDS access to experimental drugs that had not been approved. ACT UP ran a four-year campaign that forced the CDC to change its definition of AIDS so that women could qualify for benefits and could be part of experimental drug trials. ACT UP made needle exchange legal in New York City. ACT UP started Housing Works, the organization for Housing for Homeless People with AIDS. ACT UP confronted the Catholic Church when they tried to obstruct the distribution of condoms in public schools and stopped them from doing that. And ACT UP changed the way that gay people and people with AIDS saw themselves and were seen in mass media. So those are enormous accomplishments. You've been saying they for ACT UP, but you remember, you were very involved. How did you join it? So I was a reporter. Now at that time in the early 80s, the mainstream press did not cover gay people at all. And they wouldn't say that somebody was gay and there was almost no news about us. So there was a series of underground newspapers. The New York native was a gay male newspaper. Gay community news was a gay and lesbian socialist newspaper. Woman news was a lesbian and straight feminist paper. And this was how our community got its news. The work was done by volunteer journalists who did not get paid and who went out and figured out what the stories were. And that was our only coverage. And I was like a girl reporter on the go. You know, I was in my early 20s. So I was on assignment at City Hall for the New York native. And the issue was that there was no gay rights bill in New York. And this was when AIDS was revealed, 81, 82. So since I was already there, I started covering very early AIDS stories. And most of the work that I did had a social justice lens. So I covered pediatric AIDS, women with AIDS being excluded from drug trials. I did, I think, the first story at home was people with AIDS. But I also did assignments like I covered the closing of the bathhouses, which is an odd assignment because women were not allowed in the bathhouses. But it shows you how chaotic everything was. You know, journalists were dying, editors were dying. My editor at the Village Voice, Robert Massa, gave me an edit in his pajamas at home because he was too sick to go to work. So by the time ACTUP was founded in 1987, I'd already been covering AIDS for about five years. And I joined in July of 1987. And I stayed until about 1993. So I want to go back to something you said a minute ago, which is that ACTUP was the only truly successful activist movement of the kind of past couple of decades. This is important to the framing of the book. But when I think about it, I think of the fight for gay marriage is very successful. And then Black Lives Matter, in this era, as quite transformational. So I'm curious either how you define it or why you'd argue ACTUP is alone in its ability to claim that level of change in society. I don't think I said the only. I said, I think it was the most recent successful movement. Black Lives Matter has transformed the society but hasn't yet won its demands, although I hope that that will come. Before AIDS activism, gay marriage was considered a bizarre demand. It was considered so radical that it was impossible. But once ACTUP went into St. Patrick's Cathedral and disrupted mass, suddenly something like gay marriage became much more acceptable to the general public. Because the way that movements work is that the more to the left your left is, the more credibility your center has. And so the part of gay life that was different than straight people was much less acceptable than the part of gay life that straight people felt resembled their choices. How many people were in ACTUP? Then Monday night meetings were somewhere between 300 to 700 people. And our largest demonstration was Stop the Church, which was about 7,000 people. Now, that sounds like a lot of people to have in a meeting, but it's actually a small number of people. It's not a mass movement. It's a vanguard movement. It's just that the people in ACTUP were so committed to being effective that they were able to accomplish so much. And when I interviewed people, I interviewed 188 surviving members of ACTUP over 18 years. It was clear that ACTUP was a way of life. People lived with each other. They spent all their time together. They got their jobs through ACTUP. It was a complete and total commitment. This goes to something you say at the beginning of the book that I've been thinking about since I read it, which is the fate of a society is determined by very small groups of people. Only tiny vanguard's actually take the actions necessary. And even fewer do this with a commitment to being effective. One thing that I've been struggling with with that quote is do you think of that as an optimistic theory of social change or a pessimistic one? The way in which it feels optimistic to me is that it does imply that individuals, if they have a ferocious enough level of commitment and enough of a commitment to being rigorous and whether or not they're achieving their goals really can have a big impact. And so I'd be curious, not just about what you think brought people to join ACTUP, but what it was that made the people who joined it effective. Like what it was they were willing to do, the conflict they were willing to be involved in the society, what allowed them to be effective were so many people who joined activist movements often give up because of the feeling that they're not getting enough change. They're not being sufficiently effective. Well ACTUP was a constituency movement, right? So the people who had AIDS were the people who were in the movement. And it was heavily influenced by previous movements that ACTUP members had been in. And one was the feminist women's health movement. So the concept of patient-centered politics was literally brought to ACTUP at educational by people like Marion Vanzoff and other activists who had worked at feminist clinics before. And the idea that people with AIDS are the experts and that people with AIDS determine the agenda was central to ACTUP. So for example, there was controversy about the use of placebo's. If you're looking at it from the perspective of a scientist, you want to use placebos because it gives you better stats. But if you look at it from the perspective of a person with AIDS, nobody with AIDS wants to be given a placebo. And so we always said that the standard of care, whatever drugs were out there should be the counterpoint and not a placebo. And that's an example of looking at things from the point of view of a person with AIDS. And that's something that ACTUP did that contemporary movements can really learn from. ACTUP designed the solution. They did not take it in fantilized relationship to power, treating power like your parents, begging them to solve it. ACTUP would study the institutions, study the drugs. Members became citizen scientists or learned about housing policy or learned about narcotics policies and design solutions that were winnable, reasonable and doable. And then presented these solutions to the powers that be. And when they would say no, which inevitably they would, ACTUP would then do non-violent civil disobedience actions that were theatrical and designed to attract the attention of the media so that they could communicate through the media to the public to pressure these institutions for change. You were saying a moment ago that ACTUP was a pioneer in pushing patient-centered solutions. So tell me a bit about some of the campaigns that were effective here. Because to the extent I think a lot of people know about ACTUP, they know about the spectacular, very media-friendly, direct confrontational work, right? You know, unrolling a condom over Jesse Helms' house. I think the actual inside work, inside institutions is somewhat less well known. So what was that and why was it actually effective? You know, in the book, I contrast three different campaigns in ACTUP that were based in three different constituencies. And by looking at them together, you can really see the range of how your strategic plan must meet your social position. And as your social position is different, your strategies have to be different. So for example, Larry Kramer went to Yale with the head of a pharmaceutical company. So he could call him up and they got a meeting and he came with Mark Harrington, a very brilliant leader in ACTUP who was a Harvard graduate and Peter Staley, another brilliant leader in ACTUP who had been a stockbroker. And they met with pharma in their office and they had a catered lunch and they had a face-to-face. But there was another campaign that was organized primarily by women with HIV and primarily white lesbians inside ACTUP that was to change the CDC definition of AIDS. Now let me just explain this for a minute. In the 1960s, there was a drug called the lytomide that was given to pregnant women and many of them had children who were born without limbs. And pharma had to pay out millions of dollars in damages. So after that, they didn't want women in experimental drug trials. So women were excluded from these trials and the definition of what constituted an AIDS diagnosis did not include symptoms that only women got. Women with HIV tended to be poorer than gay men with HIV. And they couldn't get benefits and they couldn't get experimental drugs and they couldn't get drugs tested on women. So this campaign in ACTUP took four years to win and it took two years before they could get a meeting with Tony Fauci. But they used all different kinds of strategies than the men who were meeting with pharma. They screamed to people in airports, they handcuffed themselves to people, they occupied offices, they put things in people's files. They really stepped outside of respectability politics. Then I can trust that was a third campaign that was run by active and former IV drug users inside ACTUP. And that was even messier. Two people died of OD's. One guy stole $10,000 from ACTUP. The group broke the law by doing illegal needle exchange. They were arrested. They had a trial and they won. And they made needle exchange legal in New York. So what it really shows is that you have to build tactics based on where you're situated and you have to assess your position realistically. And there was something very human in these strategies because they expressed where people were at and what they needed. And it shows you how diverse the organization really was. This is very cordy argument of why ACTUP was effective though, which is that you almost describe ACTUP as a platform. And people came to the platform and they could use it to almost do what they wanted. You describe ACTUP as an organization that never demanded consensus. If you didn't like the campaign I was planning, the action I was planning, you didn't tell me not to do it. You didn't tell the governing board to tell me I couldn't do it. You just went and did something different. And so there was, I don't want to call it an anarchy, but there was a ferment to it in the way you describe it where it really did allow for tremendous amount of experimentation and as such, was able to attack with a broader set of strategies than most activist groups can that are more controlled. Could you talk a bit about that organizational structure? ACTUP was an organization that practiced radical democracy. And it was a big tent organization. People were very different inside. There was only one line of unity, principle of unity, direct action to end the AIDS crisis. And that was direct action as opposed to social service provision. So if you were doing direct action to end the AIDS crisis, you could do it pretty much whatever you wanted. My feeling is that historically movements that try to force conformity or homogeneity where everyone has to have the same analysis and all agree on one strategy, I think that those movements always fail. And that the movements that really succeed are ones that are very broad, that have more radical wings, that have central wings, where people can respond on all different levels at the same time, a kind of simultaneity of response. When you examine the amount and range of actions that ACTUP was doing, it's phenomenal what was going on. The Latino caucus was organizing ACTUP Puerto Rico. There was a Haitian working group that was helping HIV positive Haitians get out of Guantanamo where they were being incarcerated. There was an Asian Pacific Islander caucus that was doing safe sex educational in Asian gay bars. I mean, when someone was fired from Macy's for being HIV positive, a guy who was playing Santa, 25 Santas who walked into Macy's and chained themselves and started seeing Santa has HIV. I mean, wherever something was happening with AIDS, ACTUP was there and the structure facilitated that. That's really why they were so impactful. In the ACTUP schema, what is a meaning of direct action? What is an action that an activist group might take that is not a direct action? And how does it contrast with the kinds of things ACTUP did? Okay, so what ACTUP did not do was have passive demonstrations where people would stand in the cold and listen to speakers because that is not empowering. The image of direct action that ACTUP used, I think, was something that we've all seen, which was black resistance in the 1960s. And that movement was very impactful on ACTUP. Most of us were born in the 50s and 60s. And when you're a queer kid in the 50s or 60s, you don't know that there's a gay community waiting for you, that there's going to be a gay movement. But you're seeing black people resist on television or in life magazine or in jet magazine or some people's families were involved in those movements. And there's an identification there. That something was internalized. So later when I was researching and I reread Martin Luther King's letter from Birmingham Jail, he defines direct action. And it was exactly the structure that ACTUP used, even though we never referenced him or we never had a study group or anything like that. But clearly we had internalized it. So the structure is basically that you identify the needs based on the community who's living in the experience. You design the solution. You become the expert on your issue. You present your solution to the powers that be. And then when they don't respond, you do what Dr. King called self purification. And of course, the best known direct action in American history is when black students sat in at segregated lunch counters to demand the end of segregation. Because what they're doing there is they're not just picketing in front with signs saying end segregated lunch counters. They are creating an image of the world that they wish to inhabit by sitting at the counter and not being complicit with the restriction. And that's the kind of image that I think ACTUP was responding to unconsciously when we decided to disrupt mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral or when we shut down the FDA, when we occupied Grand Central Station to protest the Gulf War with a slogan, fight AIDS, not Arabs. When we interrupted Dan Rather on television because TV media was not accurately representing the AIDS crisis. Over and over again, it's an insertion of queer people and people with AIDS into the power apparatus that was excluding us. One of the tensions you see in activist groups, and one reason they end up being more controlled than ACTUP was, is that they're worried about actions, messages, aesthetics, images that could create backlash to them. I'm somebody who cares a lot about animal rights and PETA is a very controversial group in that world. Because on the one hand, they do a lot of direct action, they insert themselves into conversations, and on the other hand, a lot of people feel, at least in the past, they've created more enemies than they've created friends. So how do you think about that trade-off or for other groups between trying to win people over and trying to force them to recognize you when they're trying to ignore your issues? Well ACTUP had nothing to lose. People were dying all the time, and we were very young, and there were people who were suffering. AIDS is a horrible death, and our friends were suffering in front of our eyes and dying. And so what if somebody says that you're being inappropriate because you're fighting for your life? You're wrong. You know, when we were very clear about that, there's a certain point when you have to accept that it's no business as usual. There are people who are willing to risk a certain kind of ostracism or marginalization to tell the truth to institutions. And those are the people who make change. I want to talk a bit about how this book connects to another book of yours that I read a bit ago and have been influenced by, which is conflict is not abuse. So ACTUP seems to have been a place where conflict was accepted. You see that I think really as a strength. In my sense, I think you're pretty explicit on this at times, is that you worry it's one a lot of modern activist groups are losing, that there's a rhetoric of conflict as abuse, a rhetoric as conflict as harm, such that they're losing the ability to have this kind of ferment and letting a thousand flowers bloom that ACTUP did. Could you talk a bit about, first, whether that's a fair characterization? And second, what you see is the continuities between the books. The books do relate to each other because people in ACTUP were doing the right thing, and yet they were being arrested and stigmatized. And that happens often that when you refuse to accept an unjust situation and you resist it, you're then repositioned as the negative force or the threat. And we see that in every area of life, we see that, for example, within a family, you might have one queer family member and the homophobic family unites around deciding that that person is the problem and they should be excluded and punished. But the reality is, the real problem is the homophobia of the family, not the queerness of the queer family member. And so we see perpetrators positioning themselves as victims. This is very common, whether it's the Israeli state, whether it's Donald Trump telling us constantly that he's a victim and that there's a witch hunt, whether it's racist police officers telling us that they were threatened by blackmail civilians who were doing absolutely nothing. The trend is for perpetrators to present themselves as victims. And conversely, people who resist injustice are then blamed because they create discomfort. But my argument is that discomfort is good for society because it means that lots of different experiences of difference are being expressed. And the only people who really insist upon being comfortable all the time are people who are in the dominant position. And the only way they can be comfortable all the time is if everyone else is suppressed and that's not a healthy social structure. But I think that's underselling some of the challenge of both books, which is it is taking aim, the conflict is not abuse. And then at times, I think this one, at a culture on the left that has become more hostile, or at least at the cost zone, in your telling to challenge and to conflict where challenge is often considered harm and injury, a form of violence. You talk about the idea that the word violence should be reserved for physical violence. So I think it's true certainly that people trying to disrupt the status quo are often framed as the transgressors, as the attackers, when they're actually the ones who are being harmed. And they're simply trying to make that known. But at the same time, one of the moves in conflict is not abuse. It's to say that people have absorbed that kind of trauma at some point, then often later see those who push them back into an uncomfortable place as inflicting more trauma upon them. And certainly I read this book having read the first one as saying like one thing that the modern left needs to learn from act up is that conflict is okay. Explosions of disagreement even are okay. And a lot of internal dissension is okay. You don't need people to agree. You don't want one. So the thinking is that not a reasonable read of it? Yes, as long as there's a basic principle of unity. I mean, one of the insights of conflict is not abuse is that dominant cultural people feel threatened by difference, but so can traumatize people feel threatened by difference. And the consequences can resonate. So if you're raised in a dominant position, you don't want the discomfort of having to question yourself. And if somebody else is asking you to be self-critical, you feel like they're abusing you. How dare you ask me to question myself? But sometimes when we're traumatized, it's so hard to just keep it together. That the additional questioning of the self or the need to be self-critical feels absolutely impossible. And when that is presented by somebody else's difference, it could feel like an assault or abuse, but it's not. So that's how those two things resonate. But when I wrote conflict is not abuse, I was primarily talking about the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the rhetoric of perpetrators presenting themselves as victims and people defending themselves being presented as abusive. It was not about the American left. It's just that it came out at a time when that discussion was in the air. I think I mentioned cancel culture or call out culture in one sentence in conflict is not abuse. It's not really what I was focusing on. But younger people got interested in the book because it resonated with this kind of over accusatory subculture that they were experiencing. And as I started to tour with the book, I started to see younger and younger and younger audiences because they were extrapolating from my arguments. But it was primarily about the idea that when people with AIDS or Palestinians or any oppressed group fight back, they become accused of being an aggressor when actually they're not they're responding to oppression. I read the book more recently and I was really struck by how much in the current conversation given they came out a number of years ago now, it responded to I'm interested to hear you say it was primarily about Israel, Palestine though, because that comes in quite late. There's a lot earlier in the book about trigger warnings on campus. I mean, you talk a lot about on campus things, including with a story of yourself when a student wrote a blog post about being attracted to you and other members of faculty kind of telling you to shun him. There's a lot about domestic violence and the rhetoric that emerged around that. One of the things I found very moving in the book, I'll say, is that I read it as a real argument on behalf of communication, that your argument was that conflict is often a way of driving people towards communication. And that one of the dangers you're worried about were things where people decided communication was no longer helpful, that the conflict would become something where it was now abuse and now communication was something that should be off the table because simply more contact would be re-traumatizing or it would be a problem of its own. And that's what struck me as a real connection to ACT UP, which was at least in many of its more public direct actions, it seems to me a real effort to use conflict, the generation of societal conflict, to force society into communication and into recognition of people with AIDS. That's true, people need to be heard because people with AIDS were not allowed to speak and when they tried to speak they were arrested. So they had to force themselves into television stations, etc. to be heard. So that's absolutely true. But the other thing to remember is that I'm a novelist and so my non-fiction books are cumulative story that's always building towards the revelation. When conflict is not abuse, I start with the intimate and I start with the interpersonal and relationships and then I build to the classroom and then I build and then I build. But what I'm really talking about are negative systems of loyalty and how clicks or families define loyalty by joining together to collectively hurt people who are different. And that argument as I build it lands in Palestine because when I'm trying to expose or explain, it's my own experience of being held to support Israel no matter what as a thing of family loyalty, that loyalty to your group, in that case the Jewish people, right? Because in my generation being a loyal Jew was equated with supporting the Israeli government. Now fortunately there are organizations like Jewish Voice for Peace, which I'm on the advisory board and growing, growing, growing movements of Jewish people who oppose the occupation. You know, I'll be honest, I've been thinking about how to just talk about Israel, Palestine on the podcast and didn't quite expect this would be the conversation of entry into it. But I did think of that book as very profound on a number of levels for that. I also grew up in a Jewish context where supporting Israel was a question of familial loyalty, particularly with my grandparents, although not only. And something that I reflect on a lot now, because I'm sensitive to the way the trauma of the Holocaust still shapes Jewish people, still shapes older generations, but also mine and very much still shapes Israel is something you talk about there. The way trauma can create a foundation upon which future domination can stand on. Yes. And it makes it an incredibly difficult conversation to have because you rapidly end up in people's terror and people speaking from their terror, particularly their historical terror, their past down terror. It's not the part of them that can usually see how they have also become strong. Well, you can see it in interpersonal relationships. You know, people who had severe trauma and abuse in childhood can often act out in the present from pain that is unresolved in the past and asks the present to be accountable for pain that the present has not caused. You know, and I think we all have experience with that. And we need to be able to understand that what is happening now and how we are treating other human beings is the priority. And if we have unresolved pain from the past, whether it's individual or collective, it's up to us and the groups that we're in to support each other in not projecting that. You know, when you hear a racist police officer justify having killed an unarmed black man, you can hear that he had anxiety caused by his own racism. It's internal. He felt threatened and he felt afraid because he thought that that the book that that man was holding was a gun. And so he killed him. And that's sort of the metaphor for the phenomena that you and I are discussing right now. Yes, we have anxieties from the past, but how are we treating people real people today and what are going to be the consequences of those actions? I wonder if anxiety is quite the right way to put it. I mean, you talk about anxiety as a dominant emotion in that book. And I'm not saying it's not true. It's very much true at the at the intimate level. The thing that is always hard for me, I used to cover the Israel-Palestine conflict more closely. I've written op-eds for Harits. I've been on reporting trips in Israel and in Palestine. And what always struck me was it Israel was a state that would always feel psychologically weak and geopolitically weak, no matter how actually strong it became. And that that had become a very toxic dynamic. And I'm not saying that there was not, there was not, it is not real reason for fear. I mean, any society that has, you know, rockets being shot at is going to be afraid. But nevertheless, it is so convinced of its own weakness and vulnerability that it cannot fully, I always felt talking to people there. It cannot fully apprehend its actual strength. And what that strength was doing and how it was being perceived now because its actual situation was different than its internal perception. And that had become and has become, I think, and is geopolitically and there, just a tremendous danger to it now going forward, like that growing chasm between what it sees itself to be and what the rest of the world sees it as is a real vulnerability. Well, so those rockets that you mentioned, I mean, that's like, you know, act up occupying Grand Central Station. It's a response to profound oppression. And then the response is the thing that gets blamed or gets focused on to the exclusion of the originating action. And that's the standard structure. You see that everywhere. You see that in families, you see it in clicks, communities, religious groups, national groups, where the response is the thing that gets blamed and the originating action no one takes responsibility for it. What seems very true to me now about the situation in Israel, actually within the framework of your books, is that conflict is not leading to any kind of communication. And instead, particularly in the way Israel has transitioned its approach to the Palestinians over the past eight decades, it's become a way to not have communication. And so there's like, we are further and further and further away from any kind of process that could lead to resolution. And the idea that I think someone is about how that this is stable is just baffling to me. I mean, you're just going to keep all these people completely under lock and key forever. Like that's just asking for the only end when somebody finds a weapon big enough to end it. Well, you know, as long as Israel is aerial bombing and murdering civilians and children and doing it with American money, we have a responsibility as Americans, not just as Jews, but as Americans, to interrupt this process and to end it. And I believe, and even though I know you and I disagree in some aspects of Israel, Palestine, I think we do agree that people should not have different rights based on their religions. And that that's not justice. And you know, I call it apartheid. You may or you may not. No, I would. I don't think there's any doubt at this point. Yeah. So clearly the world has to intervene. And there's been more global support for Palestinians this round than has ever been before. I think that people are really fed up and the global support for change is there. We finally have people in the Congress in the US who are speaking up for Palestine. And we're going, I just have to stop funding Israel, Israeli war machine. I used to be more optimistic that American funding was a kind of leverage that would really matter. And in my more recent reporting, I don't think it is. Israel's rich enough to fund its own military. And so that's why when I think about the conflict, I will say like I am in a space of, I completely don't know what the answer is. I agree with you that when there's aerial bombing, it needs to be stopped. In terms of how you get parties to the table for something constructive, where you can imagine some kind of answer emerging, I mean, I would absolutely end funding of anything within Israel until all settlement construction is ended. Like I've said that for years and years and years. But I am past the point where I believe Israel would care, which has actually made me much more pessimistic about the whole situation than I was say, you know, called 10 years ago when I thought America actually had more control. But the drift in Israeli society and in Israeli politics, and we'll see what the new coalition that's emerging right now will look like. But the drift in Israeli society and politics towards a much harder right form of politics and a much harder right form of philosophy in terms of how this should go. I think it has taken this so far from anything you can imagine moving towards peace that we're at a point where you could just like the only hope is to get towards communication. One of the steps that's necessary towards better communication is for the American media to stop falsely presenting this as a both sides conflict where they do something wrong and then the other person does something wrong. This is a very powerful militarized state that is oppressing a deus boric scattered people who don't even have a functional state apparatus. It's extremely uneven. And when I watch MSNBC or read the front page of the New York Times, I'm just so frustrated that there's not an honest conversation. How does conflict and communication and conflict versus abuse work when there really are profound power differentials? You talk about power over versus sort of conflict with, but in a lot of cases and a lot of places where we see it now, one, you have disagreements over who holds power, right? That's the core of the whole cancel culture debate who is actually in power right now. And what it means to corporations seem to be leaning in a different way they did a few years ago. But two, even within something like Israel, Palestine, you have really big disparities in terms of where there's power. And so is there a demand for communication then or does that change the underlying dynamic and perhaps the underlying answers where it becomes something where once I just needs to win in order to get the power back to even have communication in the first place? I'm a person whose story was not allowed to be told when I was young. So I had to be part of inventing lesbian literature. I was in a community that had no rights. My friends were dying of a disease. I've had a lot of experience of people who are not allowed to be heard and who are not considered to have lives that have value and are not allowed to participate. And that's why when I started writing this book, I think the first line is that this is a book in which all people with AIDS matter. Their lives are all important because in order to understand the truth of any situation, you have to start with a place that every person is equally valuable. And what they have to say must be heard. And whether that is in a click where somebody is being shunned and blamed for everything or whether that's an entire class of people whose experiences are not taken into account, it's the same formula from the bottom to the top to let everyone speak and let everyone be heard. And until then, you cannot have a solution that addresses people's needs. I don't know when that the pink triangle is built on Nazi iconography. Could you talk about the story of that? Well, the pink triangle was the concentration camp badge that was put on male homosexuals to identify them. Jews had a yellow star and lesbians were given the black triangle of the A-socials or anarchists. And so just as the word queer was reclaimed, this sign of destruction and murder was reclaimed and turned upside down as a sign of identity. You know, there's a lot of Jewish influence in AIDS activism and in gay liberation. When you look at who the leaders are, even though in Act Up Larry Kramer, Avram Finkelstein, Maxine Wolff, there were just a lot of Jews. And I tend to think that in that generation, people born in the 40s, 50s and 60s, they were raised with certain kind of American Jewish social values. And yet as gay people, they were not allowed in the community. If they were openly gay, they couldn't be in their families. They couldn't rise in the Jewish community. And so they brought those values to gay politics. And that's why in that particular generation, Audrey and Rich, et cetera, Jews are in a sense overrepresented in the driving voices of gay liberation and Act Up. So you see a lot of comparison by that generation, which is a post-Holicos generation, between the AIDS experience and the Holocaust. Larry Kramer wrote a book that had the word Holocaust in the title. Avram Finkelstein was in Silent Seagull's Death Project because people felt that there was a mass death experience that others were allowing to take place. In my family, I come from a Holocaust family. My mother's mother had two brothers and two sisters who were exterminated. My mother's father's sister was murdered. And I was always raised with this knowledge that other people stood by and let it happen. And that the worst thing you can be as a person in the world is a bystander. And so there was that value and that identification was clear in early AIDS metaphors. As younger people came up, that was less so. Do you think something in queer politics or cultural criticism has been lost in the past couple of decades? Oh, absolutely. You know, the most exciting thing that's happening in queer politics is that the leadership of our most important political movements today, which are the movements against police violence, the movement for Black lives, movement for immigration reform and Palestine solidarity. All of these movements have openly queer and trans people in leadership. There's no longer this reality that openly queer people can only be in the gay movement. That's over. And so queer liberation ideals are now present in the people and the values of these other movements. There's still that sector of this kind of predominantly male rights oriented, gay, highly funded, gay sector groups like GLAD and Human Rights Campaign. I don't even know who these people are. I never interact with them. I've never met them. And they're out of touch with the agendas for progressive change in this country. So we've divided. And you know, the demand to be in the military was not a liberation concept. Gay marriage, well, is very important for people to have the same rights. It represented a kind of white reconciliation, a move away from the collective and back into the family. You know, if the gay community had been divided into privatized family units at the time of AIDS, we never would have been able to overcome. Because at that time, we had a group identification and a community identification. And that's what made us so effective. Is it strange to live in a time where the social valence of some of these things has changed so much? And here I'm thinking of, so I live in the Bay Area now. And I talk to a lot of younger cases as part of my work and something they tell me and that I see is that at least in this area, in this set of politics, queers a more aspirational identity than straight. And you have the huge, huge, huge rise in women who identify as bisexual. And I'm not making any kind of argument that straight people are discriminating. I think at all that is completely ridiculous. But I do think there's something interesting in the ways in which these identities have been adopted or people want to adopt them who wouldn't have 15 years ago, who would have been afraid of them 15 years ago, might have discriminated against them 20 years ago. But you're bringing up is very interesting because, and it does get back to where we started, there's a kind of branding culture that's based not on experience and desire, but rather on situating oneself in a tradition of victimization, oppression, and resistance, even if the individual has never experienced those things. And you know, what is queer life without oppression? It's something very different than it is when you're in the middle of the AIDS crisis. So people have to make decisions about what kind of actions they want to take, who they're going to stand with, and how they're going to be effective for progressive change. And if they're not going to be effective for progressive change, then really it's lifestyleism without the life. So it's a lot of it is about living in a very market oriented culture in which the exterior is what drives. Are there aspects of the queer critique of American culture that you came up in, that you wish were resuscitated, that you think have been lost, but have value for the moment we're in now? Well, you know, the gay liberation front that was founded after Stonewall named itself after liberation movements, that were its contemporaries around the world, anti-colonial movements that were resisting European control. And what the word liberation meant was reimagining the world so that the ways that we relate to each other were liberatory instead of oppressive. And that meant that sexual relationships, economic relationships, racial relationships, interpersonal dealings, identifications of gender, ways that we expressed ourselves politically and emotionally, that we had a dream, a utopian dream that they could be more open, and so that human beings could be more individuated and yet more within a collective. And that the purpose of the collective is to create more space for the individual voice. And that's a vision that I very much believe in and that I hold dear to. Tell me a bit about that in the specifics. So when you talk about liberatory ways of relating to each other, what does that mean? Well, for example, you know, I'm an artist primarily, right? So my life is organized around being an individual voice. And so I want to make the work that I want to make. And I think other artists should be able to make the work that they want to make. But when your work is seized upon by a corporate society and elevated, then you have to analyze its reception. And that's part of your responsibility to the collective. So for example, as we discussed earlier, my current book is being embraced in a way that my previous books were not, I think primarily because we're so far away from the events that they're no longer implicating and because it's basically about men. When I was writing novels about AIDS with lesbian protagonists in the 90s, that kind of reception was not available. So I need to be critical about where I'm being situated, how I'm being co-opted, what advantages I'm getting because the timing is comfortable, because the subject matter is more relatable. So that there's a dynamic between my personal wishes and desires and the individual work that I did and put into this project and the collective that I'm a part of and how things land and what the impact is on other people. And conversely, I've had to work in collective movements my whole life to create space so that this conversation can finally take place so many years after the fact. What do you want to make sure people listening to this don't think it's true of you? I mean, here we're talking this is New York Times podcast. The New York Times is not a hero in this book, but as you say, this book is being embraced, it's got a tremendous review in the New York Times. As some of your others have, but this one got a very, very, very strong review. What do you want to make sure people know is true about what you're trying to say here, that you're worried is going to be lost in the way you're being received or situated? I want people to understand that individuals do not make change. It's the collective and that the way change happens in the United States is through coalition. And in order to be in communication, as you would say, or in coalition with people who are different, you need to practice a kind of radical democracy that's rooted in a creativity of thought and action so that people can respond from a place that makes sense to them. They're not forced into homogeneity and that we stand together when we can and have as much simultaneity of response as possible. And that I think is something that will be helpful. I hope will be helpful to people who are trying to build change today. I think it's a lovely place to end. So let me ask you what is always our final question, which is what are three books that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience? I have three books that I've read this year that I just thought were incredible. The first is called Poor Queer Studies by Matt Brim. And Matt is a queer studies professor who teaches at the College of Staten Island. He teaches queer studies to poor people. He has people bringing their children to class, traveling from the Bronx because they don't want anyone to know they're taking a queer studies class. And it's a phenomenal book about inequality in our higher educational system with lots of good ideas about how to address that. My second favorite book this year was Vanguard by Martha S. Jones. It is a book that absolutely changed the way I look at things. I had always thought that women won the vote in 1920. But what I learned from Vanguard is that white women won the vote in 1920 and that black women are still fighting for the right to vote, especially in this period of voter suppression. So it re-historizes and breaks a myth that kept us all back from thinking accurately. And then finally, the book that I think is the best written book of the year, and I say this as a writer, is Memorial Drive by Natasha Tretheway, who's a Pulitzer Prize winning poet. It's an absolutely incredibly well-written book about when her mother was murdered when she was 19 years old. But because Tretheway waited until she was at the top of her game as one of America's finest writers to tell this story. It is so exquisitely written. It's a masterclass just by reading. So that's Memorial Drive by Natasha Tretheway. Sarah Schulman, your new book is Let the Record Show. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. The Ezra Clencho is a production of New York Times Opinion. It is produced by Jeff Gell, Rache Karma, and Annie Galvin, in fact-checked by Michelle Harris, original music by Isaac Jones, and mixing by Jeff Gell."
