It explores the history of the sport, the psychology behind it, the personalities that drive it and asks what it says about the world we're living specifically, why everybody seems to suddenly be paying for pain. He is a self-proclaimed beta male. And in 2011, he tackled his first tough mutter, his articles and interviews documenting his experiences have been featured on the cover of outside magazine, 60 minute sports, and a speaking engagement at Stanford Business School. Scott is a treatment writer for some of the top directors and music videos and commercials, and over the past 15 years, he has collaborated on videos for Rihanna, Madonna, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Paris Hilton. But today he's here to talk with us about his documentary, Rise of the Sufferfest and why all of us should consider embracing the suffering. Scott, what's going on, man? Thanks for joining me on the show today. Thanks for having me, man. Hey, so I watched your documentary. This was probably a couple weeks ago, and it's pretty cool to have you on the show. What got you into obstacle course racing? Narcissism. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you know, I like writing humor essays, so I thought it'd be very funny to write a story about training up, tackling a paramilitary assault course, and, you know, publishing a confessional about being a beta male, getting his ass handed to him. Sure. And so I, you know, now I also wanted like the profile pick. So I... Of course, everybody wants that, right? Yeah. So I had those two objectives in mind when I signed up for my first Tough Mudder in the fall of 2011. And so the Tough Mudder was your first event, then you ever done with regards to obstacle course racing? Yeah, absolutely. It was probably like... Have you done anything before? Anything like this at all? Marathon running, anything like that? No, I'm mountain biked, like, you know, recreationally, and I played football in college, but very, very briefly. So yeah, this was the first thing I'd really done in many, many years, and I spent about a, you know, a good month and a half, because I was terrified of Tough Mudder, like really dedicating myself to training. Yeah. What did that training look like for you? A lot of trail runs and my wife is a... She teaches high intensity interval training, so I would go to some of her classes, which sucked every single time. Yeah, get your butt kicked there for sure, right? Totally. Yeah. What was the experience like? I've actually never done a Tough Mudder. I've done Spartan races, I've done some endurance events, but I've never done a Tough Mudder. What was that like? Terrifying and painful and enlightening at the same time. There's a lot of fun. I mean, I think of all the different race series that I've done. I have the most fun at Tough Mudder's, because I do gravitate towards those psychological challenges, maybe because they make the most fun bar stories afterwards. Sure. So it was beautiful. I loved it, but there are points in the course where I just didn't know if I could make it over this obstacle or through the electrical wires. So it was really challenging and ultimately because of how difficult I found parts of it, it was really rewarding. Yeah, I think that's the most... That's been the thing for me, is that the hardest stuff I've ever done. I did the Spartan Ngoge, which you're probably familiar with. It's a 60-hour endurance event. I did that several months ago, and yeah, the hardest things I've ever done are always the most rewarding, so I definitely can understand that. Yep. What was the... You talk about the psychological challenges. Tell me a little bit about that. Well, there's a... So Tough Mudder will challenge your, let's say, fear of tight spaces. So you're crawling through sewer pipes, fear of heights, balance beams over cargo nets, fear of electricity. You're getting shocked. Ice water, hypothermia, diving into garbage bins filled with ice water and fire. A lot of these things aren't necessarily physical challenges, although they're physical in nature, in that you have to move your body through them. But I think pray a lot more towards people's fears of these experiences. Was the electricity the hardest part for you then? I mean, it sounds like maybe that was a difficult challenge. I mean, absolutely, in the sense that this was 2011 before Tough Mudder was, Tough Mudder, and like very little reference point. I didn't know anyone who had done one, so... And when you're standing there waiting to go and you see people running through and getting shocked and blacking out and face planning in the mud and screaming, everyone's screaming. There's like, what the hell is going on here? So it was pretty terrifying. And it definitely hurt when you ran through there, just getting stung by bees. And you made it through, you didn't pass out or blackout or anything like that? I made it through with an epic profile pic. Yeah, I think I've actually seen... You had that in the documentary probably, right? Where you actually ran through... Was that in 2011? Was that your first event? Yes. So I don't know if the guys know what we're talking about. They probably do just because of the intro, but we're talking about Rise of the Suffrfest, which is your documentary. What prompted you then to create this documentary? I've watched the documentary. I know a little bit about the backstory and what you're doing. Tell me a little bit about that. While I was researching and reporting that humor essay about doing my first tough matter, that piece, that essay landed on the cover of my local alt weekly, the North Bay bohemian, North of San Francisco. While I was researching tough matter, I stumbled upon the scandal surrounding its origins. And I flung myself into investigating that, researching that. And about a year later, my expose landed on the cover of Outside Magazine. That piece led to pretty widespread media attention. It was picked up by a bunch of various media outlets. And also 60 minutes, I sent it to a producer over there. They really liked the story and they hired me to help consult on a segment. Interesting. So at this point, I felt like as a writer, you're always maybe looking for your beat or your niche, the thing that you have an expertise in. And I'd spent so much time researching this, immersing myself in the community, talking to people that at that point, I was just pretty fascinated with it. I thought maybe I'd write a book, a book about maybe the man who started the whole thing, who is the kind of tragic hero of the industry, Mr. Mouse. And then it kind of broadened from there. And I thought it was a, you know, obviously it's a very visual medium, these events. So I thought it'd be fun to tell the story of this subculture in a film form, documentary. Yeah. And you did a great job on it. I really enjoyed the documentary. What's been the, I think it's called, Mr. Mouse, I think it's called the, is it the tough guy? I can't remember what you called it. Yeah, tough, it's called tough guy. So that event looks horrifying to me. I mean, I've done Spartan races. I look at them, I get nervous, I get the butterflies, but that event like literally scares me. Tell me a little bit about maybe the most difficult events you've done and what that actually looks like. The first tough guy was hands down, I'd say the hardest, most challenging, terrifying event. I don't, I don't, I mean, no one really likes being cold. And the day before, when I got to England and there, the day before in course, standing on a pond that I would be dunking my head underwater, dunking my head under several times the following day. The ice was super thick. It rained a lot that night. So it broke up some of the ice, but not all of it. And so that course, you know, it's an eight or nine mile course, and you are in and out of water the whole time. And with the winds in England, and this is, this is the end of January, mind you, in the Midlands of England, it's just already cold. And now you've got this water that you have to compete with and air temperature and water temperature are both probably around, you know, 37 degrees. So it was, you know, when I crossed the finish line of that event, and that also a lot of Tough Mudder's obstacles were modeled after tough guy, hence the lawsuit and the scandal that I mentioned before. Sure. So, you know, there are large A frames that you have to cross over. You're walking on a balance beam that's 40 feet above above the ground with like, maybe a cargo net 10 feet below the balance beam. And then you're, you know, you're up in this massive structure and it's windy and cold, and you're trying to walk across the thing. It was everything about it was really a big, big mind. I don't know if I can curse here, but it was a big mind. I know you're, yeah, I know where you're going with this. All right. So I, and then, you know, the sewer pipes, their actual cement sewer sewage pipes. It was really uncomfortable. Everything about the event was uncomfortable. And then by the time I got to the finish line, my core body temperature chipped away so much that I, you know, there wasn't that sense of achievement and triumph that you have when you cross the Tough Mudder, or Spartan Race finish line. It was a real sense of panic. Like, do I need to go to the ER? Like, this doesn't feel right. I feel too cold. I can't talk. I'm slurring my words. This seems like unnatural and I need medical attention. So it was a different, an entirely different experience, that event. Did you go to the hospital? No, I didn't. You stuck it out, huh? Yeah. My wife got me back to our hotel and I sat in a hot bath still shaking like an hour later, unable to, I don't know if I really wondered when this was going to end. Yeah. How long did that last? I think it was about 90 minutes after the race where I finally felt like I was okay. Starting to recover a little bit. Oh my goodness. Yeah. I think you actually have that part in the documentary as well. Yep. I do. So I want to ask, and I know this is on a lot of people's mind, especially those who've never done any type of optical course racing. And my father-in-law says it all the time when I go do races. Like, you're going to pay money to do that, which is one of the core questions that you ask in the documentary. Tell me a little bit about why, like maybe even the culture, the type of people that would do this. I have my own reasons, but I'd like to hear what you have to say. I think in general, I feel like most of the people who do this are just normal people with desk jobs. And there's all sorts of, there are lots of athletes and extreme athletes, and that's a much smaller percentage of the people who actually participate in these things. So I think the vast majority of them are desk jockeys and pencil pushers, and don't have these types of experiences in their life. And so they're really stepping outside their comfort zone. They're really gaining something at that finish line because they've gone through something that's so different from what's in their normal HR existence. So it really appeals to corporate America and people with, I guess, normal jobs and enough disposable income to pay to crawl through mud. And I don't know if you are familiar with the quote, I quote this all the time, John Eldridge, he says, deep in his heart, every man has a battle to fight an adventure to live and a beauty to rescue. And I think this is what we want. Like, I spent time in the military and a lot of people ask me about what my service was like in Iraq and as difficult and as challenging as it was, it was probably the time that I felt one of the most alive points of my life, if you will. And I think we can get a glimpse of a small experience of that when we start to participate in these obstacle course races. Yeah. And Nicholas Carr touches upon it in the film and also in a lot of extra footage that I have that I'd like to figure out a way to repurpose. He's a tech writer. He's a Pulitzer Prize finalist. And he just talks about how, essentially, our lives, the goal has been to remove all the obstacles. Silicon Valley wants us to have a frictionless existence. And we think we want that. But the bottom line is that humans were designed to face challenges, there are reward mechanisms for overcoming challenges. And we feel most alive when we are actually engaged in difficult challenges. And I think that's the thing that we lose in these digital modern lives that we live, this convenience of culture where you can just get anything on demand anytime. You don't have to leave your house. Everything is just so easy for us. And I think ultimately that leaves all of us feeling very unfulfilled. Is this the most effective way to get some of that fulfillment in that challenge? Or are there other things that people are doing that may be rivaled obstacle course racing? Or what's your experience with that? I think this is one symptom of a society at a step. You look at the maker movement. Those people are also, I think, finding happiness and a feeling of competence through learning how to make things, whether it's artisanal mustard or you're creating some sort of battle bot robot thing. Sure. But the people who are not just buying things off the shelf and are engaged in creation, I think that's another outlet for this. Very much so. So where do you suggest that somebody start? I mean, I know there's going to be a lot of guys. Everybody's listening to me. They know in my experience, I'm a proponent of obstacle course racing. I like to get abused and beat up a little bit. I find it exciting and fascinating and it makes me feel alive. So everybody knows that who listens to this podcast. But where would somebody get started if they're looking at doing something like this? It depends on the fitness level. If you want to just dip your toes in, the Warrior Dash provides a really great experience for people. It's a 3k. No, it's a 5k. So a little over three miles, sometimes even shorter, maybe has, I'm not sure how many obstacles, but not too many. And they seem fun. And I've personally never done a Warrior Dash. It's kind of like the gateway drug into obstacle racing, so to speak. I just went straight for it with Tough Mudder. Spartan races appeal to a different type of person. These are much more physically challenging. It's almost like they feel like CrossFit based obstacles. They're about grip strength and endurance. And then Tough Mudder has gimmicky, very fun obstacles. And they're of a longer length. Spartan has three different race lengths. So there's something there for everyone. But if you fail an obstacle, you have to do 30 burpees. Which is brutal. I mean, that doesn't sound horrible, except for when you realize that you just ran six or nine or 12 miles, and then that destroys you literally for the rest of the race. Yep. I quit a three mile Spartan race as you had seen in the movie. Literally, my spirit was broken. Too many burpees. And I just felt like my body was going into shock. Which obstacles did you miss if you don't mind me asking? Spear pretty much always. I miss the spear. The spear is brutal. I mean, it's not a hard thing, except physically demanding, but it is difficult to stick that spear. It's difficult under pressure for me, which is really annoying because I built the spear target at my house. Oh, you did? Yeah. At home, I can nail it 85% of the time. You put me in a race and I'm at like 5%. Of course. Last time I missed it, I went, I did my burpees, and then I tried it four more times. And of course, now there's nothing on the line. I hit it four times in a row at the last race. Yeah, of course. So spear, I think the zip wall with like grips, I slipped off that and... Was that the Z wall, right? Yeah. At the time, it was controversial. And oh, the rope climb, I failed that in spectacular fashion. Was it water at the bottom? It was water at the bottom. And I was at the very, very top, and I couldn't pull myself up even. I was at the top knot, and I couldn't even get myself up. And there's a large crowd of people at this point because I declared the world I was making this movie. And so a lot of people had recognized me on the course. And so they're cheering me on, and I'm the only one on the ropes, and I couldn't do it. And I knew I couldn't do it. I made this fake attempt to ring the bell, but I knew I wasn't going to hit it. And then I went, I went kirplunk splashing from the top. I could hear the voices like, like, yeah, you got this to... Oh. Yep. Yep. And I just wanted to stay underwater as long as possible. Like a sinkhole could have opened up right then and there, and I would have been psyched. So I didn't... And they put those rope climbs right by the... World of Spectators, right? Yeah, of course, right there. Yeah. All right, guys, let me take a quick break to tell you again about our elite mastermind, the Iron Council. I've received a lot of questions and interest over the past several weeks. And if you're sitting on the fence about joining, I'm here to tell you nothing is going to change in your life until you do.

You can do that at order ofman.com slash Iron Council. Now let's get back to my interview with Scott. I want to jump back to the tough guy race because it is really fascinating. I mean, I've seen the video I know a little bit about Mr. Malison and his personality, which seems interesting to put him mildly. Tell me a little bit about why he has basically the founder, the grandfather of creating this movement, but just hasn't hit that mainstream like some of these other events have. He was popular. Tough guy had always gotten a lot of press internationally because it was so bizarre. We're talking MTV came out, ESPN came out, they did a short film and a story. It had traction with media, pre-Facebook, but once Tough Mudder came along and commercialized the tough guy model, you never really heard about Tough Guy again because Mr. Malison doesn't have the, let's say, commercial awareness that Tough Mudder had or Will Dean or even Joe DeSenna. It's not necessarily about that for him, but they found a way to take his idea and really blow it up to the Facebook generation. Yeah, the event, yeah, I think just did not hit mainstream because of just various limitations. It's not, they're not a bunch of MBAs and business people in his office. It's him typing, writing everything up by hand and having a secretary type things up. I mean, it's something out of the 1500s. The operations there. And I think I remember hearing about the newsletter with the donkeys or something like that. Yeah, he sends out a quarterly newsletter called the Jelly Leg News, which is obscure to say the least. It's, you know, sometimes it has race information and literally sometimes it has stories about the love of a donkey or, you know, random war heroes that Mr. Mouse likes or various experiences of his. It's charming and expensive. He's still mailing these things out by postage and he says in the film that he spent $60,000 on postage that year, which is insane when you think about how far $60,000 would go at that time on Facebook. Yeah, exactly to get to promote the event for sure. What's the significance? I wanted to ask you about this, about Jelly Leg. What is that? What's the significance there? There's some hills that you go up and down, up and down. I mean, I think originally Jelly Leg might have some new with runners, like your wobbly legs. Sure. Yeah, in the context I've heard, there's a slalom section where you're going up and down a steep hillside on his property and at the end of it, you are left with Jelly Legs, which is very true. Yeah, I bet. I bet it is. So how do the other guys, I mean, you talk about, is Will, is he the founder of Tough Guy? I mean, excuse me, Tough Money. Yeah. Okay, so what is the, obviously, I'm sure there's some bad blood there, but the thought behind Will and Joe, what they think about Mr. Mouse and his, basically his movement and what he started. I think they both have respect for it. Obviously, there is some bad blood between Will and Mr. Mouse. They had a very bitter legal battle, which you could read about, if I guess maybe in the show notes, my cover story for outside. Yeah, we'll link it up. So, Will and Joe, or Will and Mr. Mouse have a, they're not close or anything by any stretch. Joe and Mr. Mouse, they both have a mutual respect for one another. And I think, you know, they both appreciate what Mr. Mouse did. He was the first, the first along to do this, to build an obstacle course and a permanent course or a course on your farm. And they just made their own version of it. And this is certainly left Mr. Mouse feeling, you know, he feels left behind and, you know, in a way, rightfully so. It's a bit of a tragic story, which I definitely tried to get across in the film. Part of what I really appreciated about Mr. Mouse was just his, he just is so far out of the box and just, he's like, he is from another era with another set of values. And, you know, he's not as commercially minded or driven, tough guy to him is more of a, it's a way to teach these kinds of experiences to people to, you know, it's more of a lesson. And I think some people might argue that tough matter and tough and Spartan race are more of a commercial enterprise, which no knock against it. You got to, these are expensive races to put on. But I think Mr. Mouse's spirit is in a different place. And he does this for a different reason. I definitely think there's an opportunity for both. I mean, I'm a firm believer, obviously, of capitalism and the ability to capitalize and monetize something that you've created and something that will help other people. So there's definitely a line that I think can be straddled, if you will. Yeah, absolutely. I have no problem with the commercialization and sponsorships and everything that tough matters and Spartan races. I think, you know, I want them to succeed. And that's a big part of the equation for them. What do you see as the direction for obstacle course racing? First of all, I guess, does Mr. Mouse have any desire to adapt or move forward into this newer way of doing things? Or do you feel like it'll always be the way it currently is? Well, he has said that this year, the 30th anniversary of Tough Guy will be the last Tough Guy. So I don't know what his plans are afterwards. It's hard. His plans change. Maybe it's marketing ploy to sell out this year. And if it is good on him, I'm sure no one who does it because I think it's a last is going to be upset that it is the last. But so I know he, Mr. Mouse, would like to see this in the Olympics as Joe would, but I don't really know what he's going to do after this January. And I think that probably is the direction. And it sounds like I've had a conversation, a couple conversations with Joe about him wanting to get this in the Olympics. Is that the future of obstacle course racing? I think it's a very real possibility that not anytime in the next 10 years, but sometime within my lifetime, this would be an Olympic sport. And it would have to change in a lot of different ways from what it is right now. From what it is that I love about it, but still there could be a fun version that's just shorter, spectator friendly. And I still think we'll still have these trail runs through woods and whatnot. But there are some ways to do it. But obviously, it has to be TV friendly and it has to be spectator friendly. And at the moment, it's not super set up that way. How do you feel like it would need to change? I mean, specifically, what obviously they're standardized type things that we would need to incorporate. I know that there's, I'm assuming that Spartan race is a little bit closer just because they have national standings and rankings and things like that. But how would that work if it were to work out in the Olympics? Well, not only that, you'd need standardized courses across the world. So it'd have to be in, I think, maybe 47 or 50 countries. And you'd have to have the same, you know, you can't have sandbags. You can't have the spears the way they have them where, because each haybell you're throwing it into would have to be identical. The obstacles themselves would have to be very, very standardized. It wouldn't be different weighted sacks or different sized logs. You know, I think there are two ways from what I understand. One would be in an arena. So in a stadium, you have a course that people can qualify across the world at the same, you know, everything is the same. And that would also be TV friendly. But mountain biking courses would be another, another like possibility for how these races could be outside of an arena, because they are TV friendly. And you could have a, I mean, obviously, you can't have the same mountain bike course across the world. But as far as Olympics, knowing the competition, you could do it on a mountain bike course, because it's already set up for TV. Yeah, no, that makes sense. So what do you, I mean, just to come back to some of the reasons why and what people are finding out about themselves, I mean, are you learning new things about yourself as you are participating in these races? Well, how have you developed as a person through doing this? Put it this way, like, there's a point in the movie. And in my experience with this, where I quit a three mile Spartan race in shame that I, that I just didn't have it in me. And I felt pretty gutless, and I felt really low. So that, even that experience, I learned that I'm not the man that I want to be or anywhere near it. I could, I walked off a three mile course in shame and humiliation. And so that's instructive, and it led me to want to take my life more seriously. It was embarrassing. I mean, I was frankly embarrassed with myself. So lesson number one. And then, you know, from that, I started doing CrossFit. I started training more and running more and taking it more seriously, because it's not fun for me to be out there. You know, I don't want to do it. And then like, last fall around this time, I signed up for World's Toughest Mudder, which is a 24-hour race. You do a five mile course as many times as you can in 24 hours. And over the course of that, whatever it is, a year and a half or almost two years, I went from a guy who couldn't finish a three mile race to a guy who was standing after 50 miles and 24 hours. And that was like seriously, one of the more profound moments of my life. And I count that 50 miles as, you know, next to my marriage and fatherhood. And this movie has maybe the four things I'm most proud of. I feel like I have a resiliency that I didn't know that I had within me. I can apply that to my life. And in a lot of ways I've learned that I'm more than, you know, that maybe it's like the just the mental barriers that stop you. Like your body, my mind would generally quit far along before my body will. And I think World's Toughest Mudder proved that, that, you know, whenever my mind wanted to quit, my body could still keep going, but you just have to kind of control your mind a bit. And how did you do that for yourself? I think it was just sheer will and desire. Like I knew it would mean a lot to me. I wasn't really thinking about the movie. We had kind of finished the movie and that only was included as an epilogue because I did hit the 50 miles and that seemed important. But I just had this thing in my head and I had a son and I wanted, you know, maybe do it for him. Have this thing that I look back on and that by all objective measures is a pretty bad thing to be able to pull off. For sure. And so I feel like I wanted to redeem myself in a way that, you know, sure, you know, I could say I did the Spartan World Championship, 16-mile beast. And, you know, that sounds, I know that, I mean, that's a brutal race. This is about a month before World's Toughest Mudder. I knew that was an achievement to finish that. But to the outside observer, that doesn't necessarily mean as much as I did 50 miles. Yeah, there's something about that benchmark. Yeah, I think I'm like good at the really big things like, you know, better at those because they're so extreme and I think I tend towards those things. Well, I can definitely relate for, you know, doing it with your son. When I did that 60-hour Spartan year go, the endurance event, that was what was kept me going. There was a couple of times where literally, I mean, it's scary to look back now how close I was to actually ringing that bell and quitting. But at that point, the only thing that kept me going was my wife and my kids. They took a picture and they sent it to me before and they said, hey, we know you can do it. And they had a big poster with, you know, go dad, 60 hours. It was pretty cool. And those moments is what kept me driving, what kept me pushing, even though I did want to quit and give up. Yeah, that's a crazy race. And that's like, you know, that's on my bucket list sometime in the near, you know, futures, giving one of those back. I think clear another mental hurdle in my head to be able to take on something like that. But yeah, good on you, man. Well, you know, and just to maybe give you some insight into that, it really, I mean, you obviously physically, you can complete it. It's not as physically demanding as it is mentally demanding. And when you're on sleep deprivation for 60 hours and things like food deprivation, all that kind of stuff, your mind starts to really do some things to you. So it's definitely a different type of challenge. It's not like a traditional Spartan race, for sure. Got it. So what's the different? You talk about redeeming yourself from the three- the three-mile Spartan that you ran. What's the difference between you, somebody who says, I want to redeem myself and learn from that experience and get better and use that as fuel and motivation? And then somebody who maybe just throws in the towel and says, this is not for me. I'm going to quit. I don't want to do this anymore. What would you say the difference is? Yeah, I mean, it's just a different type of people. I think a lot of people are quitters. And I think there are people who maybe I just demand a lot from myself. I have a family. I've always had big outsized dreams for my life. And to me, quitting, I mean, it was hard to make this movie. I mean, after let's just, I tried kickstarting this thing and that was a big failure. I I fell a quarter million dollar shy of my Kickstarter goal. So and I, it's a very public thing. I'm asking all my friends and Spartan races posting it out to like, there are people and I tried to let the whole world know that I was doing this thing. And usually at that point, if you fail, I don't think very many movies that fail so spectacularly ever see the light of day. For me, like, I guess there's something inside. I believe that I have, it seems cheesy like everyone has greatness inside or whatnot. It seems cliche and it all seems like a marketing ploy for some podcasters. We don't use that, by the way. But I just always have felt that way. I always wanted to do something great in this world. And I always, you know, maybe my mom made me feel special. Maybe whatever it is, I just, I can't put myself out there so publicly and then just hide in the corner and, and, and not own up to it. Like, you know, one way for me to address that failure at the DNF at the Spartan race was, as I finally, by the time I got to the car, the embarrassment and humiliation faded a little bit and I started laughing. And I realized I could write an essay for Outside Magazine about it and I did. And it was shared like 23,000 times on social media. So I ended up getting that like, you know, it was a humor essay about like being a just enougher and how I need to demand more for myself. And I guess using comedy to process my failures has always been a, you know, a powerful tool for me to get back on the horse. As a life as a chronic bedwetter, that was always a something I was so embarrassed about. I was wetting my bed into college. I think I remember you saying that. Did you talk about that in the video? I can't remember. Yeah, I did. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. So that for me was obviously, I mean, I'm a college bedwater. What could be worse? You know, like laying there, hoping your room wakes up and goes to class so you can like flip the mattress and pour curox on it and like, it was just a nightmare. But years later, like, I, I just started writing about it and I started laughing as I was writing about it. And I realized like, Oh, like this is good. Let me use this, like, dark night of the soul for comedy. And I published, is the first magazine story I published nationally. And, you know, it was so cathartic to me that I think that's just the answer. It's like being able to see the upside of failure and using it as an opportunity as opposed to the thing that makes you just stop in your tracks. Yeah, definitely. Well, I know when we talk about this a lot, there's power in just being vulnerable and just owning, owning every aspect and element of your life. And when you can do that and drop the ego, push that aside and just say, here's me, and here's what I failed at. Here's what I'm good at. I think a lot of people understand that. And it gives them permission to do the same because all of us have failed. All of us have come up short. And I think that vulnerability is powerful for other people. It definitely shows in your documentary and the conversation that we're having today. Thanks. So what's next for you, man? I mean, you've got, you've got, this seems to be pretty successful. What's on, what's on the doc next for you? I think maybe next, I'd like to maybe do a documentary or a docu series about manning up and learning how to do man stuff before my son, Raleigh is old enough to realize that he doesn't know how to do anything. And so in a lot of ways, it could zoom in on the, you know, some of the themes from this film, like the masculinity crisis, you know, most men don't know how to do man things like we, whereas our grandfathers could fix basic electronics in the car and build things, you know, there just really aren't many of my friends who know how to do these things. I think it's important to have those certain basic, you know, survival man skills. And I don't have them. And I think it would be fun to explore that in, you know, a documentary sort of format. Yeah, that'd be cool. Let us know when you get that going because we can definitely promote or help in any way on our end because obviously the conversation of masculinity and those type of things are valuable to the discussion we're having as well. So let us know. Cool. It's got to appreciate you, man. Obviously, I could talk about the stuff all day. It's important to me. It's an important component of my life that I've only found recently. So I really appreciate you coming on. I've got a couple of questions as we wind down. And the first one is what does it mean to be a man? Well, if you're Tucker Max, who I interviewed for the film and did not actually use the footage, but I did love his answer to this, there are three Fs of manhood. There was food. So obviously gathering food for your family, fucking being able to make a family and fighting, being able to defend your family. So I think basic competence and those arenas are important to me, important signifiers of manhood. I don't know if I would have put it like that, but definitely can see that. So very cool. I appreciate that, Scott. Hey, Scott, I just want to let you know, man. I appreciate you. I appreciate your work and in what you're doing. It's been a big part of my life.
