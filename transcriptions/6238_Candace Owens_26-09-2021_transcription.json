    "text": " All right, you guys, almost time to go, but not before I answer some of your questions, my favorite part of the show. Questions given to me via social media and also always one here in our live audience. I look forward to answering them. As always, I never see these questions in advance, so let's get started. Is it still a good idea to immigrate to the USA with everything going on? Hmm, I would say it's not a bad idea, you know? I mean, America, obviously, we are definitely facing constitutionally existential crisis with the Biden administration in charge and their every effort to strip away our constitutional rights, but fortunately in America, because of the beauty of the Constitution, we have state rights. We know that people like Ron DeSantis and Governor Abbott are stepping up to make sure that he doesn't get away with so much and our founding fathers were brilliant in realizing that federal overreach could be a problem, which makes America unique compared against any other country in the world. They don't have this. I'm married to an Englishman, and he even says, it's you guys are just so lucky that this could never happen in America because of all these protections that were afforded. We're also afforded a protection in knowing that Biden's not going to be present forever. He can remember his name, and that's the truth. So we have an ability to fight as long as we protect the integrity of our elections, we have the ability to fight at the polls, and I believe that we will. So yes, it's always a good idea to immigrate legally to America. Next question. I'm sure you saw Meghan and Harry on the cover of Time Magazine. What did you think of it, and why does the media continually put them in the spotlight, calling them the world's most influential people? Seems a bit dramatic, would love to hear your take. Well, I think that, of course, I've seen this, it's such an embarrassment. It made me cringe. I just, I don't understand what's going on with Harry. I think he needs his friends. He needs his homeboys, and he's got to get back to the UK. And it's like watching a live castration. That was my viewpoint. It's like watching a man be castrated live. It's bizarre. You know, a couple of signatures all the time. There's no reason for a man to be squatting down behind a woman while she's front and powerful. It's just, there's just no need for this other than to send a message. And this is why they are trying so hard to force upon us that they're influential. We know they're not. We know that left and right, people are getting tired of them. It seems like all they do is complain. Oh, they were so brave and influential because they quit. They learned how to quit everything. They learned how to be against their family. Think about everything the left is trying to push right now and you'll understand why to them they are the dream couple, right? The left is against family. People that are Marxist, they don't believe the nuclear family unit. Well, Meghan Markle was a symbol of what it looks like to hate your family. She hates her personal family. She got with Harry and she convinced him to hate his own family. Every interview they do, it's against family. Every time he gets any tabloids, because he's attacking his family. So they love that. The media wants to put that up and say, look, this is bravery. This is bravery to hate your family. They also are climate activists. So they sell that doom in the gloom of the climate and the world is going to be over in 10 years and they make children fearful that their planet is not going to be live in 10 years. So they love Meghan Markle and Harry because they came out and said, we're only having two children because it's the responsible thing to do for the climate and the responsible thing to do for the planet. So again, a celebration of death and a lack of family only have two children. So yeah, to the left, this is the dream king and queen, except for the rest of us regular thinking people, they're an absolute abomination and I think that we should send them back to the UK. We will get back to the show in a second, but first we need to talk about rockauto.com. I don't know anything about cars. I just want mine to work. So thank goodness for rockauto.com.

How do you feel about universal healthcare for all if you are against it? What's your alternative? I am against universal healthcare, but I am for affordable healthcare. Unfortunately, these two terms are often wrongly conflated. Let me tell you something about healthcare in America. It is not an example of free market capitalism. A left will tell you a thousand times. See, it shows that capitalism doesn't work. Free markets don't work. No. The reason why we have a horrible healthcare system is it's because it's literally filled with people that don't show us the prices. They hide everything. When you walk into a store, you know how much a shirt is going to cost. You look at the price how can you say I can afford it or I can't? Well, the healthcare industry is basically a cartel. The big pharma is in collusion with the insurance companies and they don't tell you how much anything costs which allows them to ratchet up the prices. So you go in, you get treated for something and then you get a bill and it says, by the way, that Tylenol cost $400. There is no competition. Let me give you an example on the other side of what happens when healthcare is affordable and you actually allow the free markets to come in. Well, a while ago, the insurance companies decided that they weren't going to cover a LASIK. So it used to be when it was covered, I think it cost something like $25,000 per an eye. Now you can get an entire LASIK procedure and it cost you a couple of thousand bucks because once it said they weren't going to cover it, the free market was allowed in and a doctor said, I'll do it for X amount of dollars versus another doctor who said I'll do it even cheaper. So the price had to come down to something that was realistic that would make people that were not being covered by insurance want to buy it. That is why affordable healthcare and price transparency, which I'm a huge supporter of and avid supporter of and a fan of. We need to see the prices. We need to know how much stuff costs so we can make meaningful decisions. That is my answer. Also, as a reminder, there's no such thing as free. So don't fall for that buzzword of free healthcare. It doesn't exist. It just means it's going to be written into your taxes. So and we have one more question from the audience. What do we have today? Left or right? Hello. What's your name? Maddie. Maddie, are you nervous? A little bit. Don't be nervous, Maddie. How old are you? 24. 24. Awesome. Well, thank you for coming here. Where are you from? I'm from Franklin. Don't worry. I do not bite unless you're a liberal. A leftist. I'm definitely not. Okay, good. Then ask the question. As a conservative young woman, I often find myself afraid to speak out against the narrative that's constantly being pushed to my generation. How do you balance being unapologetic about your beliefs and having empathy, compassion, and civility towards those who disagree with you on crucial issues? You know, that's a really, really, really great question. I think for me, I'm fired up. I'm older. So I think it's a lot harder to be younger, especially at your age, you know, people that are on college campuses. It's hard because it feels like you exist in a totalitarian state when the entire universities and the school systems are on the left. So you have professors and we talk about what the teachers are teaching in the school system that are largely big supporters of March of Cityology and they're afraid to speak out. So I think it's especially harder when you're younger because you don't, you can't even imagine that something else exists and you're scared. You think you're the only one. The good news is that when you get out of college, university, and you start paying bills and you get out into the real world, you realize that there are plenty more people that think exactly like you, which makes it easier. And for me, I think it's what, what fires me up. I am obviously very driven by having a child. I have a son. A son, he's eight months old. He is just the light of my life. And I think that the arguments that we're having are going to determine his future. You know, I will, when I die, he's going to have to live with whatever America that I've left over. And I think that because I am guided by something very real and that very real thing is family, there's nothing that will really stop me in terms of how you balance compassion. It's in realizing that most people are ignorant, not evil. And you have to always ask when you're going at this one, is this person ignorant or is this person evil? And I would say by and large, people are ignorant. And less the people that are in power, they tend to be evil. And I spend a lot of my time going after the people that are in power. Biden administration, they are not victims. Jen Psaki knows what she is covering for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She started ignorant and she has now gone to the other side and she's just evil. She knows how she's making money. She knows how much money she's making and she's pretending that she cares about the little guy. So I think that that helps having perspective, knowing that especially when you're young, that people do grow up when they get real life experiences and sometimes biting your time and waiting for them to get hit with the tax bill, it can be good for you because when they see how much they're paying in taxes and what it's going to, they may suddenly come over to your side. So that would be my answer. Thanks for joining me on this episode of Candace.
