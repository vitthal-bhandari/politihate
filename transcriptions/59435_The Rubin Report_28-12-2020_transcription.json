    "text": " Holy cow people, it looks like we made it, and 2020 is officially coming to a close. And lordy, it was definitely one for the record books. While so many people went completely bananas this year, and some for good reason, I'm thrilled that so many of you have shared with me how this show has become a little oasis of sanity for you in the desert of craziness. As traditional media rightfully continues to implode, I'm happy to tell you guys that the Rubin Report is continuing to grow and trailblaze in this new digital landscape. We expanded our partnership with Blaze TV, launched my weekday direct message livestreams, and reached more people than ever during this election cycle. And of course we did a couple tequila shots along the way. For the last week of 2020, I wanted to look back on some of my favorite moments from the sit-down interviews this year. We had a ton of incredible guests on the show from Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to new media superstars Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens to all-star comedians Brian Callan and Nicole Arber. I promise to continue having the conversations that matter as we roll into 2021, barring a full-blown zombie apocalypse in which case I'll be hiding in a bunker and it might take a little time to get internet down there, but I think that goes without saying. So now enjoy this look back at some of my favorite moments on the Rubin Report from 2020. About a week later, and now it was off the grid already, I was in the fruit section, I was buying a melon actually. I do enjoy a little watermelon in the summer months, it gets hot here. And there was a woman like screaming in joy about Kamala Harris. So I suspect that it is Kamala Harris. I'm guessing it's Kamala Harris, the way you're nodding at me sort of... She is Kamala Harris. She is the worst. She is the worst. I mean she is the worst. Do you think she is the worst? Do you think the dead would have helped him or hurt him in the polls? Do I think that Kamala would help him or hurt him? Well, it can't really... Well first off the polls at this point it's like... Who knows what the polls mean. It can't really help because the Democrats hated her, nobody voted for her, nobody likes her. And the crazy lefties that are running the show right now, the anti-fiburni coalition of Marxist lunatics, they all hate Kamala Harris because they think she's like a corporatist sellout. But she... Ugh, that's so gross. It's so gross. And it did. You know, look, she's the worst. She's the worst kind of authoritarian. You remember that moment at one of the debates when she was still in it when the question was asked to Biden about would you use an executive action to ban assault weapons or do something on guns? And Biden said, people can find this. Biden said, oh, well, it would have to be constitutional. And Kamala Harris looks at him laughing and she says, Joe, can't we just say yes, we can? And it's like, wait a minute, you think that you can use the power of the executive branch to supersede the power of the legislative branch on something that's enshrined in the bill right? Yeah. Like she's the worst. So it's funny you mentioned that witchy cackle because you'll remember, this is the big problem when Biden picks her. She launched the most vicious attack against Biden that has yet been launched this cycle. She called him a vicious racist at those early debates and said he was a segregationist or whatever. Oh, right. Remember that? The busting and all this ridiculous thing. So she goes on the Colbert show and Colbert, to his credit, pushes her. He says, uh, uh, Senator Harris, what happened to Joe Biden being a terrible racist? Which he said she puts on the cackle. She goes, ha ha ha ha. It was a debate. And so he says, right, it was a debate, but her, but you know, are you saying you were lying then or it's not? He goes, ha ha ha. It was a debate. It was a debate. It's called a debate. It was a debate. She must have repeated the word. And that's how evil these people are. That, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah. But it's all becoming too obvious to everybody. Yes. Yeah. The nonsense she never believed he was a racist. No one in their right mind believes Joe Biden is a racist. But then you throw it out there. And, and for anyone that's on the fence about politics that's, that's watching this happen, it's like when you see them do it against their own and it's a lie, does it make you wonder when they call everybody else? Maybe it's a lie too. Right. Let's just talk about the world as it is at the moment for just the. Do you believe on the show? Oh, you can curse your brains out, but, but what do you mean? You're, you're a, you don't curse. I know, but yeah, I do. If you promise me, I'll believe that then I'll curse. Oh, I, I, yes. My people will believe it. Yeah, we're sort of. I've been waiting for that for a long time. You're, because I've heard you say fuck off. My guys don't have to bleed my fuck. They can bleed beer. Yeah, that's right. I've heard you say fuck privately and then you, you put your little. Well, as you know, as you know, there is a bit of a gap between public persona and, in private, I curse a blue streak is, you know, so that's, that's not, that's not a great shock. But yes. Okay. So yeah, let's, let's just do it for a little bit. Are we fucked? Like what the hell is going on here right now? Um, it feels that way. I mean, it really does feel as though any common bonds that we once shared are basically disintegrating and that you're being pressured into mimicking the belief that all those bonds are gone. So even if you believe that the bonds aren't really frayed and that really we should have some stuff in common, if you say that out loud, you're part of the system, part of the white supremacist system. And this is, it's such dangerous stuff. And as we're sitting here very, in the last few hours, there was a, there was a sort of graphic that came out from the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is a Smithsonian Institute taxpayer funded institution. Funded by the government. Funded by the government. And it was all about whiteness and the evils of whiteness. And among the evils of whiteness, things that we have all integrated into our lives because of the prevailing system of white supremacy, where things like hard work, individualism, justice, time management, delayed gratification, science, I'm not kidding. This is all in the document. These are all, these are all things that are listed as elements of white supremacy that must be rejected in order to move forward into a better, more progressive world. And so all the things that you would think like, yeah, I feel like we should all have this in common, like, you know, science. This one, this one we should have in common. There's a whole movement to say, no, no, all of these things are outgrowth of an evil system. And that in turn is the result of an absolutely despicable redefinition of the term racism. For what it used to mean in, for virtually all of human history, but certainly since the 1960s, to what it means now. So in the 1960s, racism was what we all think of racism as, believing in the inferiority or superiority of a particular racial group. Very easy definition. Easy enough. You can spot it wherever you see it, right? It's not hard. It's a very easily applied definition. And then there's been an attempt in the last several years to redefine racism to mean any system that results in racial inequality is itself racist. And so if you're not seeking the destruction of that system, you are complicit in racism. And in order to be anti-racism, you have to seek to destroy that system. Well, every system in human history has resulted in inequality of some sort or another because human beings have different capacities. We make different choices. If you literally tell me, you tell me we're not all exactly the same. We don't have all the exact same thoughts and gifts and skills. You tell me- Stop being racist. Stop it. Stop it. It's slightly different. It, everyone Kendi specifically writes this, right? And how to be an anti-racist? He says literally any system that generates racial inequality is a racist system. And so therefore, it's not like you're a bad person because you're a racist. You're just a product of the system or you're upholding the system. And in order for us to fight that racism, we have to fight the system itself. And so anything that is part of that system, anything and everything that is of that system is tainted by racism and must be ripped down completely. And if you are complicit in the system by doing things like hard work and individualism, you're an assimilationist. This is what everyone Kendi says in how to be an anti-racist and Robin D'Angelo sort of mirrors this. And you're saying yourself, wait a second, are you closing in an awful lot of doors to black Americans and minority Americans? Like the pathways to success in a free system are things like hard work, individual effort, thinking ahead, delayed gratification. Like this is not unique to capitalism or the evil American system or anything. But also what are you saying about black people like that? Right, you're saying, what? It's insane. I mean, David Duke could write this shit. Right. I mean, he really could. I mean, David Duke could write the idea that whiteness is about hard work and individual initiative and religious adherence and family structure. Right? That's crap David Duke would write. Yeah. But the anti-racist are writing the exact same crap and they're saying, yeah, but all those things are bad, right? And if we just got rid of our adherence to these systems, well, then we wouldn't really have to have standards that we hold people to and then equality would be the result. I mean, that's insanely dangerous stuff. But because the charge of racism is the most highly charged charge you can make against somebody. It's the worst thing you can call somebody in America and for good reason because that is an awful thing to be. Right? It's an awful thing to say about somebody. It's an awful thing to be because that is such a highly loaded term. It's so easy to cudgel people into line. All you have to do is just acquiesce. All you have to do is be the person who cheers on the guillotines as the guillotines chop off heads and we'll leave you alone. Now we're not going to say that you're left alone forever, right? This only holds true until the time for the next guillotine. What was it like for you to sort of be someone that was supposed to be talking about the news but also for a lot of the time you were kind of making news. I mean, everyone knows what happened with Trump and the debate. But that you sort of got sucked into news too. And in the movie, there's a line where Nicole Kidman as you basically says that you know, no, no, Charlize Theron. Sorry, Charlize Theron. Here she says that she, you basically saying you didn't want to be making the news. I assume that's pretty much how you feel. I didn't want to be the story. Yeah. I said, I'm not going to be the story and I don't want to be the story. And I was the story after that debate and I hated it and I have hated being the story every time it's happened. You know, I see the journalist as on the sidelines, not as players on the field. And you know, Trump to some extent grabbed me and put me on the field and the Roger Ailes thing did too. And then just, I don't know, once you get well known, you know, that the sleazy media takes a big interest in you and starts following you around and they're not all bad. Some guys are good. There was actually a sweet guy right after I left NBC, all these paparazzi were outside of my apartment and you know, couldn't like leave without getting ch ch ch ch and this one guy, he was from the post. He got his shot. And then he goes, this is such bullshit, Megan, you can't say anything anymore. Like, there are real people out there. They're not all bad, but I don't like being the topic of the news. I have asked myself many times why that keeps happening, you know, I think I think people aren't used to seeing like somebody they can't figure out. Somebody who's sort of unapologetically strong, especially especially a woman. We're out there, but like, it's not that common. And a woman who doesn't mind fighting, right? Like it's like, what, what's she doing? But you know, I'm feudalistic by nature. And I think it may be exciting. It may be upsetting, you know, it may be alienating, but for whatever reason, it's attracted news. Yeah, it's funny to me because as you're getting back into the fray, like, it's so obvious. There's going to be a moment like within a couple of months where something's going to happen, like, you're going to say something or one of your guests is going to say, sorry, sorry. And you're going to be like, Oh, why did I get back in? But then, but then an hour later, you'll be like, this is exactly why I got back in. Like that's just an emotion. I don't think that's going to happen to me. I mean, I do think they're going to come after me, you know, not out, but I'm just so used to being attacked for everything I say. It's like, at this point, I'm like, all right, you know, what are you going to do? You're going to call me a mean name? What would that feel like? What would it feel like to see myself call something horrible on every newspaper in the country? Oh, wait, I've done that. In a way, it's sort of empowering because it's like they took their best shot. I'm here. I'm well. I'm happy. I'm about to launch something that I'm really into. And for once, they like they can't get rid of me. They can't get rid of me, you know, like, even if every sponsor I have is like, we're out, then I'll do subscription. You know, the relationship will be between me and my audience and they can't stop it. Whether they want to or not, they can't stop it. I will have my say. I will have these discussions with interesting, provocative people, people who go against the grain. And if the audience is there, I will remain on the air. You're speaking my language, sister. I maybe I know I may be able to retire early now that you're getting back in. What do you mean? We're going to go off to the sunset together and the digital sunset. Ah, the digital the digital sunset. There you go. So do you miss? I mean, I think I know the answer is, but do you miss sort of the same blue dog, more centrist Democrat? Because I think Biden was the last hope of that thing. That's what it strikes me as. And clearly he's not going to be the savior, obviously, for many reasons. But, you know, Jordan Peterson talks about this a lot, that you want this healthy tension between the left and the right. And it's like, look, I know I'm new to the right. So maybe I don't see some of the problems that you guys have been around. So you see, but what I see is this pretty diverse group of the real Trump people, the more libertarian people that are all that are all sort of trying to fight for what the future is. On the left, I just see purging. Do you miss the old school? You know, I know JFK is before your time, but do you miss an old school Democrat? Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Yes. Look, JFK is a great example. Scoop Jackson on foreign policy who believed in standing up to communists. That you look at JFK. I often quote JFK. You read his speeches, for example, what he says on religious liberty. Read his speeches on cutting taxes, where he campaigned in 1960 on we're going to cut your taxes and we're going to cut your taxes. That's going to produce more jobs, more prosperity. That's going to benefit everyone. Those speeches, he would be driven out of the Democratic Party like some crazy heretic today. Yeah. You look at the tax cut we passed in 2017. You know how many Democrats voted for in the house? Zero. In the Senate, zero. There was nobody. I'll give you another example. One, one that the media refused to cover, but it's one that I got very passionate about. The Democrats introduced a constitutional amendment in the Senate to repeal the free speech protections of the First Amendment. Now, this was following the Citizens United case, which Citizens United has become this totem. So Hillary Clinton pled, every Justice, I point, is going to repeal Citizens United. Joe Biden said the same thing. Do they know when they say that about what the Supreme Court nominees are going to do in the future that that's not really how government works? Well, I mean, everyone does this across the board, right? For Democratic nominees, it largely does. Yeah. So I've got a book that's coming out in October called One Vote Away. And it talks about how one vote on the Supreme Court can change history. Are you worried for a limited government guy? You don't want the administrative state to be too big. It's like you can get in the weeds on all of this stuff. But in many ways, this is what you've spent your whole life fighting that peep that the whole system has just gotten so big and crazy at this point that even if you tell people what's true and we have all the facts in front of us, that sort of the ship has sailed on, on raining in the things that I think you and I and most of my audience are worried about. Yes and no. I think if you were asked your audience, obviously, it's probably a very limited government audience. But even if you're asked a general audience. So for example, if I ask everybody in Kentucky about whether or not a secret court where you don't get a lawyer should investigate political campaigns, I wish that falls at 75 percent, particularly to keep Trump out of it. Now Trump's pretty popular in my state. So it doesn't hurt so much. But really, if you could get Trump out of it, but the problem is people get they won't vote on principle and ideas. So I didn't get any Democrat votes on this. I only got 11 Republicans. But I got no Democrats, even though many of them profess to think that Pfizer has too much power and shouldn't be investigating Americans, they wouldn't vote for it because they saw it as a vote, rebuking Pfizer over Trump. And so they saw it as a political vote. But I guess I don't look at it this way. I lose a lot of time. I'm I'm I'm I'm used to losing on votes in the center. But I think most of this and this is where we do have some ability. So we pass out a sheet of prominent tweets that went out from senators each each week on Wednesday and all my office does the sheet and they all complain because we'll put out something in my tweet. We'll have gotten 30,000 retweets and they will put out senators so and so and they got six. So right. One of the things they see is that the Liberty movement has reach well beyond them and they fear the electorate. These people are afraid of elections. They're afraid of me. They're afraid of conservatives because they're afraid someday someone's going to wake up and challenge them in the primary. And that's what has to happen. The Democrats, it's sort of like this. Democrats don't care at all about the deficit and they'll tell you and they want to spend more money. They're honest about it. Republicans say that against debt, say that against spending, but they're also most of them big government Republicans vote lockstep with the Democrats. So really when people ask me, whose fault is it Republican or Democrat, I say, yeah, you know, it's really parties fall. But, you know, we could give up and just try to protect ourselves. But, you know, I think if we give up and the few good voices here go away, then really, I think it goes much quicker towards socialism. It goes much quicker towards indebtedness and big government. So it has to be some voices that needs to be more. I was strongly considering leaving. Like I was looking at real estate. I had a whole bunch of people begging me to come to Dallas. I would have a pretty sweet operation over there. Yeah. My feeling right now is I want to stay and fight here. I love I love SoCal. I love, you know, I love the weather, of course, and all that. But like I've built a good life here. We've got friends. I like it here. It's a freaking mess. Absolutely. I think you're in a bit of a similar situation. I am. And I didn't think about staying and fighting until I spoke to you. And I haven't stopped thinking about that. And I think you're right. I was just in Austin looking at property and boy, does that. No, I know. We probably I told you we're probably looking at the same houses. I'm on truly like, I can get in Austin. Oh, come on. Really, I can save it. It's cheaper to live. It's that, you know, I don't pay that 13% tax or whatever it is or 18%. So yeah, I could save a lot of money. And what's happening in California, it seems, is businesses are leaving for just that reason because it's very expensive to do business here. What California has going for it is a very diversified economy and amazing weather. And it's just a huge, important state for a lot of reasons. But California was the state that worked. And we have a democratic super majority. And if you look at local politics, it's it's just anytime you have a super majority of any group, I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat, I don't think that's good for democracy. Your vote, if you are someone who leans even a little bit right, doesn't count. You'll save it, stay home. We don't care. And you aren't getting elected to local office. You're not getting elected to to government office. You're not unless you are pro big union across the board. Good luck. Good luck otherwise. And I'm a member of a union. I'm in SAG. So I understand the value of unions, but. It's expensive to do business and unless you can push back a little bit or come up with a compromise, I don't I don't I'm not bullish on California. And that ain't me. I've talked to some very smart people who are economic. Animals and all of them agree and all of them are looking to get out because. It's too expensive. Why? What I live in on Skid Row, basically, I'm in Venice. I've been in Venice for 25 years. I love it, but I don't recognize my town anymore as much. And you know, it's gotten really bad over there. It's not just gotten very bad. It's become profitable because developers now can get these government contracts. I mean, I can build you I can build you a bunch of apartments for $200 million on Prime Real Estate on a parking lot and on the beach if you'd like. I'd be happy to do that and we can just have we can create a homeless. Apartments for people who are homeless and don't worry about doing drugs or anything else. We're not going to put any other restrictions on you can come and go as you like. You know, so so there is something that see this is not me, but a scholar. I had a long conversation with called the the homeless industrial complex. Once there's money in bidding and getting homeless shelters for big developers, you better be careful. So these people need to be put in treatment. The majority of the people on the street is not a housing problem. It's not a housing problem. It's not a housing problem. It is a mental health and addiction problem. And until we get serious about that, we're we're we're going to be in big trouble. Is it weird to you watching it spread in different areas? So Venice always had a certain amount of that. Now it's definitely more but like Hollywood, which also always had a certain amount. It's like kind of taking over Hollywood. If you just go to straight up, especially now where there aren't as many other people on the streets. Now it just seems like all there are kind of like transient people and homeless and tents and well, you and as that inches closer to West Hollywood now, but it'll inch closer to Beverly Hills and that that then is what that then is. It gets pushed. Yeah. Well, you know, they have their own police force, but yeah, prop 47 and you can't it's not criminalized. They're all kind of these. I voted for prop 47 because the way it was phrased and it had the it had the again on the ballot as I'm voting. I went, well, this makes sense. I don't want kids to be in a revolving door of crime and police chiefs back it. And how did you read the whole thing? I didn't. That's it. I didn't have time. I I'm remiss. But that's how they get you in this state. I think more than any other during the last election, there was this one thing on the ballot about, you know, do you want to do something like this? Do you want to put $500 million into education for, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then there's essay, just a giant crazy essay on the whole thing. And I skipped all the way to the bottom. And on the bottom, it says this can only be repealed or reversed by popular vote. But nobody ever says, OK, now we'll take the money from the kids. But that's government 101. That's right. You sell it exactly the packaging thing you're talking about. Go away. Nobody reads the fine print and then you throw it back on the people to be like, Oh, you'll have to take care of this deal with this. It does feel like we're sort of getting if this is a video game, we're getting to the big boss. We're getting to the final boss where for for eight levels, they've just ramped up the racism, racism, homophobia, blah, blah, blah. And now we're there. Like this election is it. And it almost seems to me that all they've got to run on is that America is racist. And if they don't have that, it's like, I don't think anyone buys any of the policies. And unfortunately, just the way the media operates right now, this isn't going to be an election about policy. This is an election about basically racism and socialism versus capitalism and freedom, something like that. Yeah, you know, it is in in they the thing that always strikes me because I watched them, the left leaning stuff and God, I see this, you know, never ending clown car of the black liberals that come up and they talk about stuff. So case in point, so the McCloskey situation where this couple was defending themselves from from an angry mob, by the way, broken into private property. And on the left with with the black pundits, this somehow becomes about race. And this somehow becomes the idea of these people inflicting their white supremacy on these black protesters. Number one, those those protesters are not peaceful. Number two, they were not all black. And number three, the last time I checked, the second amendment in the right to bear arms is for everybody. It's not just for for white people. So I'm struck when I see these conversations, how, how quickly and how easily they remove all agency from black people in America and from African Americans in general. They all of our agency is removed in these conversations. Yeah, well, it's also incredible because they try to paint the McCloskeys as evil for defending their property as we as we're watching all this stuff burned down. But it's not like the McCloskeys woke up that morning and were like, we're going to go shoot people. They had those guns for a long time. It sounds like they were actually Democratic donors at least at one point and supported Black Lives Matter. It's not like they were just sitting there waiting to start some stuff. It literally showed up at their door and then they defended themselves. But that's actually a good transition to media because you're you're a media. What can I call a assassin, I suppose, as well? You've just had it with the with the mainstream media too because this is stuff they're endlessly peddling, right? Well, it is. And a lot of people don't realize, Dave, that so I went to Columbia journalism school. I got my master's in Columbia. I worked in medium production for years before I decided to come out and say what I really thought and do all this for myself. So I know all the games, dude, I know about prepping a tweet and leaving half of the quote off. Um, I know what fake news is because sometimes fake news are actually most of the time. Fake news isn't an outright lie, but more a half proof. And so you see past all these games when I first came out as conservative, one of the first friends that I lost, I got deeply offended when I told him and not in a condescending way at all, told him that I've been working in this at that point for about five to six years and I know these games and you're not media littered enough to see this and he got deeply offended by it. And then that was it and just like, it's whatever. Um, but people didn't realize these games. And I think the deeper we get into this, we see it over and over and over again. And folks like you and I, when there is an outright lie, and I mean, a whopper, it has to be shut down so quick because if you don't, then it becomes part of the lexicon and it becomes common knowledge. Ace and point, um, Trump, very fine people comment, which has been debunked so many times, but it is canon among the left. And that's because, and that was a feeling on the right because they didn't shut that down immediately immediately when they shut up. Fortunately, we had suits because we were supposed to go that night to an event that Ben Shapiro was headlining and we were supposed to be in suits for that thing. Sorry, Ben. We, uh, we left yet to go see the president. We go to Marlago. There's like like an absolute insane security situation and they have to like drive us around a small island. And miles around this. Yeah. It was like crazy to get in there. We get in there. We're like basically almost strip searched before thrown on the back of a golf car. Yeah. Like they really, well, it's the president, you know, and then as you've described it, it's sort of like the Playboy mansion, but like doused in gold and hairspray. Right. Although it didn't feel cheesy at all. It actually felt kind of classy or old school or something. And we go in and there's a main dining room. And I'd say there were probably about 50 people in the main dining room and Candace Owens was there and a couple other people that we sort of knew. And we were sort of whisked into the side room, which is, I guess, the more exclusive room where there's maybe 20 people. Right. And our table is right in the middle. I get an extra layer of secret services to get into that room. Right. And it made they make sure no phones, no pictures, blah, blah, blah. Our table's like literally in the center of the room. So the four of us have a nice dinner and sitting next to us, you know, one table over is President Trump and Melania and Rudy Giuliani and they have two or three other people there. And we have a great dinner. We had a great time, right? Like totally fun and Don doesn't drink. But and when some one funny thing was happening, but somehow the way we were sitting, I kept drinking your wine. So basically I had like seven glasses of wine. I was like, I'll do sober by the end. Yeah. And I figured out why until I realized what was happening. It's because you were a lefty, which Oh, that's what it was. You see what I did here. Actually today because this isn't a real shoot. I let you have your water on your left side. Normally I make the water on that side and then people say I lost over there. They say I lost all my lefty creds. Look at that. Anyway, then at the end of the meal, Junior says, hey, do you get to take some of your water? Go crazy. Junior says, hey, do you want to meet my dad? I was like, all right. Let's meet your dad. So we go up to him and remember this is like two or three days after impeachment had just been announced, which feels like another lifetime ago at this point. And everyone, every story was about Trump is freaking out. You're closing in. He's a paranoid lunatic. The guy sitting there, he had no tie on. He looked totally relaxed. His hair was a little more dishevo than usual. He was having a ball. He was laughing. If you were living on the moon, you didn't know who Donald Trump was. You didn't know who the president of the United States was. And all of a sudden you found yourself in this room and they said to you, the president of the United States is in this room. Who do you think it is? I guarantee you, you would never think it was him. Right. This guy was sitting there pretty quiet for the most of dinner. Just listening to other people, listening to his wife speak, mostly, actually. And I was expecting this like loud, bombastic, blowhard sort of like nothing even against him. It's just I think everyone can agree. Like he's you would think he's this would be the center of attention, sucking a lot of the energy out of the room. The exact opposite. It was the reverse. So so we walk up to him and he's sitting and done junior introduces me. And he says, Dad, this is Dave Rubin. He has a great podcast, blah, blah, blah. And Trump looks up and he's like, you kind of recognize you. And I was like, Oh, well, you know, I go on Fox and I'm on Tucker. I said, Tucker, that must be many turns to you. And he goes, man, who are you? And you were you and you're standing there. Yeah. Who are you? And you go, well, I'm his husband and he goes husband. Husband. You two are married. You two are married. And then he slaps his hands on the table. Yeah. And he goes, he goes, I want to stand up. I want to stand up and shake your hands. I think that's great. I think that's just right. And he's like, honey, these two guys are married. And he turns to me, he's like, you two, you guys are too good looking. That's your problem. You're too good looking. He's like, I got to shake your hand. That's fantastic. That's fantastic. And then he says, he goes, you know, I don't give a shit. He goes, and I don't think anybody else does either. And then in a very Trump way. And also, I don't think anybody has for 20 years. No one's given a shit for 20 years. Yeah. And I realized at that point, I was like, oh, he thinks that I think he's probably a homophobe because I'm gay and that's what I've been told by the media. But I mean, that moment, I mean, I knew already he wasn't a homophobe. So I'm not thinking that, but I realized how much does that suck for him to have to preface that after he meets a gay couple to say, you know, like, you know, I don't care. Like we're cool. Right. So you left Los Angeles. I said goodbye to you and you said, I'm going to Portland. And I said, why are you going to Portland? And I think you said, I need to see it for myself. So you went up to Portland. Yes. What do you see up in Portland? I slightly shot my bolt on this because I wrote a piece for one of the papers saying California is a California is a failed state. And then I went to Oregon. Yeah. Yeah. Portland is some people say to me, you know, why do you need to go and see this stuff for yourself? And I just think it's an instinct of curiosity I have. And I also, even when it is exactly what you think it is going to be, it's still interesting, you know, Portland, Oregon was exactly what I feared. It would be a bit worse. I was horrified by the immiseration of the city, the total destruction of all public monuments and public buildings, the shuttering up of shops, the intimidation of the citizenry, the demoralization of the citizenry, a homelessness problem, which makes even California's look minimal. And the fact that the city's basically been given over to an emiserated lawlessness, I went with Antifa several nights in a row to pardon the language a fuck gentrification protest, which was my first. Yeah, that was your first one. Yeah, it was. Yes. I've hit the two always avoided the temptation. I quite like gentrification, actually. I think that houses being made nicer and neighbourhood being smarter is no bad thing. But old fashioned view, certainly not the view of Antifa, important who sectioned off some of the streets and went through them in the middle of the night, screaming at the citizens and the house owners, telling them they were all on stolen land. This included many black families, by the way, shouting at these black families, white families, families of every background, shouting at them, they were on stolen land. And should get out. Were you worried? Were you worried for your own safety? I mean, you were you were out there with them. I mean, people know who you are. Yes, I was lucky enough in the era of mask wearing. You can cover almost your entire face lawfully, indeed almost compulsively. And I was I mean, I've been in worse places and war zones where there's more lawlessness than that. But it was not in a pleasant situation to be in what is normally a first world city. The second night, I went with them to the protest of the ICE facility, where which was a bit hairy because they were assaulting the so it is one of the very few federal buildings in the in the area. They play a game of cat and mouse with law enforcement. They get closer and closer to the front of the building. Their aim in the past has been to barricade in the buildings, burning dumpster trucks in front of them and then kill the people inside by burning them alive. So that's their modus operandi. So you can understand why the ICE officers don't want that. And they get within a certain closeness to the door and then the officers break out and there was firing tear gas, pepper bullets and all that. And people were selling fire things in the street. And that was unpleasant. Yes, I got you know, shoot out of an alleyway by federal officers with a bunch of other antifa with me and the officers at Gumpoit told us please to move out of the alleyway and it was unpleasant. But I have to say that considering the situation, I thought the officers were as decent and reasonable and efficient in their duties as they could possibly be. I have to read you. There is a song that is I'll just pull up to your glasses like I would excuse me, sir. Now that we're going blue, so there's a new song that's taken over the world. And when I say taken over the world, I mean, like this is the story. OK, this is like the story. Yeah. So I don't even know. You know, I don't go blue on my show. Yeah, I know. I'm very clean clean cut. I don't wear socks in my loafers. I try to be. I can't say the name of this of this song without going blue. Would it be better? And you're hosting right now. So I want you to do what you think is right. Would it be red or if I just read it straight? I would feel much better if you. So the song is called WAP. OK, WAP. It's by Cardi. WAP. It's by Cardi B. And this song, I mean, this is like now the the anthem, the feminist anthem. Right. And Cardi B, I'm not totally sure who she is, but I know she was like fighting with people right before I went. Yes, she she supported Bernie Sanders. Oh, right. It's got long nails, I think. She and I think that's racist for you to say that. But yes, she does have long nails. So here's this is this song is just taken over. Everyone's this is everyone's taken over. So I'll just I guess I'll just read a little. Yeah. Horrors in this house. There's some horrors in this house. There's some horrors in this house. There's some horrors in this house. Hole up. I said certified freak seven days a week. Wet ass pussy make that pull out game week. That's good. Yeah. And then the chorus. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you fucking with some sweet ass pussy. Bring a bucket and mop for this pussy. Mop for this. Oh, bring a bucket and mop for this. You got to mop up. Give me everything you got for this wet ass pussy. I'm going to not do the next paragraph because that's where they'll come for me. Yeah, this is the so so where does she get her mop? Yeah, you can't ask got some words that you're allowed to. Yeah. So that song, I mean, she's making a point. It's not she's making it without merit. No, it's not. It actually the song actually does have a point. The thesis of the song is that all women are prostitutes. That's actually the thesis. She says, yeah, I got my man by and she describes sexual acts that I know, look, we're young hit millennials. OK, we've gone also like that you've never thought of. I mean, in this kind of it's I didn't know that pornogra. Felling a slot bucket. When you're just that image. And only I didn't know that that audio could be pornographic. I thought pornography is only visual. Yeah. So she's saying that these things are good. Like this is how you attain power in essence. It's not yes, it's not she's not. So the it's so the reverse, actually, of what what at least first wave feminism was. Yeah, yeah, it's it's a it's funny because it's such a ridiculous song, but it is a commentary on our map. Wap. I see. And then it hits you. It took me like a day to I thought, oh, as I'm pondering this deep song of great thing. Yeah. And but that's it. And so to say that calling women prostitutes and having themselves is empowering is is obviously a complete reversal of reality. Like you say, reality is on trial. It's emblematic to me of everything that's going on. You really do do it through comedy. Like if you want to tell people to knock at punch in the face, you got to do it through comedy, right? That's that's just kind of the way you got to do it. And that you really have mastered that. But I'm curious, did you were you kind of right before then? Because I want to get to when you kind of came out for Trump. But were you always we both had our kind of similar events? Yeah. Yeah. But but like what were you before? Did you did you consider yourself liberal, conservative blah, blah, blah? So liberal. This is my liberal sweater, by the way, at least liberal media. OK, this is like freaking CNN reporters all over it. Yeah, 100% liberal for sure, for sure. And then I actually had a good friend in LA. I was staying at her house and we were watching CNN or something before the last election and she's like, you know, me and my whole family vote for Trump. And I thought she's a crazy person. And I literally thought I probably can't be friends with this person anymore. That means she's evil. She's a bad human. Like I was like, are you guys like racist? Knowing her boyfriend is a black man, I thought it was weird. And eventually I realized, oh, no, her family just owns a bunch of businesses and employs a lot of people. Oh, OK, that makes sense for them why they would support him. And then I started to see the unraveling of all the things I've been taught. You go to enough parties in Hollywood to learn their all douchebags. It's just it is what it is. Ninety eight percent, you know, the ones who live in Texas most of the time, they're pretty dope. Yeah, but I started seeing that every single thing that these people pretend they are. They're actually the polar opposite. And I went, well, what's the opposite of asshole? I kind of want to go that way. And I saw I caught, you know, even Jimmy Kimmel, I caught him multiple times lying in stories. Yeah, total lie. And I actually was responsible for outing him twice. He probably hates me in the last year because I was like, wait a minute. That doesn't seem right. I'd go to see span and watch the full uncut footage. And I'd do a quick video on it and be like, Jimmy Kimmel, did you just lie to your entire audience? Let's see. And he did. And then he issued an apology a couple days later on Twitter. He was lying about Mike Pence and one of them. But the more I saw this, the more I was like, motherfuckers, check to me. You checked me. Doesn't it doesn't seem crazy to you that you have to like fact check comedians as a comedian? Like if you would have said that to any any like eight year old who wants to be a comedian and your job will be to fact check comedians through comedy, you'd be like, what the f are you talking about? Right. You can swear with me. It's OK. I saw you tell that Shapiro to swear. I've told him to swear multiple times to I was I was being hosty there. But I would like that. You're so cute. I would. Yeah. Thing. Just like just once and then put it on a loop and turn it to songs. Yeah. Often think now that I've been taking some of these positions that aren't thought of as popular or or OK by mainstream or whatever, that the only thing to fear itself and I've been thinking about that a lot lately that the more that I say the things that I believe to be true that happened to be against the mainstream things, the more I get over that because if you can get over the fear, then if it's true that we're on a list and they're coming for us then we're on a list then we're on a list and by the way, pretty much everyone's on the list and that's why there's that famous thing. You know, they came for the Jews first. It's like we're all we're all part of this thing, but it's a very strange time that you can show me some of these things, founding documents from the United States, documents about saving Jews during World War II and it feels like something that's kind of now only if people don't find their courage. Yeah, I truly believe and this is why I think you're so powerful. Courage is contagious. It is people, not everybody's a leader, not everybody's willing to step out into danger. You know, not everybody's willing to lose all their friends or to whatever. But when they see someone risk everything and they see them on a list, if you can get them early enough, they'll step out. But the longer you wait, the worse it gets. That's Bonhoeffer was a pacifist, was involved in Fajtofenberg's coup. How he's a pacifist. He said there's nothing else we can do at this point because it's too late. The people's hearts had turned to stone and you couldn't turn them. We have to find a way to make sure that our hearts and the hearts of everybody we know stay soft and see people as people, not enemies. You know, when I was on tour with Jordan, one of the things that he would bring up often because he would talk about the parallels to Nazism, to some of the authoritarian movements of the day. And he would say to everyone in the crowd, he'd say, you know, there's three thousand of you sitting out here right now. And I guarantee you that every single one of you would think that you wouldn't be a Nazi if this was 1936 Germany. And that proves probably that you would be. And I always thought that that was pretty powerful. So we all think we would do the unpopular thing. We all think we would do the risky thing. We all judge everybody by our standards of today. I'm not sure I'd stand in the end. I mean, a friend of my barca's trail. I said to him, how do you stand torture and not break? And he said, Glenn, everyone breaks. Everyone breaks. He said, but the ones who break the fastest and the loudest are the ones who will say, I'm never, I'll stand. Oh, I'll stand because they haven't thought about it. It's why I wanted to bring my kids to Auschwitz. I need you to feel it so you can think about it and really look at this as a possibility. And once you do that and you realize by the grace of God, I'll stand. Then you're then you're ready. But we have got to prepare ourselves now to be ready because if you're ready now, the problems go away."
