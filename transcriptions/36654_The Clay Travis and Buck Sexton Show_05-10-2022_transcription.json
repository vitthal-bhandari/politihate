    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome back into the clay Travis and bucksxton show. We are joined now by the governor of Oklahoma Kevin stitt governor. Thanks for being with us. Appreciate you. Oh Absolutely great to be on your show today. So one thing that's gotten a lot of attention from certainly conservatives in recent weeks and months are the revelations about transgender Surgery on minors sometimes as young as 12 or 13 years old You are leading an effort in your state to stop this practice at least in the hospital system. Tell us what's going on here Yeah, well first off we were totally shocked. I mean every governor, you know citizens around the country We need to find out what's happening because we found out there were these you know gender transition surgeries Which are really you know sterilizing minors and doing permanent surgeries to you know 12 13 14 year olds And so we put a stop to it. We blocked funding. I called the legislature to stop that You know statewide make sure we put a ban on that I don't think taxpayers want this to happen in their state. I mean especially minors This is really troubling to me. These are healthy children and and you should not permanently do something You know and or allow that to be done in your state and so I think it's pretty pretty common sense to us Yeah, I think it's a hundred percent governor. This is clay. I appreciate you coming on with us The analogy I would draw here is you can't get a tattoo to your 18 But we're letting gender reassignment surgeries happen for 14 or 15 year olds I mean it's madness What kind of opposition if any aligned? lined up against this and what did the numbers look like in Oklahoma in terms of the politicians who supported you You know you had it's it's it's so ridiculous that we're so politicized, but every single Democrat I believe maybe two Democrats in our legislature voted against it all of them voted for it that all the rest of Democrats voted against this bill that The legislature put on my desk and we have a majority Republican conservative legislature in Oklahoma So everyone of the Republicans voted to say yeah, this is nonsense I think 95 percent of citizens believe in traditional family values and and so to allow somebody to harm Their child or to permanently change something. I mean we can have the conversation I'm happy to talk about if you're an adult and you're 18 or 19 or 20 if you want to do something You know on your own dime, but for the state to pay for this for a minor We're just not gonna tolerate it in Oklahoma. How crazy is it to you? Let's just be honest pretend you're not the governor, right? You're a dad. I'm a dad How crazy is it to you your kids are young that? Democrats would make their entire party position that this should be able to occur You know, I mean I tell people you know just privately before I mean this would this would make our grandparents roll over in their graves Thinking about this this is the most unbelievable thing ever and I think that the the Democrats have gone so far Left and made this part of their platform in the hill to die on and they're losing the Hispanics You know a lot of the a lot of the Hispanics African Americans the pack of stannies the Asians in Oklahoma They constantly are reaching out to me just saying what in the world is happening? I voted Democrat before but I can't stand for this we're fathers We want to protect young people like you said minors can't we don't give them a driver's license and give them a car at 12 or 14 and say be responsible. We're gonna let them alter Their life we don't let them buy beer until they're 21 and we let them cut their genitals off at 14 I mean, I don't even understand how this is remotely first of all I think it's child abuse But the idea that this would be a Democrat platform is truly insane to me Yeah, well, you're exactly right and they're losing that the far the far extremist Are losing this this isn't about attacking anyone person. This is about protecting young people This is about there's a lot of things that you know, you're not your mind and your frontal lobe is not fully developed until you're in your 20s and so to allow people to life altering change and let parents I agree with you I think it's I think it's child abuse and and we took the first step to ban it in Oklahoma We're speaking in governor Kevin state of Oklahoma Governor You have spent time down at the border. You've seen the lawlessness and the chaos and the impact on border communities firsthand I just saw yesterday the official fiscal year count for Godaways I I want to say it was between six and eight hundred thousand which is in addition to the five million people who have entered illegally on the full two years of Biden's time and office or whatever it is year and and change going on two years What does it mean for your state? Well, what are the impacts that you're seeing and just also? Have you ever seen a border that is this wide open before? You know, I have it now, you know, it was one it'll be one year ago tomorrow that myself and ten other governors We went down to the border with governor Abbott in McLean, Texas and held a press conference We released a ten-point plan prior to that 26 governors asked Biden sent president Biden a letter asking for a meeting and crickets nothing Can you imagine over half of your customers or half of your? employees want in a meeting with the boss and and and he won't even respond So we brought released a ten-point plan You know, we have to have a remain in Mexico policy and that would change everything because right now You're free to be released into the US if you just touch the border and oh by the way Here's a piece of paper show back up in two years at a court date. It's just nonsense. It's creating the migration and now $20 billion is the estimate that this is costing taxpayers From open border the cost of taxpayers from illegal immigration They're just pouring across but in Oklahoma specifically fentanyl is the leading cause of death I think that's across America now. We know those drugs are coming through the southern border Then you talk about terrorists and you talk about all the give up getaways We have to have strong borders and I also want to say this This is totally different than an attack on the Hispanic community. We have a fantastic hard-working Hispanic community in Oklahoma, but we have to have strong borders. We have to know who's coming through Our borders. We need correct immigration policy Governor, this is shifting gears a little bit. I know you're a big Oklahoma state fan Oklahoma is leaving to go to the SEC one of the great rivalries in all of sports Certainly college football is bedlam in your state. It appears. It's going to be coming to an end Can you do anything as governor to try to keep that rivalry going? Man, we would love to you're right bedlam is a huge deal every we played that game and Thanksgiving And so we hope so I'm talking to the legislature the university presidents to see what we can do And and it's complicated when they go to different conferences and having a non-conference game with a with another Team is is gonna be difficult But you know, I'm gonna be down in Texas on Saturday flipping the coin with governor Abbott the Red River rivalry is a big one Oh, you Texas that that rival we will continue because they're both gonna be moving conferences together and But I hope we can do something to keep it going And governor, you know, we were just talking about the migration to Florida before and the migration that is we're going on to Texas particularly from the coast from the New York area and from California has been ongoing for years what kind of inflows to your state of Oklahoma are you seeing and and for anyone who's wondering what policies Either Florida or Texas have enacted successfully What are the ones that you're also doing in Oklahoma? I mean we'd like to see sort of the spreading of good policies and ideas to all states with red governors. Oh Well, first off, you know, not per capita, but true numbers Oklahoma is 11th in the country right now in migration So people are waking up to our pro freedom pro business policies Traditional family values We've got the cheapest electricity to the consumer and businesses so manufacturing people are coming Because we've got an all of above energy approach. I cut taxes last year for every single business every single, Oklahoma So just amazing things our regulatory environment in Oklahoma is so much better than the coast I'm a businessman that became governor four years ago. I've never been in politics And so I bring that business perspective that we want we want our regulatory bodies working with industry We never played gotcha. We were clear with the rules, but we let businesses go compete against each other And that's why people are flooding here because of that. But yeah, we we're seeing the same kind of migration I kind of joke though that if you move here from California, you know, I had to wait 18 years to vote So they should have to wait 18 years before they vote here too. So Governor we talked to start the show about Everything going on with the energy policy you were just talking about the impact certainly that energy has in Oklahoma You're right there by Texas when you see that OPEC is diminishing their oil production by two million barrels and certainly you live in a region where you guys have produced a lot of oil and gas over the years How much of a disaster is Joe Biden's energy policy for? Oklahomaans and based on what you guys certainly know about American energy production Yeah, it was so for everybody listening to your show. It's just set politics aside for a second Every single president of the United States whether the republican or democrats since 1973 Has had an energy independence policy that makes common sense for americans Let's meet the needs of our of our citizens with our own resources our own companies our own employees This administration they want to buy oil from russia. They want to buy it from the saudis They want to ask them to increase they want to be reliant on other countries Well, we have the resources in our own country to take care of our needs because We're still driving to work and heating our homes and businesses and taking our kids to soccer practice and football practice So demand is the same, but they choke off supply And then they scratch their head when everything costs more the same people that they try to help they're actually harming Because it's the people at the lower income bracket that that pay a higher percentage their money on groceries and and gasoline And so it's so frustrating in such common sense that we have to have these honest conversations And by the way, oklahoma Everybody thinks we're just an oil and gas state. I'm so proud of our oil and gas industry We're actually number four in oil number three in natural gas, but we're number two in wind energy production We're not afraid of renewables at all, but let's have an honest conversation about meeting the needs of americans with our own resources Governor kevin state of oklahoma governor.

We got a couple of people who went away in 800 282 2882 try to throw in some calls every now and then and let's go first to amber in edgewater She's down in florida. Just move from Huntington beach. So you moved california to florida. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Why did you make the move? Oh, there's a plethora of reasons it just got It got too hard financially and in the education system as well. So We were ended up losing money out of savings and didn't like the direction of our finances and Search and search the search and ended up here in florida. We got the best bang for our buck. How happy are you with the florida moon? Yeah Well, there's a bittersweetness. I absolutely love my count of fun in can beach which is still fighting politically to save it city council Um, but I am I'm loving it. There's you know certain aspects of freedom I didn't realize that I had lost even though I'm aware of many of them that I did lose in california um, you know, just um, there's there's You know just little things waking up there and cheaper gas by a lot All right, no doubt. Well, I look there is A world buck where the 2024 election should be If we were really going to have a referendum on covid florida versus california Gavin Newsom versus ron desantis who was the better executive of a large state during covid That feels like if you were like a boxing promoter. That's the fight you would set up by the way I was a big proponent uh and amber. Thank you for calling in from engewater florida I was a big proponent of if we're just lining up the best match up possible It should have been trump bernie sanders really yeah instead of joe biden Uh because with bernie you actually get what the democrat party really is now. Yes joe biden the whole game with hamless Oh, he's been in the game a long time. He's not crazy joe He's gonna keep things right down the all eyes. Yes the policies you've gotten with joe biden are Just a razors edge difference from what you would have gotten with a bernie sanders presidency That's just the truth. I mean look what they just did with the spenny. He wanted to spend folks He wanted to spend five trillion dollars with record inflation already. I mean it's it's lunacy joe in miami beach florida. I gotta say love miami beach. How you doing joe I'm good guys great show joe here is sunday house beach by uh union new jersey And uh so happy me and the wife and the family made the move down here And if our governor great governor desantis is uh listening All we want to say to him is run run run run let's so into joe because i get a lot of Clay there a lot of florida in this who are like you you take the rest of the country take their hands off our desantis They get very uh very possessive No, look. I think there are a lot of people out there who are in florida that love what run desantis has done And are apprehensive about the idea of him running for president because they don't want to lose him as governor Which is the ultimate endorsement of how good of a governor he's been i'll be honest with the you know As somebody who had lived in new york city proper for for decades Um the mayor mattered right? I knew the mayor mattered a lot The governor I kind of you know the governor was like pataki and it was you know a few other people here and there um The governor I think for a lot of people became a much more Important role and they realize the power they have because of covid with covid all of a sudden your governor mattered a whole heck of a lot Which is why we say the de seantis beating gillam is maybe the most consequential governor's race Of any of our lives almost just because if gillam wins there are a lot less freedoms everywhere He turns florida into new york or california. It also buck made a lot of people realize covid did how important school boards are because i'll be honest I hadn't really cared that much my kids are in public school I never really thought about it until I saw that school board and what they were doing And covid made me recognize it in a way that I never had before Well, I hope a lot of parents are still upset about the child abuse that their children were subjected to buy the school system by making them Mask up and even sit outside in cold weather because of covid Hillsdale college is on a mission my friends the same mission They've been on since the 1850s when the college was established in a midwest town hillsdale, michigan Their mission has been to explain and defend our nation's liberties and freedoms That's one of the founding principles that has made our country the envy of the world Hillsdale professors don't just educate that point on their campus But far beyond their string of online video series is the perfect example They've produced more than a dozen on-demand video courses each one explaining our freedoms in different ways Their most popular course to date constitution 101 their newest course It's called the great american story a land of hope Enroll in one of these free wonderful courses from hillsdale and after you've learned and our lyser for it Please spread the word encourage your friends and family to sign up to Begin your free totally free folks hillsdale college course today at clay and buck for hillsdale.com That website again for your free hillsdale college course go check it out this week this weekend clay and buck for hillsdale.com Herschel's gonna win and they're starting to see it Herschel's gonna win so they're gonna throw everything under the sun at him I talked Herschel today. Herschel is a great candidate He's focused on the right issues the dim you know democrat want to have to defend all his bad votes in the Biden agenda That's that's gonna hurt democrats all across the country. We're gonna get the house We're gonna get the senate and we're gonna start moving in a positive direction to get this economy going Make sure we have a great education system. Keep this country safe I believe that we're gonna have a big win and i'm excited the Herschel Walker will be one of my colleagues Herschel Walker Underfire right now from the live media because of a daily beast report that we told you about that was senator rick scott of florida I was saying look Herschel's gonna pull this out and he's gonna be a very strong member of the united states senate when he gets it done The libs Know that this may be it it could come down to georgia I mean the based on how these other races go we're hopeful that Pennsylvania and Nevada Arizona georgia all gonna go in the republican category, but who knows Herschel's in a dead heat really I mean up up a couple points down a couple points look at the poll look at the day You can find different numbers And here's what i'd say about this obviously an october surprise It's october time to try to torpedo a candidacy You know whether it's a billy bush tape on the bus remember that with trump or now it's this The allegation which which Herschel completely denies But there's some paperwork that they say is a check From Herschel to pay for the abortion of a girlfriend that he had in 2009 Um, there are there are a lot of layers to this. I start with the premise And I'd actually I'd had to hit my friend uh, david har sony over at The the federalist for this I agree with him on this this changes nothing changes nothing about Herschel's candidacy for me because First of all people are allowed to evolve and their understanding and their positions over time um What's the alternative as somebody who is a Major proponent of the pro-life cause what are you supposed to do in this instance? Go with warnock who wants abortion for all nine months of a pregnancy that that's going to really Show the pro-abortion movement how consistent we are on the right One thing the democrats in the left love to try to do other than smear people lie about them And I don't know if this is true about Herschel. He denies it They have paperwork people can make their own conclusions or come to their own conclusions about that voters can but clay We're not going to allow uh, the Left's complete abandonment of principle to be a weapon that they use against us by saying you have an imperfect candidate Therefore you shouldn't vote for him vote for our incredibly bad candidate on the democrat side Democrats reelected Ted Kennedy six times after he killed a woman in chapaquiddic six times he is one of their lions of left wing causes They are running john fetterman right now Who nearly died in may has been dishonest about his entire health history and can't physically do the job as senator And trying to lecture people about georgia. Here's what I believe in general and this is my personal position everyone can think differently. I try not to make A choice about who i'm voting for based on the personality of a candidate Because we don't know these people now. I know Herschel a little bit. I like him But it's not like i've spent time with Herschel privately. It's not like i've had a long existing relationship with him What I know beyond a shadow of a doubt Is joe biden is the worst president that has ever existed in my lifetime? We've never had a worst president my opinion shadow of a doubt The number one thing that I have to decide if I believe that which I do Is how can I keep joe biden from doing more damage to this country than he has already done And the answer is a republican house and a republican senate to check joe biden's powers That means Herschel walker if I were a georgia Not only would I vote for him. I would be proud to vote for Herschel walker. This is not a remotely difficult choice for me I'm not going to allow an entirely personal based attack, right? That's what this is That's what the new york times when they said he wasn't black enough on sunday daily beast comes out on monday and says oh He's not pro life enough They are going after him personally because he is winning and they are desperate to control the united states senate And for any georgia out there listening to me Don't allow yourself to be played by the daily beast and the new york times. Herschel had his best day of fundraising Of his campaign yesterday because I think a lot of republicans buck when I was saying the desantis analogy a lot of republicans Understand that when you're getting attacked by the media It's actually a sign that they fear you and you should support that person even more Oh, yeah, I I'm in the line from our friend and colter is so true if the new york times isn't calling you racist You're losing I mean it's you know when when you're when you're doing well is when they get really nasty, right? When you're doing a good job and you're making the points is when all of a sudden they You know start saying oh somebody said you remember the stuff they said about mit romney Just put aside what we think about mit romney these days He's the plan leave least defensive person on the planet. He is Rich Ned Flanders from the simpsons, okay And they said that he like he like had a car with a rooftop a dog container on it and that he was he gave someone a wedgie in high school I mean it was pathetic. It's a stuff that just anything that they could come up with always you know mit romney was such a pulley Um, but but here, you know psychologists will talk about projection, right? When you put on to others what you yourself are doing or thinking joe scarborough is Unintentionally, I think here a master of projection in his analysis of the hirschal walker situation It doesn't matter to voters or at least to the leadership I should say of the republican party who said none of that matters. We think he can win. We like him He's famous. We love him in the state. He won us a national championship and a Heisman trophy Were with her shell come hell or high water. Yeah, despite all the lives despite despite lying about working for law enforcement Despite lying about graduating Despite no he's not and and they know he's not fit to serve. They want the vote. They want the power That's really that's all it's about All it's about Is power that's interesting coming from the party that as you put it on has federman and has joe biden whom you and Apparently roughly let's call it three out of four members of our audience with my own scientific poll agree Is not even going to be able to run again because he's not fit to serve. I think he's not fit to serve I think they don't care. I think what we've seen all along here is no support I mean to your point about teddy kenny to the point about federman to the point about joe biden They to the point about hillary clinton hillary clinton was I mean never mind the classified information Go back to bill clinton the guy is Having sexual congress with an intern In in the oval hell done with the euphemism and the double entendre by the way Um, and so the idea that you're going to lecture me uh or anyone else out there about Voting for her shell walker again if i'm a georgia and this is not a tough call you need to get the vote This we already gave away two seats in january of 21 And it's going to be tight and this is what this is why they they've spent 60 million dollars attacking her shell walker with everything They've got and here's the truth buck Herschel walker georgians know him So all the ads that you're running about him everything else They've known him since he was a kid 18 years old and he went to the university of georgia And he's not perfect just like anybody else out there Uh in your own life if you were running they would go through every single thing you've ever done If you were about to win and you were about to take away any of their power And they would try and destroy you that's what they do I need to see when you know the clay travis presidential campaign one day. It's october of 20 Something 2050. I guess that would probably be pretty far out, but you got what i'm saying dead I'm there like mr. Clay travis Is it true that you are a great supporter of the first amendments and boobs that they'd like run this ad against you all of you know Everybody everybody's got a thing that the libs are going to come after them I mean that would just be funny of course, but you know everybody's got a thing Hey, look I bet a lot of guys are like me buck when that brett kavanagh thing happened I talked to my wife and I was like I I mean, I I bet I tried to make out with somebody who didn't want to make out with me when I was a teenager I'm just i'm just putting this right now. I'm just making stun everyone out there That happened this for me the three most um the three most important moments of political revelation in my adult life um have been 9-11 because of everything and the impact obviously but 9-11 and that recognition of the enemies we have in the world The kavanagh destruction attempt. I really think that that was that was the soul of the democrats on display and it was rotten and fed and grotesque and covid I think those three, you know, yeah, trump amazing what he did it with beating hillary that that but those three things I will never forget and they have actually um shifted my political my core political philosophy in ways that have really Made have really changed things in some in some ways For me buck the kavanagh hearings. I like you were a conservative growing up. You've had the same political beliefs good for you your whole life I shift right like I was moderate I watched the kavanagh hearings And I said I can't support anybody in the democrat party After watching what they did to break kavanagh in that hearing that changed that changed my Libertarian that made me a republican they knew they were lying They knew they were lying in front of millions and millions of people They were trying to ritually humiliate and destroy a man in front of his wife and his children and the whole country And they didn't care one bit. They were the remorseless Sadistic mob that is what the democrats were in the kavanagh hearings Nobody should ever allow themselves to forget what happened there. Just think About the idea of being quizzed based on What was written in your high school? You're and you know who is one of the worst of all the people Kamala Harris One of the worst people she got a promotion everybody a promotion 100 right that's what they're trying to do to Herschel They're trying to break kavanagh him because they don't want him in office Don't let them win Go and support Herschel Walker.

She says the only reason her show walker got the nomination Was because of his skin color listen They have to offer but it's all they're giving and that should tell you something They didn't even try to find somebody who was at least Had the idea of how to take care of people in georgia. They just said oh get somebody black in there get who who do you know? Oh, yeah, get him. Yeah, and that's what they did. That's what it feels like I mean how else can you explain it? I mean, this is such an insult to have a black woman diminishing her show walker Entirely to the color of his skin Particularly when it's democrats who are actually the party that regularly says I mean this is what joe biden did with the supreme core justice He said i'm going to pick a black woman and didn't allow any other options out there Herschel walker is one of the most popular and esteemed people in the state of georgia beloved for decades and He Herschel did stepped up for donald trump a long time friend of his I think Herschel would tell us if he were on here right now We'll get him on again soon. We've had him on a show a bunch Herschel would say that when he saw his friend donald trump being unfairly attacked He felt compelled to speak out and that's how he ended up in politics if trump doesn't get involved in politics I don't think Herschel ever really steps to the forefront and feels compelled to speak out like he did Uh, and that's why everybody out there particularly everybody in georgia has to stand behind Herschel here as he is under fire We got a lot of people who went away in with a variety of calls Johnny in utah Where'd you move to? I'm doing Johnny in oh hi. I was gonna say special agent jonnie. You tell us he calling in from from the beach exactly what I was thinking jonnie Utah jonnie. Sorry jonnie. I apologize You're not worried So good What you got for us here on radio there's a couple million people listening It's all rep just hanging out with special agent jonnie. You tell man. He's gonna catch the point break any moment. Go ahead, sir Yeah, anyway, I don't think what the golfer got the her job because of looks I couldn't have been looking for her Um, but real quick is I moved from California to Ohio and I did all the math prior to leaving and it was like 28 percent uh cheaper for me to move here and Now that everything has changed a lot of people here are still in shock because of All the prices are going up and in california was already like that. So yeah No, look cost of living. Thank you. Thank you, dani great stat for you back Uh, it look cost of living is something that I think now people have thought more about because of Of covid clay and the mobility that happened during that period a lot of people just got out of some of the blue Stalinist covid enclaves and experienced Tennessee experienced north carolina experienced florida texas and they're like oh wow these places have Amazing everything and they're a lot cheaper crazy stat From the time california became a state in 1850 Until 2020 the state game population every year 2020 it loses 2021 it loses 2022 it loses cost plus covid robin salt lake city what you got for us We love salt lake city appreciate everybody listening out there Well, I gotta say uh that last car. I wish I had a cool handle like johnny ewts off love movie Hey guys listen to you guys all the time love the show um figure it out stir the pot a little bit um between Uh driving every day. I I fill my day up with listening to you guys and your buddy jesse kelly So with that in mind Clay my my question is mainly for you is how much crap does jesse give you for uh, uh, uh, Not putting your money where your morals are as far as uh, the sports go and uh giving it all up Yeah, you know that's it's it's well first of all jesse's got a great show Um, although he did order 75 dollar tequila shots that cost me a great deal of money and tried to claim that he did it Because he didn't have another drink and he actually had an old fashion that I was also paying for just for the record Uh, look we've talked about this sometimes buck. Um, I Made the decision first of all I love sports and I think when you love something you either make the decision I am going to stand and fight for the sports that I love to try to make them Appeal to everyone democrat republic and independent whatever they are Or you say Throw up the deuces say peace out and I abandon interest. I understand both sides I'm fighting to try to make sports sane. I haven't been willing to leave so I you know I don't love it enough to fight for it. So it's easy for me to say I don't think that conservative should support those things But you're on the inside and you don't want to give the aircraft carrier or the battleship to the left So you're not giving up the fight by the way you get an under siege vibe. That was a great move That was a great movie joni you top Clay Travis and buck sexton on the front lines of truth"
