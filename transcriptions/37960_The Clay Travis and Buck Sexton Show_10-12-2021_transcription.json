right now in Minnesota just by way of review this woman shot Dante Wright she's a police officer she shot Dante Wright when she meant to go for her taser she killed him and there's no one that no one disputes the facts here she killed the man who absolutely should not have been subject to lethal force by a police officer there's no question about that there's no debate no one's saying that she was justified in shooting him not a sin not even officer potter not even a defense the issue is around whether she is criminally culpable for killing him or if this would be along a civil issue essentially right is this is this a person who should be held to a criminal standard where they will be imprisoned for a period of time Dante writes um Dante writes a state is surely if they have not already going to get a lot of money as they should from from the state this was a tragic accident and so this shouldn't be a case that has people it's very sad it is a tragedy but this shouldn't be a case where the national guard is on standby which right now they are the national guard has been called up and prepared here for a possible unrest in in Minnesota Brooklyn center Minnesota this is outside Minneapolis because if the wrong verdict comes out of this the quote wrong verdict other might be riots now this is not an issue of anyone thinking that what happened was was justified or okay this is entirely question of under Minnesota state law was this a reckless homicide or involuntary manslaughter every state has different terminology for how they refer to these things but under Minnesota law what are we dealing with right that's it it's a question of question of fact why is BLM gathering and acting as though this is part of the narrative of police killing unarmed black men you know out of racism officer Potter did not want to kill this individual did not want to kill Dante right she thought she was going for her taser it was a terrible and yes in many ways unforgivable error but that is what happened there's no doubt about what happened so why create this tension around it why why are there people who are saying that this could turn into a violent confrontation bad things happen in the world there are tragic situations that will occur that does not mean that there is racism involved it doesn't mean that there's some systemic justice that is at issue and to pretend there and pretend otherwise is just to exacerbate pre-existing tensions and to make things worse than they would otherwise be and I also give you BLM coming out to say recently that they are supporting just the small at because you could never trust the police anyone who supports just the small at is at this point I mean who who believes just the small at or even is willing to say that is essentially a moron I mean no serious human being thinks the just the small at is not guilty right so what's fascinating is that back in 2019 Joe Biden tweeted this out what happened to just the small at must never be tolerated in this country we must stand up in demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts we are with you just the okay so he fell for the hoax Joe Biden now he's present United States back then he was just Joe Biden trying to line his pockets and I think that this is a moment where we have to recognize the BLM movement is in every respect damaging to this country in terms of its results and you can argue about what its intentions are the results are bad across the board results are bad so when do we get to have Democrats be honest about that well they won't be honest about it Democrats won't be honest about it because they view it as important for galvanizing and mobilizing the black community politically and they know that if they don't at the national level get 90% of the black vote they're basically never going to win another national presidential election so they'll do whatever they have to do to keep this going it's just a shame that this has to be this is a moment in time where we see how completely intellectually dishonest the democrat party has become officer potter I'd have to look at the statutes more specifically my sense is she look she's guilty of involuntary manslaughter one way or another and so it's just a question of what the punishment is and what happens and it's a tragedy for Dante Wright's family it's a tragedy for officer potter's family she didn't want to kill him and she made a terrible mistake you know I mean if you know if a pharmacist gives you the wrong pills and you have a you go to anaphylactic shock and you die it doesn't make them a bad person it makes them a culpable person there's a difference there's a difference there right they're not evil but they made a mistake and there should be accountability for that so we shall see how how that one turns out the Christmas tree in front of Fox News that was burned down very happy to see that you had Suzanne Scott the CEO Fox News say that they're going to have a new tree and a new lighting ceremony and the whole company's invited and that's the way it should be but the the individual who lit the tree on fire his name is Craig Tamanaha he's seen on video outside of City Hall also I believe exposing himself recently this guy's look he's they describe him as emotionally disturbed that that's a polite way of saying this guy's crazy he's a crazy person this is a person who probably has untreated and pretty advanced schizophrenia some kind of severe bipolar disorder who knows I'm not a psychiatrist but I mean he's got serious mental health issues that are not addressed right you know a lot of us have mental health issues by the way people have mental you know you get depressed for a while tons of people get depressed Winston Churchill used to battle depression terribly he called his black dog days people get depressed no question about it it's just what do you do about it you know that you spend more time in reflection prayer with family do you go see a shrink a psychologist psychiatrist deal with some of the underlying issues perhaps take some SSR eyes or medicine for it I mean that's in the same way if you get strep throat you take an antibiotic for it so you take care of it right I mean everyone gets sick everyone gets sick I mean I believe everybody deals with illness of the body but also different illnesses of the mind just how you handle it well when you have an individual who is roaming free in the streets who is untreated I mean it's essentially like the strep throat has not been treated with the antibiotics which can be very serious right and that's what you have here with this guy he's already out on bail that's why I'm talking about this so he's walking around you know showing people his hidden parts and lighting lighting massive trees and on 6th Avenue on fire for fun because he's a crazy arsonist and he's already on bail because of New York City Bill is he's already walking the streets he's out how can anyone think that's a good idea Democrats Democrats they think it's a good idea they think this is something that makes sense now not they wouldn't necessarily focus on the specific case to make their point but these are the policies they've put in place this is what they've decided is the way forward and we all see this and say ah so this is why cities are having the problems there this is why you're less safe walking down the streets of name a city yeah released without bail the christmas tree arson suspect is classic this is this is what democrats do with their bad ideas their bad ideas have a real cost my friends it's not just a theoretical cost it's something that we need to be very aware of going forward so we also need to be aware of our obligation to those who fought for this country 20 years ago at this time this nation was still reeling from the worst terrorist attack to ever take place on american soil we lost 2,977 people on September 11th 2001 now in the face of horror brave americans responded many even stepped forward to enlist in our armed forces since then more than 7,000 us soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice those heroes were part of the war on terror america's response to 9 11 they fought for us but never came home the tunnel the towers foundation

their honor donate 11 dollars a month at t2t.org that's t the number two t.org tunnel to towers foundation does fantastic work all right latest on fauci the evil lab coat tyrant um here's the kind of thing you can expect dr fauci to say and this is not a surprise to me but you're getting a window into his mindset which is screw your freedoms do what i tell you we really have to get people vaccinated i mean i understand and we all understand how people do not like to be told what to do they want to make their own choice and their own free will i get that and i respect that but these are unusual times and you can't think only of yourself and your own personal opinion but you've got to think about your communal responsibility to get yourself in your family and indirectly then the community protected so i would prefer and we all would prefer that people would be voluntarily getting vaccinated but if they're not going to do that sometimes you've got to do things that are unpopular but that clearly supersede individual choices and are directed predominantly at the communal good at the communal good he says who gets to determine what the communal good is who gets to make that designation dr fauci who has allowed for a situation where you have children still this happened in portland there's video of it now who are eating in 30 40 degree weather outside sitting on overturned buckets separated from each other social distance like prison convicts because of the fear of covid because over anxious idiotic democrats by the way who run the school systems in major cities this is all the democrat thing this has now become a democrat identity issue the same way that climate change which no no reasonable person sits around thinking oh my god i need to change everything about how i live my life to lower my carbon footprint because otherwise the world won't no reasonable person actually thinks that that's that's not a thing but it becomes an issue of a secular faith it becomes an issue of religious belief for people who don't believe in religion and that's what's happened now with fauciism too fauciism has overtaken any sense of whether this is public policy that is justified when you add everything else in people just do things people mask up outside now alone still even after they've been told that's not really necessary even by fauci they still do it doesn't matter they can't turn it off they can't stop this is how they view it and that's not going to change so fauci's out there telling you uh yeah i like freedom but sorry times are tough do what we tell you and that's the way that he sees it um and Ted Cruz fortunately is out there pointing out to everybody that you know these vaccine mandates they're pushing they're illegal i mean the government is violating the law the federal government the Biden administration is violating law in the name of law it's awful what they are doing and here is an example of a Ted Cruz just laying it down the vaccine mandated is illegal it's unconstitutional and it's a grotesque abuse of power and i think Biden knows that i think the white house lawyers told Biden that this is illegal this will get struck out in the courts and cynically i think they made the decision to gram it through anyway assuming that litigation will take time will take months or years and in the meantime a whole lot of people will obey last night's vote was a really important vote we voted on rescinding Biden's vaccine mandate for private employers it passed with a bipartisan majority every republican and two democrats joined us he's right about how they're hoping to just ram this through before anyone even figures out what's going on he's right about that and that's the democrat plan here abuse power while you can deal with a fallout later shred the constitution when it's in front of you worry about letting somebody else patch it back up this is a pollen it's appalling what's going on right now and uh we're going to need to stop up and fight against this we really are all right now just one more thing here on the transgender swimmer um i you know that one of the things that makes me so upset about these issues of trans rights is that they really uh the left the authoritarian aggressive left uses the fact that you're a good person they use this against you right because they say just be just be kind to people just be accepting don't you want to like make people feel better why are you being so mean essentially and i'll tell you i mean through much of my life why are you being mean about something works very well with an entry point i oh gosh i'd be i don't want to be mean i hate being mean that's really what the left does with a lot of issues they certainly do with the transgender issue because what you should say when someone points that out or someone says that to you is i'm not being i'm not being mean i never say to say demeaning things to people or to mock them or certainly not to um harm them in any way but we're talking about policies and laws and rules and i refuse to be party to lies i keep saying it's the famous solzhenitsyn essay live not by lies don't let people make you live your life with lies all around you and that you have to affirm that you have to celebrate men and women are biologically different the left is trying this thing where they force you to bend the knee on something that is just not true and you shouldn't do it and we shouldn't say lea atlamis is a she lea thomas is a he lea thomas is a biological male x y chromosomes change your name fine your name is whatever you say your name is your gender is not whatever you say your your gender is it's not i can say i'm nine feet tall which would probably be even taller than i would want but i could say that that doesn't make it true now if i said that people mock me mean i might be having some kind of issues or maybe they would mock me but doesn't mean everyone else has to walk around saying buck is you know a human christmas tree he's nine feet tall no of course not makes no sense so that's what i would say friends about this live not by lies do not let them i do i care about and see double a swimming no do i think college athletics in general gets more focus than it should in the media yes but who cares that's not here or there certainly swimming but live not by lies that's what i that's just i'll end on that today with all of you thanks for being here with me and i look forward to talking all tomorrow shields high i have diabetes i'm at risk for
