    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show podcast. Tuesday edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show gets going right now. Everybody appreciate you being with us. Much to discuss as always. We've got is it going to be Trump Tuesday tonight? Is it going to actually happen? Is the man himself former president number 45? Is he going to make a big announcement? Very big. We're going to hear about it tonight. We'll see. I think it's scheduled for tonight or on eight or nine PM Eastern. There's a press conference of sorts tomorrow. A lago. So we'll obviously be talking about where that's all going. Republicans, as I speak to you, I believe are one seat from officially one seat from the House majority. Lauren Boberts win in Colorado. But if it come from behind situation there, we have had, I think it's important for everyone to hear this. We have had some very narrow contests in a few states that have in fact gone for the Republican even after some delays in the vote count. So we just have to make sure we're clear on all the facts everywhere. As we look at what the heck happened here, we got Lee Zeldin, who I think did as much as any individual for the Republicans to have a house majority here, the imminent house majority. He is Zeldin is reportedly considering a bid for chair of the Republican National Committee after his exceptional unsuccessful, but still exceptional run in the New York gubernatorial race, Mitch McConnell speaking of leadership, still planning to rush through that vote. And I have a feeling that he will continue to be Senate minority leader. I know it makes me sad. But it is what it is, as they say. Also, there was a pretty funny Elon Musk Twitter exchange where he got called out by one of his developers. You got to figure if you're a Twitter employee at this point, given what's going on over there, you might want to keep your head down, particularly when it comes to the over 100 million followers of the boss. When you say you don't know what you're talking about publicly, we'll tell you how that little Twitter exchange went here in just a few minutes. Also the New York Times admitting that puberty blockers for adolescents have some really negative consequences. Oh, wow. You mean the most obvious assessment imaginable, but one that we haven't been allowed to say out loud. Certainly they wouldn't say out loud before the election will discuss. But Clay, you know what I'm going to say, man. You know where I'm going here, buddy, because look, the house majority is a good thing. It's not all that we want it. But it's it's prevented total disaster in this election. It means that things are edging toward a better place, but carry Lake Clay lost the governor's race in Arizona as of last night. We had it on the show a lot compelling to so many people. What happened, my man? So there are two things that I would say stun me about this election. One, as we have discussed, is John Federman winning and winning by four and a half points in Pennsylvania in a manner that wasn't particularly close. That's stunned me. I'm also stunned that Carrie Lake lost. Now the margin is going to be around 20,000 votes. At least right now it is. But to me, if you are a Republican voter, you have to take a step back and think about this question. Democrats managed to elect the worst candidate that either party nominated for a statewide election, John Federman and Republican in an open seat and Republicans could not elect Carrie Lake, who I think was the best candidate who ran the best campaign of anyone for an open seat. And just to make it clear for open seat, I mean, non incumbent, right? And you've heard me talk about how much I love everything that Carrie Lake did. So if Democrats can elect the worst statewide candidate, which I think it's fair to say Buck, John Federman was based on his not only policies, but also his health. And if Republicans could not elect, these are in purple states and toss up states like Arizona and Pennsylvania, the best candidate that either party put forward, something is severely wrong with the way that we are running elections. Okay. Now I know a lot of people out there are going to say, well, the election was stolen. And certainly I understand that argument. If there is any evidence that is found that the election was stolen, we'll be the first to talk about it on this program. But what did we say for months on this show? We had to win outside the margin of error. We had to put it so unquestionably in the Republican camp. And we didn't do it. And there are Republicans listening to us right now in Arizona, according to the data that ended up voting for Democrats. And so when you look at the results that came out of these elections, Democrats were more loyal to their candidates than Republicans were to theirs. And so Buck, I think we have a lot of big questions to answer to discuss now. This is not a cataclysm, right? Basically every incumbent one election, there are incredible stories for Republicans. What happened in Florida is if I had told you four years ago that Ron DeSantis was going to win reelection by 20 points after he had won by 30,000 votes, none of you would have believed it. If I had told you that Lee Zaldin was going to nearly beat Kathy Hochl and that the reason why we were going to have a house majority was because so many Republicans in New York were going to come out and turn much of New York red. None of you would have believed me. If I had said that Brian Kemp was going to beat Stacey Abrams by eight points or that Beto was going to lose by double digits to Greg Abbott. There are a lot of really good stories out there. But ultimately, we won a narrow house majority and it looks like we're going to lose either one or have a draw depending on what happens in the runoff with Herschel Walker and the Reverend Raphael Warnock, despite the fact Buck that Joe Biden is the worst president of our lives. So this is a time to assess. This is a time to analyze. Go back and look at the proverbial game film and figure out what you need to do to win a landslide election in 24. I think one important story about politics right now in recent years that could illuminate the path forward here would be the situation of California from 2018. California obviously the ultimate blue stronghold, the most important Democrat state, but there are some red areas. I mean, we there are millions of Republicans who live in California. A whole bunch of them listened to this show got big audience in Los Angeles, big audience in San Diego. Good. So good point to bring that home buck. More people voted for Donald Trump in California in 2020 than Texas. Yeah, that stuns a lot of people. So while you won't win statewide right now with the numbers as they are, you can win individual congressional seats. 2018 was a people forget this Democrats. It was kind of not such a great night for them. And that had actually got better over time. Why? Because there were some places like California where they were already expanding a lot of these different voting provisions. And now in voting became a major focus of Democrats. Obviously 2020 supercharged this the COVID year. But Democrats were able to use tools to their advantage. Republicans. It's interesting. I was reading about this in the Orange County Register and hat tip, my friend, Kurt Schlichter and Mike Sernovich for putting this information out there. You see that there were Republican groups that took it upon themselves to do the things that Democrats had done in California. Meaning they're like, you know what, if they're going to do ballot harvesting, if they're going to do drop boxes, if they're going to remember encouraging people to do mail in, this is a simple numbers game. You tell everybody to show up to your party. And I mean, like a party, like a birthday party. If you say you got to show up on this day, I just had an engaging party, Clay. Sometimes, you know, someone gets COVID, someone gets a sore throat, someone can't make it. The kids got, you know, extra school stuff, whatever. Do you tell somebody, Hey, you can show up my party's 30 days long. You show up any day and that could that's considered showing up to my my party. That obviously is going to just help you from a pure yield perspective. So in California, they did some of this. And guess what the effect is? California and New York are going to be two states that even though they're very blue, gave us enough tightly contested Republican wins in Congress that were actually not in the nightmare position of losing or not having control of the house again, not not being able to take control of the house. So we have to look at some of the case studies here about, well, what would actually work? How would we win? Because the throw up your hands in despair and nothing matters. And if we get into election nihilism with, Oh my gosh, they, they cheat all the time. Well, we have to find ways to beat them even though they're cheating. I, you know, you, I, we can't retreat into our turtle shell and say, well, they cheat. We got to find ways to beat them or else what are we even doing? Getting out there and thinking this country isn't finished, which I refuse to ever believe this country is finished. We're going to take it back from these commies. I think that's an important point. Because what I am seeing in reaction, first of all, let's start here. Millions more people voted for Republicans than voted for Democrats so far in the tally. That's a pretty substantial swing. So another crazy staff for you, Buck, you're talking about California. It looks like Ron DeSantis is going to win Florida by more than Gavin Newsom wins California. I haven't seen very many people talk about this. Gavin Newsom's up around 17 or 18 right now in California. Ron DeSantis won by nearly 20 in Florida. That's pretty seismic. And so Donald Trump is going to announce tonight and the 2024 campaign is going to begin effectively in earnest. Some point in the near future, January, February, Joe Biden is going to have to decide, Hey, am I going to run or not? Both of us now think that he's going to run. And then we're basically going to be off and running. And some of the data points that we need to consider, and I'll talk about this a little bit when we come back, are what did we support that turned off persuadable voters? And how do we get those persuadable voters to break in our direction? Because one of the big surprises, in addition to me, that Republicans were not as loyal to their candidates as Democrats were. In other words, Republicans are more likely to split tickets. Independence broke for Democrats. How in the world did independence look around at the worst president of our life and make the decision, Hey, we need to support more of this. It's stunning to me. And so I think as we sort of sift through the returns and contemplate what took place across the nation, we're going to have the house. We're going to have a significant check on Joe Biden that effectively keeps him from getting very much done. I'd like to think we could still win in Georgia and basically put Joe Manchin in control of the United States Senate as fickle and unreliable as he may be. Did you see Buck just in the last couple of hours, it's been announced. One of the Republicans in West Virginia has announced that he's taken on Joe Manchin. So the 2024 Senate campaign has already begun in earnest. And Joe Manchin is going to have to make a decision because he's not winning. I mean, you talk about why why what happens with Herschel matters in a big way. There should be two easy pickups, I believe for Republicans in 2024. We should pick up Montana and we should pick up West Virginia. Now, there's many other states where we could run competitively in depending on how things go. But we should pick up two seats just by virtue of Montana's deep red and West Virginia is deep red. There's no reason that Democrats should be elected to represent those places. And so I think we're going to pick up to just by virtue of the map. And as we said, Democrats are going to have to defend a lot more. So this is a big deal as we start to think about it. But I want to share some data with you. We come back that is jumping out at me. We'll also open up phone lines, continue to allow you guys to react 800-282-2882. But I want to tell you about our friend Michael Endell at my pillow. He's the first person to tell you how appreciative he is of all of your support.

That is pretty incredible. Okay, so we don't officially have the word yet of the 218th house seat. But there are four seats right now that Republicans are leading in. Any one of which would be 218. I suspect that at some point today, we will officially know that Republicans have taken control of the house. This is important because it gives the Republicans in the house, the gavels, to be able to conduct the hearings to control the direction to control, frankly, some of the counter narrative coming out of the Biden White House. And Jim Jordan's office, I can confirm this report is true. Jim Jordan's office, they had a meeting. Congressman was on with us was it Monday, Friday, I think it was we had Jim Jordan on last week, Rand Paul, Senator Grassley, Senator Ron Johnson, Roger Marshall, and Comer, all of them senators in the meeting with Jim Jordan. And it was primarily focused on holding Dr. Fauci accountable for his lies and potential COVID investigations. Now, Rand Paul, I'm sure we need to get him on again soon. Unfortunately, Democrats are going to control the Senate. So Rand Paul will not control or be able to determine what is or is not the, what is or is or not the committee's hearings that they're going to be having. So, uh, in general, uh, as you break all of this down, a lot of this now is going to be in the control of the house buck. And this is one major impact. This is an important part of what house control can represent. Jim Jordan is going to be able, I hope, at some point, to make Dr. Fauci cry because he needs to be held accountable for all the lies that he has shared. And we're going to have real hearings, uh, on COVID, where COVID came from, all the cover up, all of the mandates, everything else. And they're already working in coordination. It sounds like the Senate and the house to ensure that those hearings take place. They'll have to take place now in the house. Hearings are a good thing when the Republicans are able to direct the subject matter in general. And I think it's necessary for us to have a full accounting of what happened during COVID. I, I would just admit now though, doesn't seem like people really care enough to vote on it. So that's just fortunately, unfortunately, right? I had, I had a, I had a hoped that our little trial run of authoritarianism. I, I had a hope that are, you know, 30 days of, or actually, I'm sorry, 18 months of free communism, uh, wasn't something during the COVID era that would go without political punishment. Uh, unfortunately it was largely, it was largely the case. I think that they were able, they were lucky in that, uh, we had gotten far enough away from that that people just wanted to move on. And there is this, uh, there's this mentality. A lot of people have it about a whole range of issues. When you've dealt with something that was really difficult, maybe even traumatic, your brain does want to move on. And we're seeing some of the implications of that. We've seen it in the last week or so with this election. People don't want to hear about the then they want to hear about the now. So while I liked it, there will be, I mean, no one will be more approving of Fauci sitting there and saying, I didn't say that thing. I said another thing at another time. And why are you being so mean to me? Rand Paul. I've never said anything so mean to you. Well, I think that'll be entertaining and worthwhile. It's not going to change the trajectory of political control in this country. And I would, I would remind everybody, Clay, I said this at the time when Obama won reelection in 2012 and I, it hurt me to say it, but I got a lot of heat. I said accountability for Benghazi just went out the window. Just so everybody knows there will. And there were a lot of hearings and a lot of people built careers on pounding the table over Benghazi. Nothing happened to anybody who was involved in that debacle politically or otherwise. The only thing that happened as we know is for brave Americans lost their lives and that whole night played out as it did. But in terms of accountability, there was none accountability for COVID. I'm very skeptical at this point. There will be any that doesn't, the China origins issue, I think we should find out just because we should know, hey, did this really come from a lab 100% because we need to think long and hard about what kind of research we're doing in these labs, right? But even with China, does anyone think that we're going to, what exactly are we, and not not a popular sentiment? I'm sure it. What exactly are we going to do about China's responsibility for the COVID virus? We've got that question. Honestly, we've done nothing to them. And I hope at this point, Buck, I think you're right. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a COVID reckoning over all of the lies. I there there already. I saw Bill Gates coming out and saying, well, we didn't really know that this only impacted the elderly. And it was, you know, the IFR, the fatality rate was somewhat similar to to flu. Yeah, we did. Yeah, we've known that whole time. All that data was out there. Buck and I were talking about it back in like May and June of 2020. And it was as if no one was allowed to actually discuss that data at this point, honestly, Buck, what I'm just hoping for is a historical record that eventually can be written about in the hopes, in the hopes that we will learn from the failure of COVID over time as the people who were responsible for that failure step off of the national stage. Maybe it'll be 50 years from now. We're going to have another pandemic, right? There is going to be this is going to occur at some point again. Hopefully it's the long after everybody who is listening to this show right now has passed. But I would just hope that our failures on this can be used in some way as a historical precedent in the future for what not to do. So if we look back at the IFR, the individual fatality rate for the Spanish influenza, which wasn't even really a flu and which didn't, as we know, start in Spain, it's just the Spanish press because of wartime regulations. The first World War were able to write about it. We believe it was started actually in a US military base. I think that's there's not a definitive, but that's where they think the first case of it happened. I think the IFR was 5%, something like that 5% of people who got that died. Now the I the IFR, there's different kinds of smallpox that have been the different versions of that virus out there. But in general, you're looking at about a 30%, which is why smallpox was the most devastating disease to humanity for many, many centuries of recorded history. But Clay, if we ever got to a point where we had an IFR of 2%, 3%, something like that, I think unfortunately, what we saw as one, our public health authorities are total morons, have absolutely worthless. And two, a lot of people would sit there and cheer while they took people off to quarantine camps. I mean, that's so so so to my point, I'm not saying we shouldn't do these hearings. I think it's essential because I'm more terrified about how psycho the left is in this country now because of COVID than I've ever been before about anything else. They would run the playbook again. And if we had a virus that wasn't really just a threat to the elderly and the immunocompromised, God help us, man, it would get ugly in this country. I don't think there's any doubt buck. And this is this is why I think having some form of reckoning, even if it's just a reckoning in the historical record, maybe it leads down the line, we end up with some prosecutions, maybe some people who are brought, uh, that charged with, with crimes. I don't know exactly how it's all going to play out. But here's what I do know. They would totally sweep this under the rug if we didn't have control of the house. So I just want a positive story out there for everyone to be cognizant of that the Senate and the Ron Johnson's and the Rand Paul's and the Roger Marshals of the world who have been standing up on many of these different COVID issues. They are now working with Jim Jordan on the house side to help I would presume whatever hearings he's going to be able to set up now that we're going to have the majority in the house. And I do think Buck, while we're upset that we didn't win the Senate, Joe Biden is going to take an a lot of punishment. Hunter Biden is the questions are going to be asked that are so important and it's going to be harder for the media to ignore them when the house has control of these hearings and is able to set the agenda, then it would be if Nancy Pelosi still had to gavel. You know, one thing we haven't talked about a little while, it pops up here and there. I saw Drudge had some headlines on it yesterday. Of course, I missed the old drudge. The new drudge doesn't get it done. But whether or not Trump may be facing some law fair effort from the Democrats. I mean, he's supposed to announce we started the show mentioning it's supposed to announce we believe tonight. It's a very big announcement. I mean, I don't know how at this point they could decide that that he's not announcing without it looking quite strange. So I'm assuming that you know, Trump is, you know, he marches to the beat of his own drum. Maybe who knows, but I think he's going to announce tonight, which would mean now that they're talking about possible indictment for the classified documents. Remember, remember, can I just point this out for a second? Like, because you know, it's fun to go back. Remember when there was that breathless headline in like August was like Trump had the nuclear secrets. Yes. All the nuclear secrets were under his bed under his pillow. Why is he such a monster? It's an imminent. And now you heard nothing about it after like a few days because it was obviously, you know, okay. So the guy kept like a letter from Kim Jong-un or something where he said, I mean, the whole thing is it was so crazy. And and that we it was so dishonest. But as we see, they don't care how dishonest it is. And that's why I think even though, as I say, this people like, fuck, they're not going to indict Trump over some documents. They just they just elected Federman for God's sakes. Look what's going on in this country. I actually think if they indict Trump, it's probably the best thing that could happen for Trump's campaign. I really do. I think many people would rally around Trump and I will just point this out. Okay. So Clay is leaving us there with with quite a tease because I think we might have lost connectivity to him for a second. And I would just say, I believe that the Libs are basically sitting around the Democrats are sitting around and assessing exactly that point about whether or not some form of law fair against Donald Trump, meaning using the law as a as a political weapon. Would it be to their advantage if they think it is to their advantage? So absolutely do it. There's no screw bills. There's no principle. They think they are literally saving democracy, saving democracy. So if they have to burn it down in order to save it, they're fine with it. The DOJ has to be the gasoline canister next to our democracy. And Merrick Garland has to have the match. They're fine with that. So we'll see. I put nothing past them. And I'm certainly these days, man, I to my credit, I always say nobody can predict the future. And I'm right about that. Nobody can predict the future. So we're assessing we're analyzing. And Clay will be back with us here in just a moment. But you know, one thing that Dr Fauci wants for all of you out there, especially for the men in the audience, it would be to your benefit if you have super low testosterone. So then you will listen, you will triple mask, you will get shots eight, nine, 10, maybe 15. That's the best shot you can get for the Roaner for the COVID. You don't want that you want to have energy endurance focus and drive that'll get you through every day. So tell Fauci's of the world to stuff it and boost your testosterone with my friends at chalk. Because you know, testosterone and the average guy in this country is down about 50% of the last 50 years grip strength is down. This is real stuff is really concerning because while they're constantly encouraging men to be more docile, don't be toxic and masculine. Got a lot of guys that are feeling like, hold on a second, I'm being undermined. They want me to just do as I'm told and be a part of the apparatus and not not actually feel like I have drive to get through every day. That's what testosterone and chalk supplements can do for you.

Third hour of the clay Travis N buck sex and show gets going right now. One thing that is a constant, as you all know, that the democrat corporate media lies to you all the time, constantly pushing an agenda. Journalism as a profession is something that people don't view the same way they used to. And that's a good thing because it really is warring propaganda machines out there. They're pushing agendas. They aren't bringing you just facts. You all know that. And I actually saw today that the most regretted above even gender studies and sociology and communications. There was some poll that was circulating some data out there this morning that the most regretted major was journalism because you know what journalism is reading and writing and communicating. You're not getting a leg up on everybody else by studying journalism in school. In fact, I even know people who have taught at top J schools journalism schools, and they will tell people quietly it's a waste of time and money don't do it. But the journals clay are relentless. They are true believers in their first of all, they're this really noxious combination of incredibly arrogant and condescending, but also deeply insecure and aware of the fact that they're all very replaceable. So it's it's a difficult personality type to handle to manage. But we have yet another instance of the fake news. Great term that President Trump gave us the fake news showing us what they're really all about. NBC News reporter Miguel Almaguer, I think that's right, was suspended over his now retracted Paul Pelosi story. So he reported, if we all remember the Paul Pelosi story that got so much attention. God was attacked. It was a vicious attack. But people were asking some questions. As I said, Clay, just on a security basis, how does this guy just walk into the home of? I mean, I would assume that Capitol police had cameras. They were there. They were asleep at the wheel. Not ask any questions, though. It was a right wing Trump supporter. They said that it's I mean, which this guy is just clearly completely out of his mind. But so Miguel Almaguer reported that Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul didn't let on that he was in danger when the police were at his home right away. And so there were some questions about this. And Clay, this is early stage reporting. I mean, think about all the reporting on something far more serious and horrific than this, like this shooting at you, Val day clearly, so much reporting that was completely wrong. Now, in this case, Almaguer, it's not believe he didn't fabricate it. This is just what was reported to him by either by law enforcement sources, I would assume at the time. And they are suspending it. I mean, he is getting and this is now public. He's getting an official punishment for this. And we all sit here and go, Oh, okay. So you upset the libs, you upset the Democrat narrative in some way, Clay, or make things even more difficult for a new cycle for them. And there are professional consequences. But you lie about Russia collusion for four years, you get a Pulitzer. That's where we are. Okay. And I would just point out they could easily have eliminated all of this uncertainty by releasing some of the body cam footage. The police officers have body cams on them. If they wanted to get the full story out there, they have the charges that they have brought against this guy. At some point, they could have just released the body cam footage. How often do you see body cam footage out there from police in tumultuous, controversial cases all the time? And your point on you, Val day is a great one. Everything that we were told initially on the you, Val day school shooting ended up being a lie, everything just about. And so every reporter got it wrong because they were lied to. It's really, really amazing. I mean, this was a today show report that they pulled off of the NBC website that they took completely down. And now they are castigating and chastising this reporter because he said something we still don't know 100% what the story is here because we haven't seen the full footage or the full details come out. They just he said something that upset the democrat party. And as a result, NBC news the same, we can't have this. Have you heard, it's just a good question for everybody out there. Have you heard of any journalist at NBC, CBS, ABC, Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC, CNN have any journalist been suspended for any Russia collusion report at all? You mentioned this, but I mean, just one, I haven't seen it publicly that anybody has been suspended. They got a number of things on this. They got the Russia think themselves rewards for fake legitimate fake news. And I just think this is instructive. I mean, it's all about the narrative. It's just service of the narrative. We all know it. It's very obvious. We have to keep hammering it though because you should not ever lull yourself into thinking or allow yourself to think, well, maybe the journos are going back toward the center and, you know, they've realized the air of their ways. Are you kidding me? I mean, President Trump is likely announcing his run for the presidency tonight, right? To be president for four more years. I've been saying this, as you know, Clay and everyone listening for quite some time, the media is just waiting for this. And then all the anti Trump machinery kicks right back into place, CNN's talking about the insurrection 24 seven. I mean, this, this is what many of them think they need really for for rating. So it's not like they've actually decided that what they did in the past was partisan, dishonest and wrong. But I will say on the upside of things, you do have this Elon Musk takeover of Twitter still playing out. There's a couple of bugs. You know, there's a couple of little issues here and there just as the site goes because Clay and I are both very active on it. And this may mean that we'll have a site that has true free speech and real free speech implications going into the next election cycle that we really didn't in this last one. And everyone I know I'm sure you've seen the same thing, Clay. All of a sudden, all these conservatives, you know, you're, you're engagements up 50%, your follower counts going up more than it has everything that we said about how they were throttling and it's all true. They were doing all kinds of shenanigans behind the scenes at Twitter. The psycho woke lives were playing every game they could to help their side and make it all seem like it was on the up and up. It's a free exchange of ideas site. But this is pretty amazing. Elon tweeted out, this was actually on November 13th, I'd like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing over 1000 poorly batch RPCs just to render a home timeline. Now, to be fair, I have no idea what that means. They were do I? Yeah, I mean, like, I'm not pretending to know about any of this stuff. I mean, I sometimes carry has to help me like switch from the smart TV to the old TV. You know, I'm not great at this stuff. People like you were in the CIA. I'm like, yeah, we had smart people who did that stuff in the CIA too. This guy though, Eric Fronofer responds to Elon Musk, who was his boss, apparently a Twitter. I have spent six years working on Twitter for Android and can say this is wrong. Gets 102,000 likes. And then some guy who goes by the moniker money nerd techie. Well, I think probably does know about this stuff. I have been a developer for 20 years and I can tell you as the domain expert here, you should inform your boss privately trying to one up him in public while he's trying to learn and be helpful makes you look like a spiteful self serving dev for developer. Mr. Eric Fronofer writes, maybe you should ask questions privately, maybe using slacker email. And then Elon just tweets in, he's fired. And he is, it turns out, messing with the richest man in the world who was also your boss and the new CEO of your company is a bad idea. Wokesters. I love this. Let me also just, I said this on Fox News earlier today, because we were talking about this story a little bit. You cannot believe that Elon Musk is going to have success at Twitter. But there are a lot of blue checks running around like, Oh, Elon Musk doesn't understand Twitter. He has no hope. This guy is better at spending rocket ships to space than NASA is. And he totally remade the way that we power cars. Both of those things. If you told me right now, Buck, like 20 years ago, hey, I think I can send rockets to space better than NASA cheaper, more efficiently, and I can return them. Most people would say that's a, that's a really tall order. And if you also said simultaneously, and while I'm doing that, I'm going to redesign cars so that we don't have to rely on gas and I'm going to electric power them and all these other things. A lot of people would say that's really difficult to do. Figuring out a social media app and configuring it and analyzing it and compared to that, compared to sending space rocket ships to space better than NASA and designing cars without the combustion engine. This is not very complicated. So I'm not sure whether the business of Twitter is going to be a success because I think there certainly bet you can place on that. But the idea that Elon Musk is not going to be able to understand the mechanics of Twitter, which this little software engineer developer, whoever he was, was sniping at Elon Musk. This is one of the most brilliant people on the planet. And he's already succeeded in literal rocket shipmaking. And also now in the car business by redesigning the combustion engine. I think he's probably going to be able to handle Twitter. I'm just placing my bet down on this guy can figure it out. I just also, you know, I don't do the hero worship thing, but I do live in reality. And I think when someone is the richest man on the planet, because they've done the things that you've laid out there, like maybe, maybe show a little respect, you know what I mean? Maybe don't be like, Oh, Mr. idiot, Elon doesn't know anything about the back end machinations of the I can't even know what you call this thing, the software. Once you start getting into computer science, I mean, it is a totally might as well be speaking Mandarin. I have no idea what's going on. I'm like you in terms of tech. I mean, I run a media company and we've got a lot of tech, obviously involved in that media company. I mean, when I want to watch Thursday night football on Amazon, I have to call in my wife or my kids to figure out how to get on Amazon streaming as opposed to traditional cable. Like I hate trying to find sporting events now on my television, because they're streamed so many different ways. But you know, I still think I'm going to tell you this now. I think I'm going to be able to beat my kids one day in video games. I feel like old school Nintendo got us very primed for this. I see everyone say they're all they're all digital native sorely mistaken. I think like FIFA 2035 is going to come out on PlayStation 19 or whatever. And I'm going to I'm going to be schooling my kids. I think that, you know, the gap is not as big as people say. I will say they have gotten me to play Fortnite against them. They've gotten me to try to do the Minecraft building. And I grew up on the I grew up on video games. Now you may have played video games longer than me, right? Because when I started having kids, like they got years of advantage on me like you, Matt, they use something called the pinball machine. That was the that was the state of the art. You know, when Clay was coming up the ranks, I'm real. I could beat him in tech mobile. You know, you want to play tech mobile. You want to play RBI baseball. You want to play. You want to play the old school Nintendo eight bit games. I'll wreck these kids. But but when it comes to the modern day Madden, they let dad have it pretty bad. Yeah. Well, there you have it. So I'm just I'm just saying that your prediction may may actually be if somebody if somebody gunned your head says greatest for you at the time, greatest video game that you ever played. What would it be? Tecmo Super Bowl greatest video game ever created. Um first one with 11 players like it's the best game ever. What are you Myers original civilization for me? Even though not a computer game? Yes. Very nerdy. You are best game ever was a computer game. It was amazing. Yeah. I used to play as Montezuma and then just end up nuking everybody. It was phenomenal. Blades of steel, baseball stars, RBI baseball, the original Tecmo Bowl, all of those would be in my contra back in the day. Remember, I love the contra video game. I also on N64, I remember the Golden Eye video game multiplayer. Oh, everybody played that was revolutionary in its time and Mario Kart. There were some people who would imbibe illegal substances and play the Mario Kart. You say Mario not Mario. Isn't it Mario? You say Mario? Well, you might have just you might have just caught me doing the weird pro. I might have just pulled the clay there with my pronunciation. No, I'm just isn't it Super Mario Brothers? You would say Super Mario Brothers. Is that the way you would I think it's I think you're right. I think it's Mario like it's Mario and Luigi, right? Is it Mario or Mario Lopez, for example, Mario Lopez? Yeah. So it's Mario. I think I don't know. Now you just caught me. Mr. Mr. Nevada. You just caught me. All right. There you go. Nevada. I got it right. I know. You've ended up people have noticed too are Nevada listeners are like, thank you Clay. Didn't help though. And although I guess Lombardo got the win, I would have liked to have been able to celebrate two wins. Laxalt is officially conceded, by the way, unfortunately. And so as we break these things down, you get a hit us with the read here. Yeah, absolutely. Rising inflation of volatile stock market wreaking havoc on retirement accounts.

Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. Buck, you mentioned this in the open. I want to make sure I remember to hit it. So there yesterday was a front page story in the New York Times about the dangers of transgender surgeries for minors and also puberty blockers. And it's a fascinating story that they finally acknowledged is a real issue. And it's a, you know, several thousand words story. But what I thought was intriguing was, and we made these analogies before and I wonder whether there's somebody like who's kind of a mole inside of the New York Times that thought to do this in the print edition. Yes, I'm an old man. I read the print newspaper. When you finished that article about the transgender, the surgeries and also the puberty blockers, there was an article about a 10 year old who got a tattoo. And in that article about a 10 year old who got a tattoo, they quoted several experts of saying, how in the world could any parent let their 10 year old get a tattoo? Kids who are that young don't have the ability to make life altering decisions. I'm paraphrasing yet. There were many experts in the article about the puberty blockers saying, well, if a 12 year old decides they don't want to go into puberty, we should definitely do it. And the overriding story here, Buck, was that when you get puberty blockers, your bones don't develop like they normally would. And many of these kids are facing osteoporosis issues where their bones are brittle because puberty is when many kids, I didn't know this, but your bones strengthen to a large degree to support you being able to handle an adult body. And many of these kids getting puberty blockers are having issues with their bone strength in addition to all the issues that might arise, obviously, from changing your gender while you're still under 18 years old. So there's something called body integrity identity disorder, which is when somebody wants to amputate a healthy limb. This is a real psychological condition. I believe it is still in the DSM. I think it is still something that the medical community, psychiatric medical community will, we'll talk about. There was a story class since we're discussing this yesterday in on vice, which is a very left wing so-called news organizations like a left wing blog. Trans people are seeking non binary bottom surgeries. Let's talk about that. We come back. I don't even know what that means. What does that even mean? Everybody will talk about this in just a moment. My friends, most business operators found their way to stamps.com end up thinking up thinking, why didn't I do this sooner?

First and foremost, one is that Kevin McCarthy, this is a reported by my friend, Henry Rogers from the Daily Caller, has won the GOP nomination at this stage for speaker in a 188 to 31 vote. And McCarthy will, according to Henry here, have a lot to do, still needs 218 supporters to win the floor vote on January 3rd. But it is looking like Kevin McCarthy will be speaker of the house. Another news item, perhaps just more of a follow up to our discussion yesterday on the situation in Ukraine, a senior US intelligence official, according to the Associated Press has confirmed that Russian missiles crossed into Poland, a NATO member and killed two people as in there was there are Russian missiles fired into Poland. I think people would assume that this was, you know, they were off target, essentially, this was accidental and acts a collateral damage issue. Assume I'm not sure that's the case. But when you have two Polish nationals killed on their own territory and it's a NATO country, I would just note, as Russia is losing, Russia will get more desperate and trying to come up with a way to off ramp all of this violence as soon as possible and end this conflict. I think should be that certainly the goal for the US I can't speak for Ukraine and the sentiments over there. But Clay, I raised this issue before or this this concept before we went into the break there and I wanted to address it with everybody now. Because while there was much discussion before the midterm election about issues like transgender indoctrination in schools, which they still want to do and drag queen, not just drag queen story hour, but these kind of drag queen strip shows in front of small children, you know, the dancing up on the polls or whatever all this stuff that goes on. It's weird. It's inappropriate. We all know this. Well, not everybody, but everyone listening to this knows that. And this was new. I had never heard of this before. And now I want to point out this is reported on vice, which is it's essentially like the the place for very far left wing hipsters with you know, this is like a very far left wing website. I'll put it to you that way. A lot of a lot of nose rings and blue hair and, you know, Black Lives Matter and announcing pronouns and get your six VAC shots. That's kind of the vice vibe. So it's their reporting on this. Trans people are seeking non binary bottom surgeries is the story here. Across the gender spectrum. I'm quoting everybody. Some patients are looking for mixed sets of genitals or none at all. And actually receiving this affirming care isn't easy. Okay. A couple things here, Clay, before I let you let you get into this situation. First of all, you can tell by the subhead here, the subhead line that the problem here is, oh my gosh, we're not letting people easily get mixed genital sets or no genital sets. I want to be clear in this article, they go into there are now transgender self identified individuals who want surgery to have both a penis and a vagina simultaneously because that is their gender identity journey. Or I'm not even sure which is, I mean, this, this, I think this is probably the more strange one to have all genitalia removed entirely and have only, you know, a urinary tract effectively in that area. This is a thing that is happening. And some doctors are being told by their patients that this is the surgery that they want. I would, I would wonder within the trans left wing activist community on what basis could this is their truth? On what basis will they tell them they can't do this? Yeah, this is all crazy. And my general belief is if you're over 18 years old and you want to make crazy choices for yourself, you can do it. I think it's unlikely to lead to you being happier. I think many of these people are psychologically broken and they feel like they need to take grave action in order to make themselves happy. And I suspect very often after all these surgeries, they think, Oh, if I just did this, I would be happy if I just fat and then they aren't, right? But this is next level crazy. This is just at some point, there is a difference between, I mean, the analogy on Halloween, which is if your kid dresses up like a Cowboys and Indians, then it's totally unacceptable. But if an adult decides that they want to change their gender and they demand that you use the pronouns of their choice, it's permissible. The line, I think Matt Walsh added in his, in his, what is a woman piece, which I thought was really good is you don't get to pick your adjectives, right? So take away the pronoun thing, like I'm going to share my pronouns with you or whatever else. But I don't get to say you can only refer to me as handsome. You can only refer to me as brilliant. You can only refer to me as a genius. Like, you, everybody out there can make their own determinations about how you see me or you or anyone else. This idea that you can demand your pronouns is crazy. And I don't know where the trans agenda goes, but it feels like many people increasingly are saying, Hey, you wanted to change your gender or whatever, but you, you, you've gone off the crazy train. So what would be fascinating to me? And remember, we can call this, and I do think this is mental illness. I'm not a doctor, but I would, I would make the argument as a lay person that that's what's going on here. That, that clay, what we, it keeps getting crazier and they don't stop. I think we need to be very cognizant of that, meaning that the more, you know, it was, Oh, just use my pronouns. And now it's, oh, I get to compete against the opposite gender and use their locker rooms or else you're a bigot. And the Biden administration, by the way, may go back to giving title nine protection to transgender athletes, which means the whole thing then is, is just a free for all for anybody who wants to compete against the other gender. You have people demanding that they are put in a woman's prison, even if they are a man with a penis, they just say, I'm a woman. So put me in the woman's prison. It keeps getting crazier. This is the nature of this movement of this situation. It never stops. And this is, oh, and I would say the most recent manifestation we have seen is the, we got to get the kids to do this. We got to get 12 year olds to take the puberty. No, that's the, that's. And now a level beyond that is individuals who are saying, I want to have no genitalia. I have a right to have a medical professional member. This is a serious surgery with all kinds of come. I mean, you're not, you know, this is not a, this is not growing your hair out and putting on lipstick. I mean, this is something you got to be put on general anesthesia. You got to have a surgeon, all this stuff. They want doctors to remove all genitals. So sort of like, you know, Ken and Barbie doll situation here, that is what they are demanding. And what's fascinating is that they're getting pushed back from within the trans community, according to this article for making it seem too crazy. That's what's so interesting. So finally, wokeness has now turned on wokeness and they're trying to figure out, can we make this next step happen? I'm going to tell you something. They're going to keep pushing this. You know what they tried for a look? There are a couple of articles. One thing they tried for a little while is, um, you are a bigot if you are a man who is not attracted to a trans female, because trans women are women. You're a bigot. They actually like Huffington Post had some articles about this. That didn't work. I think they're going to try this one next, which is that, Hey, if you want to have both sets, so to speak, it's fine. It's fine. And by the way, Joe Biden will have some influencer to the White House and they'll say, Oh God bless you. You know, you got the two sets. He's fine with this. The White House goes along with all of this. I just don't know where we go from here. I almost, by the way, clay almost flabbergasted with this one, which I've almost never seen. I can barely speak. I just, when you told me about this, like basically the way to think of it is like, if you've ever seen a Barbie doll or a kin doll, people are just wiping their entire genitals out. I don't even know. Like this is clearly psychological. Like they are like clearly, like mentally ill, right? Body identity, integrity disorder is something that the, that people that are critical of the trans agenda and activism have been bringing up for years because people realize that you're asking a surgeon to, I don't like my left arm, remove my left arm. That is essentially, you know, boiled down. What we're talking about here. This is that now, basically remove everything down there. This is body integrity identity disorder, which the trans activist community was always saying, well, we would, that's totally different. This is about living your truth. It's actually not that different. It's just crazy. And I don't know how we get back to not being crazy. Honestly, spend a lot of time thinking about that. We'll close out. Donald Trump is making his announcement tonight at nine. What do we hope that he says in this presidential announcement at Mar-a-Lago tonight at nine? Buck and I'll discuss. Certainly we'll be talking about it tomorrow as well. In the meantime, getting kids to read, not easy. If you have kids, and I do, I have found it to be very difficult at times to get them to read.
