    "text": " What is feminism in today's world? What is feminism in an era where some people refuse to define the word woman? Or when men like Dylan Mulvaney are encouraged to be women? It's all a little confusing. And we've been encouraged for a long time, or at least as long as I can remember, I'm 38 years old to be girl bosses, to go out to be CEOs, to put work ahead. Are we happier as a result of all of that? And why are nearly 70% of divorces initiated by women? What's behind all of this? We're going to talk to Dr. Carrie Gress. She has a doctorate of psychology. She is also the author of the new book, The End of Woman, how smashing the patriarchy has destroyed us. We're going to get into all of these questions with her. Get to the heart of what the left thinks feminism is, where it's driven us to, and why no one seems to be happier as a result of any of it. So stay tuned for Dr. Carrie Gress. Dr. Carrie Gress, I appreciate you taking the time to join the show. We are in a weird time in history. As a society, when we talk about feminism in an era where some refuse to define the word woman. Yeah, I think it's amazing time because it feels like there's no reason anymore. We were in this post-rational age where it all depends on what you're feeling and your emotions on things. This is what's really drew me out to draw this book called The End of Woman. How has it gone to this point where women are being raised in sports and we can't define what a woman is? At the same time, I don't think there's anyone out there who doesn't want to help women. I think that's our impression of feminism broadly speaking is isn't that how we help women. So I just really dug into it and just said, we have 200 years of feminist history. Let's pull out some of the threads and see what's going on. I think for me, what I really found that made the most sense out of the situation that we're in is the feminist question that's been asked from the very beginning but that's been reiterated over the generations is not how do we help women as women, but how do we help women become more like men because they saw that men had better and easier lives, especially because they didn't have the weight of their fertility or the vulnerability associated with it. And so that became the big question. And so even for 50 years, all of our lives, really, there's been this kind of idolization of the masculine and women have been pushed into that. I'm sure you heard growing up, you can compete with the boys and all that kind of attitude. And so what we're really seeing now is sort of the culmination of it because part of what happened in the 70s too was this big question about gender and this desire to really erase gender entirely. So that's where we're at. It's a culmination of it. It's just this idea of we can get rid of it. It's a social construct and we don't have to pay attention to biology. We can just go with what people are feeling and that that's going to inform our choices. So I think for those of us who still think that biology is important and there are two sexes, it feels really insane. But when you start really digging into all of the scholarship, you can just see that the crumbs are all there. And this is just what we ended up with. Yeah, I guess they went from trying to turn women into men to now turning men into women. Yes, it's like, excuse me if I'm confused. Exactly right. So kind of all this, the weird stuff too, like, we hate men in the patriarchy, there are oppressors, but we want to be just like men. And we want men to be just like us too. So it gets really confusing very, very quickly. And a lot of it is because of all of the psychobabble and a ton of Marxism and communist tropes are thrown into it. So yeah, I really look at feminism as sort of this gateway drug to what has led to the woke culture because of all of these places where we're supposed to see oppression and places where we're also supposed to see victimization. And I think that's what was really allowed things to run rampant is that we've given people the title of being a victim and then that victimhood has given them a kind of status, almost a bulletproof status where they can't be held accountable for their actions anymore. So yeah, it's kind of a mess, but it has a source really. That's a good way to put it. What's interesting is, you know, at least, you know, I'm 38, right? So throughout my generation, there's been this encouragement to be a girl boss, to, you know, career, career, career, to really prioritize career over a family. Why are we saying that? You know, what's the intent behind that? Huge, huge question. You know, and I'm older than you are. And it was really the same focus, I think. Part of it comes back to Betty Friedan, actually. It's really interesting. She, you know, published her book, The Feminine Mystique in 1963. Sold three million copies within the first few years. And it just is really remarkable when you start digging into her life. There's actually a whole book about it commenting about her connections to the Communist Party, because she actually always said she was just a housewife. She wasn't really interested in anything political or women's issues until the 50s. But there's significant evidence that she actually was much more involved in leftist projects. You know, her resume is just riddled with it. So she hit it very, very well. But she was very motivated by marks and angles and trying to, what she really believed, and actually there's a journal entry of her, she's quoting an angles quote about women. And she says, women can never fully be free until they're actively in the marketplace. At that point, motherhood wasn't considered of any kind of real production. That was the big thing. You had to be producing something. And children didn't count. So she, along with so many others, thought that that was the real goal, is how do we get women out of what she called the Comfortable Concentration Camp, which was the home. So that really forced women out. And, you know, I obviously work and I have an advanced degree and I have a problem with that. And a big problem has come in when in order to facilitate that ideology, you know, men and children have had to become the enemies and the home itself, really, of women. And I think that's where things really started getting off course was when that ideology really took hold and women were inspired by it because she wrote so well. She was a psychology major. And, you know, going back to that idea of victimhood, she just really, you know, rather than coming at it from a Marxist way, she came at it from an emotional way. She, you know, hit on those buttons that really get us to move, like a fear of missing out. That was one of them, you know, what are you missing out on when you're at home? And then of course, the other one is that victimization, you know, how awful your life is because you're at home. So that, I think that those are really, those ideas have been the drivers. And, you know, that the predominant culture and narrative has just really run with it and not really allowed any kind of straying from that. And so, you know, it's funny now to look around and see, especially with COVID, you know, how much things like sourdough bread and gardening and knitting and, you know, all these things are back in style, all these home making skills, even interior design. And yet that that idea of home making is still very taboo and, you know, not something that any women would say when she's in college, I just want to be a homemaker. You know, you just don't hear that very, with any kind of prevalence. It's still that push to career and, you know, focus on that avenue for making women happy. And of course, we're also saying it's not really making women happy. That's not, you know, showing statistically that women are increasing in happiness the more that they drive into their careers. Is the point to nuke the nuclear family? Yes. Yeah. That is it. That is the point because the nuclear family is what makes civilization strong. It's what creates the defense against the ideologies. And these are really, really about power and control. You can see it most, especially, I think, with the way that men are treated. And sadly, you know, it's been like Kryptonite. You know, no man wants to talk about feminism. And I do not blame them. I would not want to talk about. I don't even want to talk about feminism, much less, you know, as a man. They've been able to paint with a broad brush men as these oppressors. And so there's no way for them to really get out of that in a healthy and engaging way with other women. But yes, it's absolutely to destroy the nuclear family is really at the heart of it. I also think people don't want to talk about it because no one knows what the hell it means these days. That's why. You know, I think most guys are like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, I think you're like, I don't even know what's going on. It's so true. And also keep your head down and just keep moving. Like, don't talk to the feminists because you don't want to look at you, you know, sort of like the mean teacher in school. Like, just don't notice me. Yeah, I think that that is very true. And that's the other problem is that it's become, it means so many different things, again, with this idea of benevolence. But there were really three things about it that we can see throughout the last 200 years that are that stick out. Obviously, there are going to be other definite and I'll go into those three things in a second. But I think there are other ways to define feminism. It's just that nobody's really forced to do it. So people don't do it. And that's what creates so much confusion. But the three things that I found that were there from almost the very beginning were this commitment to free love, which of course, you know, goes right against monogamy in the family. The, the idea of smashing the patriarchy, which was this idea of kind of collapsing culture getting rid of things like any kind of hierarchy in the church or in the military. You know, all those gifts that men have had in spades and have built civilizations on, not to say that women can't do those things, but that's, that was the target that came right out of the French Revolution. And then the third piece was really the occult, which is just amazing. But if you look around at the culture today, you can see a kind of cropping up in all kinds of ways with different TV shows and movies that are out and music videos and, you know, books, whatnot. So those are the three things that I found to be sort of at the core of the movement from early 1800s to certainly up to today. And you know, I think those are the things that most of us just really don't want to be endorsing. So I think that's why we need to be more careful. If we're going to still call ourselves feminists, we need to be more specific about exactly what we mean, because it's all the terms are so loaded. You had mentioned that women are less happy today. Why do you think that is? Well, I mean, if you're going to take men and take your children and make them the enemy and then tell women that they need to be bitter and resentful, you know, I don't think anyone's going to be happy. That's sort of the push that we've gotten. And I think also it's just that this realization of just a job can only go so far. You know, you hear all these stories about these women that've given themselves over to their careers and then they get to 50, 60, 70 and they, you know, wonder what happened to their lives. Like this was not the life that they were promised or that they expected tragically. And yeah, I think that there's all kinds of reasons that are going into it. But it's again, this kind of pitting the sexes against one another, pitting these very tender, natural relationships like a mother to child and making them out to be something, you know, awful and as obstacles to art fulfillment instead of really avenues to it. I don't think it can do anything but make us unhappy because I think what we're trying to do is with feminism is tinker with human nature and human nature revolts. You know, it just says, look, you are not going to be happy in this tract that you currently have put yourself in because people told you to. So I think that has a lot to do with it is this pushing against human nature and trying to come up with different results when we're not seeing that that is happening. Let's take a quick commercial break more with Dr. Kerry Gress. Well, because to some degree, you know, men and women are inherently and biologically built differently and we're being taught to sort of deny these biological impulses and sort of our own human nature. And so, you know, it would make sense as to why that would make people unhappy. Yeah. Well, and I think too, you know, I've spent a lot of time just even thinking about what the vulnerability that is involved with fertility, I have five children and, you know, I have an amazing husband that allows us to have the life that we have with healthy, you know, children. We've been incredibly blessed. But there's something about, you know, being able to have that dynamic where you are in a situation where you can be vulnerable with someone. And obviously there are situations where there, there are just bad men, you know, there's just bad women too. And I think this is what motivates it and is the hard part is that people behave badly. But the way that we've tried to solve it isn't, you know, by helping people act more virtuously. It's been like, why don't we just dissolve all of it and then women don't have to deal with any of it. And I think that's really what that missing piece is, is we're made to be in relationship. We're made, you know, we're made to bring new life into the world and to sort of just cut those things off because there might be suffering. You know, that's not really a human answer. That's sort of a very superficial answer and very short-sighted answer because of course you're talking about the perpetuation of the species as well. So yeah, I think that is part of the problem too. I had read in one of the columns that you've written recently that nearly 70% of divorces are initiated by women. Why is that? You know, I think a lot of it is again, sort of this attitude of, you know, again, it goes back to the differences between men and women. And a lot of times, men are sort of blindsided by it because they think things are going just fine. And then women are asking for divorce because they are bored or they feel like they've moved on or they want more from their relationship. You know, there's all kinds of reasons, but it seems like women are encouraged to break out of something if they're unhappy. And look at the unhappiness must be in that situation instead of encouraged to say, maybe we need to work on this or whatnot. So yeah, I mean, if you look at, I think, pop culture too, you can sort of see the femoral in this of relationships, but it also is that almost kind of shopping mentality that we've sort of adopted about our relationships and something good better could be coming along. And viewing men through that kind of relationship in terms of what have you done for me lately and all of that. So I think it's a remarkable statistic and I think it's really sad because it tells you a lot too about, you know, just men feeling probably in a lot of respects just very out of control, especially when they are blindsided by this, you know, they thought their relationships were fine and they obviously weren't what they thought too. And of course, the children that are involved too is another tragic element. You know, it's also, you know, this is all being pushed through culture as well. I don't know if you saw the interview with the new Snow White Rachel Ziegler. I did. I want to play that clip real quick and then get your thoughts on the other side of it. The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so. But there is a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Yeah, weird, weird. So we didn't do that this time. So no prints or a different kind of prints. We have a different approach to what I'm sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because like we cast a guy in the movie and you burn up. Great dude. It's one of those things that I think everyone's going to have their assumptions about what it's actually going to be. But it's really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful. And whether or not she finds love along the way, is anybody's guess until 2024. All of Andrew scenes could get cut. Who knows? It's Hollywood, baby. So she's like, princes are terrible men are awful. All young girls hate men and you know, be afraid of them. And in the process of it, we're not going to get good men in this environment. I think that's what worries me the most. Yeah. I think that's an incredibly scary reality. The other interesting detail that has come out recently is that I think it's 12th grade boys that were interviewed that are actually becoming more conservative instead of more feminist minded, which is interesting. I'm not saying it's necessarily making them by default better men, but I think it shows that there's kind of this inherent detachment from what the women are thinking in a way that we you didn't see that in the boomer movement, you know, or even, you know, and beyond. It seemed like there was always this sense of like, we want to support the women, you know, look at Prince Harry and Meghan Margot. I mean, it's that kind of like he calls himself a feminist and all that kind of stuff. Like he's supporting Megan and all of that by using the language that she expects and things like that. But it seems like the younger generation is finally like, no, we're not doing that, which may or may not be healthy. But to have this sense though that this isolation is sort of mentality is I think what's also really scary too, that you know, that there's something creepy about romance in 1936, sort of heartbreaking. Like what has happened to dating and you know, all of those kinds of questions that you just feel really sorry for this generation and just all the things that are missed and all of those ways that you learn about other people, you learn about yourself, you learn a way to communicate. And the beautiful things that come from those relationships, you know, instead of just what it seems like now is become just such a hookup quick awkward, you know, that's that's I think the word I keep hearing the most is all these awkward relationships. Like people just don't have a sense of how to relate to other people. And so it ends up being awkward and everybody's just sort of like, well, let me just go back to texting, you know, kind of return to that instead of really dating someone and getting to know them and taking them out to dinner, you know, all those kinds of things. So yeah, it's it's there there's a lot to be worried about, I think for the future. Well, you know, I'm a millennial and I think in dating, even in my generation, you know, there's a real fear of marriage in a way that's very different than, you know, my parents got married and you know, when it was just that's what you do. That's what you did, you know, you wanted to get married. And, you know, so I don't know how you, you know, reshape that. And so I can't imagine if that's what's going on in my generation, what, you know, Gen Z looks like or, you know, no, I think that's and that's the hardest part is just again, this huge rift that's been placed between men and women and then sort of this wild card of, you know, you can be whatever, you know, me pan, you can, you know, all of this, all of these different options. And it seems like people are going, you know, trying them on. And, um, and that obviously can't be helping either when you can't even, you know, you're not even sure what, what you are. So yeah, it's, it's, it's really daunting. You know, and then now, you know, to add confusion to all of it, you've got kids being told that, you know, they're not the gender they're supposed to be that if you're a little boy, you can be a girl, if you're a little girl, you can be a little boy and just, you know, sewing, additional chaos. Uh, you know, why do you think there is this seemingly intentional push to sew additional chaos among children? I think that's a great question. It's, I think it's a very big question. And I think that so much of it has to do again with this idea of, of revolution and, and utopia and trying to sort of steering the United States to, um, you know, something that's supposedly better, this, this vision. Um, and yet all it is, is, is just is creating more discord. But what happens when you create discord is you need more government assistance. You need more government, you know, people, government has to be involved in your life. You know, that's, that there's that great word, biorogamy that was invented by Lionel Tiger, who also he's a psychologist, I think he came up with that term male bonding that, um, was popular, you know, a decade or so ago. Um, but biorogamy where, you know, a woman is basically married to this, the state. And even in the Obama administration, there was that, that woman, Julia, that they created, that, you know, she, her whole life, she was just taken care of by the government. It was her life. And, um, we're seeing that more and more, especially among the poor, uh, you know, marriage has become sort of a status symbol or something that, you know, people have to have a certain amount of money to be able to do instead of what it's typically been, which is, you know, something that was for all the classes. Um, so yeah, you can see this real centralization into the government because suddenly you have all these vulnerable women with children and they don't have the means to, to support them properly. And so rather than, you know, being married to the father of these children, they're just married to the state and don't really understand how to sort of get out of that. Um, but yeah, I think that it's, it's about, um, power being, you know, coming together in, in, in one place. It's also about, you know, that kind of destruction isn't, is kind of a road to nowhere. Um, and that's the part that they don't talk about is what the direction of which we're going and what it leads to. And I think, you know, look at San Francisco, this is kind of the perfect example. It's sort of the, um, the prototype of, of what we can expect because of all of these policies that are clearly not working with human nature, clearly not helping anybody. Um, and yet they just keep pushing from over and over again. And it just, it does create destruction. So it's one of those things where you're like, this doesn't even make sense on paper. But because it's been going on for so long, you sort of have to think, well, maybe there's really a lot more work. Um, you know, whether you want to go look at the spiritual battle part of it or more specifically even the governmental part of it. Um, and, and the consolidation of power. Um, so yeah, all those things I think come into play because it does literally does not make any sense of in terms of what they're trying to build. They're not building anything. They're just conch and continually just tearing and tearing and tearing things down. So children are the, the latest effort because they've been sort of left to hone up until now. It's like the more I think about it throughout this conversation, it's almost like the entire intention is to push people to believing that they are unfulfilled, that they're unhappy. You know, it's, it's to really to make people constantly yearn for, you know, this unfulfillment in life and try to seek things that aren't actually going to bring fulfillment. You know, it's, it's really just like all a facade to make people unhappy. I have this one part in the book where I talk about these, these queen bees that you can sort of imagine who they might be in the culture, um, that sort of rule over everything. And, and, you know, there, it has become sort of a quasi religion where the, the preaching is really about discontent, you know, how really, if you don't, if you don't start out discontent, well, they will sure as heck make you discontent. They will show you all the areas in which your life you want to be discontented by. Um, and that, that's, um, you know, just comes with the, the, the preaching and the narrative and what we hear over and over again. And so then as a result, you actually do actualize realities that are, are, that do create discontent. So it just gets worse. You know, you can just see it sort of like, um, snowballing and becoming almost this, you know, bigger and bigger because you started with this discontent that was small and then you are actually creating a reality that is more discontented and, you know, on and on quick break, stay with us. And the book is out now. It's called the end of woman. How smashing the patriarchy has destroyed us. Uh, why did you decide to write this book? You know, what, what kind of would encourage it? I mean, obviously a lot of the discussion we're having, but what kind of spurred it. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely that question of, of womanhood. I, I feel like we can't really, we don't, we don't have any way to actually speak of womanhood anymore. We don't have like the moral categories to think of women and a healthy way outside of what, um, you know, telling us to be like men or the girl boss or whatever. So that was one of the things, um, certainly, you know, I have a lot of sympathy for men. I think men have really been mistreated by feminism and I would love to say, I don't, I don't expect men to start fighting back because I don't think that's, that's the way in which they do things, but I would love to see them like rise the occasion and become better men because of it. And, um, and I think just helping men and women understand like why do we have so many of these struggles? Um, you know, and to help us realize like these are not new things. None of this is new. It's all been sort of sewn into the, to the culture because the ideology for, for a very long time. So I think being able to see it helps people significantly and be able to step out of it certainly in their own lives and in their kids lives and, um, you know, even in the workplace too. So all of that, I also, I don't think there's a book like this. I think that, um, you know, so many, even women who I respect a lot who do call themselves feminists that, you know, they usually say, well, the, the feminist problem started with the second wave. And, um, so that was the amazing thing was to go back and say, no, it's, it's a lot older than that. And, um, it's just been this, you know, it's been like a brand. It just keeps rebranding itself and cycling through and doing the exact same thing only, you know, a little bit worse each, each go around. Um, and I think we're on the edge of it at the next iteration of the brand. I think Barbie has really ushered that in. Um, I think that was part of the intention of the movie was to, to draw in new followers with the very clear signaling the patriarchy's bad and women bring order to everything and men are unnecessary. You know, there's, there's so much in that, that movie that, um, you know, my research laid bare. And I think that, um, you know, they dressed it up beautifully. They, it's, it's pink. It's nostalgic. It's, um, you know, it's, it has some tender moments in it. And I think that's what we are used to buying into without really realizing like there's a lot of real rot in that, that, that we need to just start rejecting outright. But, um, anyway, so hopefully people will be a little bit more aware of what it is that they're ingesting. And I'd love to see people, I'd love to see a conservative start making more films, um, being more involved in media, being, you know, fashion magazine, something like this with things that content that women absorb, because this is what the way that we've really been destroyed to is by allowing all of the media from the left to pop culture to be really taken over by the left. So I think that, that is one huge step and one huge area rather than thinking in fit of them is fluff. We could really make some great strides with without huge budgets, you know, even the movie sound of freedom. Um, obviously it's not a feminist film, but it's the kind of film that said I think could be made that, you know, people would really respond to. I agree with all that. And I'm fortunate because I have three brothers and a great dad. So, uh, I've never, I never, you know, even during all the me to stuff I never bought into the whole, uh, men are inherently evil somehow when, you know, women, women can be too. So, you know, that's great. It goes away. Exactly. Yeah. Dr. Kerry Gress. This is very interesting. Uh, the book sounds fascinating. I appreciate you taking the time and joining the show.
