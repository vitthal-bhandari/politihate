    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast second hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show is underway and this is Buck I'm gonna be solo today Clay taking some much deserve vacation time with the kids doing the dad stuff My main man clay will be back with us on Monday So looking forward to that and of course we've got that Huge news coming down today of Supreme Court decision. We'll get back into that a little bit also Much more coming your way on crime the Biden Democrat meltdown Senator Tubberville from Alabama will be joining us on the anniversary. I think of a 50th anniversary of Title IX So we've got much to discuss to be sure I want to thank WIO D Miami our wonderful I heart affiliate for hosting me down here. I am down in the great state of Florida It's very nice here. I gotta say you can feel you can feel the freedom just kind of wafting around like oh I feel so free here although New York My home state and of course I love all my WOR family My home state has just gotten a little injection of freedom today courtesy of this Supreme Court decision But this will not be a surprise to you The libs they are very upset by this they are not happy at all at the situation of the six three decision that says you need a a good cause That you have to show a need beyond just being a person who wants to defend himself to conceal carry a weapon just a review for everybody proper cause Law or proper cause as part of a may issue regime for concealed carry pistol permits unconstitutional in the states the six states and The six states were that is currently The case although not anymore so we'll discuss that but there are a lot of lives who are very upset about this Biden has said it's amazing to think that Biden was a lawyer although he was the absolute bottom of his class from Syracuse University Law School in you know 1650 or whenever he went there but he His legal analysis you would never think that he actually went to any law school nor had he ever practiced law And I really say this objectively I don't like it's such a cheap thing to denigrate the intelligence of someone you disagree with but I really do believe and it's Important because the commander in chief. I just think Biden's a dumb person now You could say oh, but he's president. How is that possible first of all Democrats the ones who say Trump is dumb Bush is dumb Bush the other one HWs, you know every Republican Reagan was dumb they say they're all dumb We're actually fair. I've said this to you before and I like to establish that I call balls and strikes on these things Barack Obama That ideas for policy a lot about him that you know And I don't think he was the you know the greatest genius in the history of the planet like Democrats do not dumb Not a dumb guy not fair to say that he's a dumb guy Joe Biden's dumb and When you hear him talking about and that was known among Democrats to even my Democrat Associates for years had said everyone just knows he's mister You know grin and shake the hand and just sort of say the thing and kiss the baby's head and his Irish charm I mean he's as Irish literally as Irish as I am I don't know what this is all about doesn't walk around saying buck has all this Irish charm well, maybe they do luck of the Irish but Biden says he's deeply Disappointed in this second amendment decision and it just says it goes against common sense Explain to me why explain the legal objection to this if you would right? That's what I want to hear Where did the six three majority air? Notice when we don't like a Supreme Court decision It's here's where as a matter of law they got it wrong when they the Democrats the left don't like a decision It's oh my gosh, I'm so And like like there's gonna be even more of the guns and the gun people and they're gonna just they're gonna be wearing their trucker hats and NASCAR t-shirts and going to the gun ranges and it's you know, that's they get very upset about this They could very there's a lot of liberal tears that are gonna be piling up. They're gonna be rivers of Lib tears flowing over this decision and you know if they could at least come up with an argument against it I would listen to it But they don't here is for example the mayor of Chicago and this will be our transition into Actual gun violence problems and how Democrats make it all worse a mayor of Chicago saying well She doesn't like this decision goes against common sense play it I just think it sends the wrong message and light of the fact that we hopefully are in the cause of the Senate taking final action on a bipartisan set of gun reforms that we've all been Lobbying for him frankly has overwhelming support in American public the fact that the court is coming down with this decision feels Tom death and I think I worry that it undermines the legitimacy of the court Particularly given the leak draft of the road decision and we're obviously anxious and concerned about what the depth of that Decision is going to be but I think like what it means is cities and states have to really lean into the things that we know that work tone deaf Think about this. It's as though the mayor of Chicago the third largest city in America Doesn't know what the job of the Supreme Court is it's not to take the political measurements of the time It's not to figure out what the elites want in any given moment or even To use their own judgment as justices for what the best policy is it is a matter of law and constitutionality tone deaf notice she even invokes the Republican sellout senators the sellout senators who decided to go along at this stage and give Biden a win that won't keep anyone Safer, but we'll just create additional ways to harass law abiding gun owners What was the what was the point of that again exactly why do these Republicans and if you live in a very red state You know if you live in Kentucky Mitch McConnell territory if you live and I can't even name all that you live in Missouri You live in Utah you live in Why are you voting for these individuals or at least please hold them to account now? They're hoping you'll forget about this because only I think two of them are up for Re-election of the Republican sellouts in this cycle. They're hoping that you won't remember what happened with this gun bill But notice life it says we're moving in that door. Oh you mean that that was just a step in the direction of further gun restriction and Confiscation this is going against the plan the Supreme Court decision. Don't you see? Now they'll they made big notes or they made a big deal in the dissent my sort of my or and brier and Kagan about how many people die of now they say gun violence a lot of it is actually Suicide's which I think is always it's of course very serious always need to be in a separate category from gun violence against other human beings And in terms of the criminal justice approach to these matters, right? But they'd they like to put those together because they want the numbers to be even even Higher to have more impact, but if we want to bring down gun violence, I have an idea an idea for Democrats like Lori Lightfoot the mayor of Chicago. I don't I don't mean this in general terms I have a fascinating you could say brilliant Approach I have this novel notion. I've come up with this mind-blowing strategy For how we the American people from cities to towns to rural counties can be Safer where there are Democrats running the police force and Democrats running the prosecutor's offices Prosecute crimes and enforce the law I know it's crazy and you can say you can say I'm just getting way too out there on the edge here But in my opinion, it would probably help us out if we stopped letting criminals go And I could even drill this down into I know you're sitting there saying wow buck you're you're a wild man with this stuff I know I know punish criminals stop Adjecting the law abiding because you disagree with their politics and you don't think that they should own guns under any circumstances and actually go after criminals because what they're doing is the opposite magazine limitations on rifles is meant to annoy tens of millions of Americans who have never broken any law and Just want to have their second amendment rights without infringement but Prohibited possessor laws in major cities people with multiple felony convictions who get caught with a loaded firearm on the street Do you think they might be a danger to the public? I think so But these das these progressive prosecutors these Democrats they find every way they can to Not charge them minimally charge them let them walk. Oh Yes friends. That's the game. They're playing right now. Why is that you'd say so they don't want you the law abiding to be armed But they also don't want to really punish the criminal element when they're armed And as men now there are obviously some gun prosecutions are all you know going on and all these jurisdictions But they're dismissing in Philadelphia half of prohibited possessor prosecutions dismissing the case outright Half of them does that sound right to anybody out there? Yeah, we know what's going on in Chicago Lori Lightfoot the mayor who's just presided over a disaster of crime and criminality there and we all know it She's terrible at her job. I've even had Democrats. I spoke to a Democrat Alderman in that city who said it's outrageous They just formalized and made permanent. They're no pursuit policy No foot pursuit by cops except under very specific circumstances now they'll point you well if it's a serious felony the cop can All right, but the policy is no foot pursuit So if you're a police officer and you see that one video, you know put up on the internet one video Even 15 seconds of it seized out of context can result not just in the end of your career But in the destruction of your life your incarceration the ruination of your reputation and your family What do we all think's gonna happen when cops have to make that and by the way? I'm not blaming the cops in this case. I'm saying they're gonna have to just look at the realities of being a police officer in Chicago You chase when maybe you shouldn't have chased even if the person committed a crime and then there's a a use of force exchange. Maybe you get sued. Maybe you lose your job. Maybe you go to prison This was all done because of two individuals who were shot Fleeing police both of whom had guns one of whom was firing the gun off into traffic as if that's not a threat of lethal incident right then and there oh But the the live media made a huge deal out of this. So now they made that policy in New York Just to get everybody really attuned to how crazy this is you can't go to the store on my corner as I've said to you so many times and by Really anything that could be resold easily without lock and key without an attendant coming over and They just want to slow down. They want to make it more annoying to steal that obviously doesn't even stop somebody from stealing You can just have the attendant come fill the bag or you have the the clerk come fill the bags up that you want to steal and then He's walk out and the police aren't gonna do anything about it This is true in every major city really now in the country with maybe a handful of exceptions New York New York Houston Los Angeles, maybe Houston's a little better you could tell me that but Los Angeles San Francisco Portland Seattle Chicago Atlanta you steal you're not gonna get much trouble with any trouble and if you want proof of it Here is the story of the New York Post a shop lifter with 122 arrests Was released on his own recognizance Yesterday thanks to the bail reform laws passed in New York My friends, I think it's fair to say that when you have Been arrested 120 times you're a criminal And there needs to be punishment and sure we could talk about rehabilitation. We can have all those discussions But you need to be taken off the streets Because you are creating an atmosphere of disorder and also praying upon your fellow human beings In a way that is unacceptable and for anyone who says oh, but but we can't we can't have cops What are they gonna do? They're gonna they're gonna arrest somebody for shoplifting? We're gonna wrestle them the ground you really want them to use the force of the state and of course there's so much of this that comes down to their claims of disproportionate impact against minorities minority men in particular and Therefore the enforcement of these laws that are universally applicable is somehow racist Is not true, but that's what they will say And all the while I'm just have to remind everybody we've gone through a time where democrats were fine With sending cops in to wrestle people to the ground to arrest them and humiliate them For failure to wear a mask on an airplane We have gone through a time where democrats were willing to arrest priests and rabbis Who wanted to have worship services, but all the states said no, of course a blatant violation Of the first amendment, you know best buy was open, but your church was closed Don't forget that these people that say oh, we don't want to use the force of the state. It's just stuff This is the aoc line. It's just things you shouldn't use state violence to protect property Oh, but they were willing to use state violence unjustly I might add for the stupidity of making people double mask or get the vaccine or you name it Oh, they are all too fond of using the force of the state when you've done nothing wrong But there are other people out there who can get arrested 122 times And they don't want the state to come down on them too harsh Too harsh a manner not not not acceptable to the libs today And that's why we have the disorder and that's why we have the misery in all these cities Come back to more of this in a second folks wane from kansas gave us a great testimonial about relief factor that I think a lot of people will relate to Relief factor which you've heard us talk about a lot on the show is a drug free alternative for managing chronic pain As wane writes he suffered from lower back pain for years after playing rugby and other contact sports for most of his life Wayne finally decided to try relief factor quick start, which is their three-week introductory program Amazingly his back pain was gone within a week created by doctors and perfected over 15 years of scientific research Relief factor contains four key ingredients that addresses pain in the hands knees hips neck and shoulders Hot spots where inflammation can wreak havoc hundreds of thousands of people have ordered relief factor and about 70 Percent of them have gone on to order more join the more than half a million and order the three-week quick start for only 1995 go to relief factor dot com or call 804 relief get the 1995 three-week quick start develop for you one more time. That's relief factor dot com or call 800 the number four relief Move more live more and enjoy your life more with relief I'm sorry this dark day has come they were supposed to go back to what was in place Since 1788 when the constitution United States americans ratified And I would like to point out in Supreme Court justices that the only weapons at the time were muskets I'm prepared to go back to muskets. I don't think they envision the high capacity assault weapon magazines intended for battlefields As being covered with it, but I guess we're just gonna have to disagree I don't like to be mean welcome back to clay and buck this is buck and that was the governor of new york Is she is she able to even read the constitution on her own? does she have the reading comprehension required I do wonder because That is the simple dumb the the single Dumbest argument that I think anyone ever makes around these issues, which is well, they only had muskets then So, you know when it comes to a free press like it doesn't include the inner webs Because the inner webs is not like a quill pan and ink and all the stuff that we used to protect You can't protect free speech on the inner webs. It's just for parchment paper the dumbest arguments imaginable made by the governor of new york my friends When I tell you these people are dumb. I don't say it for effect. I am observing reality And so they can be as upset as they wanted. Wow. Are they gonna be upset? I think if that decision from the supreme court comes down tomorrow on abortion as is expected It's gonna be a long weekend for a lot of lives Uh, we also have senator tommy tuberville joining us in just a few minutes here from the great state of alabama On the 50th anniversary of title nine and what the bide administration is planning to do on title nine Folks, this is gonna affect a lot certainly will affect your kids in schools your kids in the university So be sure to stay with us for that You know if your business has five or more employees and you managed to survive kovid You're eligible to receive a payroll tax rebate of $26,000 per employee.

I think in just a few minutes here He's running late doing senator stuff. So he's coming up here in a bit in the meantime the biden regime Like to call it. I really mostly call it that because it upsets the libs And that in itself there's a certain currency to just saying things that they go. You're not allowed to say that I think I am actually I think I am and so I will biden's having a rough time right now in all the polls that we can see and the new quinipiac poll has biden down 24 negative 24 with his spanix Uh, he's down negative 31 for uh white voters his advantage among black or rather his approval among black voters is plus 28, but That's those are all really Oh Historically bad numbers for a democrat president that certainly bad numbers At this uh stage and I think they they might want to Take a little messaging moment here because usually how it works is you have Democrats Uh who are all on the same sheet of music. We're all saying the same stuff. That's why you've been hearing recently You know a recession is not inevitable The recession is not inevitable. I mean It may not be inevitable, but it will be televised. We will see it. It will happen right? It's almost certainly Going to be the reality of what we face And I thought this was a particularly worthwhile Moment though because they don't have good talking points So you're going to have some people that Decide they're going to go on tv and they're they're hoping to advance the interests of the regime They call themselves a journalist. They call themselves Somebody who's uh unaffiliated Politically, they're just you know Journalists journos in the media Washington post columnist michael single terry Had a moment here that I think you should all hear because Price of gas very high inflation very high food prices skyrocketing And also baby formula shortage still going on folks They haven't addressed that they haven't fixed that still hard for a lot of people a lot of parents Across the country to find the baby formula that they need for their children Will this washing post columnist on msnbc wants you to know Stop whining. Okay. Stop all your complaining america play clip three There's a great deal of americans where it is uncomfortable that they're spending more but they are not going to go under You know, you you got to stop complaining When there's so many people who literally the inflation rate means they may only have two meals instead of three There are americans who did extremely well in the last two years in the market You still have your job and yeah, it's costing you more for gas But guess what you are still going to take that holiday that for for your live vacation You can still eat out So i'm going to need you to calm down and back off because it feeds into this fear And then this fear feeds into people making decisions that creates the very thing that they're fearful of Calm down stop looking at your portfolio Calm down americans who can't pay their bills right now can't afford their gas Can't pay their rent or their mortgage Can't find baby formula for their children Don't know what their economic future six months from now will be like if the current situation of not just inflation But likely stagflation and maybe recession Becomes all too real calm down bines doing a great job. What do you not see? Maybe if the american people weren't all just so silly in their thinking that bines economy is an awesome We've been a better place right now everyone get your act together You're going to see some of this You're going to see some democrats who say oh well some people are suffering but not most of you so shut up and just vote biden Oh Is that what the promise has become now the promise of the biden regime? It's not awful. So vote biden. It's not as bad as everyone says it is vote biden You still have food to eat peasants. Sorry. It's 20 or 30 more expensive So keep the democrats in power. Oh That's going to be quite a pitch Seems to be the way they're going with this though Also thought it was fascinating earlier on in the week when biden said You know Sorry, uh, oh wait actually we have it We have it here. I was hoping I was like do we have this one on our on our cut list today Biden defending himself saying yeah, okay prices are high the economy's crappy But you know what we're gonna do not stand up to pouten play clip 15 So For all those republics in congress criticized me today for high gas prices in america Are you now saying we were wrong to support you crayon? Are you saying we were wrong to stand up to pouten? Are you saying that we would rather have lower gas prices in america and poutens iron fist in euro? You know the ruble right now russian currency is that a seven-year high Russian economy seems to be just moving along, okay But our economy is taking a big hit you say oh because we have to stand up to pouten Okay, well, let's let's continue with this thread first of all the the The snide nature of the democrat commentary around this as if they're all out there on the front lines in the donbas Taken enemy artillery fire, please you put a Ukraine flag emoji up on your facebook page I stand with zalinsky give it give it a rest all right libs calm down start with that but beyond that like you're looking at the policy side of this more okay, uh is our support to Ukraine worth a recession in america Is supporting Ukraine with munitions worth a skyrocketing unemployment rate which along with that of course comes uh short and life expectancy massive increase in suicides and alcohol and drug use and an overdose and misery for millions of people destroyed futures and despair i'm just wondering what where do they actually you know there was a little story didn't get much attention about uh trying to stop Trying to stop imports from a piece of russian territory so essentially cut it off And this didn't get much attention because people are so focused on you know putting up their uh putting up their emojis with the ukraine flag on it but uh Colin ingrad I'm not even sure i'm saying it right which is a russian toehold in europe Could be cut off entirely from the outside world by Major well by the actions of poland essentially saying you're no longer we're going to cut you off So there's a little piece of russia That is effectively surrounded by non-russian territory lithelania uh stands between it and velarus poland borders it to the south So What happens if we cut off this territory? The russians would just allow that No one was even paying attention to this Blockaded it. What would happen? What lengths is biden willing to go to well No one even discusses it do they shut up we support ukraine they say oh yeah We should pay closer attention to that shouldn't we My friends switching gears here for sec.

How are you? I'm good sir I know you had a press conference with some other senators just a what about a little over an hour ago Talking about the 50th anniversary of title nine and what biden's regime plans to do to title nine Everybody needs to know about this total folks. What's going on? Well, what a great day it is for women and women's sports You know, it should be a big celebration. This today is the 50th anniversary of the Passing of title nine here in this building in the capital in washington dc probably the best piece of legislation Especially for women ever ever passed and uh, you know what it did It it gave equal equal opportunity for women as to men back in early days, but Uh before 1972 when it was passed you had three to five percent of the girl in high school that played women's sports Today you have close to 50 because of title nine and because the same funding that boys get they have to get for girls the same uh Number of sports that you have you have to have for girls Uh, it is it's been an amazing ride to watch Title nine how effective it's been for young women all across this country and and because of it Just a little item that i just heard 31 new women's sports were added since title nine to the olympics 31 and so it's had a huge impact but obviously You know the body administration they screwed everything else up so they might as well screw up title nine, which is uh Something that we're all who dearly to our heart Um, so this morning on the anniversary 50th anniversary of title nine Uh president body decided that he would add something to title nine that uh, he thinks would help title nine So what he did he changed the definition of sex Uh to gender identity Uh, you're not male or female. Uh, you can be what you want to be and they did this so Uh, young men would have the opportunity to participate against women in sports Uh, it's it's a shame in the last just a few years 22 Uh, biological boys planning women's sports have won 22 championships Uh, it's taken away opportunities for girls to compete for number one if they're going to compete in a lot of these sports now They're going to be competing for second third fourth place Uh, it's just an absolute shame and it's no common sense to this. You know the radical left Uh, they won't control of everything including, uh, the definition of sex. It's just amazing to me Uh, what i've seen over 50 years how far we've come and now we're going to take ourself back 50 years because the body administration wants power not only over you but also Uh, what you determine yourself and what sex you are speaking to senator tuberville of alabama uh senator it seems like what they're doing then would be a Through the interpretation that they're now taking as a federal matter of title nine codifying transgender athlete participation in sports As a civil rights issue is that is that where this is heading? Well, pretty much, uh, that's what they're saying. They want Everybody to have the same equal opportunity. They want they want equity. They don't want equality They want everybody to be the same no matter how hard you work now the problem is that you can't do that in sports Uh, everybody should have an opportunity to work hard Practice hard be dedicated learn learn leadership. You know the what women have had the opportunity to do in sports in the last 50 years learned to be in a leadership role. We have Um, a woman up here in the senate now that told me just today That i'm here today because i played high school or college sports because i learned how to deal with winning Losing how to deal with other people how to communicate It's just amazing the things that you know buck or what you learn in whether it's uh military team sports Anything that you do with other people Uh, but the body administration on their higher horse, uh, of course the progressive left is pushing this Uh, they want to give, uh, opportunities to transgender. Hey, i'm fine with that Give them their own category But do not allow boys to compete against girls because it is a no-brainer that they're bigger faster and stronger And you're going to have less uh, built less opportunities for girls to get scholarships and you're going to end up with uh, basically, uh Boys playing then in women's sports. It's not going to be women's sports. It's going to be transgender boys playing in women's sports It's absolutely, uh, insane of what the body administration of course they've ruined our economy our border or foreign relations Uh, they've taken away, you know the crime in the country is just rampant. They've ruined everything else So they just decided to ruin athletics while they're at it but senator toberville, how do they even Define who would be protected under a gender identity interpretation of title nine It seems like that that remains entirely unclear. I mean, because it's because it's so fluid When does the protection kick in and what standards to be let's say a trans athlete competing against women? Which the by administration supports How do those how does one even meet the designation that would then? qualify for protection under title nine do you know what i mean title nine is all based under women and men being different and discernible Exactly and you know the There's a lot of things that we're looking into this on but uh, some people with some of the democrats i've talked to said well, you know, which if if they're still a A female after 12 years old. We're not going to allow them to participate once they fit puberty uh, then uh But how do you determine that? I mean it's you know that you hear the science that they go by and everything to them is about science Of course they screwed up and everything made we did with with uh COVID, you know the pandemic because yes, yeah, covid so there they'll mess this up, but it's it's not about anything other than given the Opportunity for the far left to have power and control Over everything we're doing and now they're getting at the sports which a lot of people on both sides are going to be really really mad about this Let's celebrate celebrate women's sports and keep women's sports for women senator chubberville appreciate you joining from alabamis for thanks so much Thank you, but I got a break in news story free folks just came down Oh boy The feds have searched the home of jeffree clark a former trump d oj official Is all ties into the insurrection and january sixth I think we all know what's going on here intimidation tactics by the biden praetorian fbi We will get into this in just a moment"
