    "text": " What's up guys it's David Priscilla and this is the show for the real and sick about the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Today we're going to do something different, something that we've never done before, something that will either be really awesome or very mediocre. I guess we'll find out. Today we didn't have a format of a show to do. We just did Q and A.F. I got a full length tomorrow. I didn't really have anything that I had for real talk for you guys. So I walk into locker room and I say, hey DJ, let's record a show. I was half naked by the way. He was walking into the shower. I said, when you're done in the shower, we're going to record a show. He said, what's the show? What I say? Andy and DJ, cruise the Internet. Yeah, all right, I'll stay with me. All right, we're gonna brand that shit. Here we go. All right, so this is how this is how true innovation happens. Now it could be fucking horrible. It could be it could be amazing. We're going to find out more than likely. Yeah, probably is going to be amazing. Let's be honest. Now, before we get started on the show, I'd like to remind you of the fee. The fee is very simple. If it makes you think, if it makes you laugh, if it gives you a new perspective, if it delivers value, if it teaches you something, if you learn something, if you just think it's good shit, give us a share, man. You know, I could make a lot of money selling ads on this show. And I don't because I hate when I listen to other motherfucker show. And it's like 30 minutes of ads in a fucking 50 minute show. It's ridiculous, dude. And like, I appreciate you guys making all the money doing it. And maybe one day I'll regret doing it. But right now, we're going to do it my way. And my way is very simple. Straight value exchange. If you like the shit, help us out. If you don't like the shit, don't. And we're cool with that. So here's how I think the show should work. And then you let me know how you think it should work. And then you let me know that we're going to build the show right here. All right. So I got my dot live on the mic who is who's who's one of the main comedians here in the office. No cap. Yeah. All right. So we're going to redo that part. No, we're going to do so. All right. So here's how I think the show should go. I think the Q and A F model is working pretty well because it's raw. And there's a format to it, right? Like there's three everybody knows there's three things. And it's short somewhat. It's not fucking two hours, which like, you know, the two hour podcasts are good. You know, when we've got a lot of shit to discuss, right? But we don't always want to do two hours. We also want to keep some short, quick content for people to consume. And so what I'm thinking here is what we could do is you could just, when we're going to do these shows, all right, you have like three turn today current events, okay, that we're that we're going to like you're going to pull up on the screen. But I don't know what they are. Okay. You're going to decide what they are. And it could be it could be a fucking news clip. It could be whatever current events, all right. So you decide just like when you do the Q and A. So it comes out wrong, right? Got it. And then you throw the shit up on the screen. We watched the video kind of like how they do in Dear Deck show, but not like funny shit, where they get hurt, you know, Rob Dear Deck show. Ridiculousness. Okay, Rob's a good buddy of mine. So Rob, you inspired the show. So, but, but so we watched the video, right? And then we talk about the shit. All right. I know this is not a new concept, but it's new for us. All right. What do you think? Awesome. Let's go. You like you? Are you in? I'm fucking into. I'm in. All right, because usually you're critical. I'm critical. Yeah. Usually you tell me my shit kind of sucks. Hey, somebody has to. Yeah. Okay. And I listen, everybody's dude, one of my biggest criticisms is like, Oh, you're going to surround himself with yes people. No, I don't. I surround people who tell me the fucking truth. And if I suck, I want to know I suck. And my dad's biggest value here is that he tells me when I suck. So very rarely. Yeah, it's very, it is very rare. Let's be honest. And you are the most handsome guy I've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. So to see how this works, this is value exchange. Like I don't suck that much when I tell him how how pimp he is. So all right. So what? Do you like the idea? I don't know the idea is fucking gold, but I think all the shit about him is fucking trash. Okay. Is that all you're laughing at? All right. I thought you had something good pulled up. No, I was. Yeah. I'm looking. I'm looking. All right. So are we going to put this on YouTube? We're just going to put it on audio. We can do both. Okay. So do we have the ability to screen share our thing on YouTube? Yep. Okay. I'm sure no one better because our team is fucking fuck. That's we were just talking about this before we were live. We do have the best fucking team out there. Really? Like our talent's pretty shitty. I mean, I just made that joke story where I was making, but really our talent does suck. Our team just makes it seem like we don't suck. It's the truth. So I'm the Sam bro. I mean, I'm not trying to to their own home, but fucking toot, toot, man. I mean, we got pretty good fucking solids. Yeah. We got to go start going all in. We've been half-assing. I mean, hey, somebody's got to do it. Do you got the first thing? You know, I put you two on the spot, bro. No, it's not too on a spot. I just got to find the right source because I don't want people. Oh, this fucking, you know, extremist news and fucking, you know, I like extremist news. That's what I mentioned. Tucker Carlson comes on. I'm fucking all my, I put my fucking like, you know, I wrap myself in my Confederate flag and fucking run around my garage naked and holler. I mean, that's what the fuck they think we do, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what that's what that's what the domestic extremism is about, right? Like all these women at the fucking school meetings, you know, with their fucking bro, bro, I'm just here. They're all the is, you know, all the is, you know, the misogynist, racist, fucking white supremacist is this anything with the is there it dude? Look, I'm just here for the credit score, bro. Now that's fucking racist, bro. All right, let's talk about sleepy Joe, man. So there's a newest headline we got out. White House says it cannot guarantee holiday packages will arrive on time and they'd rush to address supply chain issues. Hmm. Hmm. What you got on that? Well, I mean, dude, I posted this in my story, like two weeks, three weeks ago, and people were like, Oh my God, you're an alarmist. You're you're crazy. You're conspiracy. Here we are, fucking two weeks later. And I did say in six weeks, some of your mother fuckers will be fighting over cans of beans. So we'll just see what happens. But yeah, that's a real issue. It's really happening. It's happening on purpose. It's intentional. And everybody should be pissed about it. And the fucked up thing is is like the fake news media, which is what the fuck they are. Okay. If you watch their headlines, scroll that headline so I see the whole thing there. This headline, no, it says White House says it cannot guarantee holiday packages will arrive on time amid rush to address supply chain. That that title is very, very benign, compared to what's actually probably going to happen. Okay. Everybody needs to be prepared. Everybody needs to have plans. Everybody needs to take care of their basic needs because there's a chance that things like regular food is going to be it's going to be very expensive or very hard to come by. And this is being done on purpose. And I don't think it should surprise anybody at this point in time. But some people still think that these people have our best interests in mind, which they don't. But you know, the one the headline they're using on CNN, bro, and the fake news is kids Christmas presents might not arrive on top bro. Listen, you got way bigger problems. They're trying to blame it on the Santa's Elfes and shit. Yeah. Oh, thank you, bro. They will be. This just comes around. That'd be fucking putting a Santa's Santa didn't do his job. You know what I'm saying? You think it's intentional or just incompetent? No, I think it's completely intentional. I just wanted to put this up for you. Yeah, you actually posted this on your stories just so you guys on YouTube can see this as well. That was the one I got yelled at about. This is the actual fucking crisis on our hands. Yeah. That was the one I got yelled at about by all the fucking parents. Yes, the blue hairs are pink hair. I mean, what? This is alarmist conspiracy. Yeah, but I mean, like, you know, everything in the grocery stores four times as much already. I mean, like these people. These ghosts are already started. These people are so fucking stupid. That's just the reality. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I offend you. But these people are so stupid and so ignorant to how things really work. It's almost it's beyond my comprehension. Like when you have Jen Saki on TV saying that it's absurd that if taxes in a business go up that the prices of goods go up and she meant it. You could watch it. Like that wasn't that wasn't her covering. That wasn't her trying to, you know, be strategic. That was her genuine reaction. Yeah. And you could tell, by the way, she said it. Oh, yeah. Well, you don't understand that concept. You are a literal fucking moron. Like you have no business talking about anything that has to do with our government. Yeah. And that's what we're dealing with. We're dealing with people who are stuck on idealism and and are they suffer from greed and they suffer from power thirst and they suffer from elitism. And these people will lie cheat and hurt you to to maintain their control over you and the benefits that they receive. And a lot of people think this is big some big evil shit. And I think it is evil. You know, but I think it's evil for the reason that these people are so selfish and so self centered and so fucking not give a fuck about the average American that they're willing to literally submarine everybody with the guarantee of more wealth for themselves when they're already the wealthiest people in this fucking country. Yeah. Well, here's something to my, I mean, I don't know if this is this is good scary, but this is CNN's website about the same supply chain issue. So they're actually yeah, but that's today that just came out. That's today. My slide was from weeks ago weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah. But so yeah, man. I mean, they're you know, it's real of us on CNN. Yeah. Well, you know, yeah, no shit. I listen, dude, I've been trying to help people with this for fucking how long, you know, and it's not fun saying I told you so at this point because everybody's going to suffer and it's ignorance, it's weakness, it's cowardice, it's, you know, it's all of these things. It's apathy. It's a, you know, willful ignorance. Yeah. All of these things wrapped in one that has become America and America is going to be punished for that attitude now. Yeah, very harshly. All of you who haven't spoken up or who have criticized people like me who try to tell the truth or who have denied that facts that are right in front of your fucking face. Now it's going to hurt you. And there and you can't be mad at the people who try to tell you because a lot of motherfuckers did. And now this shit's about to smack you right in the face real hard. And you know, I'm just kind of sitting back at this point like, yeah, you know, the alarm is fucking. I mean, motherfucker, I still see motherfuckers talking about dumb shit. Like we got Demi Lovato on list no, bro. It's funny, right? Yeah, we got Demi Lovato talking about shit fucking aliens be called ET or fucking aliens. ET or something. Motherfucker, you haven't, you are so out of touch. You have no idea what the fuck people are dealing with. And then we got social media influencers out there, you know, and I see this because I'm in that space, right? The personal development space, you know, they're totally out of touch to what the average person is dealing with right now. They're still posting, you know, all their wealth and all their shit and all and I'm just like, bro, do you understand that the people that are watching you are losing everything right now? You know what I'm saying? Like, there's so many tone death people right now to what's happening. And like, this whole time, I've been, I think almost a year ahead of the timeline. That's fair. And so that's what I feel like now. I feel like I'm just a year ahead. Like, I already see what's going to happen. I already see what is coming and I see people talking about this stupid shit, like his aliens, a derogatory term. Who the fuck is a fuck? Like, that's a whole problem with the society, bro. Everybody's turning this political correctness and they put that above everything else. They put that fucking value on being politically correct and non-offensive above the truth and above the facts. And the guess what? The truth and the fucking facts rule the mother fucking universe. And when you put other things in front of that and deny those things, those things come back to bite you in the mother fucking ass real hard. And that's what's getting ready to happen in America. That's the truth. Like, the fact that this is even on fucking TV is just a testament to how distracted our people are from what's actually happening in real life. So how could we fix the global supply chain? Oh, bro, you ain't fixing that. I don't think I'm sorry. I mean, that's my, you ain't fixing it. Yeah, you ain't, they don't want, they're not going to allow that to get fixed. You know, like when we talk about when we say that, like, call me the alarm, alarmist, but guess what? So it was fucking Paul Revere, right? They don't want that to be fixed. They want us to fucking have to find the fire. You wrote that line out at home. And like you were just waiting. Yeah, he did, dude. Was it good? It was good. I know. You know, he did too, didn't he? You wrote that shit down. He was just waiting to drop it in there. He was practicing in the shower earlier. Hey, that was a good one. It was good. Yeah. I mean, I'm saying, but fuck, I mean, Paul Revere wasn't alarming. You know what I'm saying? Like my point is they don't want the supply chain being fixed. Well, they want us to have the fucking fight over eggs and fucking water and then fucking gas. They've already put out that gas to heat your home. So we 54% more. They want that shit to happen. Yeah, because it's all distractions. You know, it's all fucking distractions. So I don't think there is a solution to that, bro. We have the fucking workers we have something has to be done. Well, I mean, you know, they're trying to. Here's what's going to have to happen, dude. People who have those jobs are going to have to get morally obligated to fucking go do those jobs, whether they get paid or not. There's going to have people volunteer. National guard should be called in but won't because of where these ports are and who's in charge, which is fucking bullshit. These people want to sink everything. They're intent on sinking everything about this country and whether what the reason is, is not clear yet. Okay, but nobody comes in and makes these kinds of moves without having the intention of literally destroying what America is about. And if you listen to Jen Psaki, she talks about it openly all the time. You know, the president believes that this is a time for fundamental economic change in this country. Yeah. And you know what that means? That means erasing the middle class and making them all fucking destitute depending on the government. That's what that means when she says that. Okay, so, you know, whether it's they're compromised by China or whatever the fuck comes out eventually in the wash. Because it will. It will. It'll come out on the wash. But the problem is, is I don't know that America will survive until that actually happens. I think these people are on a full court press to create the situation where they can grab all the fucking power away from the people forever so that there is no next time. What do you think about it? They're all fucking in like they're in. Oh no, they're in because the other flip side of them is that they don't they're not on this earth. Right. So that's why they're all in driving in hard, bro. Yes. So I don't think it's not going to change anytime soon. I'm very in. No, no, no, and they're going to continue to press and press and press until they try to eliminate, as I mentioned on previous podcasts, any sort of ideology opposition. So that's going to happen. And that's why they're doing these camps and they're disguising them as COVID fucking centers and shit. You know, when it comes time to eliminate that ideology, so convenient that we already have the places built for them to go. Like, dude, get the fuck out of here, man. Some of us are not morons. You know, some of us understand history. Some of us have read history. Some of us understand that it's not just happening in Germany, but it's happened a million fucking times over the court. Like the average intelligence of the fucking average American is, and I'm sorry to say this. And that makes me sound like cocksucker. I know it does. Oh, I'm sorry. That probably offends people to you, right? It's Peter's sucker. Yeah. Okay. And what's wrong with that? Like, that's, you know, for whatever, dude. I'm not playing a fucking games. You know, you can't, bro. Right. So, so, I know, I just think the average person, I just misjudged the average person. I think the average person is not, they have been indoctrinated into the system so fucking hard. And this explains a lot about my career and my life personally. You know, why I get so frustrated with personal development? Because you can't wake people up out of this fucking thing that they're in. This like, this way of thinking, this way that they've been taught to live and act and behave. It's extremely hard to get people to see that, like, if you just open your eyes and look outside, it's a completely different fucking world. And like, there are no actual limits when we live in a free society. And the reason you're not where you want to be is simply that you haven't taken certain actions. It's not all the shit that they're, that they pump into your head. You have to realize that they pump all this shit into your motherfucking head because they want you docile. They want you weak. They want you to not believe in yourself because if you don't believe yourself, you have to depend on them. That's what they want. And so like, you know, it should become more and more clear to society, to people in society, that we really do live in a sort of matrix. You know what I'm saying? So, and I've lived outside of my whole life. You know, I've never, I never bought into it. Like, when I was a kid, this is why I was terrible at school. When I was fucking in school, and you know, I know I wanted to be successful. And I sit there and ask myself, well, if I want to be successful, and I'm sitting here in college entrepreneurship, course, learning from someone who doesn't own a business who drives off in a 19 fucking 70 rust bucket piece of fuck. I'm, why am I learning from this person? So I'd ever bought into the matrix anyway. You know what I mean? So, but most people do. And the problem is, is you know, it's going to be a harsh reality when they wake up. The cool thing is, Hollywood's lost all credibility, no one is about anybody, anything they said. Here's the dangerous thing though. I believe for a big part of the population, traditional hospitals and medical care have also lost all credibility. Right. I think people are going to be very hesitant to use our public health care system if they can afford other alternatives. So that creates an opportunity for the medical community that wants to create a new way. But, you know, we'll see what happens. All right. So that was my good to say one or two. No, that's just I think that's still one. Okay, so one. And I think it's safe to say one for one or one for one. Wait, no, since we're designing the show on the fly, are we allowed to cross reference fucking sayings? I don't think so. I think that's got to stay on the other show. Okay, so check Mark. Yeah. How about this? Verifine. I got a new one for you. What this? Yeah. That means like, hey, put a new fucking story on. Yeah. Okay, that's a perfect transition. Like let's move the fuck on. Yeah, yeah, I got you. Got you. Okay. Next, next one. And oh, I saw that. Yeah. William Shatner, TV's Captain Kurt blast into space. Dude, you know, what's fucked up, man? Like this was the fucking story. This was the story that they were talking about. I saw that I saw him come out. I saw him swipe his ID into the thing. You know, I saw him ring the bell. I saw that I saw that 400 times today. Yeah. But we're not talking about how like the average family is going to have a hard time paying their fucking bills and getting food on the table literally in fucking weeks. I mean, that's fucked up, bro. Yeah. If that doesn't link credibility to what we were just talking about a minute ago, I don't know what does. Yeah, I mean, it's yeah. I don't know. There's a little disdain when when it comes like, I don't know, I see this shit, man. And like you do you think about these like fucking, you know, billion billion, the elite shit, right? Like the fucking lines with Jeff Bezos, man. And you and you just wonder, man, like it probably cost how much would you say it costs to send send me? He's looking up. I don't know. I'm sure just that fucking space through the long cost a little extra. Okay. Like that should be on me. You definitely been doing 75 hard. He ain't been doing 75 hard. Okay. I've been doing 75 soft. Yeah. Yeah. Like the amount of money that that was spent to get him and those people up in space, could that have been used to help fix the supply chain issue? Could have been used, you know what I'm saying? Like, listen, I love capitalism. I understand. Hey, I do too, but there's ethical capital. There's fucking ethical. Like there has to be, bro. Yeah, there has to be. And that's what we're like, bro, the elitist in this country, don't believe in that. That's all shit they preach. They point the finger at that at people like me or people that are, you know, in that area, as the rich people, we're not the rich people, mother fucker. Those motherfuckers are the rich people and they don't pay any tax and they don't do shit for you. And then they come in and say all this shit and then go on TV and blast their shit into space, bro. Yeah. I don't know. It does put a fucking sour taste in my mouth. It does, man. It definitely does. I sure as fuck no, like in this, this is just reality. I'm not for cancel culture. Unfortunately, I believe we're at a point where if we don't spend our dollars, where companies are in line with our beliefs, we're going to sink society. And I think it's important that people do that now. And I don't believe in cancel shit. Like all this shit, you know, bringing back fucking emails from 30 fucking years ago and shit. I go on and on. But the point is, I think it probably put a bad taste in everybody's mouth. And that's another thing I was talking about. These people are tone deaf. They're out of touch, bro. You know, so I don't know. Let me just show you two the games that I would feel completely different if like Amazon or these other big companies, all of them paid the full tax rate tax. Yeah. Like if they paid the full tax rate tax and they were still doing this shit, dude, I'd be like, fuck, that's awesome. But the problem is is they don't, they preach one thing, they do another. And you know, they created this amazing information platform of the internet, where we can all talk about it now. So they kind of fuck themselves. You know, because they used to be able to do this shit and go on TV and tell us what they wanted us to know. But now they can't because information travels too fast. Yeah. Yeah. I just think about like on a normal scale, like for normal fucking people, right? Like we think about competing, right? Like, Oh, I'm going to get a better house than you, right? Or I'm going to drive a better car than you. These motherfuckers are competing about fucking space. Like how, you know what I'm saying? That's just some elite level shit, man. It's just like, yeah. And I think it would be awesome if they all paid their fucking fair share. Because like the pay the fair share thing is a misdirected talk point. Yeah. No, no, for sure. 10% of the population, guys, 10% of the population, the US population, 10% it was responsible for over 75% of the tax is generating this company. Yeah. And that's the millionaires, not the billionaires. No. Yeah. That's the fucking millionaires. That's the people that are worth less than a billion. The people that are worth more than a billion typically don't pay any tax or close to any or have a fucking negative tax rate. Yeah. That go looking to that shift. You don't think that's fucking true. Go look at Amazon's tech rate. It's negative. But yeah, I don't know, man. There was a lot of other fucking big shit going on today. And this definitely took a fucking price. I mean, it's not, you know, I mean, don't you believe it? I mean, don't you guys believe by now that they put a lot of this shit in the news just to keep the eyes off what's really going on? Oh, for sure. I mean, that's what I fucking see. Would you guys ever go into space? I pro I don't know. Probably not. I would. I don't do that shit, bro. Is that why people shit? That's why people shit, man. Hot air balloons. No, I don't do it in that shit. Not doing it. Fucking storm chasing. Not doing. I would do that. Not not doing it. Yeah. Fucking going into space. Not doing it, bro. Not for me. Yeah. I don't think so either, man. Oh, cruise ships. Learn my lesson. Not doing it. Dude, you think they're fucking you think they're fucking you think they're fake going into space to try it because there's so many people starting to believe in that flat earth shit. Mm. Because like, dude, why are they putting these, why all the sudden these motherfuckers go into space that are the richest dudes on earth and shit? Like, like when they're saying, and then there's definitely a high propensity, like high possibility of dying. Well, no, no, but what I'm saying is there's so many people, there's like a lot of people out there right now saying flat earth shit. You know what I'm saying? So like, maybe they're trying to squash those like those people's dreams. You know what I'm saying? I mean, for real, dude, like, like they try to control the narrative with all kinds of shit. Yeah. I don't know, man. I'm yeah, I don't know about that, but I'm definitely not going to space. So I we neither. Yeah, I don't know about that. I got better shit to do like lay on my couch. Like there's plenty of other. Yeah, I think there'll be a lot. I can I'll get high. Yeah, I ain't getting that high. No, no, I don't want to see my house. No, no. Yeah, I'm spaces. That's fine. Completely fine. All right, next one. And this might, uh, guys, if you guys haven't heard about this one, I highly highly suggest you do some research on this one. Oh, man, London County responds after that says school district tried to conceal Dardis bathroom assault. Yeah. So back story on this a little bit. So this father, uh, this father here, apparently his daughter was sexually assaulted in the high school bathroom by a young man that was wearing a dress and identified as trans gender fluid gender fluid. Yes. Okay. So he could change anytime at any time. That's his right. He went into the bathroom sexually assaulted this young girl. He didn't just sexually assault her. Raped her. Raped her. Yeah. I mean, there the, uh, forcible, filletio, forcible sodomy. Correct. And so it wasn't like he went in there and like cop to feel guys, like you all like to think, then after that, they trained the school board covered it up. They transferred him to another school and he did the same shit again to another teenage girl. Nah, you know the smoke. No, bro. This is bullshit. This is this is a fucking byproduct of, of you guys tolerating this nonsense. That's what this is a product of. Yeah. Everybody wants to be politically correct. Everybody wants to fucking, you know, pretend like they're just moral fucking, nobody wants to be the bad guy. Well, guess what? I'll be the bad guy. That's fucking wrong. It's fucked up. Yeah. What else did they cover up to? Well, I mean, that just opens up the doors. It's the same thing with like the Gabriel Geip situation, the, the socialist, Marxist, teacher in California or whatever, you know, that how many other teachers are in that school? I'm just saying. And also like who the fuck didn't see that coming? You know, when we try, when this shit all came out a few years ago, when it started to be like men in the women's restroom and all this shit with trans going in the restroom, and that was the big thing. And you have target building out new restrooms and all these big corporations jumping on this fucking shit. You know, there was a lot of people who stood up and said, Hey, that's not a good idea. There was a lot of, and guess what those people got called fucking bigots, fucking, homophobes, transophobes, race, they got called every name in the book to silence them. And now here we have this. And how much more of this has happened that we don't fucking hear about it, because it doesn't happen to creep out and get loud enough to get on the, the, the TV for the mainstream media, which we all know, is it telling us all the shit? You know, so like this, this fucking really makes me angry. And it should make everybody angry. You know, we have all these crazy laws and like I've said a hundred times, this is not anti-trans. Okay, if you're an adult, and you want to be trans, and that's how you will choose to live, I have no problem with that. In fact, you should have every single right and you should not be discriminated at all. You should be treated like a normal human. There's no question. You shouldn't be getting made fun of. You know, I'm not with that shit, all that stuff with making fun of these adult people who do this. Now, if you say dumb shit, we're going to make funny it because you're dumb. But I don't really give a fuck if you decide you want to be trans. But here's the deal, you're 0.5% of the population, and we're, we're bending the entire logical rule system of a functioning society around this. And the reason that we are has nothing to do with trans people. It has to do with the weakening of the American social structure so that eventually there's no morals, there's no fucking rules, and there's complete chaos amongst the people. That's what this is about. But people don't understand the subversion that's happening right now. So they think it's most fucking responsible trans people and most gay people are not these rainbow style activists trying to jam this shit into every crevice of society. Most reasonable people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or how they want to live, or their gender identity, understand that this is a bad thing for it to happen. I get it in my DMs constantly, gay or trans people hitting me up being like, look, dude, here's the problem. Most of us are think normal shit, and we've got these people creeping in under this cause that are trying to push this crazy shit and they're making all of us look bad. So that sounds, I don't know, I don't know what to think about this other than like, dude, yeah, what the fuck do you expect? If you allow a teenage boy to say, hey, at any given time, I'm trans or I'm gender fluid and I can change my whatever. If you're going to allow those people to go to a fucking girl's locker room or a girl's bathroom, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? There's a shit ton of perverted bad people out there, men and women. Okay, so what do you think is going to happen? I don't know what to say, man. People are too afraid to say what I just said. That's why it's happening. And now our fucking teenage girls are getting fucking raped. That should make every single fucking responsible adult no matter what your political beliefs are furious because it's wrong. Yeah, man, this hurts, man. That girl has the fucking live with that whole fucking life. Her family has to live with that whole because people didn't want to stand up and tell the truth. Any reasonable human knows that it's not a good idea to let teenage boys go in the fucking girl's locker room or girls bathroom. And if you don't think that, you literally shouldn't be able to participate in society because you're fucking stupid. 100%. Yeah. Yeah, man. Fuck, I feel for the other man. You know what it is. It's what I said in my fucking story today, bro. It's apathy. It's weakness. It's ignorance. It's fucking cowardice. And it's wanting to go along with the fucking whatever the pop thing is. And they've social pressured our society into this. And that should make every single American fucking furious. And that's not a fucking partisan opinion. That's a human opinion. We're allowing our young girls to be vulnerable to fucking shit. Right. Yeah, this this was stuff, man. But uh, yeah, fuck man, I don't even know how to move on. I Yeah. I mean, what about what were you going to Hey, what are you going to do when Ryan's fucking 16, bro? Bro. And all the boys are allowed in their fucking bathroom because these fuckers on the school board will fucking allow it. Yeah, yeah. See, this is why I tell these parents that they should be in the school board and get involved. That's why I'm telling you to get involved. Well, I mean, that's the other part though. He did go to the school board and they fucking had them arrested. Not only to have them arrested, bro, they swept the story under the fucking rut. Yeah, there's a whole bunch to this story. There's a lot to it. Yeah. I can't believe it hit mainstream media. To be honest, I guarantee you this is happening. This is not this is not the only case. It's not a one off. No, fuck no. Yep. Yep. Well, fuck man, that's it's not three for three. That's something else. But it takes marks. Verified. I thought you're going to put some funny shit up on the screen. I can put some funny shit up. Yeah. I think we probably should have known a fucking light note, right? Yeah. I mean, like, dude, that was some serious shit. You had to get me all fired up. I'm in a good mood. Now I want to go beat the fuck out of this fucking kid. And, and you know, like, I just don't understand how that's not common sense. Is that not common sense? No, that's one of those. Like, no, bro, like, because it makes me feel alone. Like how the fuck how the fuck is this allowed in society? They don't want to hurt each other's feelings. So they allow a girl to get her fucking whole life ruined. That's their logic. And how many other girls are there? Probably a bunch. I think there probably is too, bro. You know, it's this ideal. It's all comes back to that idealism, bro. Oh, people are good. People are nice. Everybody wants to get a look. No, dude. We got to get some fucking people who deliver, who decide to make laws and govern our our government, our country with facts. That's what we need. Not this fucking feeling shit. Because this is where it leads us. Dave Chappelle spoke on it, spoke on it on his last comedy special. I watched it. That's pretty good. DJ swash it. But I pissed everybody off. So I'm sure it's hilarious. Netflix and they didn't take it off yet. Yeah, good. So they said they wouldn't. They fucking store it. You know, the rapper, the baby. Yeah. So he shot and killed somebody at Walmart. I saw that. And nobody said anything. But as soon as he said something about the trans community, he is like whole career, he got, he got taken off, I think like 14 to 15 different shows. Lava Palooza thing. What do you say? Something about something basically to the effect of about AIDS and gay people and how like if you're gay, you shouldn't be here because you got AIDS or some shit like that. Pretty bad. Okay. Pretty bad. But cool. That's feelings. He said that recently. Yeah. He said it at a performance like in during his fucking, okay, cool. Bro, you know what though? Like, here's the thing. Just don't buy a shit anymore. Yeah. If you don't like a shit, don't buy a shit. You don't like what he says. Don't buy what he says. It, man. You know, like this shit, we're like, we like like the Gruden thing, right? Like John Gruden. Okay. Like, like, dude, like, here's how this conversation went, by the way. DJ came in and I go, did you see the Gruden thing? And he's like, yeah. He goes, what do you think? I said, I don't know. Like, that's pretty fucking bad, dude. Like, like, I could see why he got fired. Yeah. And what do you say? I know, I said, I said, I think it's fine, man. Like, at the end of the day, people can grow, people can move forward, people can move past that shit. His own teammates supported him. Right. They had his, the entire fucking team had his back. Look, bro, if we get to a point, if we're, listen, here's the problem I have with it. Like what he said was pretty fucking bad. Okay. Especially the lips thing. Like that shit was fucking racist as fuck. Okay. Let's be real. I thought it was funny, but yeah. Okay. I'll get it. Yeah. But it was, but you still shouldn't say those things. Yeah. Okay. Like, I don't know. Maybe you should. I don't fucking know. Here's the point that I have a problem with. Yeah. All right. Here's the point I have a problem with. Are we really going to, we're going to go back on everybody's last 15 years of life and we're going to fucking edit their whole life. And we're going to fucking decide who has a job and who doesn't based off of that, because I'm going to tell you motherfucker something. None of you motherfuckers would have jobs. And that's the problem with the world right now. That's the entire fucking problem. Everybody's fucking perfect except the guy who got caught. It's fucking bullshit. It is bullshit. And like, I'm talking about any of these motherfuckers to say anything they want. Like, dude, if you say fucking something that offends a fucking group of people, then you suffer the consequences when they don't buy your shit no more. Right. Okay. But like this thing. And then you learn your lesson. Yeah. But this thing where like, we remove people from society completely. Yeah. Like, this is fucking absurd. It is. And the people who are fucking doing are the most guilty of the shit. Like, you all motherfuckers that are on the news and the media that create these shit storms. You guys got the longest list of fucking bullshit. One day it's going to come out. Then like, and for everybody else, like I, I played football, no, you play football. You got to see those miked up things, man. Like, if you only knew half the shit, those fucking, you guys see what they, you should see what they added out. That's what I'm saying. Like, how do you fucking game is on average three hours and you're telling me they only got fucking a minute and 30 seconds of a fucking clip. No, that's only shit they could air bullshit. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, I mean, like, dude, listen, nobody's fucking perfect. You know what's fucked up? Everybody that's going along with that fucking nose. What you just said. Yeah. It's like this big fucking everybody's so fucking scared to be called something now that they won't fucking say come to the defense of anybody. And like, look, dude, if Gruden worked for me and he said that shit, I find him. Yeah. All right. That's just me. But I don't think he should be removed or looked at as like a piece of shit for. I don't, you know what, dude, I don't even know if I should say that. I don't know if I would fire him. It was fucking 10 years ago. Right. I would certainly have a conversation with him and say, Hey, what the fuck was that? Yeah. You know, well, and that's a point though, man. You had his current players make public statements and hey, listen, I've been around him for the last three years. I've never felt any type of way about him. I've never felt like, you know, like none of that actually bro now that I'm thinking about, I probably wouldn't fire him. Oh, I mean, like, because like, because like, dude, that would be hypocritical of me to even buy into that at all. Like the truth is, is like, I would ask him and then I would evaluate what I'd know of him and see if I think those things are congruent. And then I would make a decision, you know, but I don't know him in real life. So I can't speak to that. But like, this, I don't know this idea that like, people use words from 15 years ago or 10 years ago or whatever. And that's, I don't know, man, like I just feel like that's, I feel like that's the shit that's got us to this point where we can't even fucking talk. We can't even have conversations. Otherwise, we're labeled fucking literally terrorists. So like, it makes me think that there's something deeper there. Like, there's some other shit that's good that's going on. No, no, no, I'm not saying you mean in this situation, we're grood. Yeah. What do you mean? Because I mean, he was also starting to make some more pro American stuff criticized the president. Oh, I think there was plenty of other shit. Yeah, I think there was plenty of other shit that like, that's just what they had to get them on. You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I don't know, man. You know, like take out the slurs, his opinions of those people were correct. Yeah. I mean, you know, not you take out the slurs, like, I don't like, I think Roger Goodell's a spineless fucking dude. I think so too. So it's fucking Joe Biden. I think so too. Yeah. And that's what he said. And he also made comments about, you know, these coaches that are allowing the players to kneel during the national anthem. He criticized that. Well, he criticized the NFL drafting a gay player. Should the NFL, should the NFL pressure some pressure a team to like, I'm not saying that's what happened. But the guy who, the guy in question didn't make it in the NFL. Right. Okay. So Gruden said that they had the NFL pressure them into hiring a to drafting a player just because of you's gay. Because he was gay. Is that, should that be happening? Nope. I mean, that's what I'm saying. Like, look, I'm just saying there's two sides in this fucking story. You know what I'm saying? And like, you know, I mean, really think about that. Like, that's kind of where why we are, where we are in the world. You know, these things kind of all link together, bro, because like, we, we have Gruden right there saying that the NFL shouldn't pressure teams to draft people based on their, no, we shouldn't be hiring people for that or firing people for that. Yeah. We shouldn't be, just like, dude, we shouldn't be doing any of that. Like, we shouldn't be fucking promoting people because they're a certain skin color or a certain gender or a certain this or that just for optics. We should, this should, this is America, dude. Like, if you're fucking skilled, you should move forward. And nothing should fuck with that. Everybody should have that opportunity. But when you start getting preference to opportunity on based on things like that, that's not right either. No, it's not. Yeah. Like I said, here's my other thing too. Like, like, what really pushed this because they've went through 650,000 emails. Oh, it was definitely 10 years ago, bro. This is, this is definitely probably has to do with his political something deeper. And I mean, the, I mean, the, even the owner of the, uh, the writers, he didn't, he didn't have a comment. He should actually NFL. They have all the answers. I mean, like, there's definitely something deeper there. I don't know. I think, I think, well, at the NFL pressure to team, uh, to draft a player based on his sexual orientation, do you think they would pressure a team to fire a coach because it was political beliefs? 1000%. 1000%. I think that's a reasonable question. Yeah. I don't know. I just think it's bullshit. And I think it goes to say when it comes to the cancel culture, uh, cancel culture shit, you know, guys, if you just stand on your shit, nobody can really mess with you. Yeah. You know, I think, cause we were tech. Bro, and the truth is too, like on the racist shit that he said, you know, if that comes out, like that, that's on that, the owner should be on him to repair that reputation. Yeah, for sure. Owners should be on him to repair the relationships that were damaged from that coming out. Right. But I think there's also, it's an important to, to, to differentiate a racist statement and a racist person, right? Or what you would think would be a racist thing. Because at the end of the day, John Gruden helped a shit ton of black people. Yeah. Shit ton of black athletes. All idle. I don't have to point. You know what I'm saying? It's like, is he racist? No. Can he can, can, can a non racist person say something that offends people? It happens all the fucking time. Sure. Yeah. And it happens all the time behind closed doors, which nobody wants to fucking admit. We were just talking about this in the fucking bro. We got, we got guys from all different backgrounds sitting in this room. And we were talking about before the show even started, how all of our fucking grandparents used to say racist shit. Yeah. And that's the fucking story that's not told, right? Like how fucking racist older, like it's all you old motherfuckers that are fucking racist. It is. Now, are you like us, like the people who were like 50 and under and shit, like we all get the fuck along. It's all you all like it's, you know, like when like you were saying like the like the old black lady you say, yeah, yeah, I mean, but fuck that's still me, Ma, you know what I'm saying? But like, we just know me, Ma got some issues. Yeah. Like bro, that's it. Until we start being honest about like really what happens in fucking, you know, and literally, like we were talking about how the American Native Americans, bro, you know, they could be in tribes that were fucking 10 miles apart. We're literally the same exact fucking human, the same fucking everything. And they're killing each other because they think they're different. You know, happened in fucking Rwanda, happened in fucking Bosnia, happened in fucking like, bro, we're all human. All of us young motherfuckers, we understand this shit. It's all these old fucking crusty fucks up in Washington. They keep pushing this shit through the media and pushing this shit on us, making us believe that that shit is actually true when it isn't. Right. Fuck man. Dude, I'm sorry. I just don't know. I don't like, I don't know. Like, I'm we're in Missouri, bro. Like we're in the place where they they believe that KKK is like burning crusty shit. You know, I ain't never fucking seen it. No, you know, I just told me we were roasted s'mores. But that's a big marshmallow stick you got there, bro. No, but dude, like, I mean, it doesn't happen, man. Like this, like the smores uniform. Yeah, I mean, I'm like, damn, okay, chef hats. I get it. Yeah, I got a chef hat you've seen it, you know, but like, those crazy these dudes, they had their own uniform just for just for s'mores, man. I'm like, these s'mores are gonna be fucking wet. Let's get it. But do I mean, the reality is, dude, like, you know, here I am, I'm a 26 year old black dude and born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. And I've never seen it. I've never encountered it. You know, they care issue. Okay, but that's separate, right? But like, but that's real shit. You know, I'm not that snout with these people. Think when they, you know, they, yeah, like they think Mississippi burning, you know what I'm saying? But yeah, like, I do, that's not it, man. There's just not it, man. It's time to kill. Awesome. It's great movies, great movies. Time to kill the fucking great. James Bond. Huh? James Bond. No, no, no, bro. That's Jesus Christ. Yeah, that's a expansion. No, bro. It's fucking a do from Pulp Fiction. John Shavolt. No, the other one black dude. Samuel L. Jackson. Isn't it? Yeah. Samuel Jackson and, uh, yeah, no, Matthew McConaughey is missive burning. Oh, wait, no, no, he's time to kill. Yeah. Samuel L. Jackson. Samuel Bullock Senate too, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Samuel Bullock, John Grisman. Yeah. And, and, uh, McConaughey. And McConaughey, yeah. And then fucking, uh, Samuel Jackson, right? Yep. Yeah. That's a fucking great movie. And double ACP image award, outstanding motion picture. It really is. It's a great movie. Great fucking movie, you know, but, but guys, that shouldn't happen. It just not happen. Yeah. Now did it? Sure. Was it happening fucking 60 years ago? Maybe. Sure. Cool. But not in 2021. Not at all. Not happening, you know. I mean, we're not saying like it, shit don't ever happen. It isn't racially motivated. Sure. I mean, like, dude, like those dudes down there in Atlanta that shot that kid that they said was fucking stealing. Yeah. That was fucking racist. That's racist. Yeah. Sure. Those are pieces of shit. And guess what? They're going to get there. They are. And they just happens every fucking time. I was fucking bullshit. I watched the video so I could see like, there's no reason, you don't shoot a fucking on on person no matter what color fucking skin they are. It's just a fucked up deal. Yeah. You know, but, but this man, I just want the shit to die. I don't know. And when I say I'm on the show, I got this racism like to the, I broke, we're at a point now where we're having to create our own fucking racist situations that happen. You know what I'm saying? Like you got kids in school, black kids, writing graffiti on the wall, you know, and you got fucking, you know, ladies down in, I believe it was Georgia terrorizing the entire fucking black community putting swastika stickers on the fucking walls and shit. You know, we have to create like we're at a point now where there's literally there's so little racism out there. Wait, what? The second one? The second there's a woman. I believe her name was Tenisha. It's the first one you're talking about what happened here in St. Louis. Multiple times. Yeah. Happens. I mean, it happens all over the country, right? But I know it happened five times here within the last two years. We're talking about there was a black student who wrote racial slurs in the bathroom. And then they created a big walk out like protesting around it. And then if it was found out later that the person that created it was actually black. Correct. That was another situation. I believe my name was Tenisha. I forget the last name, but this Oh, here it is right here for 11 months black families in up in an Atlanta suburb with terrorized with letters from someone saying that they were the white KKK member who will burn the houses and kill them after an extensive investigation police charge to Risha Lewis, Lucas, a black woman. You know what I'm saying? Like there's so little fucking racism happening. Well, look, dude. Yeah, but like just like we say, there's bad people. That's just a bad person. Oh, agree. I don't mean all black people are fucking racist. No, not at all. Yeah. Not where my point is. But the logic they use on the other side, the other way is is that yes, yes. And also I just the way I look at it, man, like they're so little, they're so little bad. Should actually happen. Then we have to fucking create it. We have to we have to create it ourselves. And like, I mean, that if that doesn't say something right there, well, we should start standing up for that shit. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like calling it for what it is not letting these fuckers manipulate our minds with these bullshit narratives, you know, and start looking at the other side of the of the story because dude, these fuckers are intent on getting everybody to hate each other forever, right? Like irreparable chaos. And remember, they benefit from it. Yeah. Everybody's looking at the stock market and they say, oh, the stock market's up. Economy's doing great. That's how your economy you dumb fuck. That's fucking their economy. Exactly. Your economy is your local fucking grocer, your local restaurant, your local business that can't get fucking supplies to make the goods that that you create so that you can get paid. That's your local economy. Your local economy fucking sucks right now. Yeah, their economy is get yeah, like you're celebrating that. What you're really celebrating there, bro, is them getting rich as fuck and you getting porous fuck. You know what I'm saying? That's real people are too fucking stupid to understand that. Yeah. And they think because they got fucking 50 grand in the fucking stock market that that still isn't true or 100 grand or whatever mother fucker, you're you and they're them. Yeah. That's it. All right. Can we do one last little thing? I don't know how what we're doing on time. Okay. So we got to keep these next time, I think under 30 minutes. I agree. All right. So we'll do one more just because this is fun. Yeah. But from now on, I think 30 minutes will be the time limit on this show. I got an idea on it. So we do three main headlines and then we do a segment called two thumbs up. And this could be like the, you know, finish. Good shit. All right. But but if it sucks, it's two thumbs in the butt. Who's but but British man visits 51 pubs in 24 hours for Guinness World Record. I think that's two thumbs up there. Well, what determines the world record though? Because like if you just walked in, you have to have had a fucking whole beer at each bar. Right. I think he's a boy. Yeah, it is. At least 4.2 ounces. That's a small beer. Right. Yeah. What's a beer? Six ounce or eight. 16. No, that's a fucking tall boy is a 16. And it was at 24. I have no idea. 12 ounces of fucking beer. So he had to drink one third of a bounce. Yeah. He had to drink one third of a beer. I don't think that fucking counts. You don't think that's too. No, that's like a shot. That's like a big swallow of a shot. Well, hold on. Let's do the math though. So how many 51 in eight hours? So wait, hold on, do this math. So what's 4.2 times 51? Divided by 12. That's 17.85. 17. Yeah. So he drank 17 beers and eight hours. Then he shipped, bro. Yeah. Any shit. There's two thumbs in the book. Okay. I like it. I like it. I like it. Yeah. This is two thumbs in the book. I don't like two thumbs in my book. It's fucking fake news. But I like it. Fake news. Huh. If I still drank, I could fucking demolish it. No shit. Well, I call up Guinness, bro. We have to set this up after 75. That's some bullshit. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Your trash, bro. Trash. I don't care. Unless we were we fucking the math up? I don't think right. 4.2 ounces of any beverage. That could be a fucking soda. Bro, this is definitely two thumbs in the book. I don't know, man. That's just bullshit. See, this is fucking the news, dude. This is the fucking, this is what they've been doing to us for the last two years. There it is. The fucking fake news. Yeah. Motherfucker, repass a headline. Do your research. Yeah. I got it. Did I pull it up? I'm like, holy shit, man. This guy must be from Missouri. Yeah. And then, yeah. We ain't got nothing on the Irish, bro. I was in Europe one time, and I met these Irish dudes that were like from Ireland. Well, actually, like, we're like, they drank for real. Fuck. Fuck that. They're different fucking boogie. And we're a drinking town here, dude. Oh, yeah. Like, I'm a drinker. I, well, I'm I'm in, I'm in retirement that I make. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. Anyway, two thumbs in the book. Yeah. I agree. All right. All right. So that's the show. I hope you like it. We just thought of it today. You listened to the whole way that it worked. We made the show up on the show. So, if you like the show, share the show, I think we'll make this a regular thing. I think we'll do 30 minutes. Um, we'll just hit the news and then we'll do the end that two thumbs up. All right. Or two thumbs in the butt. We'll just say two thumbs and we'll figure out which way it goes. I think everybody's gonna like this show, dude. I agree. I was fun. All right, guys. I love you guys. I appreciate you guys. Don't forget to share the show and I'll catch you next time. Mee is in the cold bed. Bitch, booty, slow. Gotta own bank, roll, kang, fold. Dussano. Hit, shot, case, close, close."
