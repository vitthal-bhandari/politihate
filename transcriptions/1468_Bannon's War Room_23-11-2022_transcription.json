    "text": " This is the primal stream of a dying regime. Pray for our enemies. Because we're going to medieval on these people. Here's what I gotta free shot all these networks lying about the people, the people that had a belly pull up. I know you don't like hearing that. I know you've tried to do everything in the world to stop there, but you're not gonna stop but it's going to happen. And where do people like that go to share the big line? Mega Media. I wish in my soul, I wish that any of these people had a conscience. Ask yourself, what is my task and what is my purpose? If that answer is to save my country, this country will be saved. War will use your host, Stephen K. Bass. I served in Vietnam with the Tiger Battalion. The accused Colorado Springs shooter is the grandson of conservative Republican California Assemblyman Randy Vopel, who represents Eastern San Diego County. Assembly member, Cottie Petri Norris from Orange County served on a handful of committees with the 72 year old Navy veteran. Randy Vopel certainly had a reputation as an extremist as a loose cannon, as a hard right, mega Republican who was anti-gay, racist, and very pro-second amendment. So attorneys for the accused shooter, Anderson Lee Aldrich, say in new court filings tonight that the suspect now identifies as non-binary. In a footnote to a motion asserting legal privileges, the public defenders say, quote, Anderson Aldrich is non-binary. They use they-them pronouns, and for the purposes of all formal filings will be addressed as mix Aldrich. So in other words, not Mr. or Ms. Joining me now, CNN political commentator, Errol Lewis also back with me, Al Franken and Joe Walsh. I don't know what to say about that. I mean, that's not anything that we had heard from his background. You know, people have been looking into his background, and I don't know if anybody here, are you guys lawyers? I mean, you know, I don't know if, I don't know what to say about that. I mean, that's what he's now saying. It sounds like they're trying to prepare a defense against a hate crimes charge. That's the least of his problems legally speaking, but it looks like they're trying to build some kind of sympathy or at least confusion on the question of whether or not this was purely motivated by hate. Such a, I mean, that's what it sounds like. We'll wait to see. Womp, womp. It's Wednesday, 23 November in the year of our Lord 2022. We got a lot to get to today. Mike Adams from Natural News about the award with the CCP will join us later. Kerry Lake running in this really a dog fight in Arizona. On an uncertifiable election will join us in the second hour. Also we get Matthew Chairman. It's gonna come and talk about Brazil. But I'm honored to have Jack Passobius gonna be my co-host, my gonna ride shotgun, or I guess I'll ride shotgun for the next two hours. Jack, very disturbing. When the mainstream media doesn't do the basics of research and try to smear, this has been all mega, all mega hate. The grandfather served in the Navy of Vietnam. War of Magga ball cap was a Tea Party guy. Ran, it's hard right. It's mega hate, it's extremism. Oops, upon further review, they didn't have to go back and look at the grandfather. There had almost no dealings with this guy at all. They could have looked at the father, right? The porn star Richard Dick Delaware, right? Richard Delaware. Richard Delaware, come on, this is a family program. Richard, Richard, I'm just kidding. Richard the guy's name, Richard Delaware. Richard Delaware. It sounds like 100 Biden's buddies by the way. I don't know if they were going by the Washington lounge together. This is not funny. It's actually sad and you saw a camaraderie right there. She stunned that she had not gotten the talking points memo. They hadn't pivoted. I'll tell you what, Passova, you can tell- I think- Go ahead. You can tell Camarada in that clip, that's like Trump coming off hearing about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. You're telling me this now for the first time. I'm just hearing it now. That she hasn't gotten to 3 a.m. talking points on this because they haven't dropped it. She's just reading the file. That's her live reaction. She's speechless. Now, listen, Camarada, who's always got something to say, who's always got the producer in the ear, CNN, the entire network of people need to understand that the way it works at CNN, look, I got this year, all I got here is Steve, right? That's how I got you. I got the guests. But at CNN, at these other places, and I saw this when I was in the White House in the press room, but they've got a producer there. They've got handlers. They've got people feeding them the lines. They've got people feeding them text. She gets this one. The guy's non-binary. He's not a guy. He's a person. His name is Mix Aldrich. We must refer to him as Mix. And she's saying, and she's working through, ladies and gentlemen, the sound you just heard was the narrative of the entire week, crashing into the wall and never to be heard from again, because the great Jordan Chamberlain posted this up. Last night, she's one of these people over at Free Beacon. All she does, she watches the media. She, like a hawk, she pulls these clips. It's amazing. She says, look, and we all saw it, these guys were all in. Steve, all earlier this week, all this week, they go, it's Maga was behind this. This was Maga. It was a Maga gunman. Maga, going after the drag queens and going after, because this place had a drag queen brunch that was gonna happen the next day. That was the reason that this guy targeted it. He's a Maga support. Remember, they had no evidence. They had no evidence whatsoever. And Ben Collins is up there, and Brandi's Rodney's up there, and their Blame and Libs are TikTok, and they're Blame and Tucker Carlson, and me and you, and post Millennial and everybody. They're Blame and everybody. And now all of a sudden, and here's what's interesting, and this is what Jordan Chamberlain noticed, and I wanna give her credit for this, because Steve, she noticed that they stopped talking about the shooter hours before this court filing came out. Suddenly, we're gonna pivot to other news, we're gonna pivot to other, because they knew. They knew that a change was coming, and the order came down, hey, we gotta stop talking about this. We gotta move on, and the problem was that Ben Collins didn't get the memo over an MSNBC, because he's out there, and we gotta play the clip if we have it. We got it. Let's play Ben Collins, and then a Posobic can come in and do observations. So go and play it. What could I have done different? Seriously, as reporters, what can we do different? Because there are five dead people in a strip mall, because that was the only place they felt safe, as gay or trans people in this town in Colorado Springs. And I am trying to thread this needle here. I'm trying to say that this is happening. This targeted stuff has real life impacts. They say in the internet it has real life impacts, and I'm gonna fail, by the way. I'm gonna freak out because it's happening, because I wake up and I see that there are five dead bodies. But I think we have to have a come to Jesus moment here. As reporters, are we more afraid of being on Breitbart for saying that trans people deserve to be alive? Or are we more afraid of the dead people? Because I'm more afraid of the dead people. I don't want to wake up on a Sunday and see that all these headlines came to fruition. Give that man the Oscar. Wow, what a performance. I think just don't even nominate anybody else. Straight to the stage, straight to the statue, Oscar for Ben Collins, my bravo, bravo, Bali Sima, Bali Sima. The only problem is that this guy's been out there blaming MAGA saying that it was conservative, saying it was Trump supporters. They're the ones who gin this up. They're the ones who target it up. Turns out it wasn't Trump supporters. It was actually a non-binary gun. Oh, wait, we can't say gunman anymore Steve. We can't say gunman. CNN's the real tragedy here, beyond obviously the shooting. The real tragedy is that CNN has been misgendering him, him, her, the entire week. You realize this? They've been misgendering. And that's violence too. We have to remember that's violence too. So at this point, we have to say gun day. We have to say gun day. And he's out there. And he's already got the new talk. Dead naming him before the court found day. He's been dead naming here. Dead, that's terrible. So this was an insolence. But this is, yeah. I got to give him credit. I'll give him credit. Hold on, hold on, hold on. He's the only thing that he's been. He's the only thing that I'm going to do. Hang on. Before he get to his pivot though, I want to get to him. I want to stay with this. Then we get to his pivot. It's a, so the audience understands for two days, because we, our staff, the production staff is one of the reasons we do the cold opens to blow your head up. Wall of the wall. The wall of the wall. The wall of the wall of the wall. They came back. They go, I said to so much, you got the, you got the reparations. You got Arizona. You got Brazil. You got Ukraine. You have McCarthy. You have these huge fights. I mean, there's so many huge stories we can't get to them every day. They go, no, no, no. For three days, it's wall to wall Colorado, and it's wall to wall the grandfather with the red maga ball cap, right? 100%. This is all Trump, Trump hate, MAGA hate. They're not doing anything else. But the key here of what happened is that this is an inside deal, right? This is one of these guys that thinks he's a girl and whatever, however they work that through, something happened. He's at that. He's at the day. Yeah, I can't go there. I can't do that. I can't do that. But my point is, everybody has to understand, they absolutely lied and defamed the maga movement because this guy's part of that, whatever's happening over there in that club, he's got issues inside that club and with his own personhood. Is that correct? Is that how we say it, Jack? That's pretty close. That's pretty. That's pretty close because this guy, I mean, look, they're called in a bomb thread on his mom a year before, should have been in jail for that, tried to kidnap his mother a year before, not even sure how changes the name, by the way. Some people are thinking that the name changes when threw off the cops. No, no, no, what do have the cops? Okay. We need all the facts because I'm going to tell you when you get to the facts, what you're going to find. I can't figure out if you've seen the video, the guy waddling off the thing with the got an armored car outside the street, shut down. You guys three hundred pounds. You're going to find it's not about changing his name away from his father, the porn star, Richard Delaware. Richard, Richard. Right? It's not about that. And by the way, CNN and these guys knew that immediately they just went to the grandfather scene because he had a mega ball cap and he's a tea party guy. They knew the guys lineage. You're going to find out, Jack Passovic, when he get into this, that the reason he's not locked up, that the reason he's not off the streets, the reason he was not after making bomb threats, going to kill people and keep his mom hostage, all this crazy stuff, he's doing. Look at the video. They got an armored car. They got an armored. This is not some police thing. This is an armored car. It looks like something in the Ukraine right now with guns outside. He walks away from all that. You know why? Because you're going to see in the psychological thing, he had his issues with binary, nine binary and they just going to let him go work it out. Well, hey, he worked it out in your strip mall. This has got to be investigated down to the bolts on this thing because this is the issue in the country. They got all this madness going on and they're blaming MAGA. Here's the blame. The blame is on Ben Collins. How's Ben Collins right now trying to pivot away from this, Passovic? So Steve, after the, and we're going to call it what it was. This was MAGA blood libel. This was MAGA blood libel that went for two days across the entire mainstream media where they said, they said these bodies and you heard Ben Collins up there, you know what he was saying? We all know what he was saying with his Oscar before. These five bodies are on you. They're on the Trump supporters. They're on the MAGA movement. They're on every person who's ever worn that red hat. Every person who's ever attended a Trump rally. Every person who voted for him in 2020 and 2016 that this is whoever's ever tweeted the hashtag MAGA that this is what that's what he was doing. All right. We're going to call it like it is. That's exactly what he was doing and it was a lie and it was defamation and it was, he knew exactly what he was doing when he was doing it. Now we're going to now the pivot. So here's the pit, the amazing pivot from Ben Collins and I got to give credit because this guy, he's dancing, right? He's in total spin mode because he knows he's been out there doing all the shows on MSNBC on MSNBC. Hang on, hold it, hold it, hold it. You got to hear it. You got to hear it. Hang on, Ben Collins is their digital guy, but the reason he's spinning, he's got his hands on his Oscar. He's got his hands on his Oscar for his teary thing. He doesn't want to lose the Oscar. Fraser, he doesn't want to go down. He doesn't want to go down. He doesn't want to get loported like the AP guy who made up the Russian missiles going in the ball and what it turned out, was Jack, Jack, the soviet scalp, a Jack, the soviet scalp. So tell me before you go to break, you had a minute. Tell me about Ben Collins's pivot. His pivot is he was bullied online by right wing trolls. He's already and, excuse me, not that not he, but they were bullied online by right wing trolls attacking him, calling him a pedophile that calling they a pedophile. They they accrued all of this. They were trying to go to Japan and raise all the money. So they were bullied by right wing trolls, bullied by, he's he's he can sense that Oscar just slipping through his fingers. He's trying to cling on to it as money. No, but the problem is the problem is Ben Collins, you got greasy palms. You got Chris, Tom's Ben Collins and you're going to lose the Oscar. Pozo, there's a hate crime. The hate crimes against Mac. It's against it's against it's against Maga. It's like, it's like, just he's small. That was blood libel. This is blood libel. Exactly. This, this is blood libel. This is what they did. They smeared Maga on a guy who has obviously has issues, huge issues that should have been put away. Why was he not put away? That's what it's not about a red flag law. Okay. This is why was he allowed to walk given how serious a threat he was to the community. Why? Okay. Here to come back from Elon Musk in the S. S. B. F.S. financing of left wing media to the crackdown in China on Lao Bai Jing by Apple. She in the Bayoners next in work. You know what's never good when your nation's supposed authority on economic policy completely misses the flashing red lights of impending inflation.

Okay, Jack Busovic, high energy Jack Busovic is our co-host for the hour. By the way, the event is what, 10 or 11 December in New York City, Jack, is the 10th of the 11th of New York. New York, younger Republicans with the great Gavin Wax, who was responsible, by the way, and people need to understand this. They were the ones who sued the state of New York over that criminal legislative map and congressional district map that they were trying to push forward. He's sued, gets it overturned. Then New York is able to have a legitimate congressional district map. That's how the seed started flipping and flipping and flipping. It's due to the work Gavin Wax, everybody else who wrote the writing it off. December 10th, we are going to be there New York City. Two keynotes, myself and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene are going to be delivering the keynote, but we've got an amazing cast of all stars that are going to be there. It all takes place in New York City. So if you're out there, if you're in New York, you get to New York, you make sure you come. A ton of the war room posse and the contributors on the show, Cortez, Captain Bennett, are all going to be there. In the great, our former producer, Vish, the Vish Burros, putting it on. One of the guys putting it on. Vish. But we're going to do an open invitation right here. The great Carly Bonet is going to sit at our table. Open invitation to Carly. Carly, if you're listening. Love what happened over the midnight ride. By the way, all of our chat rooms, everybody runs the chat rooms. You guys are superstars. We love the Midnight Rider channel. Carly's going to sit at the big table, right, Jack? Wait, Steve, are you saying that you're inviting Carly Bonet, the Midnight Rider herself, to sit at your table? Well, it's undetermined. It's undetermined. I've got several tables. I'm on the road so much. It's undetermined where the war room would be that day. But we will have Cortez and Navarro, Captain Bennett, Grace Chunk, and a host. But you won her at the war room table. You won her at the war room. At the war room table. At the war room, that's the midnight ride. Only, what do you mean? She says she plays the big rooms. Carly plays the big rooms. Midnight Rider plays the big rooms, right? She's going to sit ahead of the table. Not just sit at the table. Head of the table. Right next to Tonya Tay. That's the Tonya Tay. You're talking to Tonya Tay's manager right here. That's the Tonya Tay. By the way, we're going to have the China piece. People don't realize this. They just think that the Posovics, I'm dumb, Paul. No, that's not true. Posovics, the Naval Intelligence Office, speaks perfect Mandarin. His wife speaks perfect Mandarin. The biggest show in the world, if the new federal state, Gala a couple of years ago, had Tonya and Jack on the stage speaking Mandarin in the Chinese couldn't get enough. The biggest show in the world of Jack would let me launch. The Tonya Tay and others. And company, Jack would be company. And company shows. Steve, come on. We're a massage. We're a massage. We don't want women in the workplace. People forget the old room rule about no women in the war room. She's a shit. She's an old rule. There's no no. We changed. That's why we have the new one. I had Liz Harrington. It's exactly what I've done. Yeah, Liz came in and then followed Natalie. I'm going to blow you up right now because it was, they could be on remote. They could be on remote. No, no. Nobody wants to be in the war. We don't be the Breitbart embassy. It's like the club in the old, our gang comedy, right? Exactly. Okay. This thing in Colorado is a very serious smear in mainstream media. You know, I'm not so sure CNN is really changing. I hear happy talk about it. It's going to change. Dr. Malone's got to get serious. Dr. Malone, you've just allowed, and Dr. Malone's from Colorado, you've just allowed the network that you own, okay, because you're the controlling shareholder. And you got these Grondunes runner. Oh, we're going to make, sending, fine Brian Stelter is not a big move. That's a marginal Grondoon, right? Not allowing what happened when they knew the facts. Are you telling me that CNN with its vast reporting apparatus did know about the guy's father's a porn star and a total degenerate, right? And this guy's got a troubled history and really find out why the police let him go, right? This guy was, you know, bomb scares going to blow up things, going to, you know, capture his mother going to kill people. This guy was on the watch list. You talk about domestic terrorists. This guy was a domestic terrorist. Why was he not rolled up? And he's a mega hater. And you go after the grandfather who honorably served his country in Vietnam. Yeah. Go demonize the grandfather who served this country as a patriot, right? When you, when you knew what the story was, you see, here's the thing, Jack, they knew exactly what they were doing. And by the way, the reason we're bringing this up, because people know these are not type of stories I follow. Wait, and by the two days, we're two days, we couldn't get any polls on any other stories because all they did was this nonstop, so big. When you're one of these networks, okay, at this level, we even have it at human events, especially you've got, you've got access to federal databases, like PASER, like Lexus Day, so many others where you can go in, you can pull all these court records. You just type somebody's name in, boom, you pop it up, you hit Colorado, you type the name, they would have the name change, they would have the initial name, right? You've got some Grundun who does that within the first five minutes because of the amount of staff that they have over at CNN with their financialization, the fact that they're corporate on these places, they got thousands of people over there. But you mean to tell me that it's going to take a couple of guys on the internet to pull all this up and then you can't find it yourself? No, I don't believe that for a second. I'm going with the theory from Jordan Chamberlain, this theory that shows, Steve, by the way, remember, they stopped talking about the Colorado shooter hours before the court filing dropped. They stopped hours before. I wonder why that is. It's just like, if you remember the Roger Stone FBI raid and CNN's there and they're waiting at the end of the driveway, because how did CNN get a tip off? You know what they said? They said it was a happy coincidence. It was a happy coincidence that they were there. Okay. All right. Let's get some more happy coincidences. Speaking of coincidences, Elon Musk is lighting up, you know, Vox and all this left-wing media, the ecosystem of left-wing media. Why? They're taking money from SBA, from FTX, right? The money laundering scam, they head over there, the crypto money laundering scam with Ukraine. It turns out, Jack, is he saying that they're all financed, all those operations, including the great Ben Smith? They're all financed. Steve, we've got money laundering. That's exactly right. And we've got the story up at the post-millennial just now. I was working on it with the Great Libby Emmons. A couple of days ago, we had the initial story that SBA, this guy, Sam, I love the name, Bankman Fried. Bankman Fried. You couldn't write this. So he's showering money on these liberal media institutions, ProPublica, Vox, the Intercept, the Law and Justice Journalism Project, and Semaphore, the new Ben Smith founder of Buzzfeed, goes over New York Times for a while, tries to do a sub-stack not too many people follow that. Then he goes and found this Semaphore. They run over and they take millions. Even Reuters reported this early on that they were taking millions from SBA. Now Elon Musk has the tweet out, Semaphore, he doesn't even just say invested in. Elon goes, he goes straight for the jugular. He says, Semaphore is owned by SBF. This is a massive conflict of interest in your reporting. Journalistic integrity is trash. You got the richest man in the world and the owner of Twitter lighting you up, Semaphore, lighting you up. So what is Ben Smith? If Ben Smith has not responded immediately with his cap table like in 30 seconds, I think they got him, right? Has Ben Smith responded? I'd love to see Ben Smith slack channel right now because they're losing it in there because people don't like seeing how the sausage is made in left wing media because now we're peeling back the layers of the onion. We're peeling back the layers, right? We get limited hangouts every once in a while like the CAA when they have cover blown, they pull it back a little bit. They say, well, you know, there was this guy and he was bad, but it was just him. It was just him and these other people are fine. No, we are now getting into, we're finding out this guy SBF taking millions and billions from his own customers was given a free hand, was given a total pass, was money laundering, money that came from Ukraine, money that came from his own customers, his own clients that were going into it. And he was showering it out to all of his friends, which then creates a perverse feedback loop. So then he gets the pockets. He gets great coverage, but he's also pounding into NGOs. He's not for profits and he's powering into candidates. I mean, they know $40 million. I think his whole investment was a hundred million bucks in the cycle. Why are they not forced to give that money back? I mean, the cycle, because they're saying and remember, they were saying it wasn't just 25 of these house seats within a couple, within a thousand or so votes. How much did he influence on the ability to buy ads by ground game to tip this, the house majority, which could have been another 20 seats. You know, a lot of these seats 20 to 25 and just broke the other way with 1500 2000 votes max. You're going to have Joe, Joe Kent's hammering out there. He's going to get this thing down to under a thousand votes, right? That'll hit quickly. One of the other things, by the way, Steve, I don't know if people put this. I put the connected the dots on this, but the international disgrace, Jim LaPorter, the guy who wrote the fake story that's not been retracted about the fake Russian missiles. You know what other story he wrote, Steve? Over for the AP, Jay Arma Juice, the same guy behind the Jay Arma Juice, the exact same guy they put it on him. And that's the one RCC dropped out. It was a total lie. He was part of the flight crew. He was flying in and out of Afghanistan. It was the most obvious thing, but they put out the smear piece and our C.C. drops out then Bankman freed and everybody else have their money that's flying around. These are winnable seats. Yeah. These were winnable seats, but the money didn't go to the people who needed it. People I just want to make sure in the perspective everybody understands this was a path to World War three. This is going to be Article five with the polls getting hit by these Russian missiles. Remember, they had a new cycle for 48 hours. That was all based upon this story. It turns out they're Ukrainian. This is Zelensky. Right? This is Zelensky issue. Am I incorrect in that about the power? And by the way, and I'm just going to throw it out there. I'm going to throw it out there as as as someone who you know, kind of wears their Polish heritage on their sleeve. Why isn't Zelensky come out yet and offered his condolences to the people of Poland? Why hasn't Zelensky come out and said this was this was a terrible tragedy? It was a horrific accident. I wish that this had never happened. Where's the wreath? Where's any of it? Where's any of it? Yeah. Where are your thoughts and prayers, Zelensky to the to the polls that you guys murdered to innocent civilians? That's that's Zelensky. That's kind of guy you're dealing with. That's kind of guy they want to shovel another 50 billion dollars to in the lame duck. Not happening. Here's here's how much you get. No, zero. Sure. Commercial break. We're going to be back to China and Brazil next. Fair warning. Listen to this convicted home title thief explaining what happens when he forges your home's title and takes over as the new owner. Nobody thinks that I can take their house and borrow against the house. Oh, no, I have title insurance. It's in my name or he would have to get some special document. They would call me, you know, what he's calling you. You're living in a delusion. After I've stolen the title, borrowed against it or sold the property, it's 60 to 90 days for that person to even figure out that they're the victim of this crime. You start getting foreclosure notices. You've got four mortgages on your house. You don't even own your home anymore. It's not even in your name. Home title fraud is growing two and a half times faster than credit card fraud. You could be a victim and not even know it.

Get online. city. what are you going to get? Truck. right? Yeah. Oh you're back. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay the lies the world lives is that what's going on in on it, China is okay. That right there, you're seeing for a podcast already on it, you couldn't see it. The footage is actually brutally, you've got an open revolt in this apple plant, really Foxconn. Remember the Foxconn guys, the guy's coming over here, he's going to build plants all over the place. It's a guy that miles grow, Terry grow his name. Miles Goh and I fought when he ran to be president of Taiwan because he's an active participant. He's a CCP asset, right? As anybody that has huge factories in China in partnership with the CCP like Elon Musk, okay? Elon Musk and all the financing he's got from the CCP for the crime scene that's called Twitter. Somebody said yesterday on Twitter too on this thing that, oh, but Bannon doesn't mention the Saudi Arabia money. He's got a little chump change in there from Prince Awaalid, but the question is where's Prince Awaalid's money really come from? If you can ask, if somebody can ascertain that for me, where that money really comes from, the money he's got today and it's not related to the CCP, I'll buy in that 0.0%, 1% is Arab money. But we know that the rest of the money from Binance, the Sequoia, and the Tesla, all of Tesla's financed by the CCP. This issue is the Mac Daddy on Drudge, Passobic, I'm attorney because you're a specialist. A lot of people don't know, Passobic is a naval intelligence officer stationed in mainland China. He absolutely understands this to the core of his being. But this is about the presidential race here too. This is what these billionaires that are making money in China, they're more closely aligned with the CCP. And you see Khashwab, the world I can't remember from, that's the globalist kind of, that's their gathering place. That's their skull and crossbones club hangout. He says it's a role model. They look right there. Remember, in 5,000 years of recorded history, or 6,000 or 7,000 years of recorded history in China, Lao Bai Zhing, old 100 names, the deplorables of China, have never been free. For one shining moment in the early years of the 20th century, there might have been the potential for freedom under Sun Yet Sen and right before the warlord period when it didn't happen. It didn't happen. They've never been free. They've never voted the largest country in the world. And it's slave labor. We just keep reminding people it is slave labor. The role model, the business model that the world economic forum wants is slave, right? The reason I've dedicated a huge part of my life to assisting Lao Bai Zhing is that you can't get the world's business model sorted when the global financial elites have shipped all the manufacturing jobs to a slave labor camp. You're never going to actually get wages since 1972. Just kind of randomly corresponded to when Nixon went to China, right? Came off the gold standard. The Arab, Bolambargo since 1972 to today, adjusted for inflation. And you're on a 19 month negative thing. You're not keeping up with inflation. Real wages since 1972, the average worker in this nation, the American working man and woman, you have you make 12 cents more an hour, 12 cents more an hour than you made in 1972. The reason is that the as we've gone to finance capitalism, finance capitalism supports the model of slave labor in China. And you're seeing an open revolt today in this apple factory. Jack, Pacific. Look, Steve, I'd like to respond to what you said. But the first thing I'd like to say is to send a message to the people of Zhengzhou, the people of China who are experiencing this crackdown right now. When you look at the Fox con plant and Zhengzhou, where this has been is now the railhead of these riots and protests. That is the flagship factory for Fox con. They're the major manufacturers of the iPhone and Apple products, the tablets, everyone, everyone uses them that these are what people need to understand. These are I visited them. When I lived in China, I had the opportunity working with the American chamber to be able to visit them to go there. These are essentially in the US, we might call it a factory town, but it's based on this CCP model. It's more of an entire enclosed compound. So you live there, you work there, your family's there, you have a dormitory there. And so when the COVID lockdowns come, and this is under Xi Jinping, and this is under the new regime of zero COVID, that they can force you to work without food. They can force you to leave your homes. They can force you to work without pay. They can separate your children from you. And that's exactly what they're doing. And they call this these medical police, these medical troops, they call it big white. They call it be a Dabai in in in in Chinese. So when Dabai comes in, the big whites, they are the enforcers. They're the enforcers of the Chinese Communist Party over these workers, and they don't have the ability. They say, why don't you just stay home? You don't understand because they're already there. They're already within the compound in many of these places. By the way, these are the same factories, these mega factories, absolutely enormous. They're vast. They're bigger than, you know, it looks like one of the facilities, if you go down and visit, you know, Cape Canaveral, NASA, one of those huge space shuttle buildings that they have. And because the people are there, they're trapped, they're completely trapped, and they're being forced to work, they're being forced to put the the hours for the, because they know they're going to Q4, right, going to Q4. This is the massive retail period for China. They know, Xi Jinping knows, by the way, that if those apple products are not under Christmas trees in the US and across the West on December 25th, then the CCP economy starts to break and you get this across the entire country. We are not blaming Apple here. And here's why Apple knows is a problem, Jack. You know, they've been trying to, they're shifting production, you know, out into other countries in Southeast Asia. There's even talk of production coming back here, they get the cost. All of us are complicit in this. We have Apple products here at the World War One. Hold on, where is it? Where's, here, you wouldn't blame somebody. Where's Tim? Yeah. Tim Cook, where's the tweet? Where's the tweet? Where's the post that we're Elon Musk? They have to, they have to step up. They have to say, just say something. What do you do? These are your workers. These are your contract workers. Yeah. Why aren't you taking care of them? Why? Here's one. Here's what I'm saying. It's deeper than just Apple. They're trying to make things are right. He should have the back is outrageous. The Fox out, but it's the system that cost Schwab and these guys promote. Talk about, when we talk about this factories, the suicide rates are enormous. The suicide rates among young, they have suicide nets outside these factories that they've had to install inside outside of the mega Fox confectories, suicide nets, because so many people are cracked down under the pressure of this is even prior to COVID, by the way. Okay, this is the way that the slave workers are kept that they have to have suicide nets because too many people are cracking under the pressure and killing themselves. And they didn't like, and by the way, it's not about saving lives. It's about keeping you on the line. It's about keeping you as a worker. It's about keeping you there and shelling it out every single day. And by the way, this is, and there's that video from 2016 of Michael Moore, of all people, right, explaining this entire process and how the American Midwest and the American South, the people were completely gutted. They had Steve's very, what was done to these towns with JD Vance talks about all the time, that was done to them. That was done to them by a parasitic class of overlords in the US and working with the Chinese Communist Party. But this, but hang on, this, you're 100% correct. We actually put great footage or it's not capture. It's murder. It's elite merger and Klaaszwab is admitting it. He's just, I've been saying this for a year. Klaaszwab is just repeating what I've told you for an entire year. Paul Singer, Paul Tudor Jones, Ken Griffin, right, Steve Schwartz, one of the biggest points. Griffin who committed perjury by holding committed perjury about Citadel. So hang on, and throw Murak on top of it. Those four billionaires and hey, it is, they're the money and back of the Sanders right now, that brilliant piece on Schmerkonosh the other day where the guy said, hey, the logic of the Santa's campaign after he has the legislative session is there's so much money and the money's trying to force him into this race against President Trump. President Trump's already called it out. Those individuals are closer to what exactly what you're seeing going on here. People have to face the reality of what we've all allowed to happen in China. And these people are revolts. I'm going to go back to the women because of the forced abortions of, in Miles Grossa, it's 400 million that have been murdered under the Chinese Communist Party. Young babies, right? Babies that have been murdered. What 80% of those have been baby girls, right? And that's what we'll have. They throw them in the river. They throw them right in the river and because they know that if you have a girl that it's considered, it's considered not as worth. And Dave actually, people talk about the population drop off the cliff that China is about to hit because of the one child policy of the 1970s. But they also don't talk about is the ratio problem they have of male to female within the Chinese population. So you've got essentially, in pretty much every population that's left to stable, you get one to one. You pretty much get end up with a one to one because even if more boys are are born men of a tendency to die younger than women, that's just kind of our nature. We're a little more risk taking women are a little more risk averse. That's just normal. But in the Chinese system, you've got 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 men for every one woman. We even saw 1.5 depending on where we go. Maybe in these factories, the sexual abuse in these factories, the force abortion, the suicide rates among the young women are out of control. These are slave labor camps. They have no recourse. They have no recourse. They're slave labor camps. That's what costrob is saying a model. That's what American finance, finance capitalism is supporting. This is what has to stop. And we're going to vet all this in this primary in 2024. Okay, from China to Brazil and Arizona and how they are inextricably linked. In Joe Biden's America, criminals are exalted and the police are condemned, said to say, but you need to be prepared and properly trained to defend yourself and to defend your family.

Party in Bolsonaro's terrible Bolsonaro's butt. Look in the streets of Brazil. Look at the great patrons in Brazil that had a lot of danger to themselves. Have come forward in the streets of Brazil. And quite frankly, as much as i love the Bolsonaro's in Edwater, I think it's going to speak to Martin, there's no better man on this globe than Edwater Bolsonaro's father. In Brazil, it's going beyond the Bolsonaro's. This was the people saying no, you didn't follow the Constitution. You use these machines, use the judiciary to shut us down in the media, and we're not going to tolerate it. It's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out. Same in the United States. You know, the people like Kerry Lake are not going to give up and I use as a warning in the great fight that you guys have in front of you, both for the cultural issues, for the political issues, and the economic issues. Once they start taking and digitizing the elections, once they start going to machines where you can't get paper ballot, you don't have proof of ID, you take it away from the precincts and they start to sexualize them in collection centers. That's all done for one reason. That's to consistently steal elections because they know they don't have the back end. That was, I was honored to be asked to speak at CPAC last week in Mexico City. Jack Prasobo goes there. Jack will bring on Tear Mom in a second and no one in the Western world has done a better job of speaking out for the Brazilian people than Matthew Tear Mom. It's been absolutely incredible. I know that's informed by his great fight of his father and himself and his family, just like Prasobic. These polls, they understand what oppression is like, right? And this is why there's the among the Prasobics and the Tear Monks of the world, among the leaders throughout this globe, whether it's in China or whether it's in Brazil, of speaking up for the little guy. Prasobic, you were down in Mexico City that was extraordinary. And I want to say that CPAC, and you got to give a hat tip to Mercedes-Amatt slap, the CPAC in Brazil, which Tear Mon and I think Jason Miller got arrested, almost got arrested, got stopped, that was a big element of what you're seeing in the streets of Brazil today. This, what happened in Mexico City was just as powerful as a gathering of all the tribes throughout Latin America to say, hey, we got a problem and that problem is totalitarian communism backed by finance capitalism is taking over the countries of Latin America and the resources. Prasobic, give me your assessment of that. You were there and then want to bring on Matthew Tear Mon about Brazil. No, that's exactly right. And I actually have to offer an apology, and I have to apologize because I did not realize how big of a following that the war room, the human events daily, that just myself and others, Steve, even you as well, that these guys down in Mexico, there are hundreds of thousands of people that are following us, that are watching us, they're translating it on their own into Spanish. A lot of many of them speak English as well, obviously, I had no idea. I was blown away, blown away by the reception that we got, Steve, they were all saying, we want bad and we want bad and down here. And then we ended up having the situation where it was you had you had two Eduardo's, right? You had Eduardo Bolsonaro, you had Eduardo Borostegi, two Eduardo's and a Pozo that were coming in and we said, you know what, we may speak different languages, but we're at number one, we're all Catholic. And number two, we all believe in freedom. We all believe in freedom for the individual freedom for the people against global tyranny. And I said, you know what, the speech that I gave in Mexico, I could give the same speech in Poland and Hungary, I could give it in Israel, I could give it anywhere, like Brazil, anywhere in the world, because we all face the exact same issue of a transnational criminal elite that have conducted a merger, a shadow merger with the Chinese Communist Party, the clash. I gave the speech even before clash. Bob came out, he's admitting it. He's admitting it in front of his eye, Charlie Munger is out there talking about that. They want that model to be put out for the entire West. The only difference is, okay, you have your big screen TVs, but you know what, you'll own nothing. You'll be sitting there watching Netflix, you'll be working from home, you'll be voting from home, you'll have digital voting, you'll have digital money, you won't actually have anything of your own, but they'll get Elysium, they'll get everything they want. That's exactly the system they're trying to set up for the entire globe. Matthew Tiramond, a big event yesterday that you're the first one really to report because Brazilian media is not reporting it. Brazilian media is not reporting it. There are tens of millions of people in the streets here. It's beyond the Bolsonaro's, but the party of Bolsonaro jumped in here, so get us up to speed on actually the reality of what's happening. Bolsonaro's party, and he stepped back from the party politics when he became president in a class of a lot of parliamentary systems, the prime minister of the president. They don't keep us closely aligned with the party because now they're supposed to rule everybody, and that's a very sort of egalitarian political framework. But his party, and this is all the people who are on his list who won all those down ballot races, round one, round two, senate seats, governor's seats, congressional seats in their house of deputies, their lower house, they brought out a report yesterday. This is coming on the heels of what we reported the other day, that finally some military generals are making public comment like General Maro, what about highest respected across the divide? General said that the court is starting the constitution. I mean, I'm paraphrasing, and this got a lot of attention because a high ranking general does not make these statements unilaterally or flippantly. So you know that there was conversations going on within the complex about what was there going to be their response, and this was the first shot across the bow. Then that was Friday evening, and then you have yesterday the press conference and the petition to the court, the Supreme Court and the Supreme Electoral Court both overseen by a Lula crony, part of the cabal that led him out of prison after he was strictly convicted and expunged his records so that he could run because in Brazil, you cannot run for office if you have felony conviction so they expunged his record. So the party, PL, your balsner's or small party, released a report saying, and I'll read you the two money shot quotes from this report, in the files that do not contain the correct electronic voting machine identification code, it is impossible to univocally correlate the data recorded there with the events that actually occurred in the factual world, whether they be votes or human interventions, says their petition. The other quote, the lack of adequate individualization of the essential documents issued by the ballot boxes and the serious consequences resulting there from call into question objectively the transparency of the electoral process itself. They showed that a whole series, a whole suite of different machines could not be ascertained if they were human intervention or not. And so as a result, they have clamored to annul the votes that were cast on these machines, which would whoa, throw the election overwhelming, like false narrow because these machines met very big.
