Well, here we are again, another great Michael Savage podcast. Today's podcast concerns sex and politics. Why? Because the nation is obsessed both with sex and politics. Now, in this podcast, you'll hear things about how religious individuals are still having children, including Orthodox Jews, conservative Christians, and conservative Muslims. But low birth rates are very pronounced. Otherwise, in our society, obsessed with trans with gay with lesbian and all sorts of other things. I talk about modern perversion in the West. I talk about the Bible and how the Bible said go forth and multiply or your tribe dies off. I talk about how young people who are afraid to have children ought to wake up to real problems and times which are much worse during which people still had children. And how the weakest minds in our time are elevated while the smartest minds are repressed. Two articles came out that are worth mentioning right now. A Clinton appointed judge, Robert Hinkle, a Clinton appointed judge will allow children to be surgically mutilated. The headline of course doesn't read that way. I have to decipher headlines. Here's the headline. Gender identity is real federal judge issues preliminary injunction against Florida's restrictions on gender affirming care. So they're calling cutting off a penis and cutting off breasts gender affirming care. If that's not the sickest thing you've heard, tell me what is. It's crazy. Last month, the great Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill into law that restricts gender affirming care for children among other things. It's not gender affirming care. Governing DeSantis prohibited the use of GNR agonists known as puberty blockers to stop or delay normal puberty in order to affirm a person's perception of his or a sex if that perception is inconsistent with the person's natal sex. Do you understand how sick this is? Legislation that DeSantis passed also prohibits cross sex hormones to quote affirm a person's perception of his or her sex. If that perception is inconsistent with the person's natal sex, do you understand how sick this is? It will outlaw the surgical procedures and experimental puberty blockers for minors. It will also require any adults receiving the surgeries to be informed about the irreversible nature and about the dangers of the procedures. It will give Florida courts temporary jurisdiction to intervene in halt procedures for out-of-state children. You have actually some states in this country that want to be a haven for these types of procedures and even welcome minors without their parents consent into some of their jurisdiction. DeSantis said Florida is proud to lead the way in standing up for children as the world goes mad Florida represents a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy. He is right. So they shopped around for seven parents of so-called transgender children and they follow lawsuit to block the new law once DeSantis signed the bill. Four of the children involved do not need immediate care. According to their doctors do not need immediate care. But one child's doctor said puberty blockers are needed now without delay and doctors for the other two children said they'll need this treatment soon. As you well know the sicko judge Robert Hingle appointed by the great Bill Clinton will allow the three children to continue receiving quote gender affirming treatment meaning mutilation or drugs that kill saying that they would suffer irreparable harm if not allowed to continue access to the hormones of puberty blockers. We're living in the sickest times in the history of the world. Here's another article for my great podcast on sex and politics. No one else has done this one. We learned this week that Instagram had an algorithm that boosted a vast pedophile network. Did you hear this? Instagram's recommendation algorithms linked and even promoted a vast pedophile network that advertised the sale of illicit child sex material on the platform. According to the findings of an alarming report released this week. What we're finding on Instagram right now is so much worse. Pedophile-like sexualization of children for example is rampant on Instagram right now. Now none of these photos typically are showing underage nudity but they're maybe showing a girl wearing a swimsuit. It may be posing for a modeling job or doing gymnastics and it's clear that the viewers are sexualizing them and are using the comment sections as a venue for sexual harassment, potential grooming and pedophile networking. Instagram allowed users to search by hashtags related to child sex abuse including graphic terms which I will not repeat here. The hashtags directed users to accounts that purportedly offered to sell pedophilic materials via menus of content including videos of children harming themselves or committing acts of bestiality the researchers said. Some accounts even allowed buyers to quote commission specific acts or arrange meetups the journal said. The journal noted that researchers of both Stanford and UMass Amherst discovered large-scale communities promoting criminal sex abuse and Instagram. When the researchers set up test accounts to observe the network of sickos they began receiving suggested for your recommendations to other accounts that purportedly promoted pedophilia or linked to outside websites. This is what Instagram did. Instagram as you well known is owned by Facebook or meta. Thank you Mark Zuckerberg for blocking me for banning me for banning conservatives for blocking conservatives and for boosting a vast pedophile network. Thank you Mark you're a great service to humanity and now on to the podcast of the day on sex and politics as we try to navigate through the sickest times in the history of the world. That's right we're living through the sickest times in the history of the world. This is worse than the Roman Empire. This is worse than the Weimar Republic. What we are living in under Biden are the sickest times in the history of the world and you could take that to the bank. Michael Savage a host like no other.

Today I'm going to talk about a topic that's on everyone's mind all the time which is sex and politics because amor f\u00e9 pas\u00e9 le tins love makes the world go around everyone thinks about it all the time right in other words the most let us say repressed looking personality is still a human being underneath that repression and so we're going to talk about that because I've been thinking about it since I'm a little boy and I never talk about it most of us don't talk about it because we are just people who like to keep things to ourselves and I thought today that you would like me to discourse on sex and politics since America is the most sexually obsessed nation on the planet right now you have to talk about the trans sexuality that suddenly became more kosher than your grandmother and great grandfathers beautiful kind quiet life how did this happen how did this nation which is collapsing from within become so obsessed with sexuality of the most bizarre nature how well this dissertation will be more questions than answers it will be a journey not a destination as I said and I don't have the answers I thought I had some of the answers but I looked up some of the data and it didn't hold up and I'm one of those with an open mind and a free spirit and a free mind free thinking where I'm willing to admit when my thinking did not lead me where I thought it would go don't you wish everyone was like that don't you wish the candidates were like that instead of pretending they know what the hell they're talking about don't you wish Biden was like that when you know he belongs in a nursing home with a tub of ice cream and a television set so the best way to get something done if you if you hold near and dear to you that you uh um like to be able to anyway I'm we're ready to get a lot done sex and politics so I asked myself a question how is it that the countries most obsessed with sex have the lowest birth rates and those countries with the greatest sexual repression have the highest birth rates now I didn't know whether that would hold up to be true so I did a little tiny bit of quick research I'm not an expert in the area but I do have some degrees that enable me to research quickly because I know how to form questions you know I remember when I was working for my advanced degrees I was taught that you're not going to learn the answers but you're going to learn how to find the answers and that's the mark of a scholar how to find the answers I found out afterwards that the real question is not how to find the answers that it's it's knowing what questions to ask to get the right answers and I can search questions as fast as anyone on the planet I have a supercomputer between you know the ears and this super computer has been trained for a long time on how to search questions and answers so in other words we have a country like ours and there's an assumption that the republicans are sexually repressed and they want to control and depress sexual sexual urges and that the democrats are liberties and they permit anything goes which is why so many young people are sucked in by the democrat socialist communist Nazi philosophies they have no idea that those theorems don't really hold up so I looked into birth rates by country let's start with that guess which country has the highest birth rate on earth you can look it up for yourself yes it's African nations Angola has 43.7 births per thousand per thousand man they really they do it like rabbits over there Angola night Niger and Mali Chad Uganda Zambia Burundi don't tell hushush don't tell Biden he'll send a couple of 747s and a few ships over there to bring them all in on welfare Liberia Mozambique Afghanistan Guinea Basao Burkina Fasao South Sudan Guinea Ethiopia Sierra Leone very high birth rates now what do they all have in common it's not race as you would think it's not that they're black Africans that they have such a high birth rate no see that's where your mind distorts what's real it's that they're muslim it's that they were conquered by muslims and they practice Islamic law which prohibits the kind of lewdness and sexual license that we think is a mark of liberation here in the old United States of America so which countries have the lowest birth rates those are the highest Monico when you expect that Monico would have low birth rates because it's a lot of older retired wealthy people South Korea that's kind of surprising to me because the Koreans are very vigorous people and they certainly enjoy sex Japan seven per thousand people Taiwan 7.43 Greece very low what happened to the what happened to Zorba where did he go I don't know Puerto Rico low 7.9 that's surprising Portugal 8.0 Spain 8.05 Bulgaria 8.15 so it's quite surprising to me because initially I thought I would talk about how Russia and Ukraine which are killing each other and committing mutual suicide thanks to Joe Biden and the degenerates running the United States the United Kingdom France and all the other Western nations they want white men to kill each other they want heterosexual white males to be dead in Russia and in Ukraine so they're throwing gasoline on the fire see the more white men that are killed the better for people of color the better for that now that's absolutely a theorem only it's a theorem only but if you analyze it you'll see I'm correct so we'll go on it's not that they have the lowest birth rates by the way in Russia and Ukraine they have low birth rates but so does Ireland which is not at war incidentally Ireland is not at war Ireland has a very low birth rate so if you analyze birth rates and you ask why do some nations have high birth rates and some low birth rates it's a hard question to ask to get an answer for in this day and age because of massive population movements into and out of nature mainly internet well into and out of nations for example we're going through a replacement in America where white people are being pushed out of the nation for the brown and black people because they're superior to white people they've contributed more than any other race to the inventions on planet earth you know I mean the automobile telephone the telegraph the computer all invented by africas and people of color right wrong it's all white male inventions but I'll save that for another time because I've done that since 1998 and you may curse me you may hate me but you can't deny the fact of reality that 98% of all of the inventions that advance humankind were invented by the detested white male so that's why those running american today want to destroy the white male so they can reduce us to an agricultural level society or beyond that to a primitive tribal society where we're living let us say in caves and in mud huts then the occasional cortexes will be happy of the world happy while they live in adahas and the mansions and the cars and the jets while the rest of us live in mud huts see that's how that works it worked this way once before in a country called russia but don't tell that to the fellow traveler bernie sanders who was the worst man on the planet i say bernie sanders and george soros are probably genetic twins and they're two of the most evil men on the planet but i reserve that for another day because this is more of an anthropological discussion than a political discussion most savage nation is savage on demand the sex and politics and i'm going back to my first question how is it that the nation's most obsessed with sex have amongst the lowest birth rates this nation is more obsessed with sex i would say than any other nation on earth and it has amongst the lowest birth rate amongst those pushing the sexual libertarianism or libertarianism the white people it's mainly white people who are sexually obsessed in the united states of america it frankly is not the brown and black people who are as obsessed the immigrants come in here and we're speaking in broad terms now in great generalities obviously they don't have the same obsession with sex that the white people of america have because they're struggling they come from countries that are repressive politically they don't have access to the pornography etc and they're not taught to obsess and their sexuality in the countries that we are getting to say that's a good thing or a bad thing that's irrelevant to this discussion what's relevant to this discussion is it's very hard to make a general statement about a population when you have such mass migration into for example this nation and the replacement of white people by brown and black people because that's what the generates that run this country seem to think will bless us with a better future laborers in other words a slave class let's be very clear they're bringing in a slave class to work for the rulers in plain English you don't want to hear that because they pretend that they're in their favor and they love them and they're in favor of them but they're not they're bringing them into fill up the catholic churches because the pews have become empty and so they need a new stock to fill the pews that's why the catholic charities are on the border giving out welcome wagons new sneakers hair cuts dental work uh the fat nuns are there giving them out all of stuff and so they get them right into america they sneak them into every city bus from here and then they the churches are filling up and they're happy and then they get more federal money they have to bring them in for for some reason they get more federal money but that's how that works again hard to generalize in a time of mass migration and mass replacement but if you look at it a little more carefully as I can do because not only have I thought about the subject since i'm a little boy you know very keenly acute people are generally interested in everything including sex let me be very clear and I've been thinking about it since i'm a little boy and i haven't stopped thinking about it and then it dawned on me today maybe the people out there want to hear me talk about sex and politics so let me go back to it again how did this country become so insane that we glorify people who are confused about their own sexuality or you want to call a gender if you want to call a gender a sex it doesn't matter we know what i'm talking about the main thing is the words themselves have been altered and blurred so you have men who wear tuck outfits to cover their sexual part because they want to look and feel like a woman okay now that's been done since the beginning of time or their civilized time that's why the bible says it's not good by the way in other words anything that's fun the bible says is not good whether it's shrimp or sexuality that's a joke for those of you following me and wanted to get mad at me but you got the joke right no it's not true so if you look at the religion for the moment let's look at the bible let's look at Leviticus let's look at the Old Testament which i've looked at for a very long time to the Hebrew the word is the deed we're people of the book and so we grow up reading books in a foreign language called Hebrew or in English and that's why so many Jews are so smart it's because for thousands of years while your ancestors who hate me were swinging in trees we were writing and reading books incidentally it's just a fact whether you like it or not is irrelevant so here's a book called the bible the holy scriptures and it's basically an English translation of the Old Testament or the testament of god or the books a woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garments for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the lord thy god now why would the bible in deuteronomy deuteronomy 22 3 or 22 5 why would it say that what the hell is it what was their business whether someone in ancient israel put on address behind closed doors because then the tribe would die if the man wanted addresses a woman and not have sex with his wife and have babies the people would have died off so the bible whether it was from god or from man it doesn't really matter at this time what matters is whether it's factually still relevant that's all that matters then they go on it says right after that listen to this woman man thing about not dressing in the other sex if a bird's nest chance to be before the on the in the way in any tree or on the ground with young ones or eggs and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam with the young oh you see that you shall not take the bird the lady bird with the young thou shalt in any wise let the lady bird go they call it a dam but the young thou may is taken to thyself that it may be well with thee and thou may is for long thy days so listen to the wisdom of that one you don't kill the hen because then you stop the hen laying eggs and you'd kill off the species get it now that's interesting that it's in dude eronomy right after thou shall not wear the women where men's and men's wear women's clothing very interesting is the structure of the bible and the order of the commandments within the bible of the teachings they are not by chance by the way it's been studied mathematically and there's actually a mathematical mathematical purity to the biblical writings there's so much more that i could take in here maybe i should go into it since we're talking about sex and politics many of you don't know the bible many of you just you know do the mumbo jumbo mmm you know that you may be hanging on and then on the locks nags and good but the thing is there's writing is in there and so these things like a still small voice and idols and a babe is their master and women shall rule over them and all of that and i've read it for years on the radio all of my favorite little post notice stuff but here's an interesting one this is very interesting thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed lest the fullness of the seed which thou has sewn be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard in other words you don't mix the plants together thou shall not plow with an oxen and ass together thou shall not wear a mingled stuff wool and linen together now that's interesting now you know the orthodox jews they have a thing that they wear under their clothing with fringes hanging down listen where that comes from thou shalt make the twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering wherewith thou coverst thyself that's interesting why if a man take a wife and go into unto her and hate her and lay wanton charges against her and say i took this woman and when i came night to her i found not in her the tokens of virginity then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate and there's more about that why was it so important to the ancients that a woman be pure and that she not have had sex prior to marriage that's an interesting question unto itself but that has to do with property and you know who the child would be whether it was a child from another man or the man who married that woman it was all about property i only learned last week this is an interesting side story you know i started to talk today about sex and politics i'll go into a famous michael savage diversion which is what you have known me to be famous for okay so we'll go back to the subject at hand which is sex and politics so the young in america believe that the republicans are stodgy old christians they don't even think about jus because there aren't enough of them christians who are going to interfere with their pleasure like the pleasure of using heroin the pleasure of snorting crack the pleasure of getting hooked on fenthonyl the republicans stand against that so they're no good to the college girls who go to nyu and columbia that type of thing that the democrats are very good because they encourage you to have drug sex and as much drugs and sex as you can with any race on the planet anytime you want to do it if it feels good do it why not do it in the road in other words adopt the male gay lifestyle of being an animal in the gutter because that's what it is so how did that happen how did the society become like this and who are the people in america who don't follow those tenants well let's start with extremes of those who don't follow and practice those tenets all the docs jews have very high birth rates why they have very proscribed instructions on uh and when when to sleep with their wife they can only sleep with their wife a few weeks a month and the other weeks they cannot and they're supposed to have sex and children how many people do you know have had wild sex all their lives and they have no children i once said that to someone who thought he was a wild guy in a while and crazy and i said to him all that sex and no children and he looked at me didn't know whether i was complimenting him or criticizing him let him figure it out right so all that sex and no children i have a whole theory on that but that's a separate discussion today we're talking about sex and politics so the orthodox jews have very proscribed rules on when they can sleep with their wife and it's for procreation which is why they have large family six ten twelve children sometimes and that's a very interesting phenomenon now go to the other extreme it's the girls let's say from nyu or the girls from columbia or worse yet the girls from yale stanford or harvard they have no children they usually sleep with their sorority sister or as many of their sorority sisters as they can because they're wild and free aren't they they're really free uh get back to them when they 40 you see how free they are so god says what and who who's god let's say you don't believe in god that's your problem not mine i really don't care what you believe in to be honest with you it's not my issue i'm a journeyer on the planet just like you are and i'm trying to figure it all out and the older i get it's not the less i know or the more i know but certain things i do know certain things are not mine to even know and certain things are immutable truths and that could only be answered in in art and in poetry the things that are unknown for example the great artists try to answer the unknown questions so you go to um some of the great writers like george or will you know him from writing in 1984 or well was one of my favorite authors or well was a socialist in the 30s until he saw what they were doing in hitler's germany national socialism hitler socialist they killed the priests national socialism socialist bernie sanders murderers in their hearts they killed you if they could occasional cortex of filthy witch she killed you put you in a concentration camp if she could one man's opinion okay so where am i going wherever you want me to go most savage nation its savage uncut unfiltered and raw so what are your questions have i done enough or you want me to go on i'm going to have a big glass of water right now i'm going to hydrate everything is a i health thing just to be a glass of water you had a sip of water now it's hydration it's supposed to be good for you oh that's good just tastes good feels good i think read a book on whether i drink water now the stupid things i read i mean i'm a doctorate in nutrition 1978 for the University of California at Berkeley two masters degree certain things matter knowledge matters learning matters real phd's matter real masters degree matter masters degrees matter let's look at degrees and one of the reasons i was motivated to get two masters degrees not one is because i i used to look at role models and they were whether they were in my family they were immigrants and most of them were small merchants they're small stores or work in the trades they weren't rich people they weren't poor people but amongst my people on the outer parameters they were intellectuals who i would hear about like let's say a guy named mild makeup a name i forget eddie or manny i'd hear from brooklyn there was a part of the family in brooklyn and manny was like an engineer and he was very smart he was a younger one i was a kid but i'd listen you know kids listen and uh manny is so smart that manny keeps a pad next to his bed with a pencil so he could write his ideas down sometime in the middle of the night and the women go wow so i heard that and we're not a great idea i keep a pad and a pad next to my bed my whole life because of that and i've written some great ideas on those pads in the middle of the night so that's an example of things that you could learn by listening but then you can learn by studying not just hearing old wives tales but by studying and one of the things i learned along the way when i was working after my bachelor's degree had no meaning it was very hard for me when i went to queen's college i went from a high school i had very poor grades i was like a kid who was very creative didn't know who he was what he was like most kids i came from a allowed immigrant family there was a lot of dissension in the family there was a lot of uh this function they call it today because of my brother was born a certain way everyone was angry at each other all the time blaming each other it was a nightmare so i was like in another world trying to escape i lived in a lot of dreams i had my own dreams i used to build models i obsessively built wooden models you know i'm with glue and paper i built the then plastic models that were great escape escape for me but the fact is i didn't really understand what learning was i went to Hebrew school and i hated the Hebrew school i couldn't stand the rigidity of it i didn't understand the language it's a very difficult language i don't know how the asraelis talk to each other but then i guess if you grow up for speaking Hebrew it's an easy language it's so complicated it's not for an american kid and i learned Hebrew for seven years it was a tough language for me and i read the bible and i read all that stuff but think about how it exercises the mind right you're you're reading a language that's written thousands of years ago with teachings and the child's mind is being trained not on video games not on pornography but on another language and on god's rules that's pretty good for the brain of course that's been thrown out the door except for amongst orthodox jews religious christians and uh i must say religious muslims let's not leave them out of the equation and not all of them are like that ass who gave a speech the other day i think it was at NYU law where she cursed white men and white supremacy they're should have thrown her out right then and there one of very few legal institutions created to recognize that the law is a manifestation of white supremacy that continues to oppress and suppress people in this nation and around the world that's irrelevant i don't run NYU lawyers and read she's going to come out that she curses white males and white supremacy at the NYU graduation for lawyers you hear this that's going to be the next generation of lawyers that kind of filth we don't need in the country if i were running it i would deport her i'd give her a one day trial and send her on a one a one-way ticket to yemen where she could see how far she'd get with her holy robe over there in yemen putting down the country that she lives in but that's another story although i said this would be sex and politics it's mainly going to be about sex and politics not just politics so the orthodox jews the religious christians and the muslims who are not politically fanatic have high birth rates because they control their sexuality they don't fornicate like mink they don't go online to just screw they get married to have children because that's what they're told in the holy books and by their preachers and rabbis and emons go forth and multiply them etc they understand that unless you do that your race or your tribe dies off that goes back to the piece about what i just read you from the bible there's a whole thing on her ownism too why was masturbation prohibited in the bible again because if the guy wouldn't lie with a woman and have a baby the tribe would die out so there were reasons for it in ancient times where we needed a larger population and you could argue that today we don't and therefore homosexuality and transsexuality is an evolution that's required in order to stop the births right that's how the left thinks by the way but if they were really purist in their thoughts they wouldn't be bringing in a races that fornicate at a very high rate and have high numbers of children see so they're liars it's not that they want to reduce population the left they want to reduce the white population because we're the smart people in the country will stand up and they know that we know what the hell they're doing and we're on to them so they want to eliminate us if not directly by shooting us or first working us to death of the slave labor camp they'll do it through propaganda by turning our boys into girls and our girls into boys get it because most of the people who are buying into this crappy insane propaganda and buying that kind of hiding and twisting the minds for children are white people the Hispanics aren't doing it see any Mexicans doing that very few they'd rather you shoot them and shoot you first then you do that to their children but they won't tell you that they're left so the left is at war with the intelligent white people because they feel once they wipe us out they'll be able to rule over the masses and have it all to themselves that's what's behind Bernie Sanders and occasional cortex Elizabeth Warren and the other vile filth who call themselves progressives they're trying to eliminate the white race and bring in other races to control the population more readily and that's the end of that page in today's dissertation on sex and power home of borders language culture the savage nation and so what I'm going to say to you at this juncture is I may pause for a while I'm at 30 minutes now which is enough I can do another piece on sex and politics part two here's some questions dr. Savage would you have babies in today's world it is a scary time a simple answer of course see this is another thing I hear from younger people I don't want to have children in this day and age because I'm afraid for the future that is the most cowardly thinking imaginable that's so narcissistic and so cowardly it's unbelievable I'll give you an example how is it that times are so bad now have you missed the meal recently do you have war going on like in Ukraine right now and nine million people have been forced to leave that's what that's what a bad time is you're afraid of the left so you want to have a baby you're afraid of what's Bernie Sanders so you want to have a baby Nazi concentration camps a seminal moment in human history modern human history some Jews had babies in the concentration camps that's right you don't know the story but I know everything I've studied so much I've read so widely fiction nonfiction I watch a lot of movies I learn a lot I learned from odd I learned from poetry I learned from physics I learned from all sciences I can read any science I'm not good at mathematical symbolism but I can understand almost all sciences if I read it not in mathematical symbolism although I once studied logic and scientific method in mathematical symbols it's not really my cup of tea I'm more award a word oriented person so the fact is that they had babies in the concentration camp why because they wanted life to go on do you understand that in a concentration camp men and women still found each other and somehow got together the Jews put in those camps and some of them had babies in the camps and kept them alive under the most ridiculously insane conditions how many survive through the Nazi terrorists I don't know but they did have babies so you should you think about it okay so what else do you want me you nailed it says Che Martinez reproducing this priceless see a Hispanic name I told you that magic says spread that knowledge Michael what wisdom Bible wisdom you could talk to me forever mr. Savage thanks Susie as bleak as things might seem right I understand blah blah blah we're just in a phase Lou says logic isn't logic in the progressive mind that's true they do not have logic and reason they have only a didactic positions opinions that is truly fearless this thank you it's actual faith that's right that's faith faith faith faith what I wrote a book called God Faith and Reason it was a it was a very popular book God Faith and Reason notice what I combined God both faith in God and Reason to reach reach God God faith and Reason was a brilliant concept I think I've really said all I want to say I just started to talk about sex and politics and how do we wind up being such a screwed up nation today is that you take the sickest the mentally most the weakest minds in America are now put up on a pedestal like they're the smartest people on the planet and we bring in people from other other countries that have nothing to offer us whatsoever we're lied to what told oh they come here to work and yet they're putting in putting them up at our expense luxury hotels or they're living in the gutter where were they working we're all the jobs that they're taking they're not coming here to work they're coming in and work the system and live on the welfare state which makes the government bigger and makes idiots like Joe Biden seem important you know you better get it while you can because this is not going to be forever one day I'm going to wake up I know how this is going to go if I wake up to the understanding that I don't want to do this anymore I just won't do it you'll never hear from you again I won't even say goodbye I've said this for years I was in radio and toward the end I got sick and no one knows it but I went on the air for a year after that despite the fact that cumulus meter was trying to destroy me after I got sick they're amongst the most evil people on the planet in my opinion who run cumulus radio some of the worst scum on the planet if I ever told you what they did to me you wouldn't believe but you know what I don't carry it around I didn't sue them you know why I'm bigger than I don't need the money let him go to hell all I wanted to do was stay in radio one more year and move into the podcast world which I did and I've been doing podcasts for a couple of years and I enjoy podcasts and I love the Newsmax TV shows but I must tell you it's not easy to do okay two original podcasts one replay podcast two or three television segments a week and I bring more to the one segment in television than Sean Hannity has brought to a television in the last 30 years he brings nothing but his sick ego that's why he's so popular so I can close with some things from the Bible what's this I look at some of the things I found in here birds nest birds nest oh I talked about birds nest 20 to 6 I thought that was great if you find a bird's nest you can take the babies but not the mother bird wow if one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath smitten him then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain and it shall be that the city which is nearest unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which might neither be plowed nor sewn and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley I don't go for that that's the part of it I hate it's a violent religion let me tell you that right now if you think I believe everything in this Bible then you don't know who I am I am not a biblical absolutist to me it's you know there was a book called you know instructions for planet earth or something like that by Buck Mr Fuller I have better instructions than he did I learned from many sources it could be a movie at night as I've learned from the holy scriptures but I don't take them all literally because if I were biblical absolutists I'd have to slay me half the people I meet and they'd have to slay me so therefore watch out what you believe and watch out what you don't believe that's number one that's a complex story okay but the fact is is that it's I'm not a biblical absolutist I mean there's things in here I don't I'm gonna stone every woman who's other cultures you have to kill have to women in New York City if not all of them so what are you gonna do with that kill everybody can't do that so you you're looking at it okay that was a really you can't eat shrimp why because in those days I have to bring it down to food why not shrimp because in those days shrimp was probably toxic with the Red Sea and the cock the water the filth and the dirt in the pollution the effluents going in the water you could die eating shrimp today it's different unless you get it from Asia and in big markets it's frozen you could also die from the poison give an example why couldn't you eat pork in the bible why do muslims and orthodox Jews not eat pork I have no idea today pork is clean I don't eat pork because I feel bad for the pig to me a pig I look at a pig's face you know that you can transplant a lot of uh pig organs into humans that's how close we are to them in fact pigs leave cleaner lives than most people in the ACLU I don't know if you know that pigs lean cleaner lives than most people who work for Biden that's right a pigsty has cleaner people than those who advise Joe Biden on a daily basis they it doesn't matter what they eat their minds are so shot that doesn't really matter but I don't know why people don't eat pork I don't eat it I don't eat it because I feel bad for the pig they look very intelligent to me I love reading this sometimes this is great poetry captive who's capped a lot of slavery and captives the rod that's smoky is broken oh man did they do bad things to each other here's a nice one to conclude with for America today your land strangers devour it in your presence shall I pause right there because I do 30 minutes on that one it's Isaiah I loved him because he was really he was such a depressive he was such a depressive Isaiah the vision of Isaiah the sons of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the day of Isaiah ho ham ah ha and has a keyer kings of Judah his will he saw always he pissed off he was pissed at everyone he would have made a good talk show host to a good podcaster Isaiah in fact I should change my podcast the Michael Savage podcast I should change until Isaiah speaks us in full nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evil doers man children that deal corruptly they have forsaken the Lord shall I go on they are turned away backward they are turned away backward oh what and he goes on the whole head is sick wow and the whole heart faint that sounds like America to me you know I did a show on Newsmax TV as a guest for a few minutes on the perversion of the military under this moron defense secretary there's a stooge for the for the left wing fanatics who work for Biden the stooge who runs the defense department I don't know how he puts his clothes on in the morning I mean there's once a real warrior a moron on an idiot a moron so he lets them run the military into the toilet and the recruitment is in the garbage why because every lesson is about how evil white men are and white supremacy and whites are no good so why would a white boy is a tough guy go in the military unless he hates himself so he doesn't go in so what do they have gays lesbians transsexuals and other people who basically don't know what they're doing so they can be led around like by their nose by and large that's what's coming in now as I said on the show why would a boy have gone in the military in the past in non-war time other than to prove himself tough and tougher than the other guy and prove he's tougher than the other guy and why would he go in the military in addition to that because he wants to defend his nation something that's alien to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren because they're landless people they have no people that they believe in they're landless landless you don't like it you could shove it if you don't like it a guy like Bernie Sanders has no country he's landless he has no nation he's landless Michael Savage a host like no other so we'll go back to Isaiah the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the side of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it sounds like America to me wow I don't even want to read anymore your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire not yet it's not yet the summertime after a public and wins the presidency your land strangers devoured in your presence so Biden has brought in at least five million illegal aliens and they're devouring the nation the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in the vineyard what is a booth in a vineyard the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard meaning like a prostitute as a large in a garden of cucumbers these are interesting poetic words as a besieged city except the lord of hosts had left us onto a very small remnant we should have been a as we should have been a Sodom we should have been like unto Gomorrah and they go on I'll read read one more piece how is the faithful city become a harlot she that was full of justice righteousness lodged in her but now murderers sounds like San Francisco New York thy silver has become draw us thy wine mixed with water thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves sounds like the con congress doesn't it mainly the yoke democrats senate everyone loveth bribes wow they knew about fine stein and the inside of trading they knew about how Pelosi became so wealthy and follow with after rewards they judged not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them unless their immigrants of color so i'm going to conclude with something oh look at the cover of this book who wrote this book what he was this book written who was that young guy oh it's me great picture i know the day it was taken and where the enemy within and it was published a long time ago i think it was published in 2003 and i remember quoting that's been picked up by a lot of people since i found it from Cicero see it's right in the beginning of this great book i should have gotten the Nobel Prize for this book alone but i don't believe in prizes they're all political virtually every prize and are it do i have to tell you any more than even prizes in sports are political now you got men dressed as women beating women in sports what sane nation would permit that no we're not a sane nation we're by definition an insane nation we are now by definition an insane nation when you let men dressed up as women destroy women's sports but again this is about sex and politics i guess it all fits now so this introduction by Cicero written by a Roman orator in 42 bc a nation can survive its fools this is about Joe Biden and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely the sly whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself they'll be most of the democrats senators and ninety percent of the republicans look at Lindsey Graham the warmongering bastard that he is oh i got to tell you about him the bastard who's given billions to Ukraine is a pimp for the defense department he had the nerve yesterday to say that the new bill that we were just sold out to believe it's so good for fiscal conservatism bullshit Lindsey Graham didn't like it because he said we're cutting defense spending by 0.001 said less money and for the people who put him in power you know i met Lindsey Graham once i was in the congress i was invited by a congressman i had lunch there and i ran into uh Lindsey Graham and i introduced myself nice you know kind of jolly looking guy and he looked at me and Lindsey Graham said to me michael savage he said you know when i hear you on the radio i think you're you're totally crazy i said well Lindsey don't be so upset i said i listened to you and i know you're crazy set it to his face well he liked that because he likes to be insulted because he comes from an interesting background and we got to talk i swear this is true i said where did you grow up i told him i was an immigrant son and i grew up and why i seek things the way i said where did you grow up senator Graham he said i grew up underneath a whore house he didn't use those words somewhere in the south his father i think ran a whore house and he grew up downstairs so i'll go on now for the trader appears not a trader he speaks in accents from minute to his victims burning sanders and he wears their face and their arguments joey joey joey the president a man of all faces joey he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men white supremacy is the most dangerous threat to america says joey even though he's as white as a ghost he's whiter than i am why does he attack white people he knows that's good for business amongst brown and black people he rucks the soul of a nation joey he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city they don't even work secretly in the middle of the night he affects the body politic so that it could no longer resist a murderer is less to fear so now we move to the last piece of this thing today i only meant to do one sex and politics look where i wound up doing sex and politics now i'm doing politics so i was on newsmax tv and um the host was carl higg be a former navy seal love the guy admire him and i went in the air and i said roamed it i said he wanted me to talk about wokeness in the corporate world and we know about coals and we know about target we know about the uh the other one with the bud light and i i found an article on the wokeness so called in the military i don't like the word mok wokeness i don't like it's overused it has no meaning anymore so i read these five bullet points of what they've done to the military and why young men don't go in the military anymore because and i began by saying roamed did not pass away it was assassinated from within and by the invasion of the barbarians i said we have those two elements going on in america today were being assassinated from within by the left and by the invasion of the barbarians over our border because of the left so then i read about the policies in the military that have come in under this con man trader joe biden that are destroying the recruitment and the clowner runs the defense department you imagine a man like that okay there's no longer any test to determine whether any soldier can meet the fitness requirements for combat specialties that was thrown out under another defense secretary who worked for another one to ensure that female service members could meet the demanding rigors involved in qualifying for combat so at the time secret defense ashton cauter who was the president then created gender neutral standards and they lowered the standards because then they found that women were not scoring as highly as men and as a result of fierce pressure from lgbtq groups the army threw out the test altogether so now there's no test to determine whether any soldier can meet the fitness requirements for combat specialties that's number one number two in january 2021 the trade of joe biden signed an executive order that open military service to all transgender individuals it got worse since then the corrupt biden ministration as decreed that active members of the military can take time off from their duties to obtain sex change surgeries and all related hormones and drugs at taxpayer expenses biden did that to the military yeah wonder why children boys are not going in the military then when they come out of the sex change they get up there they were a new general or like that general guy whatever his name is lavine all right there were 50 push-ups what young man would want to listen to that freak three along similar lines the bright administration has recently ended support for long-term policy prohibiting individuals affected with hiv from serving in combat zones why because they were sexist a little but also for good reason the policy of not letting people with hiv serving combat zones was based on hard science hard science tied to the need for hiv medications and the danger of course infection through shared blood can you understand that if men are serving in combat at one gets hit and he needs a blood transfusion on the spot you want to get it from someone with hiv you're more on you in order to satisfy your political needs you schmuck idiot moron one more the biden administration's chief of naval operations admiral michael gilday god knows i hope this guy has a history because i don't know what he's done to himself last year he edited a book called how to be an anti-racist a critical book on critical race theory which is critical race theory is hate white people theory they hate white people and they call it critical race theory and they make all naval cadets read that it gets worse in this book written by this black hater one of its famous arguments is that capitalism is essentially racist and that to be truly anti-racist you also have to be truly anti-capitalist that's what they're brainwashing young men and women in the navy with under joe biden finally at west point there are slides being given to all the young cadets understanding whiteness and white rage white power at west point chairman of the joint chief of state of general moch millie let's that go on that fat slob was formerly a member of the hundred and first airborne how this fat slob could have let this happen he'll live in infamy forever if this country ever survives what we are going through under this purge today guys like milie and that moron in the defense department will be remembered as the traders they are they are who sissaro wrote about to let this happen general millie said i want to understand white rage and i'm white said general millie patcy you are he said i've read mauset doing and i've read carl marks every linen that doesn't make me a communist but it makes you a fat sellout millie i want to understand white rage and i'm white and i want to understand it i've read milie say tongue i've read i've read carl marks i've read lennon that doesn't make me a communist so what is wrong with understanding having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend you got real fat on your job and i'm sure you'll be rewarded by the defense contractors once you're out so um i'm still here many of you grew up with me i get such a wonderful comments i'm 40 and i've been listening to you since i'm 15 it's very hard for me to believe how i've influenced so many people and um it's very touching when i hear people have grown up listening to me and now they're grown men and i've influenced them it means a lot to me when you touch people in the right way and uh if i can keep doing these for any number of years of time a month that god wants i'll keep preaching it i'll keep preaching it those of you who stood with me through radio while cumulus was trying to kill me after i had that heart attack they tried to kill me you have no idea how strong i had to be to not disappear from the radio i fought with them for a year while i was mending from a heart attack to stay on the air for that one more year to say goodbye to you i wouldn't let them make me disappear they're run by some of the most evil people on the planet who you've never heard of they're just like bident they're like occasional cortex okay and there are some people who still broadcast on cumulus ask yourself how they can maintain their jobs my friends i'm michael savage thank you for listening today's story was called what was today's time say i wrote it this morning this is the the pad for manning sex and politics how is it that the countries most obsessed with sex have the lowest birth rates and those countries with the greatest sexual repression have the highest birth rates it's not a hundred percent accurate as a theorem but it was a good operational theory to begin with and i want to say one last thing that's been plaguing me recently i started to get to it during this little thing today about why i got two masters degrees instead of one you have to understand something so i said the manny and the intelligent people and i grew up worshiping educated people people who wrote books for like gods to me real books and i see that um you see a thing like this the two masters degrees i read along the way that i think it was hermit hoover i'm not a hundred percent sure was a mining engineer correct me if i'm mistaken and i read that his master's degree was a design for the brooklyn bridge so i said holy god that's what a master's degree meant something so i said i'm going to get not one but two masters degrees why because i remember in college at queen's college when i really didn't know what the hell was going on i had some intelligent friends i don't know where they went or what they became some of them i knew and whatever and they they once said about somebody like he was a god this teacher has two masters degrees and a phd and he looked up to him again i said i'm going to get two masters degrees and a phd this is how you're influenced by who you hang out with if you hang around with morons or idiots you're going to wind up a moron or idiot if you lie with the lousy you're going to get lice and then anyone teach you that if you lie with the lousy you're going to get lice didn't you mother teach you that if you hang around with people who smoke dope you're going to become a dope go and get real degrees not in black studies not in ethnic studies not in hating whitey get a real degree in a real field i met a young boy the other there was walking around outside a club a little somewhere forget where and i struck my conversation with someone outside of yad harbor he's a young guy he didn't know me i didn't know him and he said he goes to a university of maryland he's a young kid like a freshman and i said uh what um is in a dangerous there in bollton more he said not really the campus is very nice i said that's good to hear you know a lot of things are stereotypes and uh then he said i said what are you studying he said well i'm doing a joint major as a young kid at mac bachelor's level in astro physics and neuroscience i said you're kidding me i said that's brilliant i understood why his mind would want to study astro physics and neuroscience they're very similar at a certain level i said whatever you wind up doing in life you'll come out a better man for that because logic will help you in any field and that's what degrees used to be about teaching you how to think and i'm lucky i grew up in the classical age of a liberal education it has no meaning anymore liberal education but it liberal education taught us to think widely and learn widely and how to think for ourselves now you're considered an enemy of the state if you are think too widely and think for yourself you're now an enemy of the state that wants you to have no thoughts other than theirs so if you're a young person listening to me get a real degree in a real field and don't let anyone tell you it's worthless it's worth a lot a good master's degree in a real field is worth an awful lot you get it people say what are you going to get at san francisco i'm not going to get out of san francisco i have a home in florida i don't want to live in florida right that's a great state i love the san francisco i think he's actually a great man and i saw his interview on uh news max last week i was absolutely you know they said blown away i was knocked out because the myth of the san francisco is that he's a bumblery stupid he's it's all false it was just all false the guy is brilliant and a fabulous speaker and has great policies by the way and anyone who was a navy seal i respect and he did fight an iraq by the way before we can an uh judge advocate in in the military at quontanamo in the seals he's really an all-around great guy and how you can attack his wife who is one of the finest women on earth mrs. desanthus is beyond me and the woman is not only a fine wife and a fine mother she survived a double mastectomy and you vermin of the left have the nerve to attack her and you say nothing about that fraud joe biden that fake doctor with a degree in sociology you bums you like you attack mrs. trump a beautiful woman spoke numerous languages one of the most beautiful women on earth and you put her down your pieces of garbage but i'm not shocked by the left see now i'm getting angry and i have to stop someone just said the san francisco needs charisma we talked about so many things today got this because of the manny in me

repression of the highest birth rates and i try to explain it to you i didn't think i would i was able to finish the entire discussion with it's not definitive not a textbook which covers everything
