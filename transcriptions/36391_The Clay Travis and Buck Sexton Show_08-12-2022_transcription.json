Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Second hour of Clay and Buck gets going right now, and it has a special guest joining us. The one and only, Anne Coulter. She is, of course, the author of 13 New York Times Best Sellers, and has a sub-stack, an syndicated column. So subscribe to Anne's sub-stack for video content and her column there. Ms. Coulter, I hear from a little voice in the background that it is your birthday, so happy birthday, first and foremost to you. Thank you. Yes, that's because I tell everyone weeks and a day out. So we're pleased to be part of your celebration today. So Anne, I wanted to ask you, you know, we have these stories going on every day now, it seems. At least Fox is covering it. Clay and I talk about it. The border is so bad and so dystopian when it comes to lawlessness, constant illegal crossings, and it's all really, well, I shouldn't say all, but it's primarily through asylum requests, right? So it's not even, oh, if only we would catch these people. They're turning themselves in in huge numbers and saying, I want asylum. None of them are going to get asylum, but they're pretending like that's, this is the whole scam. Then they get led to the country, they stay, they don't get, no one gets deported based under Biden. I thought this should be a bigger issue in the midterms. Why don't people care more about this? Do they care more about this? What do you think? Oh, it's a huge vote gap era. It's a problem though, getting Republican politicians to talk about immigration. Because as you've heard me banging on about for years, the donors want the cheap labor. They want open gorgers the same way the left does. And they got politicians ears. I mean, that's what was so great about Trump's 2016 campaign. Once the campaign was over and he won the election, everything he was ever going to accomplish had been accomplished. And that was just showing politicians. I don't care if they're Republican or Democrat. The country, ordinary voters, not the ones who have billion dollar lobbyists in Washington, are desperate for there to be a wall on the border, for illegal aliens to be deported, for there to be fewer legal immigrants coming in. I mean, year after year after year Americans are polled on this. Do you want more immigration? The same, less immigration. They keep saying less than the politicians keep giving us more. So yeah, of course it's a huge issue. The other reason it didn't really come up much in the midterms was that the man who who's accomplished everything he was going to accomplish as of election night 2016 demanded that all these Republican candidates make the stolen 2020 election. There are number one issue. I mean, we are leaving in terms of crushed by Donald Trump. And I was thinking of which I wanted my bet with, um, clay traffic. Please remind me of that. Well, what was the bet? I forget. What's the new phone? Who's this? I'm not even sure who was talking. What is the, what, the Herschel Bette? Is this the Herschel Walker? Yeah, Herschel Walker. I owe you, I owe you a stake. I told Buck as we finished the first hour, I was like, I think I lost a big bet to Ann, but maybe she won't remember. And can I ask you, you know, I put out a poll. I was just curious, I put up poll on Twitter and it got like 60,000 votes, which it's not scientific, but a lot of people weighed in. Um, and, and it was about responsibility for, uh, what happened specifically in Georgia. And I put Herschel Walker, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, or just right in basically. A lot of people wrote in with different things to be fair. The most responsible for the loss was the question. Like, yeah, responsible for the loss. Is that not, yeah, responsible for the loss in Georgia. What did, how much does leadership really matter? I mean, we had Kevin McCarthy on the show yesterday. I get more angry emails about Mitch McConnell probably than anyone else in American. Like more than, you know, Nancy Pelosi or you name it. Is that the problem? Does it make a big difference? How do you see all that? Well, coincidentally, I wrote about in my column this week. Look at that. It went up yesterday morning. Um, no, there's no question. Trump is 100% responsible for Herschel Walker. I mean, it wasn't like it was Herschel's lifelong dreams run for Senate in March, uh, 2021. It was Trump who put out a statement. Um, whoa, Herschel would be the best. He should run for the Senate. He'll take the, he'll be unstoppable just as he was on the football field for my US football league run Herschel run. Um, and why? Why did he think? Why did Trump think that Herschel Walker would be a fantastic candidate? This is why everyone knowing he had, you know, string of legitimate children throughout the South. Look, he's a fine guy. I did everything I could, by the way, to lose that bad clay Travis. I was, I was promoting Herschel. Um, obviously he's better than, than any Democrat by the, why are you putting up problematic candidates? Oh, yeah. Because he was on celebrity apprentice and played for Trump's defunct football league. That's how Trump picks candidate. It's clear we were taking some incoming bombs on this one. Go ahead, sir. No, look, I mean, I worked hard and we'll have to, I will take you out the dinner. Buckle probably involved too, uh, because I definitely lost, I worked as hard as I could for Herschel to win. Same thing as you did. And I wanted him to win desperately. I was pretty crushed. I'm not going to lie that we lost Georgia, uh, that we lost Nevada, that we lost to Arizona, that many of those candidates did. I think the fact that Federman one is maybe the biggest indictment of the American electorate that I have seen in some time and also a further endorsement of the fact that if you have a debicide, your name, unlike Republicans, Democrats just show up and vote party line because a lot of Republicans split their ticket. You know, uh, Brian Kemp won by seven and a half points over Stacey Abrams, who was a well-funded candidate. And I think that's a good point. I mean, I've been with every other Republican one in the state of Georgia, other than Herschel, uh, but Republicans, they lost because they switched their vote. So Buck made a good point, uh, and I gave you credit for this. Wait a minute. I disagreed with everything you just said. Okay. Okay. You disagree with everything. All right. But I'm, but I made a good point. So can we remember what you did? And you disagree with everything I just said. Tell me why you disagree with it. As a matter of fact, I mean, I agree with you. If I don't say you disagree with the candidate, you're own facts. Say that. Yeah. Kemp won, um, sorry, governor of, of Georgia, Brian Kemp, whom and the secretary of state, um, Brad Ratson burger. primary republic and governor of of georgia and the republican governor of georgia one that primary by fifty point yes the voters are trying to tell us we are done with with trump we are what i'm saying yes and i think we're agreeing that i'm saying is republican voters it was one hundred percent trump again because he was he was encouraged it was one of it was master yano the guy running for governor he was a nut his number one issue was as i'm recommended that he insisted impression republicans to say the stolen election master yana was at the capital on january six he wanted to try women for murder for having abortion you're gonna run candidates like that no i could have won that master yano dragged him down okay so we agree on some of that i guess what i'm saying is it's republicans in many of the states splitting their tickets that actually cost republican candidates right because it's not a problem it's okay so you're you're analysis is that trump is causing that to happen so what i was going to build on here is in georgia one yeah they're not getting their tickets for governor's art attorney general secretary of state but if you're going to keep that pushing the ideas of this narcissistic moron infant yeah we're that republicans are going to keep saying please just send us a normal republican please please and by the way i was shocked at how well despite my bet with you i was rooting like mad for her shall walker and i thought that republican voters you know god bless them they kept from the way this time um and and camped the popular governor of georgia campaign for her shall i thought it was going to be forty five fifty five it was really close so i don't think you can blame republican voters in georgia they came out and voted for the republican even though it was not it he was an imperfect candidate let's put it that way okay so what i was going to say by the way just bombs in every direction i was gonna say we gotta call this segment within bombs away or like get into the binder which i respect uh... throwing throwing bombs here buck had a thesis i think he gave you credit for it um that the reason why the politically correct era in the nineties ended was because oj was found not guilty yes we we i did give a credit because we sent her the clip yes that's right um so how do we break the woke virus in the united states one of the reasons why i was so crushed by both 2020's outcome and 2022 and is it felt like a perfect time to destroy the uh democrat party for their woke virus and yet they continue to win and the woke virus gets crazier and crazier how do it does it end how do we lance this boil how do we rid the body politic of this absurd woke virus yes funny i've been thinking the exact same thing that is the thesis of my book mug um and i go through just ramped its crime much like we're going through right now um in 70s 80s we come upon the 90s and if you were alive during the oj verdict you will remember this there was there was a moment when when oj was found not guilty and black americans throughout america howard university um you know fast food places historically black colleges across the country cheered cheered everyone seen the trial or another but to know that that oj was was in fact guilty um cut off cut off his ex-wife's head and killed her on goldman and to see black people cheering the the acquittal of i i mean i think oj is hilarious on twitter and i don't know if you follow them on twitter um and what's uh can the cut you in here but you know that there are tons of 20 something girls sleeping with oj now in los vegas i have friends out there he goes out all the time and girls just throw themselves at him many of whom were born after the double murder well other than the double murder pretty cool cat he is pretty entertaining on twitter and that woke america up it used to be exactly the way it is now the woke up the way it is now um you know you'd constantly have these blow hard to dwell i think the problem in america is is the the system accurate racist and that phrase didn't exist yet but oh it's white racism and that's one it was the greatest thing that ever happened to black americans because it was just like was i say in the book it was like a subway card that didn't work anymore pulling this racism bs and i've been wondering what what what is it going to be is it going to be maybe this britany griner trade today um but if you want to stop losing um because it really didn't thought this should have been a red wave here this should have been a red tsunami wave yep you have to start telling the truth to your listeners that trump is a big fat loser he lost 40 seats in the house for us in 2008 he lost the election his own election in 2020 when there was a red wave across the country well and i still have we have a state back because i think trump is still gonna be the nominee so i think you're gonna be in a very what so so i i guess the question is truth to your listeners well look i mean i think we're gonna have a big trump is i think we're gonna have a big battle in 2023 and i think it's gonna be between the and trump is so dumb but you are ginning up these these few and far between dead enders did you see that because we're not giving up anybody i think i would be trump versus disanthetist and they're part of a lot you're telling they're part of a large group no they're not no they're not they're they're slightly bigger than q one oh god well this well this very large group is actually going to be sending us emails for the next two days about how you know that that there i will say i will say this all right let me just say this i think that buck and i are going to provide a form and this is important for a real debate about what the future of the republican party should be and it's going to be like everybody gloves off throw in punches and what i respect about an is she doesn't tip toe up she's not pretending to tell you what exactly she thinks and i think this is the real conversation this is why like people who think when disantis and trump if it happens get into a ring that it's going to be a really nice well organized boxing match it's gonna get ugly it's gonna throw off their gloves and they are going to try to gouge each other's eyes out and you have to everybody out there listening has to get ready for that it ain't going to be a genteel affair and to be fair miss colter we call a lot more balls and strikes here on the trumpster than a lot of the other folks in the radio world i will tell you your congratulations saying it's it is true that we actually were willing to say i i i was kelly uncommon something to brag about so how does this play out then and in your mind you don't you buck and i have bet i think we both have stake bets on this i've already lost a stake bet to the extent that i have because i said her show was going to win i really thought he was um how does this play out in 23 in your mind um i think there are so few people who are still supporting trump though they turn tune into fox news and your radio show and think they're part of some large group no their pathetic deadheads following them around look at the pictures from his presidential announcement and draft look i i'm sure they i feel about them the way i feel about jimmy swagger followers probably the followers were lovely people but i have about 10 more minutes of patience with them they have got to wake up you oh no we got we got to bring along all the all the this the trump voters are our family and we got all mobilized together here but and we actually are at time so we want to say happy birthday and people can right and at her substat i say one more thing very quickly i think we literally have like 20 seconds but yeah right after you announce 2015 introduce again i don't know anyone who supported him in 2015 we still support them now no these are all the johnny come lately we supported him for the issue that he betrayed us okay check out and call to sub stack everybody i love the flamethrower i love the flamethrower buck we should open up phone call we should open up phone lines at this point the flamethrower all lit clay so thank you and okay we're good that's good i mean i still think trump's going to be the nominee and we're going to throw everything we have behind him and i think and i think that trump rings a lot to the table that nobody else does but and is unhappy with the way the midterms went and i i understand that's that's a part of it anyway yeah the phones are exploding 800 282 282 big tent big conversation here and uh let's talk about something else for a second cyber thieves we could all agree we don't like cyber thieves agreed so many people these days are buying gifts online they're putting all of the information out there they're buying airline tickets putting their credit card out there and hoping that the data doesn't get stolen but there are cyber hackers online who plant malware and work harder than ever to create a data breach they can obtain hundreds of thousands of online records and maybe yours in the process there's virtually no way to protect yourself without help that help comes from life lock their online identity theft protection scans the web looking for evidence that your information is being used by someone other than you and without your permission when they see it life lock is immediately in touch with you if you become a victim of identity theft life lock will work to fix it they do that by assigning you a restoration specialist who can help you sort out the mess and restore your good name now no one can prevent all identity theft or monitor all transactions at all businesses but it's easy to help protect yourself with life lock join now save up a 25 percent off your first year with promo code buck call 1-800-LIFELOCK or head to lifelock.com use promo code buck for 25 percent off whoo welcome back everybody to clay end buck so we just had on uh and culture have a discussion well actually i want to talk to you about immigration and crime it turned into let's put all the cards on the table let's let's actually just lay this out for everybody there's a lot of back and forth right now i hear it all the time i was at a dinner last night with 20 rock solid republicans down here in uh in florida and we actually did just for fun we did a straw poll and the straw poll came out pretty close to even between desantis and trump as in who it wasn't who they won it was who they think to be fair who they think will be the uh the nominee so i sit here and i say to myself okay this is going on all over the place every person that i know who cares about politics right now clay and i are talking about this taxing each other updates who's saying what how are things going who is going to lead this party going forward and i'm going to say this anyone who thinks that they know for sure as in they can predict the future of who i i think is mistaken i think it's very possible it's trump i think it's very possible desantis i think it's also you know it's a crazy world we live in and we're not going to know for at least another six months or so who the republican nominee is even likely to be um based on actual polling that's going on and you know six months give or take i'm just pulling it out of thin air but so we wanted to bring it on here and and allow somebody who keep in mind and for people who are saying because i know we're good at these emails they'll say hey you guys have a duty and obligation in the house that rush built and i always say yeah we absolutely do and that's to have a conversation that brings in people within the party first of and in rush we're very close friends i don't know i think some folks know that or they were close friends for many years um and and obviously wrote a book in trump we trust and was one of his earliest supporters earliest supporters and then turned on him as a result of what he did in office now i could have sit here it's hard in radio i don't want to sit here and argue he was right though on china and china trade policy like you can't just leave all the he was right i i don't only want to get into all the things you'd say because if we had another voice you people would say what about the booming economy the trump had what about the deregulation the trump had what about the u.s. mexo-canada trade agreement what about dealing with china what about no new war what about the best border control we've seen in two decades that has to be a part of the conversation but there are people who have substantial followings right now in the world of conservatism clay who are having this discussion as to who should be the leader of the party and we i think have to have a forum for people within that family on the right to discuss what the direction what the future is if we only serve one side of that discussion we're not saying we're taking sides here if we only serve one side of that discussion i think we do a disservice i think this show is a big public forum for people who are conservative for people who are libertarian for people who frankly maybe left a leaning in the past but have come over because of the authoritarianism that they have seen in the wake of covid and also what happened to brett kavanagh and all those things and i think if we pretend that this is not going to be as i said when an was on this is going to be a nasty eye gouging rolling around in the mud battle over who is the nominee in 2024 this is not going to be some situation where trump clears the field like it was in 2020 and you and me and buck and everybody out there said hey we're all in for trump and can i can i have a lot of divisions and i want to throw this in there too would trump have even been trump without having to go through that primary and defeat people that by the way we have on the show and we think are you know ted kruz a fantastic senator and and a really good american and you and i both like him you know marca ruebio is doing a really good job in florida trump had to beat those individuals it got a little nasty sometimes but by the time trump made his way through that primary he was a you know a well-oiled machine going up against hilly clinton so it's likely there's going to be some kind of a primary here we want to hear from folks on this one um and we want to hear voices that aren't just going with whatever me my voice is bring on guests that aren't just going with whatever they think the consensus is at any one point in time you can agree or disagree with dan buck or with an with and she's super smart she's super smart and she represents a segment of the republican base i'm going to tell you there are a lot of yeah there are a lot of people that want it to be desantis i'm just going to tell everybody out there right now but they're scared of upsetting the trump supporters that are their friends that they love that's out there that's out there and you see this for a good and percent accurate and by the way you're i think you're point about being out to dinner you were with 20 people last night in florida and you've been basically did a straw poll uh i'm i'm having the same kind of straw polls all the time when i'm out to dinner number one question that people in media and i think republicans are talking about privately is you team uh trump or you team desantis now look desantis hasn't even answered uh announced yet and he may not he may decide that he's not going to do it i think he's going to run i think you think buck he's going to run yes but until he's officially in the battle that's not a definite but all of you out there listening right now may well have to make this decision so we have got loaded lines we will take a real wrapped and stacked here yes uh and let's see who's up first let's go to uh hold on i'm going to pull up the other let's do bill in north kebillin north carolina starts it off yeah let's see what bill has said go for it bill hey guys how you doing that good hey i just had you know listening to and culture having been a fan for a very long time going back to her first books about the clinton administration i think and needs to do a little soul searching on who she has aligned herself with on the never trump side for the record i was a cruise guy in 16 broke my heart when when he didn't get the nod but buck you just you just pretty eloquently laid out trump's accomplishments i think conservatives have for a very very long time wanted someone ragan asked type who was the counter puncher trump was the the rocket feller wing of the republicans gave us 40 years in the wilderness and trump was completely unafraid of opposition of the media of of anything and everything that was thrown at him so if if and is comfortable aligning herself with the lincoln project the national review the no no hold on can i say something there because you're eloquent yeah you're eloquent on this issue when we appreciate you you know weighing in on what everything you've said i just to be clear there are people that became so anti- trump that they abandoned the right and is not one of those people she's just anti- trump she doesn't she doesn't go on cnn and do the whole oh everybody should go vote for uh rafael warnock or whatever we've seen a lot of never trumpers yeah so just just now i'm not saying you're necessarily saying that but i'm saying there are some people on the right who haven't sold out their principles they just don't think trump is the future but i i think look on the counter puncher point your trump had that in a way that we've met we haven't seen anybody on the republican side really in my lifetime trump is fearless and that is what attracts you and me and many people to him that doesn't mean that trump is infallible or that he deserves to not have to win the 2024 and i think buck you made a good point trump wouldn't have been trump if he didn't go through the 18 or 19 contenders in 2016 and effectively fillet them right on an actual state he earned it right that's the point he earned it in a way you know he was boxing and he had to beat the stepping stones or whatever to get to the the actual title fight tom brady doesn't get to go to the super bowl every year even though he's the greatest quarterback of all time he still has to go through all the contenders every year to get to the super bowl and we know that the lines and the by the way if you want to send us an email right away we're reading those emails become a vip at clayenbuck.com that's a good time if you want to cut right through clayenbuck.com vip emails if you become a subscriber david in south carolina david what do you got for us hi guys yeah i just uh tired of hearing about these people immediately they're going to blame trump i blame the republican establishment uh especially mitch mcconnell there's no leadership in the senate um and uh you're talking about blaming him for 20 sorry to cut you off david you're talking about blaming them for 2022 for the midterms yeah yeah i mean these guys should have been there's no leadership in the senate they should have been there in georgia they should have had all these guys they're pushing they were laid on everything the financing was going in the wrong place pulling financing on these things and if he would have won he would have given himself credit the leadership the redistricting killed us uh i don't think they fought hard enough the establishment the governors in the estates that killed us we had so many house races that were close that we lost and we still got seats so we did all right but the the combat trump it's the same thing mitch mcconnell opposed you know ragan back in the tea party there the establishment you know the wall street journal editorial page times it's just they want to go they want to blame everything on trump what about oday they're they're back candidate calorally got to slaughter look so you're you're with i i try by the way i was trying to get this into end but you know she she got rolling and the problem with radio is if you try to talk over or you know it just turns into crosstalk and we want to respect our audience's ability to hear everything that's being said all the time but i was going to say what about mitch mcconnell because a lot of people are upset about mitch mcconnell but that's a topic we'll return to you one more before we go to break by the way 800-282-282 where lines wide open we want to hear from you across the country on this eddie in virginia what do you got eddie how you doing we're great you know i i i got i like trump and i like this policies and i go to frame and uh but i

program and we are joined now uh by media giant i'd like to be referred to that one day uh radio industry veteran uh jeff smaulian uh he has done an amazing job as the c o of m is communications he's got a brand new book never write a rollercoaster upside down the ups downs and reinvention of an entrepreneur uh and i love this uh jeff and thank you for coming on with us you say there's a fine line between a genius and an idiot uh some people would say we walked that line sometimes straying in both directions on this radio program every day what have you found in business about that fine line well i i've said you know that there is a fine line and i've been on many sides many times both sides uh and in the book i have a chapter idiot to genius which is the start of wf an which is the first all sports radio station and all of our guys said it was a single stupidest idea of all time uh jim lampley called it the vietnam war of emmas uh and it was it kind of a disaster and since it was my baby i got needleed about it they called it smolians folly and then one day it turned around we put down imis on the air we had russo and francesa and the next day it was a national success and i went from idiot to genius um and then after that we bought the seattle mariners and i was kind of the boy wonder out there and i was signing autographs and and doing all sorts of interviews and everybody loved the marketing and the new look of the team and i was a genius and then when it didn't work i became an idiot i always said there's nothing worse than being an idiot in front of 40,000 people every night so that's what's the move go ahead go ahead judge f no i just said that that's what i've learned about life that's why it's a rollercoaster sometimes you win sometimes you lose you just get to you know grit your teeth and smile through all of it if someone's coming up to you and they say you know i think i want to either start a business or take a big risk you know an expansion so some form of of entrepreneurial shift or elevation if someone's like i want to do this how do you advise them because i know we got a lot of people listening who maybe already have a business or thinking about starting a business and they might sit back and say oh i don't know should i really do this what do you say when people come up to you as somebody who have tried things and had big successes but also taken big risks well i and that's why i wrote the book i think listen i think if you believe in something and you love it and you're willing to you know put it all in the line and have that kind of passion i think you can be successful you aren't always successful but i think you know if you if you want to do something you care passionately enough about it you gotta do it you started sports talker radio and people out there listening know that i came from the sports talker radio universe you also owned the seattle mariners at one point right i'm curious uh bucket i was just talking this desantis versus trump battle reminds me of alabama versus auburn it reminds me of ohio state versus michigan conversations that can take place depending on those marketplaces every single day yankies red socks is another good one where that rivalry is so passionate it fuels the conversation all the time right what did you find about sports talker radio and a lot of people dream about it but what was it like owning a pro sports franchise well i'm one of my favorite lines of somebody once said every man in america once owned a major league baseball team except the 28 guys who do but i loved it we made a lot of friends i was proud of the work we didn't see at all i always said we weren't we weren't rich enough to own the mariners i joked and said you really had to be a billionaire to own the mariners or the can't the city royals but if you had a good paper route you could own the ankeys of the dodgers you know it was just the economics were wildly different in those days but i loved it i'm really proud of some of the things stuff and the stuff we invented in the ballpark situational music movie clips and contests and games uh you see everywhere now but it was absolutely revolutionary then we're speaking to jeff smaul yanney's the founder and CEO of emiss communications his book is never ride a rollercoaster upside down good advice by the way the ups downs and reinvention of an entrepreneur jeff what are you what are the trends that you see right now in media i mean we're talking to you right now on radio stations across america but we also have uh website clannabock.com we've got podcast going we've got streaming video um you know clay built a a sports uh digital sports business at out kick we both do hits on tv at fox and you know what do you see as the trajectory right now streaming is a big part of the conversation subscription service is a big part of the conversation where do you see it all going well it's all fragmented so much and i think you know the the biggest challenge of streaming uh is can you find enough subscribers uh can you find an economic model it's easier with talk than this with music because you have giant music royalties which is why spotify went into podcasting um you know so they didn't have to pay the royalties it is it's a fragmented world if you if you follow the streaming services and video uh there's a big question as to whether the regional sports networks can survive because so many people have cut the cords uh we have you know three hundred and what forty million people and everybody's got you know fragmented places they go um and it's hard to know how it'll shake out only that it's totally different and you have to sort of be a flexible and up to adapt i think you guys have done a brilliant job you know putting your content in a lot of different places it may work in some places it may not be profitable in others but i think we're in an era where you just have to experiment with a lot of different things we have to question a lot uh jeff and i appreciate you coming on and the book sounds really fascinating if you were talking to a young person today and buck said you know you're interested in entrepreneurship but if you were interested in moving into media what would you tell them is the most important thing they should be learning in order to train themselves going forward well again i think there's two things i think number one um the most important thing is your word when you work with somebody if you if they know your word is good and they trust you that that helps you an awful lot in any enterprise i don't care whether it's you know starting a job or being married or having kids or or having friends i also think again you have to have the passion uh i i had to tell people starting out when you get a new job volunteer for more stuff people can count on you and the more you know you are willing to go out and do things the more you move up you know the food chain no doubt the book is fabulous we need to have you on maybe somewhere down the line again we appreciate all the support you've shown for this show and we would encourage everybody out uh there to go make sure that they check it out uh the book again never ride a rollercoaster upside down the ups downs and reinvention of an entrepreneur on the way out i'll let you say this you obviously have an incredible uplifting sort of mindset about you how much of your success do you think is internal based on the energy that you put out into the world for everybody out there in terms of their own lives well i think it's internal because i think you have to have a spark although i've said somebody said what's it take to be an entrepreneur i said look we're all the entrepreneurs of our own lives you know that we really are i think part of its internal part of it is i've been fortunate to work with people my whole career who i just love and who make me look smarter than i am every day and that helps a lot no doubt jeff smaulian is the author we encourage you to go check out his book thank you for the time today sir thanks thanks guys it's great thank you no doubt uh we're here every day to let you know uh to try to make sure that you don't have to ever visit the post office again especially you know what i was doing yesterday buck i had to go to post

i can assert a degree of uncredential but absolute expertise i have the equivalent in my mind at least of a PhD in action movies i grew up i had vhs tapes that i watched until they were falling apart of all the short snager movies all the all the the Stallone movies i was more of a short snager guy i'm gonna be honest but you know young guns with them i find emelio estives is one of the finest movies of the 80s his finest a very underrated western for what it is yummy i want to also really good both of those young guns was an excellent franchise i think that was there a third one i don't remember now but i don't remember if there was a third but also all the all the various martial arts action movies you know van dam i celebrated van dam's whole catalog and he's a very interesting character as we see later on in life i bring all of this up because jennifer Lawrence jennifer Lawrence has come out to say that she was the first and you know like i'm isn't she from she's from Nashville what's with all these uh luva i believe oh luva okay i thought she's a kentucky and yes he's a kentux so close close by so you know you have to take you and your folks here in that region have to take responsibility for all responsibility for SEC state shenanigans i think that's fair yeah she you know because she's lovely but her politics not so good she spoke at an interview in vera in variety and she said that she what nobody ever put this is the quote nobody ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn't work because we were told girls and boys can both identify with the male lead but boys cannot identify with a female lead i'm sorry but Ripley from alien and aliens would like to have a word among other female action i'm sorry lynda hamilton in terminal one in terminal two you know if you're gonna mow off and try to get social justice points or whatever wokeness points don't don't make it so easy for us you know what i mean come on it's also disappointing i would say only in the context of if you are a movie buff to say nothing of a movie star you would think you would have seen aliens in terminator because they're two of the most iconic films of that of the i think aliens is one of the one of the 10 best action movies of that of that period honestly i think aliens come out like 81 oh you know alien came out i think it i think aliens was later like 85 or 86 but the team can check for us but yeah segorty weaver was phenomenal both 19 i was thinking even made it maybe late 70s but both of those are 1980s or late 70s iconic films right um and to not be familiar with those is embarrassing for jennifer lorence who seems totally normal and also simultaneously oh alien didn't come out until 1986 okay so that was like later than i thought i mean i'm not a i'm not a quinton tarantino fan for example like i don't like most of his room in though yes umothermen in kill bill kill bill i think is actually his most watchable movie for what it is and uh and kill bill umothermen is is excellent that lara kroft lara as in mrs travis yes lara kroft the tomb raider movies i mean there's so many it's just i but this thing even she's made clays she's made tens of millions of dollars and you know she's one she won the genetics lottery she's quite lovely and uh you know physically and she's got a wine and complain and make it seem like women have it so hard in films really that's where we're going now give me a break let me clarify this because we're gonna get blown up alien came out in 1979 okay aliens came out in 1986 which i believe was the sequel right so uh so rippley 1989 the original alien um and i think also aliens one of the best sequels of all time up there with terminator two the godfather two aliens is an enhancement to the franchise and fortunately it went substantially downhill from there i'm still trying to think about all the different women action leads there've actually been so many of them it's a wilful ignorance and also i would say this i don't know who did the interview and who did the story but this is also an example of just totally if you're writing about movies when she said that as the interviewer there should have been some pushback and there should have been like well you know segornie weaver pretty big deal uh and uh and and you're kind of stepping on linda hamilton and what she did in terminator those are big female led uh action movies i mean for some some folks may even remember from the konan the barbarian era red sonya which i think was a b movie but she's swinging a sword around and stuff hey i i was a big he-man guy they did bring out shira to try to appeal to all and they made a movie about it too i think wasn't there was it the bionic man or the bionic woman or was there both i think they did both i think they did both too so this this is where you know it's ridiculous but every clay it's not enough to be rich and famous you have to also be beloved for your political stances these days which is just a shame do your kids by the way do they have the boys do they like the hunger games is that a thing still the people read we haven't watched any of the hunger games i think those are to be fair like kind of or rated aren't they i mean they're pretty i think so i'm having the hunger games right now i'm pretty hungry i'm gonna get a sandwich it's not a bad move it's pretty good movie by the way the hunger games at this disappointing because i like chun for more stuff"
