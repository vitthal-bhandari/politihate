    "text": " Hello and welcome to Hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan. And I'm Alyssa Mastromonico. Alyssa, I don't know if it's just me that does this, but have you ever noticed that the longer you know an animal, the more formally you address them? Like, okay, so the answer is yes. That has happened in every instance of my pet ownership. Okay, well, what's the most formal title that you call one of your cats? No. Okay, so all of the boys except for Norm have ended up with Mr. So, Shrummy at one point became Mr. Boots because I called his alter ego when he was mad at physical therapy. And then Petey has become Mr. Poop Magoo. I have gotten with my husband's dog, Luca, which is now, I guess, my dog married into the dog. I know, call him Sir, or like, I refer to him as like a spectacular gentleman or like, Oh, it is a wonderful gentleman that has arrived. I love it. And don't you feel like he knows it? Like that you are really honoring him? Yes. Oh, I think he, I think he has an awareness of the fact that I'm now using formal titles to address him as though he's a member of like a royal family. There's gotta be, I'm sure that that somewhere there is some grad student studying psychology who is studying this phenomenon about how the longer you know something or the more familiar you are with it, the more ridiculous you get with the painting. And I would love to hear why everyone does this. What do you, you know, it is, what do you think it is? It's like Mitch started out as Mitch named after Mrs. Maisel. And now she's Baba O'Mijo. She's like, I mean, she's got all like, like, Baba O'Reilly. Do you know what I mean? I start singing Teenage Wasteland. And it's like, a Baba O'Mijo, Miss Bubba Baby. I mean, it's like every crazy, and you know what I do when the animal unfortunately eventually passes away. I put all the nicknames on the urn because they should be known, they should, they should be remembered as they were. You have to. You definitely have to do that. I mean, if any listeners know, we would love to hear. Why? We want to hear all about why are we doing this? Why are we, why did Shrummy ever become Porketta Monkey Butt? Great question. This week, Molly Hayward, Julissa Arce, and Megan Galey join us to tackle the following questions. Do Republicans read anything that they weren't assigned in 10th grade? How do we unfuck the feminine care industry? Who decides when we're dressing appropriately? And finally, can Mayor of Easttown solve the mystery of Pennsylvania's wacky accents? All this and more right now. Okay, let's get started with the news this week. There's a lot of things that are going on, the kind of sword fighting about the January 6th commission that the Democrats already negotiated with Republicans on and now Republicans that are like, let's negotiate on this. I say they should just be like, fuck it. We're going to do it our way that we can already do it. We're in charge of fuck it. Fuck it. Yeah, do it. You can do it. So do it. Right. I feel like the Democrats really need to lean in to any disciplinarian matronliness that you can't play with it. I'm taking it away. Now we're playing by my rules. Couldn't agree more. They have to realize this shit's not on the level. Stop playing like it's on the level. Like the Republicans are going to negotiate in good faith. It's not on the fucking level. Yeah, it's tiresome is what it is. It's just fucking tiresome. I have my days with legislative on we. Yeah, yes, exactly. Like do do a thing. I think every American wants to know what happened January 6th. But I think most Americans who don't work in anything that intersects with politics have other things they're worried about. And those other things cannot be eclipsed by this dumb sword fight. Like we will one way or another do this investigation with the Republican self without the Republican self. We're going to do it. I think it's just sucking so much oxygen out of the room. I want to I want them to do infrastructure fucking do infrastructure. Do it. People need people need that. Okay, speaking of infrastructure schools and how they have failed current Republican elected officials. Okay, so I don't like to joke about failing schools. I have so many teachers in my family. I you know everyone knows that we fucking love teachers on the show. They do. And this might be more about failing individuals than failing schools. A hundred percent failing individuals will fully failing individuals. I'm just going to read. We're just going to read through a few people who didn't quite seem to take the right lessons from what they were supposed to be learning. So Rand Paul who is a doctor for eyes. He's not an epidemiologist. He is an eyeball doctor. He is an eyeglasses man. He is not getting the vaccine because he says he has natural immunity because he has COVID which it hasn't been established that having COVID gives a person natural immunity to every strain of COVID. And it has been established that the vaccine can give people an immunity to multiple strains of concern of COVID. So it's just it's a stupid I didn't go to medical school. I didn't even take science classes in college. And even I know this like if you're one of Rand Paul's patients, I would find a new eye doctor. There's not one medical expert who agrees with his assessment. No, not a single one. And here's another thing that I don't understand. I tweeted something to this effect. But there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that men who have COVID-19 are much more likely to experience erectile dysfunction as a result of having COVID-19. So like, you know, I don't I understand the erectile dysfunction is a serious issue for a lot of people. But I also want to say that if you are a dumbass who went out and put yourself at risk and you find yourself getting COVID, don't brag about that shit. Because underneath that, I'm going to be wondering about your dick. And I don't want to I don't want to think about it, Rand, just get the fucking vaccine. Okay. But instead of, you know, getting the vaccine or educating himself, he has spent his time this week trying to get a tweet from singer Richard Marks taken down from Twitter. After did you see this? Oh my god. Okay. So Richard Marks, 80s prom maker extraordinaire. Slow dance it out. Just slow dance it out. Yes. Richard Marks tweeted something that expressed admiration for Rand Paul's neighbor. Now Rand Paul's neighbor famously beat Rand Paul up at one point. Richard Marks said that he would like to buy that neighbor a drink. So first of all, that's not even an original joke. People joke around about thinking that neighbor was cool. All the time. People make a different version of that joke. Richard Marks was probably just the first celebrity that Rand Paul knew to make that joke. And he was like, Hey, so that's how he's using his energy this week. Yeah. Wait, can you imagine the man who sang the song? Wherever you are, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you that he has been driven to say I wanted by the man who decked Rand Paul in the face and drink. I think that's hilarious. And yes, that was Carmen singing Richard Marks. That's I could read that Cartman impression. I would I would watch an entire episode of South Park that just was a musical featuring Cartman to be honest. Singing songs about Rand Paul. Oh, yeah, totally. Look, I don't think that we should encourage people to beat other people up. But Richard Marks's joke wasn't even original. And like there are other things to worry about Rand, like calm your calm fucking calm down. Okay. Marjorie Taylor Greene is comparing mandatory vaccines and mask wearing to what Jews went through during the Holocaust, which she apparently thinks was a public health measure, I guess. And she's you know, double tripled down saying she's not sorry. But she doesn't have any committee assignments. She doesn't really have anything better to do because of other crazy shit she's already done. So I'm not sure. This is how she's using her time. Congratulations, Marjorie, you got attention. Got attention for being the dumbest bitch in town. You did. Congratulations, Marjorie. We now all know that you everything that you think is bad. You compare it to the only other thing that you are aware of is bad, which is the Holocaust. We can't even tell how bad she really thinks the Holocaust is. Right. She said that she wouldn't take down a statue. Was that her was at low, lower and bow birth, which was said she wouldn't take down statues of Hitler. Oh, yeah. Oh, and Caroline saying, yeah, Caroline saying it was. So I guess maybe she likes wearing masks and wants to get a vaccine because Hitler is, I don't know, my brain hurts. And I can't give her the power to hurt my brain like this. She's she's not important enough. No, but also it's like stop calling it a gold star. It was a yellow star. I mean, it's like, if you're going to be wrong, at least get, I don't know, I guess it's not even worth getting some part of it right because she's just so wrong. Yeah, yeah. And I just, have you learned any other history? Do you know about anything else that ever happened that you could maybe compare this thing you don't like to? I'm sure she could give us a whole earful on what she thinks manifest destiny was about. That's true. She probably knows like a just like a upsetting amount about like Civil War battles. Right. Like all the wrong all the wrong one, the three, they didn't lose. Right. Exactly. She knows like too much about she's like the person who starts talking about the Civil War. If you're like in drinks with a group of friends and you're like, whoa, yeah, I'm going to go home. I don't want to I want to be around this person. Okay. Here is another one that fits into this, this larger point that I'm making a Wyoming state senator who plans to mount a primary challenge to Liz Cheney compared himself to Romeo from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet when news broke last week that Anthony Buschard, that's the name of the candidate impregnated a 14 year old girl when he was 18. By the way, this took place in Florida. The age of consent in Florida, both then and now is 18. So what Buschard did was statutory rape, not statutory Romeo. Why would you compare yourself to Romeo in this context? Girl, when he looks in the mirror, he sees Romeo. That is called reverse body dysmorphia. Also, has he read a book since 10th grade or watched one episode of Law and Order? Yeah, I mean, but here's the thing like did he even read to the end of Romeo and Juliet because Romeo killed himself. It's true. They both they both did and it was very it was actually it's a tragedy. So it's very sad. We should send this dumbfucksome hemlock and see if he knows what to do with it. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'll make a boutonniere. And finally, talking thumb Rick Santoram was let go from CNN after he commented to a conservative youth group that white Europeans quote, birthed America quote from nothing and that well, yes, he gave it to us that the Native Americans were there, but basically Native Americans had no influence in American culture. I got a hand to Native American organizers and activists. They did what women and gay people could not do, which was get rid of Rick Santoram fired. And I consider that to be a very important cultural contribution. I could not agree more when I watched this clip first come out. It's like, you just wonder you're like, that just came out of your mouth. And it wasn't like, didn't trigger anything. He wasn't like, Oh shit, I didn't mean that the way it came out. He was just like, he just doubled down with the head now. Yep. And then he went on Fox News to talk about how he was being silenced Fox News, the cable TV channel with the largest audience in America. That's not called being silenced. That's called weaponized whining, Rick. That's just, but here's a thing. Like, I think that, you know, when I heard the quote originally, which I think it was from back at the end of April that the quote first surfaced. I thought, did Rick Santoram pay attention to American history after he was past the age when they like shelter us from American history? You know, like when you're in elementary school, you don't learn about all the like stolen labor, stolen land, rape, murder, genocide. They kind of save that until we're like maybe more 10th grade, right? Yeah, like, I think middle school, I think middle schoolers are ready for this. Like we got to, we got to be like honest with our kids, but that was like a third graders understand. It's like he read a third grade picture book and was like, yep. And then the white people came over and there was nothing here, but not even because in the, if you had only gotten as far as the third grade picture book, you'd at least think that they brought you Thanksgiving. Do you know what I mean? Right. May's. May's, right? I mean, it's like there is no, like the rudimentary book actually, I think gives Native Americans more credit than Rick Santorum. Yeah, I also think that it's kind of funny that he would use the word bird. And then the words from nothing. Like the implication of the word birth is that something has a, something has a mother. Like it came from something like it's just, I don't know, I don't want to be stripping you to the point of diagramming sentences. I know I'm fucking close reading failed Pennsylvania Senator that again, looks like a thumb and a toupee. And that's not, I'm not making fun of his his appearance because he's ugly. He's ugly because I don't like him, you know, like that. Yeah, that is completely fair. Like that mean girls quote, you know, it's because I don't like him. So anyway, all of these four stories, you know, this Wyoming State Senator, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Wyoming's non Romeo and Rick Santorum kind of drove home this idea that I've had for a while, which is that current Republicans do not read, they do not read books after high school. Like I bet a lot of them are like Andrew Yang style catcher in the rye is my favorite book type people. Oh, I think that's a good call. I think that's a good call. It's like the longest thing they've read since 10th grade is a cheesecake factory menu. Like what have you read that wasn't at one point assigned reading? Exactly. Or what's your favorite book that's from the last five years that was published in the last five years? I think that's a good question. They would all just be like my book because for some reason, most of them get fucking book deals. Who's buying them? I was buying them. Who's reading them? I don't think that they get read. No, they're just propaganda for the bookshelf for the room raider. Yeah, I mean completely 100%. But so many trees. Why do they all have to die for like fucking Andrew Cuomo's book? We have to move on, but first I want to toast somebody. I mean, I think that we kind of like imply a toast to her just by living our lives because she just represents unmitigated excellence in every turn literal. Yes, Simone Biles. Arguably the greatest living American athlete, possibly the greatest gymnast of all time. On Saturday, she became the first woman in history to perform and successfully land the Yurchinco double pike in competition. It is a move that's considered so dangerous that no woman has ever even attempted it. Okay. So the vault is named after a Russian gymnast named Natalia Yurchinco. And it's the reason the vault is named after her is because of the approach, not the actual like flipping. Right. Yeah, what did you make of of this vault? I had to have watched it 15 times, 20 times. I couldn't get enough also one her costume that she was wearing, her outfit was very, very good. And at first I was watching her tumble that I pay attention to her uniform, then I'd watch her flip again. I mean, the thing I always think about when I watch gymnast do that is like, how do you get the courage to do the first one, right? To like to do the first one where like you don't know how it feels, you don't have the muscle memory for it. But she made my day. I love watching women fly and then land on two feet. Yeah, she's an absolute phenom and just like an American hero. And I got to say my feelings about the Olympics are mixed, but my feelings about Simone Biles are very simple. And that is, she's awesome. And I support her and everything she does. I grew up with you entirely. All right, let's take a quick break. But when we come back, we have an interview you're not going to want to miss. And welcome back. Alyssa, I have a question for you. Yes, Aaron. Are you one of those people that like writes your period down in your calendar? Occasionally. Oh, okay. So it's just completely useless. Like you just don't. It's kind of useless. I started writing it down because I'm supposed to take Prozac five days before it starts. So that's the only thing that's ever gotten me to take pen to paper on this topic. Interesting. I know people that are really, really religious about it, that like track it every month. I was not one of those people. I was like, I don't know. It happens like the 26th, the ish. So the reason we're talking about this, in addition to the fact that we do talk about this kind of thing anyway, because this is just how we are. In case it wasn't already in your calendars listeners, tomorrow, May 28th is menstrual hygiene day, which is a day that aims to change the negative social norms around menstrual hygiene. So periods are normal. We all get them. You wouldn't know it. What a concept. So we are really excited today to talk to Molly Hayward, who is the founder and chief branding officer of Quora, a woman's wellness company that is working to change the feminine hygiene industry and bring an end to period poverty. Molly, welcome. Thank you so much for having me. It's so great to be here. We're really excited to talk about this. So firstly, for those who aren't familiar, can you tell us a little bit about what period poverty is? Period poverty is essentially a person's inability to access or afford adequate menstrual care. So it could be sort of whatever product or means they want to manage their period, but for whatever reason, they're not able to again afford or access, and I would say access sort of using that term mostly geographically, the period care they need. And this is a problem that exists the world over. I first became aware of it in developing countries, but in fact, it's also a major issue here in the US and in many developed countries as well. But Molly, more specifically, how did you first learn about the issue and how did it influence you to create Quora? Yeah, so I was traveling in Kenya several years ago. I was with a non-profit organization that was focused on girls education and women's health. And so I was seeing all of these girls being the first in their families to go to school, all of this kind of amazing investment being made within the community to make sure that they could attend school, so making sure they had uniforms and books and tuition. And this organization was even helping to build school buildings. And I got to know a lot of the girls. And one day one of them told me that she stayed home during the week of her period every month because she couldn't access or afford a period pad. And that just totally floored me. And it was really this moment where I realized this is this common experience among all men's trading humans around the globe. And yet our experiences of that experience can be so vastly different just depending on our circumstances and situations. And it felt incredibly unjust to me that her life would be negatively impacted by this just biological fact. And so that was really the impetus for creating Quora. I knew that there could also be a better way for women in my own society to have healthier products that are more sustainable and have just a more modern brand experience and tie that back to giving to girls in need. So that's what we've done. So I read that you called the feminine care industry and I'm using your quote, fucked. What's fucked about the industry and what aspects of the feminine care industry are you most hoping to change? Like how can how can it get unfucked? I'm really glad this is a podcast where we could say fucked. Yeah, it is frankly fucked. When I got back to the US after that fateful trip, I really started to dig into the industry to understand my own experience of my period. And I started to look at not just the products themselves, but the ads, the marketing, the way that we talk about this experience among each other. And the thing that stood out to me first and foremost was that it was really hard to find out what was in these products. So I was putting a tampon in my body for a week, a month, and was going to do that for the rest of my life. But it was not clear to me what was in that product. When I started digging deeper, I learned that many of those products were made with synthetics or non-organic cotton, which is one of the dirtiest crops in the world. And I was just horrified, not to mention what I would call the antiquated notions of womanhood, that a lot of brands were still using as a way to hook girls into their brands. This industry has really run on a hook them while they're a young philosophy. And a lot of that's based in fear, like touting all the ways that they'll make sure that no one ever knows you have a period, and this erasure of this experience. And so the thing that I want to see changed more than anything in this industry is really the mindset about this experience. I think it's so damaging to have an aspect of your body that you hate or loathe or that you like really just struggle through. And everybody's body is different. And it can be incredibly painful and difficult for some people. And there's no denying that. And that is really real. But I think it's that perception, that societal sort of stigma that I would like to see altered by the way that I think newer brands and organizations are starting to actually approach things. And you know, when you were just talking, it made me realize that, you know, a lot of men, a lot of people who don't menstruate and never have menstruated have a complete lack of understanding of the way the reproductive system works in a person with a uterus, like totally. And some of them are making laws, some of them are making laws about what we're supposed to be doing with those things. So I think that like what you're saying about like removing the stigma could maybe help men be less stupid about the way that like the female reproductive system, how the uterus works, like all of those things, which I think we see evidence of that ignorance in so many, so many ways. So thank you for doing that. Oh, sure. I mean, it's baby steps here, but you know, we're trying. We're doing what we can. Now, Molly, you know, I have always suffered with my periods. Several years ago, a friend told me about Cora, I decided to try it and I was so blown away by how my body felt during my period. I mean, it was it was literally such an extreme difference from what I had been using to how I felt when I used your products that full disclosure, I wouldn't invest in your company because I wanted everybody to be able to try your products. So you mentioned tampons, not and explain this a little bit more because I'm not the expert. You are tampons, not regulated by the FDA. Correct. Tampons are regulated because they go inside your body. So they're considered a medical device. Pads are much more loosely regulated because they don't go in your body. But what I would say is that that regulation that happens, you know, it hasn't it. It's what I would say. I did. It's been pretty lax, you know, in terms of the materials you could use to make that product. It, you know, those are not materials historically. The historically is been here as well. Not ones that I would recommend putting in anyone's body. What is something aside from that, that the average person doesn't know about the tampon and feminine hygiene care industry that they absolutely should? Oh, that's such a good question. I think it is that that ingredients are very loosely regulated. And, you know, I think that the biggest assumption among women, men's traders who we talked to who are kind of like learning about natural or organic options for the first time is like, well, I had no idea. And I just assumed that someone was regulating these and looking out for me and making sure that the ingredients were, you know, were safe and healthy for me. And as we know, that's it. In a lot of industries, that's not true at all. Yeah, this is one of those ones where you really have to, I think, read the ingredients, educate yourself and, you know, make your own conscious decisions. You know, it's funny to hear about this largely unregulated medical device that women and people who menstruate put in their bodies once a month for a very long time. And people are freaking out about the COVID vaccine. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah. Oh, true. Yeah. Let's freak out about the right things. Please, let's refocus our freaking out. Okay, totally. So the tampons and feminine care industry is obsessed with the idea of discretion and that our periods are something to be ashamed of and hidden. So how do we break this stigma? Let's say that this is just like one average listener who's like, I'm going to do my part to break the stigma. What should that person do? Well, you know, I think it's, to me, it's very much to each their own. I think what we've seen happening over the last few years is like this level of just like pride and openness, I think certainly on social media and kind of out in the real world, but like captured by the media in important ways and then sort of highlighted, like I'm thinking about Kieran Gondi running the London Marathon without, you know, without kind of like free bleeding and like having blood on her pants when she ran over the finish line and like not giving a fuck. One of the earliest posts that I think like kind of blew up the internet a little bit was Ruby Carr posting, you know, a picture of like a period state on her sweat pants and being really like, this is very real. Like I bleed every month and you know, like we all do and I'm like putting this front and center. And so I think like there's, there's kind of at that level of visibility, there are things happening that I think are really inspiring. I don't think every person has to like walk around with blood on their pants nor like do most of us want to. But I think it's almost like having a willingness to talk about it and not just in negative terms. I think like the old way was sort of like this was this thing that you got to like commiserate with your girlfriends about and like it was just this thing. And yet like I think what is coming through, especially just with this broad movement that's happening where there's just more and more acceptance of this experience as as very like normal and natural is like a permission to talk about it in a new way and a permission to just be really open with it even with your partners. Like, you know, especially male partners where I think before it was like, I'm going to hide this from my male partner. Like they're not going to know what I'm bleeding. Like, you know, I might be like a wreck or I might be a total bitch, but like I'm not, you know, we're not going to talk about it. And like now, like the big thing is like period sex, we just launched a reusable disc, which is similar to a cup that you can wear while you're having sex. And so, you know, I think it's just like opening up more and more doors for conversation where conversation was not happening before or the conversation was overall negative. I think that's the first time in crooked media history that a podcast has had a period sex conversation. I think that we've made some history just now. Yeah, I think, you know, another thing that I think about when it comes to like just the, you know, having a uterus that that bleeds sometimes, it's kind of fucking metal, right? Yeah, like, totally kind of metal. Like the, it's like pain. And then it's like, blah. And then it's like, and then you get crabby and you get aggressive sometimes or you get tired. It's just, I think it's, I think it's more metal than people give it credit for it's not like this tense. It's like, yeah, it's not a hard core. Like, I have a friend who was like, we bleed and don't die. Like where else in like, that's like mythological. We bleed a shocking amount from a from a organ that went during non-pregnancy is a side of a line. How do you do it? What are you? What are you doing? I don't know if you guys had it or where in the world you are right now, but I'm on the west coast and it was the super blood mood last night. And it was like visible at like where I am at like four, you know, four 15 in the morning. So I set an alarm because my husband and I are kind of kind of geeks and, you know, I got up and like, you know, open the window to look out. And like, I swear to God, like my uterus was like, aching, just looking at it. And you know, I think it's, I think it's real. And yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely no joke. Like, like, you know, having these, having these parts, it's intense. It's an intense mystery, definitely. And at least the full moon's insattegetarius now and not Scorpio anymore, you know, that's that's a whole other conversation for a different time. Molly, thank you so much for joining us and talking about this with us. We really appreciate you. Thank you so much for having me. It's been awesome. Yep. Have a great one. You too. Yeah. And welcome back. Really excited for our conversation on today's personal political. Alyssa, are you excited about this? I'm pretty excited. I think it's going to be a really good one because we've all got stories about this topic and we've all got opinions about this. I mean, we have opinions about everything collectively, but I think this one is going to be especially good. Let's bring in the other two women who will be joining us for the conversation. First, she is a comedian and writer and she has recently wrote for Pause with Sam J, which you can watch Fridays or streaming on HBO Max. Megan Galey, welcome back. Hi. Thank you so much. And I'm so excited about the show and I really, really hope people watch it. Is it like an ongoing thing or do you? Yeah, there's six episodes. It's they call it a late night show. So it's a late night show. There's no set, no audience. Okay. So it took out all the bad things about me, but there's really, really honest, good, funny interviews, point of views. Sam is truly like probably one of the, if not the funniest comedian working right now. So, yeah, it's just my parents go, we have a lot to learn. So that's good. That's good. That's a good review of the first episode. Oh, you penetrated the Indiana market. That's oh yeah. You got it. I mean, that's a, that's a mark that something has actually made, made a splash. And also like you talk about late night TV, like sets. When I was a kid, I literally thought that Jay Leno was like sitting in front of a beautiful panorama of Los Angeles. I felt so cheated when I learned the truth. Yeah. No, no pretty views here. No. And you know, Skylines. No. And like the Daily Show offices, you know, it was implied that like John Stuart was sitting in front of like Manhattan, when reality, it's like on 10th Avenue. I know. And for a while across the street, there was an exhibitionist who would flash them when they were doing their writer's meetings. So put him in the background. I know. That would actually be kind of like transgressive. I think that's New York. That's good. The big apple. And then you should show, but that guy and then show an apartment open house next door where 30 people show up with like giant file folders in order to apply for crappy apartment in Chelsea or in Hell's Kitchen. Okay. Up next, she is an author and she has written the forthcoming book, you sound like a white girl, the case for rejecting a simulation. Julie's a r say welcome back. Thank you. You can see I'm getting way more comfortable being on the show. Today I'm wearing glasses, I'm going to be lipstick. I'm like, Oh, it's it's the ladies from hysteria. I can show up in my Selena t-shirt and be all yes. Oh, so now I see this. Can I see this, Lena t-shirt? We have to have this in the photo. That yes, that is incredible. How many like, thumbs up and signs of like approval do you get when you take that one out into the world? You know, not as many as I would hope. But that's I think because my old neighborhood, I don't know that a lot of people recognize her. In my new neighborhood, I'm excited to take out this baby out of my neighborhood. People will absolutely tell me bitty, bitty, bitty, bomb bomb. I love judging a neighborhood whether they know Selena's face or not. I think that's to go on Zillow. She absolutely go on Zillow. Yeah, I agree. Oh, yeah, especially in Los Angeles. If you're in a neighborhood where people do not recognize Selena like you're in a. Don't move there. The food's going to be bad. You're not going to like it. All right. Yeah. Food's going to be bad. There's going to be like long lines for one coffee shop that's across the street from another coffee shop that has the same coffee, but inexplicably short lines because it's a neighborhood of people who just like to stand in line because they like to do popular things instead of deciding for themselves what they like. I've got it. You're getting us today, aren't you? I am very familiar. I have had it with parts of the East Side, Meghan. I have had it. Silver Lake can eat my butt. Eat it. Eat her butt. Honestly, Silver Lake would be honored to eat your butt. Eric, thank you so much. You might have people lined up. And all open my butt across the street and see if they come over. Oh, man, I don't know. It depends on if you have really good olive oil cake. Like they have a proof. I don't know what that means, but it was gross. Okay. So today we're going to talk a little bit about dress codes. And this was inspired by an article I saw about a high school in Florida. That digitally changed the photos of girls to eliminate their cleavage. So not even cleavage. I'm not talking about exotic dancer advertising cleavage or only fans cleavage. I'm talking like a regular ass girl wearing a regular ass tank top that implies that she has breasts under her tank top. The school decided that for the purposes of modesty, they needed to eliminate that because the worst thing I think for a young woman is for the world to know that she has breasts. What could be more devastating? What could be more devastating? Alyssa, you and I have talked a little bit about dress code expectations. And like you talked about like getting blogged about for wearing flats in the White House. Has there ever been an other instance in your life when you've gotten in trouble for the clothes you were wearing? Yes. So when I first went down to Washington DC, it all comes down to Washington, by the way. I never got in trouble in New York or Chicago. When I first showed up and I was an intern for Bernie, the job I had was to go from office to office and get signatures on bills that he was cosponsoring. And they wanted me to bring it over to the Capitol. And then one of the people in the office was like, you can't go to the Capitol. And I'm like, why? And they're like, because you're not wearing a skirt and stockings. And so it's not so much that I got in trouble specific. No, actually I did because I didn't have on a skirt or stockings because Bernie didn't give a shit. And I don't even think he knew that that law existed over in the Capitol. But it was up until it was like the mid 90s. It was like right after, I think it changed right after I was an intern, but for basically the entire time that Congress existed up until the late 90s, women had to wear skirts and pantyhose. And I would like any man to put on one pair of pantyhose in the DC summer and tell me it is not a form of torture. Because there was nothing I would get. And there just be like pools of sweat when I get into my car. Because I lived so far away, I had to take a subway to a parking garage and then I drove the rest of the way home. And there would just be like pools of sweat behind my knees. It was so disgusting. Honestly, what is it about the composition of behind the knee like tight, tight sweat? It's just like under boob sweat. It is like chemically, it's chemically the same. And it's just, uh, uh, jalisa, what has your experience been with like expectations around dress and have you ever gotten like chastised or shamed because of what you were wearing? Oh, yeah. I have a story about this. So senior year prom, senior year prom, I like saved all this money to buy this dress. That was like this beautiful dress. It was like a, um, it was like tube top at the top type of dress. And I have large breasts. Like I have, I don't remember when I didn't have large boobs. And this dress, I guess, over the course of the night, like got when the little lower and lower, not to the point where it was like I was exposed, but definitely to the point where when we took our prom pictures, my, like my, it was like all chest, like it was like all boobs. And I was so mortified of this pictures. And I don't remember if I like threw them all away or if I still have them. So I don't think I have them anywhere still. But I do know for a fact that I did not give a single person a prom picture. And I forbade my prom date to give anybody a prom picture because I was so mortified and embarrassed about this picture. Because when I did show it to a couple of friends, they all sort of made kind of had the same reaction of like, I was kind of trying to get them to tell me, Oh, it's totally okay. Don't worry about it. But they were like, Oh, no, that is horrible. No, you can't see anything but your boobs. And now looking back on it, I'm like, they were just boobs. Like they're just boobs. And they were my boobs. And like, you're welcome. Everybody who would have gotten the picture of my amazing breasts. And I just wish that, you know, when I read when I read this New York time story, I just got so sad because I thought, fuck man, like girls are still having to feel shame about their bodies. And they're still like 20. I don't even know how long it's been since I graduated high school, not quite 20 years, but almost. And 20 years later, people like girls are still having to feel shame about their bodies. Their boobs still have to be covered up. And it is ridiculous that as a society, we have not made any progress in how we view women and how we treat women and how we value women and what we value or not value about them. And it is truly saddening and maddening. And I was so upset reading that story and rem and thinking you guys made me have to think again about that prom picture that I had been so upset about. And now I wish I had them so that I could post a throwback picture on Instagram. And I don't know whatever happened to those pictures. Well, I hope you find them because it seems like it would be an empowering like moment of reclamation for you to be like, these are my tits. Live with it. Live with it. Also, I wish I had that body again. Megan, same question for you. Have you ever gotten like policed or in trouble because of what you wear? I know like as a performer, what you're wearing is is under scrutiny. Has has that ever become an issue? Oh, yeah. It's a constant issue. I have a infamous sort of feud actually with a comedian that I opened for 10 years ago. And I was I dressed up. It was like a really big show for me. And so I'd worn a dress, I'd worn heels. I'm sort of like the opposite of Alyssa's story. I dressed up for this occasion. And then this man who was twice my age reprimanded me in front of everybody and was like, do not wear that on stage. My fans do not like that. Like you do like women are going to be threatened by you looking this way. Like female comedians need to be in jeans and t-shirts and sneakers. And that's like the only way that female audience members are going to feel comfortable because if they're dressed up, then all they're going to be thinking about is if they're the guy they're with is looking at that woman in a sexual way. Whoa. It was bad. It was bad. And it's some. And so that is something that it that I hear perpetuated in this industry a lot. Like you cannot be overly sexually dressed woman on stage because people are not going to listen to you or think you're funny or all or this argument of like women are going to be mad at you. And it's really, I mean, now I dress up. I dress however I want to dress because I'm in a very different place in my career. But it fucked with my head for a while to be like, oh, I can't present myself in the way that I would like to present myself in the way I feel funny and beautiful and confident because a man who's more successful than me told me that it's not good for my career. Right. And he was like imagining the psychology of women in the audience in a way that's totally inaccurate. I can't speak for every woman. I'm no longer the official spokesperson of women. This is a man whose closer is to get nude on stage. Okay. I'm Google that now. Oh my god. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. That's not how I mean, that's not how I think. When I'm watching a woman perform, I'm not like, is she prettier than me? I'm like, she looks fly. Like good for her. Good for her. And I'm not like sitting there thinking that whatever a guy I'm with is comparing me to the woman on stage. Because if that's a concern for me, like, fuck that guy. Yeah, you have a gun. Why am I with this fucking loser who can't like watch a woman do something without objectifying her thinking of her as like a total being distracted by her sexuality. Megan, like, I'm curious. Like, it's there are like pretty prominent female comedians now, like yourself included, but like Natasha Laguero kind of leans against against that like Nikki Glaser, like, well, dress like really sexy on stage, but like sexy in a way that's appealing like for it's not like actually wants to dress. Oh, it's just like, Oh, this is my body and I want to look the best way possible. I had an issue when I was doing a TV where I had chosen an outfit and I was told that's going to be distracting. That's going to be what was the outfit. The outfit was a blazer. And shorts that was over a bustier basically. And I thought I looked so good in it. And the feedback was coming from people that do have my best interests in heart and do care about me professionally. And they were like, we're just worried if you wear and I have little boobs. Okay, like that's why it's like, that's why I'm like, let me show my little boobs. Like, no, they're not going to flop out. Like it's, I truly feel like I don't, I don't have to wear a bra. Like I can, I feel blessed in this way that I can just have them flapping in the wind, you know, and, and they were like, you, you need to wear something higher cut because we worried that it's just going to be about your outfit and not what you're saying. And it sucks because it's like, you, you feel tied to it. It's something I think about every single night when I get dressed to go do a show. I thought about it last night. I was just in New York. It takes me so much time to pack because I have to think, what am I going to wear on stage and how is it going to affect how I'm viewed and what my performance is. And I lean into it and I talk about my clothes a lot. Like, if I'm dressed crazy, fun, I'm going to make fun of myself. I'm going to mention it to just sort of break the ice of like, I know that I, you know, look like a woman who teaches ceramics to divorced people. But, but it's like, I shouldn't even really necessarily have to address what I'm wearing every time I go to do my job. But in some ways, it's kind of been beaten into me that if I'm wearing a certain thing, you got to, you got to open it up or the audience is going to not, I mean, it's, it's tough. It's, I don't know. I'm glad I have good style and a husband who has good taste because if I just had shitty clothes, I think I would have stopped doing comedy a long time ago. I mean, I can't blame you. I like to dress up too. I want to kind of talk about the other side of that, which is like, I guess as the pandemic has been winding down, we've seen all these new stories about women who are like, I'm going to keep wearing my mask. I kind of like that men don't get to comment on my face anymore. And I've also seen people who have started, who normally would dress up starting to wear comfy clothes and been like, whoa, it's so nice that I'm wearing comfy clothes and men just leave me the fuck alone. So, Alyssa, as maybe the foremost expert on comfy clothes that I know. And as somebody who's had to be in public, like, what's different in the way that you are treated when you're wearing just like whatever makes you comfortable versus when you're wearing something that is like expected by a dress code. So here's the thing about this one. It's really changed how I live my life, to be quite honest, is that when I always had to abide a dress code, whether formal or informal, I actually didn't act as confidently as I do when I'm wearing clothes that I feel comfortable in, you know, like when I'm sitting sitting at the head of the table in the situation room and my fucking Spanx start to roll down. I don't feel awesome. I don't feel in control. I'm just like, I can feel it. And I just, it actually happened once. And I thought of the Wanda psych stand up where she calls her stomach, Ethel, and how Ethel fights with the Spanx and the Spanx start to roll down. And I was like, fucking, Ethel, man, why are you doing that? And so here we are like in these serious meetings, and I'm thinking about how like my Spanx are rolling down. So now I have just vowed that I am never working any place ever again where I cannot dress as myself, which is look, I guys, you can make linen that is not body skimming look very, very flattering and professional. And so this is what I seek out now. They're like four brands that I buy my clothes from. And when I put it all together, like, look, I do wear a lot of sweatpants and t-shirts. But when I put my like linen, you know, combination, Ina Garten meets Stevie Nicks, I'm like, I am invincible. And I think that people respond to me better because I feel good. And I'm just like, I fucking sit down. And I'm not worried that like, you know, my pantyhose are sticking out the back of my skirt. It's, you know, also just unrelated. I once had a skirt split on me that I, when I was with President Obama, and they had to literally the doctor had to stitch me up with pins to get me back together, which wouldn't have happened if I were wearing linen. All I kept saying the whole time was it's not because it was too tight. It's not because it was too tight. No, there's a doubt that's like, okay, okay. Okay. Just shut, suck it in and we're going to piggyback together. I diagnosed this skirt with not having enough stretch. How about that, Lisa? Jelisa, you brought this up when we were prepping for the episode, but your new book, your forthcoming book is about assimilation, like fighting against assimilation. So I would, I'm curious your thoughts on how dress codes police assimilation and try to enforce assimilation on women in particular. It really all comes down to, it's not about the clothes that we're wearing, right? It's about meeting some sort of standard that someone else has set, has set for us. And and who, you know, who, who made these standards? Who knows, right? Probably a white straight male made these standards that we all are trying to abide by. And when we continue to do that, then we can never, we can never change it, right? And Megan brought up another, another point that made me think, you know, we're talking about how like you have little boobs and they can flap around and like it's fine. And like, absolutely, when a woman is bigger and curvier, like, I can't do that with my boobs, right? Because people will absolutely judge me. I cannot walk out of my house without a brawn. Like, I just can't because people will stare at me, people will look at me and sure I can be like, fuck it and still do it. But I will still feel some type of way when people are looking at me like that, right? And so, and so, and, you know, I talked about how, like women of color, we are policed then in a different way in a bigger way, more scrutinized, right? I was talking about sort of black girls and black women and how they aren't policed just for the clothes that they wear. It's also how they wear their hair, right? Like at some schools, at some schools, they can wear braids or extensions. And yet at other schools, they can wear their hair natural. So it's like, what the fuck are they supposed to do, right? What's the message that we're sending? And the message that we're sending is constantly that no matter the situation, it's not about the clothes or the hair, it's about control. And it's about somebody else exerting control over our bodies, over our image, to meet some standard that none of us had a say in making. Like we didn't have any decision-making ability in coming up with the standards, with this dress codes or any of that, right? And so, I think it's important just to kind of like highlight that that, you know, when it comes to women of color and particularly black women, like black girls getting expelled from school, I think at some point I read that black students are suspended and expelled from school at a rate more than three times greater than white students. And some of that comes from dress code violations. So it is dumb to think that because someone isn't wearing something, now they can't go to school, so now they can't learn. You know, it's like so counterintuitive to like everything. So, yeah, it's, to me, it is sort of about understanding that somebody else has set the standard for us and we have to reject that standard and make spaces where we can be ourselves. So, you know, I love what Elise said about not working at a place where she can't dress, however she wants to dress. And I sort of feel the same way now too, you know, I remember when I worked at Goldman, there was a colleague of mine that was very thin and would often wear blouses that I couldn't wear because if I wore those same blouses, my chest would show, right? My chest would be more prominent. She also once wore fishnets and I was like, that's pretty bold, you know. Let me try it. And I mean, I had to go to the bathroom and take them off because the looks I was getting. I mean, I wanted to cry and like just go home and never go back because that was so embarrassed. And I'm like, what the hell, you know, she got to wear them and maybe people were looking and maybe that was just in my head, you know, maybe the voices in my head were louder than the voices in her head, or maybe she didn't have any voices in her. I mean, good for her. But I did feel, I do feel like there's often, if there's a double standard between men and women, then there is like another, an exponential double standard for women of color. Yeah. This happened at my high school all the time. You would see, oh, and because like in Indiana, it's like this, everyone's shopping at the same stores or whatever. And so a white girl would be in something, not getting trouble, a black girl would be in something, getting trouble. And it would, it would be they have different body types or she's she's black and we're going to target her. And that's an easier person for us to reprimand than this white girl. 100%. You also like you often hear people who are like doling out these punishments, wrap it up in where it's like distracting. Like it's distracting, distracting to whom. Like why don't you learn to not be distracted by a woman's knees for shoulders? Like how, what do you mean distracting? That's, that's so, it's, it's so gross. I mean, I was, you know, it's like, talk about this, like this, me distracted when I was looking up at this pictures from this yearbook story that were photoshopped. And then there is like this picture of these two boys in Speedos. And I'm like, I'm sorry. That's weird. Like how is, how is that not distracting? But a girl just wearing what was this, what was even more distracting was the awful photoshop job that they did. It's like, I mean, I have, I know nothing of photoshopping and I'm pretty sure I could have done a better job of photoshopping. It was like MS, it was like MS paint level. Like all the one clicked out. It was just a box. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like they uploaded it to Insta Stories and like found something to put over it and then downloaded it and then I use that picture. Well, and it's, I'm not saying every parent of a teenager is doing a 100% amazing job, but it's like, these are minors and their parents saw them leave the house. Like, why does this one woman who runs, I was very upset it was a woman who runs the yearbook to think that like she knows better than this person who decided to wear this or the parents of this person that thought that like there was a mom on it being like, my daughter, I thought looked good. Like, I don't have any problem with it. And I'm her mother. Yeah. I agree with all of that. And, and I agree with that. And I will say that I was definitely that girl that would pack a different outfit in my backpack to change into because my dad was so incredibly strict about what I could or could not wear, which, you know, I mean, that's a whole nother topic of episode. Yeah. We can get into like the concept of age appropriate clothing too, because it impacts like younger girls, but it also impacts like grown women. You know, I think three of us are in our 30s. One of us is in their 40s. And it's a weird thing that I've noticed. I think we all look young, but I've seen people who are in their late 30s, basically shamed away from wearing like trendy clothes, because that's like dressing too young. Alyssa, having worked in Washington as much as you have, did you notice like an age policing thing happening with the way that women dress as well? Yeah, I mean, there's a certain doubtiness expected over a certain age. That's like, you know, where you just go to, what is it? Jill, what is that? I can't remember the name of Chico's. It's like, you know, to hurry outlet, and you know, just make sure your blazer's boxy and your skirts kind of loose. And yes, Jill Stewart, Jill Stewart, Carolyn reminds me. And you know, it is there's a certain youthfulness that's not really that was not that was not at the time, really appreciated like bold colors and, you know, sparkle and all that kind of stuff. Though I do think it's changing based at least in part on what we see on the floor of the United States Senate from time to time. Well, Gwen Moore is a great example of a person who is in Congress, has been in Congress for a really long time. And she is having a fucking great time with how she dresses. Nancy Pelosi, another person who's like, fuck it, I'm wearing a full head to toe pink, head to toe matching mask and all. Yeah, exactly. Pink Aoshu showing up with big old hoop earrings and red lipstick. Also, yes. Yeah, it's like it breaks the expectations that like, it almost seems like when when girls are teenagers, they're supposed to be like kind of wrapped in this little chrysalis. And then when they're of a marriageable age, they take it all out and they can wear sword to short skirts and like revealing tops for like six years. And then when they get married, they have to wrap it up again and disappear. No, I say I want to have my wedding. I have a confession to make and an apology to my mom, because I just realized how I have policed my mom and the way and which she wears because I think she's almost 70 and she shouldn't be wearing, you know, a low cut shirt. And I don't know where that comes from. But in the course of this conversation, I have realized that I have been doing that to my own mom. And I should not do that. My mom should, I mean, she's fucking my mom and she has lived a whole life and she can wear whatever health she wants. And I will no longer tell my mom, mom, please cover up. When we know better, we do better. Yeah, that's right. I do. There's something with aging to where there's this trade off of like, oh, if I dress more conservatively and not as flamboyant and cover up more, I'm going to get more professional respect to. And those should not go hand in hand. You should get professional respect based on the merits of your work, which I know that sounds really simple, but it's just not the case most of the time. Yeah, I mean, at the same time, I think that there's a way to like, I think it's also kind of about this intangible ability to pull something off. Like, there are people like I was just thinking about like Kirsten cinema. And maybe it's just because I don't like her. But whenever she's like, she just dresses in a way that I find to be annoying, given her personality. It's like it contributes to my thinking she's annoying. And I've been trying to like, untangle whether that's me having like internalized misogyny. What do you think of this? No, so I fully agree with you on this. And that's why I was sort of referencing before. It's that here's, this is my point about I have to be aware of the places I'm walking into. And there are some places that are very conservative, like Julissa, when you were at Goldman Sachs, you know, there is a way that kind of everybody mostly dresses and it is a more conservative sort of environment. And so with Kirsten cinema, I mean, I just don't, I think that the floor of the US Senate is you can wear bold colors and you can express yourself. I'm not sure a flouncy skirt is what I would put on to go to the floor of the US Senate. Like I do think that there is a respect imbued in that body that is, you know, like just keep it a little bit more. Like she could have worn a red dress, you know, she doesn't have to play down entirely like who she is. But I think like, crinoline and Congress, I would say it's a risk. Yeah, I mean, I think that's an interesting question. But you know, at some point wearing pants as a woman was a risk. Yeah, right, you know, so it's sort of like, I don't know, it's like things don't change until they do. And then there's like a new standard, you know, I don't know. I stand by her right to have bad style, you know, like I think that's just what it's like, listen, it's not style. I like but girl, that's the style you like. And I stand by you not knowing what clothes look good. Right. I may not I may not agree with what you say, but I'll fight to that you're right to say it. That's how I feel about her damn skirts. That's fair. That's fair. I think that's totally fair. And you know, here we're discussing like whether or not there's a difference between like, like photoshopping out somebody is like clavicle versus being versus reflecting on a choice to wear something that could be distracting not because it shows off your body, but just because the style itself is a little bit like, whoa, nobody nobody's advocating for that to not be allowed on the floor of Congress. Like, I think Megan, you raise a really important point, like nobody's saying like, Gerson cinema should be fined like a non mask wearing red state or something like that. But you know, I do think that there's like there has to be there's like some point at which maybe we can like people can dress how they want to dress, but also have a little bit of understanding of what they're walking into like, for example, Julissa, you are like the you and Megan both had like beautiful weddings that had a dress code at the wedding. And like if somebody had shown up to the wedding wearing like, you know, propeller top and a snuggie, you might have been a little annoyed. I mean, the only thing that that people were not allowed to wear, I'm at wedding women in particular was a white anything. Like, just please do not wear a white dress to my wedding. Like, that was the only thing I really asked. But yeah, I mean, you're right. You're right. Like I did I there was like it was a formal wedding and I wanted people to wear formal long dresses and for men to wear suits or tucks. Yeah, that's true. I have no dress code. And people showed up in a cowboy hat, a bolo tie. There was someone in a white um, blazer and the reality was like, people were coming up to me like, they look crazy. And I'm like, I look the best here. So I don't really give a fuck when anybody else is wearing, you know, I'm in Vera. Is anyone else in Vera? No, okay, then case closed. Okay, finally, let me just we have to wrap this conversation up. But before we go, um, let's try let's let's let's do this thought exercise. Like if there could be like a positive dress code that's like, I encourage people to dress like X versus a negative one, which was like, don't show your shoulders off. What is like one thing that you wish more people would take into consideration when they were getting dressed? And I'll start to just kind of set an example. Um, this is a practical tip. Make sure that whatever shoes you're wearing, you're comfortable walking a mile in them, like a literal mile in them. Um, shoe anxiety is real. I think I am, I am positive that Nancy Pelosi could probably run a 5k in the heels that she wears. But you know, if I'm going anywhere, there's almost nothing worse than being caught in shoes that cannot hang. And it has nothing to do necessarily with like how high they are, how sexy they are. Some of my more comfortable shoes are like super high heels. Um, and some of my least comfortable shoes are flats. It's just like very important for shoe comfort to be a factor when you're getting dressed. That is my number one wardrobe thing. Also, like if it snows and you're caught with like open toe shoes, if you live in a place where it could snow, that happened to me one time. Oh my God. Very. Very quick. Yeah. Very quick tangent. I went to a Christmas party with my boyfriend at the time and I wore open toe shoes and I stayed with him and it snowed overnight. And the next morning I had to be carried to a cab because I had no other shoes. So just, you know, take it, take shoes in consideration. Also, what is your like number one dress code, like positive recommendation? Positive recommendation would be do your hair. However you want to do it, do it in a way that you don't have to fuss with it all the time. Because the one thing that I do find distracting is when people come, male or female, whatever, and they have their hair and they're constantly like having to touch it to put it wherever it has to go. I find it very distracting and like it and it makes me tense. So I think that you should just do your hair in a way that it's just like there and it's sort of like a non-issue. And you're not like constantly doing people can't see what I'm doing, but it's like constantly this like touching and fixing and twirling it around your finger. It's just not that's something I actually kind of find kind of unprofessional. We're all fixing our hair now as a list of saying that we're all saying. It's like, you know, if your bangs have to constantly be put to the side, I'll put a clip in them. I don't know. Yeah, that's that's a good tip too. Less fussyness when I come to say hair. Let's do it. Julissa, what's your number one positive dress code tip? Wear a comfortable bra. Good idea. You know, because I definitely have had my share of really sexy, beautiful bras that are like digging into my rib or like the middle of my chest. And maybe they're just wearing the right size. So maybe that's the actual that's a tip. Make you wearing a bra the right size. Yeah, that's great. And it also like it's not a like don't distract people with your boobs thing. It's like wearing a bra that doesn't fit fucking sucks. Don't yes, you don't want to do it. Megan, what is your positive dress code tip? I would say get things tailored. I that's I like stylists say it all the time. Like if you are between sizes, you don't need to force yourself into something you can go up and then have it cropped like you can have things hemmed taken in. Make get things to fit your body because clothes are not sold to fit every single person's body. They're made to fit like one person's body and that's not the body most of us have. So pick what you like and then have it fitted to work for you. That is a great tip. Okay, we're going to take a quick break when we come back. Sanity Corner. And welcome back to hysteria, a podcast where straight men have been silenced since 2018. Congratulations guys. We're coming up on three years of silencing straight men who knows when the straight men will be allowed to talk. This is a part of the show where we talk about things that have kind of brought us some joy in a time of confusion because all times are times of confusion. It's Sanity Corner. Alyssa, I'm going to have you go first this week. What is keeping you sane? You guys, I love Mayor of Easttown so much that I almost can't handle it. Like I hoarded episodes so that I could watch like two back to back and it was like I just can't get enough. I needed this show like ever since succession ended. I'm like what am I going to watch? And then Mayor came along and it's just it's just been a joy and a pleasure and I felt so relaxed after my episodes were over last night. I was like God that was great. So relaxed watching a missing women be found. Very tense. But she found a way. No, I know. She did. I mean it's I was Mayor was up there in my Sanity Corner. Do you have any wild series Alyssa? I mean I won't speculate because the last time I did this, I forget what show it was. Fyfer and I tried to try to break down what an ending to an episode was going to be. It wasn't the undoing. It wasn't the undoing. And I was just totally wrong. I was like it's the kid. It's you a grand and he's setting the kid up. Now it was you grand but he wasn't setting his son up. No but Mayor I just well that's the thing that I love about the show is that at the end of every episode you're like okay it could be one of three people. Like it's not clear. I love when I love when they just leave and I'm going to go back and watch from the beginning because another one of my friends said that if you go back you'll see clues that you were missing before. I saw a Keila tweeting about that. And I'm like I'm like let us know the clues. It's on Mayor of Easttown. Yeah, Mayor of Easttown it's fantastic. Also as somebody who has married into a Pennsylvania family the Pennsylvania accents in Mayor of Easttown are some of the best and most of the things I've ever read with that as someone who's also married someone from Pennsylvania. Yeah Eastern PA has a bananas absolutely bananas accent. And I've seen people on Twitter saying like why do they have Southern accents guys that is not Southern accent. That is an Eastern Pennsylvania accent. Water. You're I also married someone from Pennsylvania. This is why it's a big state. It's a big state. I guess they got good men there. Yeah it's the husband state. It's where you can find. Did anybody's husband go to Penn State? No but Josh's parents. However my mug Penn State Forum. Okay. Hey see circle. This could be a Mayor of Easttown clue. Jelisa knows the murderer. Oh yeah. I didn't even know the show. Jelisa what is keeping you sane this week? Watermelon margaritas. Oh yes. I am so glad that it is watermelon season and that I can have it with my thajin but I can make margaritas that I can make smoothies with it. I mean watermelons are my favorite thing in the world. My favorite fruit and particularly watermelon margaritas are keeping me sane this week when there are so many insane things going on. And it's very easy to make. You just put a bunch of watermelon and a little bit of uh which ones are the green ones lime or lemon? Lime. Okay so you put some limes um just a little bit of lime and you blend it all together then you use a colander putting into a glass and then you put a shot of tequila and a shot of that orange liqueur. What is a grand margarita? Grandma and trow. Either one. Either one of those two will work. And then you just stir it a little bit with some ice cubes in it. It is oh and then you put a little bit of thajin at the top. That's good. And they are delicious and they are keeping me incredibly sane this entire week. Thank you god for your benting watermelons and Mexican and Mexicans for a bentine tequila. And also no it was not 818 tequila. I will not be drinking kendall Jenner tequila. And also kendall Jenner I am sorry because she tweeted at me that I was wrong about the gift bags. Those were not her gift bags. She did not give gift bags to make guacamole with thajin in them. So thank you kendall Jenner for not giving people thajin to make guacamole because that would be wrong. You know this big of you to admit that kendall Jenner was right about something. Amidst all about the one thing the bags but like you know we still need to talk about her tequila. So yeah it's not about that. You know after I just I was just thinking about like remember that Pepsi ad where she was like oh god she's a beverages. Can this woman learn? Can she learn? Don't like you know make your tequila. That's fine like I'm not bad about your tequila. I am mad about you putting your hair in trencitas braids. You know having putting us some rero wearing those earrings like you don't need you can just show up as your white girl self to sell your tequila. Like you don't need to to try to dress as the culture to like do it but we're talking sanity. So back to just have a watermelon margarita. Yeah. I bet when it gets like ungodly hot here just blending that shit up and making it a slush. That's so good. So good. Okay I'm going to go now. So my sanity corner is actually another podcast and this isn't like an advertisement or anything like that. It's just a podcast that I have really been loving. It's called The Turning and it's a podcast about Mother Teresa and they interview a lot of people that used to be a member of her order of nuns and holy shit things were crazy. It was it was not really it really like I grew up Catholic with an idea of who Mother Teresa was and what what her order of nuns did and you know I never really thought very much about the ways in which the people that were members of the order might yeah might have been subjected to kind of bad treatment. It is like my like serialized podcast or documentary style podcasts are real hit or miss for me because it's usually like news or like smart people talking about the news or like on the media and that's pretty much it but this has hooked me. It's really well done. I love the host does a great job putting herself into this story in a way that isn't like distracting and the interviews are great. It's edited together really amazingly well. I know this is kind of like a nerdy take but I don't really like when podcasts are like overproduced and there's like too many music cues and stuff like a lot of true crime podcasts do that. It's like I don't need like dastardly to like sneak around music being played over this description of like this person. So yeah it's just really well done top to bottom. The subject matter is great. The way it's put together is great. They do a great job hosting it and it's like a woman forward podcast. So if you're into that sort of thing definitely recommend it. I think there's three episodes out and I already can't wait for the fourth one. So that's my sanity corner this week. Megan what is keeping you saying this week? Okay coming live from my sports corner. It is like one of the best times of the year for sports. The NBA playoffs are happening and it's been very fun. The nicks are in. The Clippers are falling apart. There's a lot of drama happening. The Nets like the big three are playing together for the first time in like a long long time because they've all been injured but the W NBA just kicked off their 25th anniversary season and Sabrina Ionesk who is putting on truly a clinic like she was a rookie last year got her is back and she is going to revolutionize. She is a star. The W NBA is on sports center with the NBA playoffs where it belongs. It's also the NHL playoffs which I'm not like a huge regular season hockey person but NHL playoffs are the best post season of any of the sports and my hometown Indy 500 is this weekend and I don't I mean just if you find yourself in black and white on Saturday you can say you celebrated it. You don't need to go above and beyond. You don't need to do anything special. It's a very loud long race but maybe check in. Definitely there's some hunks in IndyCar racing. So maybe some maybe some hunks to peruse. Okay Megan your take your take on sports right now was literally borderline Stefan from SNL. It's not everything. We've got everything. We've got everything you need. Yeah you know it's funny the hockey thing is is becoming an issue on our house because the penguins are playing what is turning out to be very interesting series because the New York Islanders. Here's the thing I have a very hard time with hockey. I love basketball. I love watching like playoff baseball. I love it when like all the sports are going at once because it's like it's like a mini March Madness with less like less gambling and like I like find myself despite myself getting caught up in pens games. Like if I'm like walking past the TV I'm like I don't like hockey but wait a minute. What's going on? I love. I love. I shoot out. That is exciting. Oh my gosh you're a sudden death over time. Yeah and they're they're exhausted. They've already played three periods. Hockey games are long. Oh my god. Yeah it's um you know I I'm not like a hockey fan normally the whiteness of the ice is like upsetting to me. It's like no sports need green. But yeah it's it's been like a yeah it's an exciting time in sports for sure. Absolutely. I might also add the MLS season. Yes. Going on and I finally got to go back to an LAFC game. Go black and gold and they are amazing and if you live in Los Angeles or anywhere where there's an MLS team you should go support your local soccer team because the MLS is kind of awesome. Oh yeah and in Portland Seattle specifically I know that those games sell out and they're crazy. Like and then also the National Women's Soccer League is going to have an LA team within the next couple of years. Yeah Angel City which is going to be so cool. People are going to get really excited for that. And if you're an LAFC season ticket holder you can get you can like place a reservation for Angel City season ticket holder. Awesome. Oh that's a great tip Julissa. And that's all the time we have for the show this week. Thank you to Megan and Julissa for joining for this great conversation about dress codes and staying sane.
