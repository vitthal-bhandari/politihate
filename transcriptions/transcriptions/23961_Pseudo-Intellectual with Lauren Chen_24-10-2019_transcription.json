    "text": " Hey guys, my name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. Welcome to the show and thank you so much for joining us. A big thank you, especially to our live viewers. Now we have a, you know what? We have a heavy show. We're going to be discussing some serious topics. First, we're going to be starting off with the trans son, whose father just lost custody of him because he doesn't want him to be trans among other things. Then we're going to be talking about what it means to be post political in this crazy political world. Then Miley Cyrus, she is up to shenanigans again, surprising nobody. And we're going to be finishing off the show tonight with a discussion about the growing rot in Christianity. I feel like some people either really love it or really hate it when we talk about Christianity on the show, but it's true. Yeah, this was trending. So I feel like it's a, it's an excuse to bring it up. Before we get into that though, I do have a quick message from our awesome sponsors. L, that's the letter L. Um, so they are a period and personal care company focused on giving you organic products without the organic prices. Usually organic is going to mean something is like at least three to five dollars more, not the case with L. L makes tampons, pads and liners with organic cotton because they believe a natural product just makes sense for a natural process. So they don't use pesticides, chlorine fragrances or any dies. All around the world, there are girls missing school simply because they can't get period products. So what I think is so great about L and I love companies who try to make charity a part of the way they do business. They make a tampon, pad or liner accessible to a person who needs it for everyone that's purchase, which is a very big deal to date. They've made over 200 million products accessible and counting. And when you get L, you're a part of helping that movement grow. If you go online to their site, this is something that I think is really cool. L also has a subscription program, meaning that if you purchase a product once you have the option of making it a recurring delivery every single month. So it just means you have one less thing to think about one less thing to potentially forget about, which is amazing. So you can find L by going to your local target. They're in targets everywhere. And they're also in some pharmacies as well. It's the best looking package on the shelf. Look for a clear clear canister with a gold lid or white bags with a large gold circle on the front with the logo L on it. They're also available on Amazon. You can also head on to that's L dot com slash Lauren, the letter L dot com slash Lauren to get organic tampons, pads and liners. That's this is and the letter L dot com slash Lauren. And if you use the code Lauren, you just help them know that it's our show who sent sent you there and kind of told you about them. So getting into some clown world craziness. Our first story is one that's been getting a lot of attention online. It's certainly how I found out about it. And it's definitely right up our alley in terms of topics. A mother and father are currently in a custody battle of their two seven year old sons and what makes this newsworthy different than other custody battles. You might hear about is that one of the boys, the mother claims is trans and should be transitioning into a girl. The father very much disagrees. We have a summer here and just by the way guys, I currently have an amazing case of the sniffles. So sorry. I sound stuffy. Lauren might also be out of it tonight because as if anyone who falls on Twitter, you might know that she is on painkillers. So I took two Tylenol's shot. She might be a little bit out of that. She's a little bit loopy, you know, right? Yeah. Okay. So as Breitbart, Breitbart reports, jury decides against dad seeking to block seven year old son from gender transition drugs. A jury in Dallas, Texas decided Monday against a father seeking to block his ex whites plan to start their seven year old son on puberty blockers and ultimately cross sex hormones in order to facilitate gender transition. The jury decided James's mother, Dr. Anne Georgulus, a pediatrician has full authority to continue his transition. The transition of James who is being renamed Luna reported life site news. James's mother sought to terminate younger parental rights, who is the father because James behaved as a boy when he was with his father. Dragulus has diagnosed James with gender dysphoria, a psychological disorder that is characterized by a child's persistent, consistent and insistent and assertion of their cross gender statements and behaviors. The court prohibited younger from dressing him as a boy or from sharing faith based or biologically based scientific teachings on sexuality, even though family friends who have observed James when he is in his father's care reportedly affirm he dresses and behaves as a boy by his own choosing. This is not the first case of, let's say, a custody coming into question because of the whole trans issue, but what makes this case, I guess kind of alarming is that this isn't coming from California or New York, like these liberal bastions where we've heard about this so much before. This is from Texas. And I know Texas is becoming increasingly purple as Californians flee from the mess of California that they have created with their liberal policies and bring them to places like Texas and Arizona, but still hearing that this is in Texas and not, you know, Los Angeles or somewhere in Canada, it should worry people. That was what stuck out to me the most certainly. Yeah. And I mean, you guys know what my position on trans children is. I feel like if you're an adult, call yourself whatever you want, do whatever you want with your body, you know, there's a chance I'm not going to agree with your choices. But then in the day you're an adult, you do you when it comes to children, though, children aren't mentally developed. That's a scientific fact. I don't support children getting credit cards. I don't support them signing contracts, smoking, drinking. And I certainly don't support them making decisions about what gender they are. My rule is if you're too young to responsibly choose what your bedtime is and whether or not you can eat dessert before dinner, then you're probably too young to choose your gender. That's my approach. But as we can clearly see, that's a viewpoint that's I think the majority of people still share, but it's becoming less and less common among certain institutions. Yeah. If that's someone telling me that you only need a small percentage of society to actually shift how society works. And I think that this is a just a perfect example of that where you have these radicals essentially telling everybody else how they have to live. Yeah. That's absolutely true because I mean, despite what the average person thinks, look, the American psychiatric and psychological associations support the existence and the transition of like these so-called trans kids. So I mean viewpoints like ours that, hey, maybe we should wait before we start giving children hormones and stuff. Those are the minority fringe positions that are not being accepted in mainstream academia. And dare I say, even medicine. And so just something that's not mentioned in the Breitbart article, but I've been reading other things and you want to clarify. Apparently the mother is not saying that she wants to put the seven year old on gender or hormone blockers right now, which is like a statement. I would love to have never said, but she hasn't ruled out the possibility of doing it when he gets older. So from my understanding what the mother is wanting to do right now is socially transition, including keeping the child away from anyone who doesn't affirm that he is a girl. But that I think hormone blockers would only potentially come into the picture maybe when they're 9, 11 or whenever puberty starts. Now one thing that stuck out to me about this too, by the working of the article is I understood that she is the pediatrician doctor, right? Who diagnosed also the mother who diagnosed her own son's gender. Yeah, he has been to see other other. I assume so. But yeah, it seems it seems like they would definitely give weight to that and that ought not to be the case, right? You can't be diagnosing your family. It's not that's illegal in most places. In fact, exactly. And it's very, yeah, it seems concerning to me. Yeah. And I think to me, when I look at this whole trend, child phenomenon, like there are several conditions, mental conditions that you actually cannot receive a diagnosis of if you are a minor, especially if you are as young as someone like seven, I think bipolar is one of these things, personality, disorder, just because a lot of the symptoms of different psychological clinicians, they might appear more prominent among young people because young people are prone to being more emotional identity crises and all of these things. So it makes it hard. But for some reason, that type of thinking doesn't apply to gender dysphoria. You know, it totally fine to just say that a kid has it. I did an interview a couple months ago with trans activist Julie Goldstein. I very much disagree with what Julie said, but I do appreciate that she came on was very, very cordial, very nice. And she explained and she's very knowledgeable about the process that children have to go through to transition now. And although it's shocking to me that this is even a thing as much as I might object to it, this is the reality. And I encourage anyone who's interested and concerned about this topic to go watch that interview because we need to understand what's happening and what is being pushed as mainstream medicine right now. From what it's from what's been shared about the story, this particular case, it seems like the evidence that's been put forward to support this young boy being trans includes things like him identifying as Elsa from Frozen. I think is what really set it off. He apparently likes to play dress up in dresses. And it was also reported that when his mother told him to pick a girl's name, he wanted to use Starfire, which is the name of a cartoon character. But then she told him to choose like a different name. And that's how Luna came about. He's now being referred to as Luna. So you can't choose your own name because you're a child and you're going to choose a stupid name from a cartoon because that's what kids do, but you're totally fine to identify as whatever you want. So some people who hear this might be thinking, Hannah second, do those things actually make someone like a little boy trans like there's a character in a movie who's a female. He wants to be like her. He's put on a dress during play time. Are those things actually grounds for saying a child is trans? Yes. Yes. Yes. They are right now actually. And I go through this more detail with my interview with Julie, but we actually have the diagnostic criteria that's used on gender dysphoric kids or whatever it is here. So this is from the American Psychiatric Association. So this is not just some fringe, fringe tumbler, trans activist blog. This is what is actually being used to determine whether kids should be getting puberty blockers or not. It says in children, gender dysphoria diagnosis involves at least six of the following and an associated significant distress or impairment in function lasting at least six months. So these are the things, the eight things that people will look for when they're diagnosing whether a child has gender dysphoria. They're expected to have at least six of the eight. Okay. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender sounds pretty straightforward. But I remember when I was a kid, I, I would call myself a dinosaur. So I don't know how much weight we can be putting into how children self identify. They go on to say a strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite gender. Okay. So what does that mean? If you're a little girl, like if you're a little girl and you want to play as a policeman. Are you, are you breaking boundaries and saying, like, look, I can be whatever I want. I'm a girl, or are you actually manifesting? Right. This for you. That was my point. Because it seems like what he could be doing is perfectly normal and like even what a progressive would want. Yeah, because like gender clothing is a social construct. Right. Exactly. But instead they're like, no, instead you actually are binary. Yeah. You actually are and you're the opposite of what you've, of what you were born as. Yeah. So just, you know, a feminine boys and tomboy girls be danged. Apparently we're really leaning into the binary. They continue a strong preference for cross gender roles and make belief play or fantasy play. Again, what is that? Like you wanted to be, you pretend to be like the girl character. Therefore, this is a sign that you are a trans girl. We have a friend who I think you mentioned in games always wants to be the girl character. Yeah, I don't get that. Yeah. But it's like, is that an example? Well, he might be in this point. I mean, I'm only bouncing, of course. Yeah. So it's, it's pretty ridiculous. I would think that that would be like a sign of like a comfortable new masculinity that you're, you're comfortable role playing as the female. I don't know. They also continue a strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender, a strong preference for playmates of the other gender. A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of ones assigned, ones assigned gender. So at this, okay, this doesn't make sense. We're living in a time where we're being told that the idea that there's boy toys or girl toys is socially constructed and damaging for children because it inhibits their growth and puts them in these boxes. But at the same time, we're being told that if your child who is a girl wants to play with boy toys, she's probably actually a trans boy because like so, of course preference and toys is so innate. It can actually signal gender dysphoria, but at the same time, it's completely socially constructed and gender is meaningless. Like you, you can't have it both ways. And what should be concerning to people is just how loose and seemingly random these criteria are. They continue though, a strong dislike of one's sexual anatomy. Okay, that's maybe like the first genuine one I could see would raise red flags and a strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match one's experience gender. So, you know, I want kids to be happy to be able to, you know, play with whatever toys they play with. I think if you're someone who's saying, no, my little girl can't play with Hot Wheels, which I really don't think anyone does, but hypothetically, I don't think that's right. I think, you know, kids should be able to explore whatever playtime and that they want. I just feel like if you take, let's say, a neurotic progressive virtue signaling parent, you give them maybe a tomboy or an effeminate little boy and you give them this list. I think it's going to be very likely that they start saying, oh, hang on a second. Yeah. Maybe there's something there. Maybe I have a trans child. I need to support that. And then they go to the pediatrician with their son or daughter and this. Hey, tell the doctor about this time where you did that and this and they lead everything, you know, so there's only one logical conclusion. Yeah. And that's exactly what is kind of the contention in the case because the father is saying, hang on a second, like when the child is with me, he's perfectly happy being called James. He dresses like a boy. He signs his name as a boy that I don't see anything like that. And what's what frustrated me is that even if with his mother, this little boy is playing dress up, being feminine, whatever, that still doesn't mean that he needs to transition as a girl. Like what happened to just little boys being able to play dress up and it's innocent for a while. And maybe that's something they were out of. And actually speaking of that desistence is something that's it's when children who identify as trans or exhibit signs of gender dysphoria actually grow out of it more often than not. I mean, these numbers are contested. I think more research needs to be done of it, but it's actually right now the standing numbers are anywhere from 65 to 85% of kids who experience gender dysphoria do grow out of it. And continue to identify as cis adults. And that's that's fine. And I think if we go into it with the mindset that now they've expressed some confusion or exploration, now we need to completely transition them. You're going to be causing more problems for these kids than not because the odds are and statistics show this. This is just a phase. This is just curiosity and exploring. We shouldn't shame these kids for that because, you know, it's it's natural to a certain point. And I just worry that we have these parents who probably do want think they're helping potentially actually greatly hurting their children. And I know when I was speaking with Julie, she was saying is like, well, we're just starting with a social transition. So what's the harm if they change their mind later for a trans activist who talks so much about the dangers of being misgendered. You don't understand the harm that the living as a like socially transitioned girl for years on end. If that's not how you don't understand why that would be problematic for a child. If it ends up just being a run of the male child, which is likely is the case. And the problem here is that, you know, listening to the story, I'm sure a lot of us are freaked out, scared for the kid, but it may be at the back of our minds. We're thinking, well, that'll never happen to my kid because my spouse isn't crazy. We're not going to be, you know, thrown into this court thing, but But you haven't couldn't take care. Exactly. That's when we say if the precedence is set, which it's looking like it is that not recognizing your child's new gender identity or whatever is child abuse, it won't matter whether you and your spouse are on the same page that you don't want them to transition. Like if there's a teacher out there, a doctor, a nurse who who says that, you know, that's what the kid is and you're the ones who are denying it, the end result is going to be the same. Your child is going to be taken from you. There will be nothing stopping this. You know, this is already kind of, I think, law in Canada. We've seen different cases of this in the States. This is scary. I think if you're a parent or you're thinking of becoming a new parent, this is definitely something I'm thinking about when I'm thinking about where you want to raise your kids. This should be becoming an increasingly narrow spectrum of places. Yeah, where you won't have your kid taken from you for saying. I don't, I don't know. I don't know if we should be, you know, calling him Luna, making him wear dresses, this go and all that just because he wants to be Elsa from Frozen. I mean, maybe at this point, we do need to make sure that our daughters don't play with heart wheels. Yeah. Just in case so that some, you know, overzealous kindergarten teacher doesn't start saying, like, Oh, by the way, your child has gender dysphoria. It's just it's that's just like, it's a dystopia. I don't understand it. And oh goodness, I know looking at the social media comments from this. There are all these people who are saying, no, the father is abusive. Although he should be, he is right to have his cussy taken away. The only signs of abuse that I could see are him refusing to call his son by Luna, which previously in a different case, the mother did try to have him, like, I guess, charged with child abuse for, for not referring to him for with the name that she prefers. It's this is clown world. I think we all just need to keep up to date with this story. I don't know if the father is going to be challenging this, but if he does, like, and he needs to raise money for lawyers or whatever it may be, I think a lot of people would be more than happy to donate for him because they're scared of what's going to happen to this little boy. And I think for a lot of people, this is all about affirming an ideology, insisting, yeah, no trends. Identity is real. I don't know that for everybody. The child's well-being is the main concern, which it should be. All right. So before we move on to our next segment, I actually did want to mention we're going to be at Politicon this coming weekend in Tennessee. I have a panel on Saturday and another one's on Sunday. I'm actually going to be on a panel with Lauren Duka, who's a feminist. We did a segment about so that's going to be interesting and it's going to be about feminism, the panel. So that's going to be a lot of fun. And we're also doing a meet and greet Sunday before one of my panels. I think it's at 1130. So if you're in the Tennessee Nashville area, it's going to be a lot of fun. There's going to be, I think, Anna Kasperin is doing a conversation with Tommy Larry. There's going to be a lot of people there. So I encourage you to check it out if you can make it. Now this past Monday was the Canadian elections and Prime Minister Blackface was victorious. Yeah, Canada will be keeping its liberal government and as disappointing as that is for a lot of Canadians right now. I did want to take this opportunity to discuss the idea of being post political. That's it's something that came up in a recent video we did about the rise of Jordan Peterson, which is the documentary about Dr. Peterson, obviously, and some of you did express interest about hearing more on that topic. So here we are. We're living in an age where everything is political, right? Music, movies, gender, relationships, math, even Seattle is instituting like this. Ethnic studies, math thing to talk about how I don't know why people appropriated math from it. I don't know. But say everything is political. We can't get away from it. Yeah, algebra. Yeah. So I think as political as everything is right now, we see that the result of this is that everybody is miserable. People are unhappy. You can't talk about anything without being canceled. Everything is divisive. It's not a nice way to live. I think I think we're seeing this. I mean, do you find Twitter a nice place? Is that a fun area to be in? As you guys can probably tell, if you do follow me on Twitter, I try to avoid it as best I can normally. It's awful. And I mean, it's in every, it's in everything now. I mean, I'm just talking with my youngest sibling the other day who was telling me about the politics in his high school in Canada. We graduated high school at 17. Well, no, just Quebec. Yeah, Quebec, Quebec in particular. We graduate high school at 17 and talking about people at that high school that I went to having political positions. And that was like not a case. When I was 17, it was just like just 17. Yeah. And I was like, man, that's really tragic. And then in my own life, definitely, I'm very much tired of living in a hyper-liberal environment and holding to my convictions. Yeah. It is definitely tiresome. Yeah. And I mean, don't get me wrong, politics are important. Policy is important. You know, coming to the new future, we might be doing some more videos that are specifically targeted to policy. But I think what we need to understand is that politics isn't everything. And policy alone is not enough to make either societies or individuals happy or thrive, right? No matter how good the laws are, you can't take a society of unhappy, of broken people, give them some good policy and expect that everything's going to end up okay, because that's not how it works. All right. Politics is downstream from culture. We always hear that. Yeah. Yeah, which is true. That's a hundred percent true. I think it is. Yeah. But what we don't understand is that culture is downstream from individuals and their individual, spiritual and mental states, right? So we have individuals here at the top below them. We have culture and then below that politics were so focused on the last stage of the equation on politics. We're trying to fix everything from something that is really the result cause not the solution. And I mean, by that point, it's much harder to control. Right. You know, the rivers you see are damn further up. Exactly. So it's and you know, our political system, I think it's fair to say, no matter what country you're in, if it's the UK, if it's Canada or the US, we can all admit like it's trash, right? It's trash everywhere. It doesn't matter where you live. Our culture is trash. It's like pure, I don't know, hedonism degeneracy, but at the same time, nihilism, materialism, it's terrible. We're not in a good place. And I'm realizing more and more that these things are trash because we are trash because like we as individuals have all of these problems. You know, the family structures and shambles, churches are receding, a communities are fragmented. And despite all those problems, like anytime there's a problem that someone identifies, they're first for so many people, their first instinct is to say, how can government fix this? And it's like government should be the last thing that's getting involved in all these things. And I'm not, that's not just the libertarian part of me talking. That's just like from a pragmatic standpoint, they're not that effective of it. They're removed from it. So, but instead of saying, what can we do as family members, friends, individuals, churches, communities, we're just saying, okay, let's, let's have the state fix it. And I mean, I understand that to some degree, because it's a lot easier to say, let's make new laws and everything will be fixed rather than say, hey, maybe we need to work on ourselves. Maybe if we want things to better, we have to work on our individual behavior, right? Maybe if like we're so concerned about like this massive debt, not that policy doesn't play a part in that, but maybe we should, maybe we should actually be spending less, right? If we're so concerned about, you know, the divide between men and women, like, yeah, these, all these like government mandated seminars in the workplace or schools that that's fine. But how about we actually just, I don't know, spend more time with our families and our partners? I mean, to me being post political, it's not just that I'm tired of politics and hearing people complain about the same stupid partisan things every day, Russia, gate, Ukraine, gate, impeachment now and it things like nothing really comes of it. It never changes, which is why we haven't really bothered to talk about it because it's like, well, next week, it's just going to be a new story. Nothing will get changed is more of the same. To me being post political is also realizing that, like, if we genuinely want to fix our society, we need to look beyond politics because politics, they can't fix things. They're not going to fix us as people. They're not going to fix our communities. If you look at all the different political systems out there, like, I, you know, I don't really support something like a universal health care system. I think it comes with a lot of problems. But at the same time, if you look at a community like Hong Kong, which aside from now, historically has had their stuff together, right? Everyone has a job. Everyone's educated. You can have bad policies in a put together society and they might still work. You could have no policies in a put together society and they might still work. It's only when things are in breakdown mode that politics becomes so important. But then at that point, it's too late. You're trying to, I guess, buffer something that's crumbling from the inside. It's not going to work. And, you know, that's not just me trying to point my finger at all of you guys saying you all need to get your stuff in order and, you know, clean your own rooms. I think like that's something that I, I take to heart a lot as well as because, you know, being in political punditry commentary or social commentary, I think looking at other people who do the same thing, it can be very draining. You know, Jordan Peterson, he recently spoke very honestly in an interview about these stresses he faces just being under constant social media criticism. And that's something that you hear a lot on the left, especially, but it's not just from the left. It's if you're online talking about politics, it's going to get heated. You're going to get a lot of crap. You're going to get threats. It's going to be negative. I mean, if you're on London, any capacity, politics is the worst of the worst in times of what you hear back from the audience. I mean, a lot of most people are great, but you get some extremely negative feedback, you know? Yeah, no, definitely. And not to mention, there's just the, the possibility that you will be burnt out talking about these subjects. I mean, it's like a lot of us, what we do, and I certainly do this, especially since we do this show, like when we look at the news, we're essentially, we're bombarded with the worst stories out there, the most outrageous, the worst examples that does way on your psyche. And you know, looking at, obviously, Dr. Peterson has other things going on in his life right now, but it really showed me that if you want to be able to just be able to function effectively in politics, you need to make your life about more than politics, right? Because ultimately politics is going to drain you out. It's going to burn you out. It's going to make you salty and bitter and such an inefficient machine that you're not going to, you're not going to be able to fix it with, you're not going to be able to fix much, frankly. Right. We've seen Trump ran on drain the swamp and we're still in a situation where it's like, there's still a swamp, unfortunately. Yes, it's stronger than ever in a lot of ways it seems. So I think we all need to kind of take a page out of Jordan Peterson's book and just clean our own rooms, right? The world is going insane around us, sure. But don't use that as an excuse to throw away any desire for a healthy, spiritual life, healthy family life, healthy career, because there's still a lot of fulfilling things you can do, just focusing on yourself, even as the world goes around you is just burning up in flames entirely. Right. And I think if we were all to do that, then maybe we wouldn't be in the situation where everything is burning in flames around us. You know, if we focus on ourselves and proving ourselves, proving ourselves, getting our stuff together and encourage other people to do the same, I think we're also going to find that political activism then becomes more useful, right? Because in politics right now, doesn't matter what country you're in. Again, Canada, US, UK, it's all the same. There are people out there offering others lots of free crap. Free college, I don't know, UBI, take your pick. I just lost the election here in Canada. Yeah. And, you know, it was about the freebies that the Trudeau government has done. Exactly. Just less responsibility. That's what the government is now offering people. You can't win against that. If you're in a culture, which we are, that really prioritizes free stuff all the time, it's all about me. I want to do as little as possible to get the most return. You're not, you're not concerned about how you can help your country or your fellow citizens. It's all about what the government can do for you. If you're a conservative libertarian or even if you're just a liberal who doesn't want that vision of society, you can't win against that. And it's depressing, but it is the reality. And Max Simbernier, who we've had on the show before, he sadly lost his seat in Parliament after this past election, he used to say, I'm not going to appeal to your emotions. I'm going to appeal, appeal to your intelligence, which sounds great. But even as he was saying it, I knew that's not going to work in this day and age, right? We're living in a society in a culture that's convinced itself that feelings are as good as fact, what you feel determines objective reality. Until we start breaking down people's perception of that, it doesn't matter what else you're going to say. It doesn't matter how strongly you lobby for personal responsibility. They're in the mindset that it's just me, me, me, take, take, take all the time. Unless we begin to address that mentality, then any type of political advocacy is just going to be useless. It's politics just becomes a game of, I guess, trying to buy people's votes with the best freebies, which is what we're living in right now. And this is clown world. But despite that, I'm going to focus on my job, my family, look for a safe place to raise kids, go to church, do whatever I can to provide myself with some order and structure. And I would encourage all of you guys to do the same because I think when we look at all things like the Canadian election, Brexit isn't going well for our friends across the pond. There is this, I think maybe tendency, some people might have to become very demoralized, to become very nihilistic. Then they'd start doing crazy things like supporting Andrew Yang, just to watch the world burn. My hope is that you guys don't do that. Regardless of how politics is going, there are still a lot of strides that you could be making in your personal life, in our communities and our churches, so many different things. So I guess to me, I'm more and more leaning that post-political side. Again, it doesn't mean policy is not important. If there's an election, you go vote, vote your conscious, educate yourself, but it's not everything. It's not going to save us. I think more people need to realize that. Actually, you've been pretty disillusioned for longer than me, I think. Yeah, I've been disillusioned for years. I still go out there and I vote. It's almost difficult because I'm a producer of a political show. I just like, all right, well, we have to find topics, but I don't care about any of these almost. That's what I find so much. I'll get people saying, why don't you talk about this? Because it literally doesn't matter. The news cycle is going to change in three days. No one's going to be talking about this and it will have changed nothing for anybody. Yeah. It's the case for a lot of politics. All right, so our light segment for the show, just to spruce things up a little bit, we're going to be talking about Miley Cyrus. Yeah. So she's gifted us with quite a few segments. Thank goodness for her. Yeah, Miley Cyrus, so she recently caused a stir by asserting that, quote, you don't have to be gay. That's true. And Instagram live, she'll be just true. You don't have to be gay. Yeah. But you know, people aren't happy for context because I'm sure most of you are not keeping up with the adventures of Miley Cyrus. So she was too many people are. Too many people are. I saw the numbers today. She has 100.5 million Instagram followers. Yeah. And something like 40 plus million Twitter followers. Oh, yeah. That's insane. That's insane. I mean, it's the same with the Kardashians. But especially Miley. Like, why Miley? Why do people pick Miley Cyrus? That's crazy. I know there are more wholesome celebrities out there, even if you do want to follow a celebrity. So like I said, for context, several months ago, she divorced her husband, Liam Hemsworth, who she had only been married to for several months, started dating a woman like immediately after they broke up, surprising no one. Now she has a new boyfriend and they were doing an Instagram live video together, which is where this infamous clip came from. And we have that video here. I was just being like, I don't know, hardcore feminist vibes and just like, I don't know, not allowing anyone in, but now I am. They're a good man out there, guys. Don't give up. You don't have to be gay. There are good people with the **** there. You just got to find them. You got to find a **** on the ****. You don't have to be gay. I know. I always thought I had to be gay because I just thought like, all the guys were evil, but it's not true. They are good people out there that just happen to have ****. I've only ever met one. But I was having that one. I'm just like, people didn't like that. People did not like that at all. And as soon as I saw the clip that was being passed around, I immediately understood, yeah, that's the problem. You can't say that. She's right, though. You don't have to be gay. That's true. You don't have to be heterosexual. Yeah, it is still acceptable. But it kind of sounds like she bought into the whole political lesbianism thing. So we did a show a while ago about political lesbianism. And there's this kind of hardcore, I think people would call her a turf feminist, Julie Bindel, who actually unironically asserts that because men are so trash, just date women. Because otherwise you're assisting the patriarchy. Yeah, furthermore, you're a moral for not dating women. You are dating the enemy. You are. Yeah, exactly. So she says, yeah, just make the choice to be attracted to women. Yes. I think she's just like, I don't think it's a choice for her. I think she really is just like a lesbian who, but anyway. So it kind of sounds like Miley Cyrus in a way bought into that. She was trying. Yeah. You know, and man, I got to say, first of all, I'm in more political show. We try to be polite and everything like that. But man, I can't, I got to hardly get through a video of that woman. She's like what, 26 or 28 or something like that? Something like that. She sounds like she's 45. She's on the Alex Jones smoking plan. Like, I mean, it's just, and you know that she smells like cats as well. That's what I've commented on. Like there was like a image of her. She doesn't look like she smells good. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe that's just my projection of her political, but it just doesn't seem clean. I don't know. But yeah, as you can imagine, people were not too thrilled with her saying that we have some responses that people were posting online. I thought it'd be fun to go through them. So this one person says, Miley Cyrus using queer identity to forge herself a new persona to gain attention and then turns around and claims you don't have to be gay. You just got to find a good, you know, male genital. The moment it doesn't serve her narrative anymore. And that's true because like she recently released this whole album where it was like this big feminist statement about being queer and she was giving interviews before she broke up with her husband about how what it means to be a queer woman in a straight relationship. I remember that quote specifically. It was the weirdest thing ever. Is she still queer now? Does like does this mean she doesn't have to be gay? Does that mean that she is straight? How like what is that change from day to day? Yeah, who knows? Sometimes and several times within the same day at the same time, nobody knows. But yeah, I think there are a lot of people who were when she said that kind of felt like it was almost like rainbow corporatism. And I completely believe that this is what this is or that some celebrity, specifically these younger female celebrities are doing, they claim to be queer or pansexual or whatever it is to make a statement, get social media attention, get all of the support. And meanwhile, they're dating another guy. Maybe the guy identifies as non-binary, in which case it is a queer trans relationship. But at the end of the day, it's like, it seems like straight with extra steps. Yeah. Rick and Morty. Yeah, that's true. But he looks like marginally, I'm looking at his eyes during that video whenever they're not like hearts or whatever. But it's like, he looks mildly like, oh, oh. This is a dangerous person. Yeah, no run for the hills. Yeah. Good morning, Syne, should be going off. If they were an over, I don't know what kind of person dates Miley Cyrus. Someone who likes money, I guess? I don't know. Attention. This other person says, Miley Cyrus has been consistently racist and transphobic for the longest time with racism being her whole brand. Are people truly surprised? She's lesbophobic too. So I thought this one was interesting because I, again, I don't like Miley Cyrus. People have probably gotten that bite. But how is she racist and transphobic? Where is that coming from? I don't know. I feel like people like this probably think that most celebrities are racist. Yeah, just because they haven't, I don't know, they haven't done some sort of ritual where you worship the other races or whatever. Haven't been doing enough self-flagellation as a white person on social media. She hasn't dated anybody who's trans. Clearly that's transphobic. Also hate the term, lesbophobic. That's the first time I'm here. I don't like it. I'd much rather even lesbobic, like, you know, just, but lesbophobic. It sounds like not a real thing. I don't know. No, but they're going to, they're going to make new words and co-opting old words. Yeah, especially like phobias. They're good at making new phobias. So who know, I just brought this up because it's like, I often get called racist and transphobic. So I thought it would be nice to like, Oh, look, who also is racist and transphobic, you know? It's like, crazy world we live in. Okay. So this person's a verified check mark. So you know, it's going to be good, but she actually makes a point here. Steph Frosh says, apparently, Miley Cyrus said women don't have to be gay because there are good men out there. Like it's a choice as if I woke up one day and thought, Hmm, do I want cereal for breakfast or would I rather spice up my life with some depression, bullying and homophobia? So yeah, I think that was what a lot of people had problems with the idea that it is a choice. This person said in response to Miley Cyrus, lesbian slash by women already have a hard time being taken seriously as many people don't believe it's a real thing for women. And you just made a mockery and reinforce the stereotype that women are only gay because of their past experiences with men disappointed crying emoji. So okay, I will say to that we did a video a while a while ago about how society is getting gayer. And it didn't actually receive as much pushback or controversy as I thought. But we go through the studies and like this is it's scientifically supported that especially for women, your sexuality is influenced by environmental factors. That's different than saying it's a choice because you know something like PTSD for example is influenced by environmental factors doesn't mean it's a choice. But yeah, so it's like sexuality, especially for women, it can be influenced. And I think someone like Miley Cyrus, I don't have a hard time believing that she was in the mind. So like, oh, this is everyone's doing it. This is super cool. It's empowering. It's empowering. Maybe I had a bad breakup and now I think all men are jerks. So I don't know. But it also kind of reinforces the impression that I at least have had for a long time that among these hardcore feminists, it's it's not that men are trash. Maybe you just have bad tastes in men, perhaps. I don't know. Or maybe they're just not worth good men dating. Yeah, exactly. Maybe you're the problem here. Maybe. Yeah. And that's actually what some people were bringing up and I was like having a great time on Twitter reading all this stuff. That's like sometimes Twitter can be fun when it's like, it's drama I'm not involved in and is not political. So it doesn't really matter. I guess it's still bad for society that we care this much. But people were kind of saying that, hang on a second, she's like totally essentially bashing every single guy. She's dated. Yeah, you're the first good good guy that I've met. And furthermore, just all men as well, right? Which I noticed that nobody took offense to that. It was like, oh man, our crap. And the LGBT community was like, all right. So what about what about the game? It's like, wait a second, sounded very misandressed. Right. Exactly. So I mean, I will say she did release an apology and I'll read that out for us here. And she says, I was talking smack about sucky guys, but let me be clear. You don't choose your sexuality. You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to project the LGBTQ community I am a part of. Rainbow, happy Monday. Yeah, but this is it. So she's saying she's still part of the LGBTQ community, but it's like how though if you're saying you don't have to be gay, because now there's a good guy there, which is like fine whatever day who you want, but it's like you still want to claim to be part of the LGBTQ. Also, what she said in her apology is like the exact opposite. Oh, yeah, that's not an apology. There was no, yeah, there was no apology. And she just contradicted herself and was like, whatever, I put a rainbow in like me, please. Yeah. Send tweet. It worked. I mean, it didn't get ratioed. I was kind of surprised. Yeah. Why would you accept that? That is like the most mediocre thing I've ever heard. Yeah. But she's part of the LGBTQ community. She's choosing now to live as a gay man essentially is the equivalent of this apology. She's Trisha Paytas now. Yeah, exactly. So I mean, I don't know. And I feel like there this kind of like LGBTQ identity and like this makes really big waves online, but I feel like for the vast majority of people, they don't even know what we're talking about. They don't care what we're talking about. I really wonder. I mean, how this kind of marketing tactic works on places like middle America or even internationally, right? Because I mean, yeah, over here, we're all yelling at genders and bathroom usage pronouns. But I mean, other countries have other problems. So I don't know. I feel like just this is not a good time for the West, not at all. Okay. So also, I'm seeing that you guys are giving super chats, which is awesome.

The rot in Christianity. This is a, this is how we're finishing off the show. That's dark. It is. And this is a topic that I've been thinking about quite a bit lately and it's gotten me pretty fired up. Not going to lie. I have a lot to say about this, but we're going to try to be succinct and calm. That's the goal for this segment. So I know a lot of people who watch the show aren't Christian. Even if you're not, this is kind of what what's happening all over society. And I think you could still get a lot out of hearing about this. So recently I saw the term pachamama that made and most likely is not how you pronounce it, but that was trending on Twitter and all of the lovely Catholic friends that I follow on the platform seem to really fired up about something. So I was intrigued. So I looked into it and as it turns out at the Vatican recently they were having a sort of conference about the church in the Amazonian area and some figurines of pachamama who is from what I gather a fertility goddess were set up in this one church. And that's the background of the situation. Oh, and before that, even the pope was, you know, praying not to them, but like, yeah, they were being involved in some of the like, yeah, like they were, they were giving an honor of it to it in some capacity. And some of the masses. Yeah. So what was trending was that apparently some Catholic men went at night into the church, took the idols and threw them in the river, recorded, posted it online. And people had a lot, a lot to say about it. We have a video explaining things here. Good evening, Wyatt. We first saw this statue during our prayer service in the Vatican Gardens at the beginning of the month to mark the opening of the Senate. The statues had been brought to the Vatican by indigenous leaders from the Amazon region, which of course is the focus of this Senate. It set off a debate over why the figure, which appears to be a pagan fertility icon, was been used in a Catholic context. This video was posted online. It shows two men entering a church near the Vatican just before dawn. One enters the side altars and gathers up five of the statues and carries them out of the church. They proceed a short distance down the street to Castel St. Angelo, where one by one, they knocked the statues off the bridge and into the Tiber River. If you're not familiar with Catholicism or Christianity more broadly, this might seem like a very strange story. You might be thinking, Lauren, why are you talking about this? I want to hear more about Miley Cyrus. That may be you. But okay. The thing is idolatry is a big no-no in Christianity. One of the biggest no-no's I would dare say for going off the 10 commandments. You should not do it. And a lot of Catholics by the look of it, the vast majority of Catholics online did not really understand why an Amazonian fertility statue was being brought into their church and used in ceremonies. So Liam is our resident Catholic on the show. I'm Protestant. I feel like I can still talk about this because I think I go to Mass more often than a lot of Catholics do. So you're going to hear my opinions about it. So how do you feel about this before we go into it? Well, it's rough. But I think I'd preface it by talking about the Pope, first of all. I think it's been a huge disappointment. A huge disappointment. He's been a huge disappointment to a lot of Catholics, particularly traditional Catholics. It's particularly sad for me because he is the first Jesuit Pope, which is an impressive order. And I went to a school that was run by Jesuits. So it's really sad because I think that he's politicized a lot of what he does. And this is one example of that. At first I was a little bit confused as to what all the uproar was about. But when I saw what was happening, what they actually had these images of this pagan... Yeah, it's a pagan god, yeah. A pagan goddess in actual Vatican churches and chapels. That's when I was like, well, you know what? I mean, theft is always wrong. And we'll see a tweet about that in a second. But there's definitely some conditions around that. Right. No, for sure. And so a lot of... I would say there was a poll I saw that had tens of thousands of responses. I would say a good 87% of Catholics didn't understand why pagan statues were in their church. And the guys who threw it out, they were calling them heroes. I think the Vatican is saying they want an investigation over who those men were and the the thes and everything. People were saying, I will go fund me for their lawyers, whatever they need, these men. We need more people like that in the church. There were some other people though who were very, very upset about the fact that there was a theft involved. We have an example of this here. This is one of the more highly rated tweets relating to this when the original story was being shared from someone named Holly. She said, Yep, theft thou shalt not steal against the Catholic church and public scandal, not Catholic values. Good job. EWTN, which is the news network that was sharing it. So there, yeah, there were a lot of Catholics saying, how dare these men, you know, stealing, this is wrong. Stealing is wrong. Yeah. And categorically almost is wrong. Almost basically always. I, as categorically that goes right, theft is wrong. But I don't actually think that this is stealing. First of all, I don't. They clearly did not intend on keeping the idols as they threw them into the river. I think that this is just calling stealing is mis-categorizing what this is. This was a destruction of a pagan idol in a church. Yeah. And I think that there, there's concepts like just war and there are times when it is completely Christian to do something like this. It's, it's, it's acceptable when Jesus goes into the temple and up, and up turns the table. Yeah. Right. So yeah, I, I think that this is not theft by any means. And I think that this was a moral action. Right. And that's, that's what I think really got me about the people who are acting outraged about the men who threw away the idols. Like stealing is wrong, of course. But if you're more upset about two random men taking some wood carvings and throwing them away, then you are the fact that your church brought in pagan idols to set up in your chapels, like you need to check your priorities. Right. The fact that people would look at this and the main problem, the main takeaway is, Oh, no, that those mentioned have done that. Like really you don't see maybe a larger, more systemic issue that this is a symptom of. And I think that's what so many Catholics who supported these men were trying to say, like, Hey, I don't like stealing either. But this is a problem here. These men are finally doing something. And I think a lot of Catholics, like you were saying, don't feel represented by this current Pope who this to me, even the inclusion of these figures kind of seems like a diversity inclusion virtue. It absolutely does. And I think that it's actually, this is a grievous sin on behalf of those involved in the church. And I think that there are people that are within the church, priests and the like, and even probably bishops that are that are unhappy with what was going on there as well. Right. And I mean, I know some people might be thinking, Oh, but like idolatry is that really such a big deal. Is it worth making a big fuss about it? It's one top of the commandments, right? And I think we have this tendency, which we're going to talk a little bit about in a second to focus more on the secular aspects and teaching is of Christianity, the whole love thy neighbor stuff, which is all good. But don't forget the the most important parts are the way that we relate to God. And when it comes to idolatry, that is a sin against God. And we have this tweet from this one father who's certainly on board with those men did. He says regarding the stolen Vatican idols, it's worth noting that some of the idols were taken from the chapel of Saint Barbara, who was martyred by her own father for refusing to worship idols. Okay. So if idol worship is actually worthy of martyrdom, like you refusing to do that qualifies you as a martyr and for satanhood. And it's that serious that you would, you know, this person would rather die. You died for your faith. Yeah. Then worship these idols. It's pretty serious. The fact that we don't understand that it's serious kind of goes to show how more and more in the church are our values and our morals have been coming from secularism and instead of from what is biblical. And that's that that's a huge problem. And like this story, common interest, not necessarily because I care about these specific statues, but I think it's representative of a larger problem, you know, a larger issue within Christianity and across different groups, right? We see this in Catholicism. We see this in Protestantism. This is a problem everywhere. There's a growing movement in Christianity to conflate Christianity with just like being nice or just being inclusive, social, whatever it is, just like being a good person, which is not what Christianity is about. Now you don't get me wrong as Christians. Like we should be nice, but that's not the main message of Christ is like he didn't come down to say, Hey guys, be nice. You know, despite what I guess some Twitter atheists and apparently also unfortunately Christians think that is not the point of the Bible to tell you to be a good person. Some Catholics might say throwing out a different religion statue isn't very nice. What's wrong with trying to be more inclusive by featuring different cultures? And here's the thing, not in a church, not in a church, right? I'm not necessarily someone who thinks that being inclusive is a bad thing. But when it comes to the church, I think there should at least be the standard that this is the God we worship, not these other ones. And it's okay to say that. If you can't say we don't worship this pagan God in a Catholic church, then where can you say it? Right? Because we certainly can't say it anywhere else. And like the gospel isn't a let's be tolerant of everything message. Okay, it's not it's not a let's be nice and passive and happy in offensive Christians type of message. Okay. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Okay. Classic John 3 16. Okay. That is the gospel. And now I believe that as Christians, anything you do should be done out of love because the gospel is about love. But if something gets away, gets in the way of that message rather, and yes, I would include idol worship here, then it's our I think it's our responsibility to take action. And like screw being polite in this like politely, call it idol, I'll treat that be great too. But I think we're in a situation now where that's just going to fall on deaf ears. So yeah, it's like so here we go. Being nice is great, but it's not the ultimate goal. And especially when we have something like this going on within the church, right? Because because there are so many times in society where Christians will find themselves at odds with the mainstream and the Bible tells us that this will happen, that we will be kind of in the world, but not of the world. And that's okay. That's just something that we have to live with. But when these types of, I guess attacks against the faith and against biblical values are coming from within the church, then it becomes that much more serious. And I think that's exactly what we were seeing here, unfortunately. And I think it's also good that these guys showed a backbone. Yeah. I'm willing to stand up for my faith. I'm willing to do something that is offensive to some. They filmed it, they put it out there. And I think it's a display of strength and a display that you take your values seriously. And I think if you see anything like we just saw the Canadian elections where you have this like wet Kleenex of a person, Andrew Sheer, running for the conservative government, you're like, you know, if you only stood by like conservative values, it would just go so much better for everybody. Yeah. And I think this is what Kleenex, a lot of fine conservative movements have become, it's under the pressure of like the liberal kind of status quo. It's super unattractive to the onlookers. But I think people seeing this kind of thing as a display of strength. And it's actually something that I think would attract more people. Well, that's the thing. Christianity in a lot of ways. And again, this isn't exclusive to Catholicism is Protestantism too, has become weak, neutered, impotent on the defense of all the time. We're too afraid to actually stand up for what we believe. I mean, if we look at like the church forefathers, people were dying being crucified for preaching their beliefs. Now we're, we're too afraid to get rid of wooden idols within our own church. Are you serious? It just shows you how far things have fallen. I'm someone who I believe like ultimately, you know, gates of hell will not prevail. I'm sure of that. I think we are at one of those times when, you know, future Christians will look back and they will condemn us and they will regret how weak. And I don't know how I guess brittle we were in our faith to afraid to do anything to stand up for it. And I think, you know, secularism is becoming more and more widespread and it's concerning to me, but it's even more concerning when you see how it's infiltrating churches itself. Because so many Christians out there entire churches, they're not operating on biblical standards of morality. They're going for secular standards. And the two overlap, absolutely. But don't make the mistake of thinking that they're the same thing this past Sunday at church. The homily was about church's heritage, right? And things like providing healthcare, education, the community, that kind of thing. And this priest, I have to say, I like him a lot. It's very rare that I have issue with anything he says. He's a, he's a good guy. But what really bothered me was that how he was talking about the church's heritage as this, you know, social services organization, when he's kind of completely overlooking the fact that Christianity is, it's not just a heritage, it's not just a history. It's a current lifestyle now. It's a relationship that exists now in the present. And it's not meant to be this charitable organization worldwide. I mean, it can be that as well, but that's not, that's not its main purpose. So it's like, are you kidding me? I know focusing on things like humanitarian work, it's not controversial. Even you know, a lot of militant atheists will still be like, Oh, well, at least the Christian, you know, they do some charity work and that's great. And it's a lot easier to stick by that kind of things than it is evangelizing, which is controversial. But that's not what we were compelled and ordered to do as Christians, right? This priest explains it while it was a, it was a clip that I found in the same places of the, the patch of a clip. And it's in, I think, Spanish. So apologies for people who are listening on the audio platform only. Unless you speak Spanish, you won't be able to see the English subtitles. But he's kind of saying the same thing I'm saying here. I'm not saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm going to say that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying thatI'm saying that I'm saying. It's not. It's a good thing that Christians are so compelled to do charity work, it is. Oh, also I apologize to our audio cause I that was fully Hispanic. What would you call it? A humanitarian organization. Social services. Yeah. And don't get it. Don't. It's not that that's bad. Right. Now that is an offshoot of what the real mission is. Right. But it is not the core mission. He says like we can be a people, a group that is happy to help others, but our main goal, our main focus needs to be proclaiming the word of Jesus Christ, spreading the gospel. And I think for a lot of churches, they have left lost sight of that. They have kind of morphed into these almost secular charitable organizations, which is like charity is good, but don't confuse yourself into thinking that you're actually living by the commandments of what we have been charged with doing by simply doing that because that's not the case. That's your, you're living by a very earthly standard, judging people's needs. Right. You're saying, okay, this person's hungry. This person's this. I want to make them comfortable as, as Christians, our main goal, our main concern should not be comfort because we know that we're not promised comfort. These people will not be promised comfort, but what we can give them is the message of the gospel. And so, you know, seeing all of this stuff with the, I think for a lot of Catholics, the, the statues were kind of what they represented was a larger problem they're having with the church. It's something that I definitely feel as well. And if you're interested in topics like this and how secularism and even social justice specifically is infecting Christianity. I recommend you check out Ali Stuckey show relatable. You can find her anywhere we can be found podcast, Google iTunes, Spotify as well as on YouTube. But this is, this is a growing problem. And you know, speaking of living post politically, I think, you know, it's okay to say politics isn't everything. But when it comes to something like the church, like this actually is like we can't ignore this. I would say this is way, way more important than any political fight that's happening right now. And we should all be very, very concerned with the way things are going. But I think that's pretty much all we have to say on those issues. Like I said, it was I'm fiery about the last segment. But if you're watching live, please stay on the stream. We're going to be back in just a few seconds with some Q and A. And aside from that, we'll see you guys next week."
