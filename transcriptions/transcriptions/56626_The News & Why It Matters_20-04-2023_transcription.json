    "text": " Today, Matt Walsh gets hacked and the leftist media celebrates. BuzzFeed news is dead. Hmm, wonder why? And Democrats vote against protecting women. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and yesterday Matt Walsh returned to Twitter after being hacked by an unknown activist who posted racial slurs and other incoherent ramblings under his account. The hacker also gained unfettered access to 20 years worth of emails and several of Matt's email accounts which of course leftist reporters were immediately salivating over. One of those reporters, Dell Cameron from the website wired.com actually went so far as to ask the hacker for these illegally obtained materials. You can see right here, he posted, prove me wrong kids. And Matt Walsh DMs2, Dell Cameron at wired.com. Later on, he said spoke with the hacker who says he's compromised what Matt Walsh's account and who was able to supply some convincing proof they'd gained access to his personal email account. Story to come. Yes, I'm sure anxious to finally take Matt Walsh down by finding something. Anything off color he said 20 years ago and pretending to be offended by it. He ended up publishing his puff piece on the hacker who provided him with loads of Matt's personal information including personal tax forms and private email conversations dating back to 2014 and was subsequently suspended from Twitter for a violation of their distribution of hacked materials policy. And of course, instead of having any level of moral integrity, any humility, any ability to reflect on his own wrongdoing, he couldn't help but make himself out to be the victim. Wired, his own company tweeted out, we learned Wednesday afternoon that senior reporter Dell Cameron's Twitter was permanently suspended after he reported on Matt Walsh's Twitter account being hacked. Neither Dell's story nor his Twitter feed contained hacked materials. We do not believe his account violated Twitter's policy. We have not received any further explanation from Twitter and our attempts to reach Twitter's press office were met with the customary poop emoji. We asked that the account be reinstated and that Twitter provide an explanation. Interestingly, they failed to mention that he in fact solicited illegally obtained and hacked materials which as I said earlier directly violates Twitter policy, it wasn't the reporting on the hack. It was the solicitation of the illegally obtained materials but what else would you expect from the lying leftist fake news media? Well, as for Matt, he has vowed harsh legal action against the hacker and the insider who helped him gain access to Matt's personal information. He tweeted out yesterday, over the last year my family has been harassed, threatened, docked and now we can add hacked to the list. Apparently the hacker had an insider who gave him access to my phone. A lot we still don't know but we're finding out and there will be consequences. I have also made note of the members of the media who openly solicited stolen information from my phone. There will be consequences there too. Fortunately, we can afford very good lawyers and in an effort to avoid using the swear jar this earlier, this early in the program. I will just say that my friends is what I believe they call F around and find out. Here to discuss this and more, we have Alex Stein, host of prime time with Alex Stein which you should be subscribed to on YouTube. Make sure that you are subscribed to. Listen, I can't promise you're going to see things that are like you want your pastor to know that you're watching but it is funny. I'll take that. Yes. It's a little x-rayed sometimes but it's different than anything else on the internet so please watch. It is and it's hilarious. We also have Caden Lopez back with us. One of the hosts of the KGB show, the K in KGB I should say. Thanks for having me back. I know the B was here yesterday. Yeah, the B. The G was here a little bit ago. Yeah, glad to be back. Yeah, it's good to have you. One day we need to have you all at the same time. Yeah, we need an extra share. Yeah, it will make you happy. We got that. We have, we do. We'll get you covered on that. So it's just fascinating to me that the same leftist media who felt so sorry for Hunter Biden, oh no, he was so drugged up. He was so drunk. He was so cracked out when he went and turned in his laptop that it's not his fault that this laptop got exposed, leaked even though he did sign a policy that if he abodes it abandoned his property, it would no longer be his property. Even though we're talking about illegal acts, right? Compromising acts, illegal acts that are being exposed somehow now. It's awesome that Matt Walsh's personal private information was illegally obtained and sent to this reporter. I realize the reporter didn't post a screenshot. He just described in detail what it was. Well, you know, you see his tweet blows on dice. Like he's so lucky to get this information. What is he going to do with it? You know, I guess, I guess really and sadly, I think what he wants is somebody to go to his house and rough up his family or rough up him. Like that's why Tocke Carlson, my biological stepfather or actual biological dad, neither here nor there. He had to move because- Wait, how is one a biological stepfather? Well, because I want him to claim stepfather, but he is my biological dad, but he will not give me DNA to test that. That's neither here nor there. This is serious, Alex. My point is that they actually want people going to your door, knocking on him and saying F you. And this is very clear that that's what they wanted to do. They want physical violence. A lot of these transgender attacks you see now, people are getting more violent, that these people on the left, they really want the violence. They want the BLM summer to happen all over again. Yeah. And I can attest to that personally. I've had my information exposed, my address exposed, where people go. And Zhiya would be a shame if people just showed up to and then posted my entire address on the internet for Antifa to show up. And to Alex's point, what purpose would they have for showing up other than to harass or threaten you with violence? Yeah. I mean, we see how effective Matt Walsh has been over the past couple of months. I mean, he's been in the Tennessee State House actually getting stuff done. That's why he got hacked. It's to find anything that might possibly discredit him. But as we know, there's been a lot of great people over time, even if there's something bad that comes out. You know, have done a bad thing or do, does that discredit anything they've said? No, it doesn't. He's been a genuine actor in the conservative movement and everything he said has been correct. So I think the attempt to discredit him is, you know, like he said, he's going to press legal charges, but he won't be taken down. I mean, he's a good actor. He seems like a genuine good human being. He's a Catholic guy, you know, has a good family. So I don't think they'll be able to take these emails and discredit him in any kind of way. I mean, especially when, you know, again, this is illegally obtained material. So you're committing a crime in order to expose someone or take someone down. I just think that in itself just can't be taken seriously, right? Yeah. I mean, the thing is though, they're going to go unpunished. We can't expect the legal system to be on our side at all at this point because we don't own any part of the actual politics with us not having majorities anywhere. The legal system isn't going to help us out. So Matt, Matt can, you know, put up an effort. But what's really going to happen? They're probably going to brush it off. Well, I hope not, but you know, it's fascinating because this, the hacker he claimed in this article, this puff piece on this. Oh my good. What do you call himself? Doomsday or something? This hacker said that he was just bored. That was his, that was his excuse. Oh, I was just bored. But I don't think that that's the case because as he also said, he needed an insider. He had an insider that he was working with who gave him access to Matt's, I don't know if it was his phone number or his, what, what it was in his phone, but he was working closely with an insider. That doesn't sound like, oh, I was just randomly bored and I decided to hack someone's phone. That sounds like a very well thought out plan. Yeah, and Matt confirmed that and it's sweet. So I mean, obviously this was a quote unquote inside job. Somebody knew that they had access and they lead to the wrong people. And that's another thing, you know, Matt Walsh is a polarizing figure that there probably are people that are want to work for him because they need to make a living, but secretly they don't have, they don't share his politics. So the idea of somebody leaking it, like the reason why I go back to the sinister nature of it, it's not like he's just leaking a phone number. So people in crank column and be like, oh, you're, you know, refrigerate is running or something. They literally want people to go scare him and intimidate him by having that information out so that he has to maybe move or that he just lives in constant fear. Mm hmm. Okay. So I want to switch to, you know, we're talking about this amazing journalism being done by wire.com. Let's switch over to more amazing journalism being done by BuzzFeed who I have bad news for you guys. What? BuzzFeed is shutting down BuzzFeed news because it is not able to turn a profit and they're laying off 15% of their employees or about 180 people across all of their divisions. RIP BuzzFeed news. It's really sad stuff. That's where I get all my news. All your news comes from BuzzFeed news. It's just fascinating because, you know, they launched in 2011 and they took the evolution, the journalistic evolution that they took. And I seem to recall another company who launched in the same year. Oh, that's right. This company right here who is like, we're just expanding because we did things the right way and we don't lie to people. So I feel like that helps when you're trying to build some sort of a news organization, a news website. I think it helps to like actually tell the truth. Well, and it was a short time ago when the onion was like one of the biggest satire sites and there was a time when BuzzFeed was everywhere. You couldn't even look at your feed. I mean, BuzzFeed was just everywhere. And to see them fall and then you see, you know, Babylon B is dominating. The Blaze is doing well. We just added a new show, Dave Landau in Quarter Black Garrett. I'm just saying, you know, you see us growing and then them dying. And I think the cultural shift where people were realizing, hey, a lot of this liberal leftist propaganda is not entertaining. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's not just BuzzFeed, right? We've seen CNN plus God, they lasted what a whole 31 days. Not even I don't think. Yeah. And regular CNN, their viewers are just plummeting. I mean, we're seeing this all across leftist media. Yeah. BuzzFeed and their prime basically lived off just click bait and whatnot. And I think people kind of got tired of that. The reason places like this are on the come up and just doing so well over time is because they're genuine. When they say things, they mean it. They're not doing things with Mal and 10, which that's what BuzzFeed lives off of. So it's fascinating too. I just was, as we were talking about this, I just recalled that BuzzFeed was the one who published the Steele dossier before they were able to even prove that any of it was true, that any sort of credibility for it. And they were the one to publish it. This just seems like a whole lot of karma that now BuzzFeed news is shutting down. Well, I hold on moment of silence. Okay, that's enough. No, that's enough. No, no, no, no. It was just a. I am sad. I mean, now we're making me my news. I mean, what the heck? I don't know. I'm really. I don't know. You could try a program called the news and why it matters. Yeah. I mean, the buzz is just, it's just so inaccurate that I love it. You know what I mean? I just love fake news. I'm just addicted to it. No, and I think you're right with that Steele dossier. I mean, that was the biggest lie. And we talk about QAnon, obviously, is crazy, but Blue Anon, the leftist, you know, version of conspiracy world, Steele dossier, they just basically reinforced all of that weird conspiracies that all the people believe on the left. So yeah, bye bye, BuzzFeed. Yeah, bye bye. You're worse than any conspiracy theorists out there. Now, BuzzFeed, we can dedicate the Ralph Wigam meme to you today. I'm a journalism. That didn't work out well for you, BuzzFeed. All right, we've got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more first when I think our sponsor, Patriot Mobile. So Patriot Mobile is, look, we talk about participating in the parallel economy all the time. It's necessary because this woke ideology is infecting companies at the highest level. So big mobile, they've been dumping millions into leftist causes and we just had to take it because another option didn't exist. Well, it does with Patriot Mobile. They're America's only Christian conservative wireless provider. They have nationwide coverage on all three major networks. So you are going to get the best possible service in your area without knowing that a portion of your money that you pay each month is actually being donated to left-leaning causes that are working to destroy this country. When you switch to Patriot Mobile, you're going to support free speech, religious freedom, the sanctity of life, the Second Amendment, our military, veterans, and first responder heroes and they do have 100% US-based customer service team. It's going to make switching very easy. You can go to patreon mobile.com slash news. It is patreon mobile dot com slash news. I'm going to try to say this without getting my channel just completely removed. So this is the part of the program where I'm supposed to tell you guys to, you know, we like a gentle tapping here at the News and Why It Matters. We like it rough sometimes too, but however you want to tap the like button, go ahead and tap the like button, subscribe to the show on YouTube and comment. And I want you to do all of those things. But here's the thing. Literally 30 minutes before we came on to film this program, I received three notifications in a row that I have gotten strikes on my YouTube channel for telling you guys the truth about biological males who are mentally ill and consider themselves to be females. In particular, one who went and shot up a bunch of children. So I actually don't know how much longer we're going to be here on YouTube. I would love to stay with you guys for as long as possible. But I'm just telling you, if you have the funds to do so, I would highly suggest investing in a Blaze TV subscription. You can save $10 when you sign up for a year using promo code news. And you can do that over at BlazeTV.com. This is genuinely like, you guys know this. Every day, I try to encourage you guys to watch on YouTube. And I joke about the freeloading thing. But I totally, it's like, I get it. It's a crazy economy. We're living in Joe Biden's economy, the Joe Biden era. I totally get it. The leftist social media censorship is very real and it's very scary. I'm actually shocked that this guy still has a YouTube channel at all. So I'm just saying, I'm trying to provide the truth for you guys. But the social media giants other than Elon Musk are not allowing me to get that message out to you. Now I have several episodes that you can literally never see on YouTube ever again. So just again, make sure that you can watch us anytime all of our episodes over at BlazeTV.com. So I want to get into this Hunter Biden story. So there is an IRS supervisory agent who is now a whistleblower who is claiming that the Biden administration is obstructing the investigation into Hunter Biden. This agent is now seeking whistleblower protections. There is a letter that his attorney sent to nine high ranking members of Congress that he is a career IRS criminal supervisory special agent who has been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high profile controversial subject since early 2020. It says that it is Hunter Biden who is the high profile subject and that the whistleblower disclosures would contradict sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee. While failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of the case and detail examples of preferential treatment and politics improperly infecting decisions and protocols that would normally be followed by career law enforcement professionals in similar circumstances if the subject were not politically connected. Now just as a refresher, he is currently, say he's under investigation. Apparently he's not very much under investigation for tax related crimes and for making a false statement on his ATF form when purchasing a firearm. Now the White House has responded, they've of course they're like, that's not true. Of course that's not happening. White House spokesman Ian Sams told Fox News earlier today, since he took office and consistent with his campaign promise that he would restore the independence of the Justice Department. You know the same Justice Department who is banging down the doors of pro life activists who dare go and pray outside of an abortion clinic. You know the same Justice Department who in an unprecedented manner raided the home of a former president over BS documents. That Justice Department totally independent, not weaponized at all. And when it comes to decision making and criminal investigations, President Biden has made clear that this matter would be handled independently by the Justice Department under the leadership of a US attorney appointed by former President Trump, free from any political interference by the White House. I am sure that that has happened. Well, everybody needs a Google Hunter Biden FBI cocaine rental car and Hunter Biden was actually caught abandoning a rental car that had cocaine and crack in it. And the FBI knew it and they knew that the chain of command that Hunter Biden was the last person to interact with this car. And they didn't do anything. They chose not to charge him. So the FBI if cocaine possession is a literal felony. So obviously we know he's committing tax fraud by the money that he's getting from his barismed dealings in the Ukraine working for energy companies that he has no experience for. So yeah, the idea that he's laundering money, welcome to obvious, Bill, but he's just look at Hunter Biden, he's always going to get a pass. It doesn't matter. I would think that even if he murdered somebody, if it was like vehicular drunken manslaughter or whatever, I think he would even get a pass on that because he's so powerfully connected. I agree, Kayden. Yeah, it'll stay that way. Nothing's going to happen. We don't have the Justice system on our side. Same thing with Matt Walsh suing. Hopefully he gets what he deserves back from the hack deal. But nothing is on our side. They brought Trump to trial. They raided his house. We're not going to win in this system. So I guess I don't know what we can really do. With the Clinton stuff, Trump said in the debates in 2016 he was like, yeah, if I was president, you'd be in prison, not in prison. When is all this going to really happen? It's just frustrating because we really are like this is a banana republic when you're talking about a two tiered justice system, a justice system in which if someone like me lied on my ATF form, if someone like me committed these crimes that Hunter Biden is being accused of, they'd put me through the ringer. You had grandma's waving their flags, their American flags inside the Capitol being led in by police who are being denied due process. So it's just very frustrating when you talk about the left who constantly, constantly wants to tell you, this is a threat to democracy. This is a threat to we love democracy. Democracy is the most important thing we can ever have. And while we're not a democracy, we're a constitutional republic, I just, it's just frustrating because it's like if you care so much about what you think is democracy, wouldn't you be a little concerned about this two tiered system that we seem to have where the elites are held to different standards than the average person? Weren't you guys supposed to be like the average person's party, the middle America party? And now it's just like, no, it's totally fine that the elites are running things and letting themselves out of the same crimes that they would throw you in jail for? Well, it's a cliche, but the federal government is obviously very dysfunctional and we say this all the time. If this is Donald Trump Jr, you would never hear the end of it. So of course the federal government is going to protect their own, but they're going to go after Donald J. Trump because there is some sort of deep state. So I hate to be the bearer of bad news and the tin foil hack conspiracy theorists of the day, but there is an evil cabal of deep state people that don't have America's best interest in mind. And that's why people like Hunter Biden always get passes. That's why people like Hillary Clinton get a passage by Bill Clinton gets a right on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein 26 times and nobody ever even bats an eye. The mainstream media doesn't even cover it. So we just have a corrupt system and you said the banana republic, sadly, I think it is, but I'm also not in the opinion that we need to totally demolish the federal government. So I don't know. I don't know what system works. It's very hard, but I think there's a cancer within it and it started off as a good thing, but it's been infected. Yeah. Democracy works until it doesn't. Democracy only works as long as you know, all the people participate. But if one person's like, okay, I'm taking power or, you know, this group of elitists, like you mentioned, then what? Like no, we're going to vote them out of their powerful situations. They can buy elections. Right. Yeah. And the government only gets wrong. Not that they've got to hold on. Hold on. Never had. Never had. Never happened. That's never happened. They might be able to. Legitally. They might be able to. But one another video going. Right. Right now. So let me just, let me just say 2020 and the midterms and all this, it was the safest and most secure election in the history. Not just of this country, but of the world. Facts. And you know, you look at the federal government. I think that we need to just keep on giving billions of dollars to the Ukraine and not help anybody here because that's, you know, in the best interest of the American people. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. When we come back, I want to talk about the vote that happened on the House floor today to save women's sports. First we want to thank our sponsor Pure Health.

For representatives, past legislation today to protect women's sports leagues by banning male athletes who identify as female from competing. And of course, no surprise, zero Democrats voted in favor of the bill. This is called the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023. And it would amend Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 such that recipients of federal financial assistance which operate sports leagues cannot permit a person who sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designed for women and girls. And I want to play for you. This is Congresswoman Virginia Fox from North Carolina who called out the Democrats for, I mean, you know, they're basically anti woman now watch. The chair recognizes a general woman from North Carolina, Ms. Fox. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of HR 734, the protection of women and girls in sports acts. The Democrats have gone to great lengths to call this bill extreme. The Democrats have gone to great lengths being almost hysterical to call this bill discriminatory. It's quite telling when the other party attempts to tear things down without offering an alternative vision. Democrats refuse to posit a reason for allowing biological men to compete in women's sports that comports with principles of athletic competition. A Nancy Pelosi, I don't know how she got led in, but drunk Nancy also took to the floor to share her opposition to the bill watch. I stand here today in opposition to the legislation that is on the floor and listening carefully to the maker of the motion. He references a religious context in his comments. And so will I then following his lead. Yes. We are all God's children. We all have a spark of divinity in us and therefore are worthy of respect. And that spark of divinity that is within us insist that we respect it in others as well. So recognizing that we are all God's children, I rise in opposition to this legislation because trans kids are all God's children belonging in sports, in schools, in books, in families and on teams. Literally no one is saying that trans kids can't play sports. We're just saying it is unfair to girls and women to allow biological males to compete with these females. It's like it's not hard. And first I think are they this stupid that they don't get it? But then it's like no, they're not stupid. They understand this. They're just weaponizing language against you so that if you say it's unfair to have a biological male competing against a bunch of women, they're going to say you don't respect trans people. It's like it does nothing to do with respect. I respect the person. What I'm saying is this is a very clear fact. It is unfair and it does not protect women. Yet disrespect sportsmanship. I mean disrespects. You see Riley Gaines, who spent her whole life in a pool having to lose to Leah Thomas so we know that they have an advantage. And it's kind of similar like when I think about this, you know, protect trans kids movement. I mean really and truly what rights do these kids on habit? My hero is a guy named Andy Kaufmann and he actually was, you know, at the forefront of creating an inter-gender league. That's what they need to do. They need to have their own trans league because all these young girls, I mean, we were talking about respect. You have no respect for a young woman if you're going to let a biological boy compete against him because he's on hormones. It doesn't make sense. Okay. Yeah. I don't look at it from the like regular sports perspective. If you take hormones or enhancers or anything like that in any major sport, you're going to get in trouble. You're not going to be allowed to play. So sure, maybe they're taking estrogen and it's, you know, lowering their testosterone. You're still taking drugs that you're not allowed to take when you play sports. But quite frankly, these tran knees, I don't know if I can say that without you. You know, we'll find out. But just accept you suck. Like you're not good enough to win in male sports. So you go over to women's sports. Just accept you suck. Well, right. Because I mean, if so, so let's follow their logic. They say trans women are women, right? Which is not true, but let's just follow it for a second. So if trans women are women, then trans men are men. However, I don't see a bunch of biological females asking to participate in male sports. Why is that? Yeah, because they don't have an advantage doing so. So they don't benefit. It's like that South Park episode where the guy, you know, is a bodybuilder just crushing all the women. We've really become an actual cartoon. I mean, there's no other way to describe it. It's like everything is coming true. They forecast it now where the men are being, you know, screwed and I. Did they forecast it or what did they think it was so preposterous that it would never happen? Well, now it has. Well, the world's gone so weird. I think that we've actually seen this for a long time. They call like predictive programming where we've seen where they want to feminize men and then masculine and eyes women. So it's like, we can't see it, but now it's just gotten to the point where, oh, you're 14, you're going to commit suicide. All right, here's a mastectomy. Oh, here, let's cut off your penis. So it's just really taking this weird thing where maybe we kind of saw it where we saw there's people transgendered and people wearing the dress. But now it's like this attack on children and it's that's where it's really gotten so disgusting. Well, and sadly, while I appreciate the house standing up for women and girls, it's not going to go anywhere because, you know, we know it's going to the Senate where the Senate will, I don't think that it's going to pass the Senate. But even if it did, the Biden administration has already released an announcement, a statement that he will veto the legislation if it does pass because as we know, he is very anti-woman in favor of mentally ill men. I want to get to John Federman speaking of Congress who we played him. His epic return to Congress where he got out of a car wearing baseball shorts and a giant hoodie and like weirdly walked in. So he returned to Capitol Hill. This was over two month hiatus as we know he was in getting inpatient treatment for depression. And he was back at work yesterday as a leader of a, so I cannot believe they made him a leader of a subcommittee. He is chairing a subcommittee to pass a farm bill. Let me just tell you, for those of you who are listening to audio podcasts and you can't see this, I want to make it very clear. He's reading off of cue cards and this is how bad he was reading off of cue cards, watch. I called to this hearing of the US Senate subcommittee and food and nutrition, specialty crafts, mechanics and research to order. To order. Chairwoman Sevenau. And ranking member Boosman. Thank you so much for coming. I thank you for your leadership on this committee and I look forward to working with you to pass a farm bill. The Eagles are better than the Eagles. This is, listen, people are going to call me mean for mocking him, but I don't know what else to do because they clearly are mocking the position by putting him in the position in the first place. Like they don't have any respect for the position by putting this giant headed, actually his head is small, isn't it? Too small for his body. Well his double head, the goiter behind him I think is pretty giant, but this vegetable in this position of power. Well if you watch it, I'm not a body language expert, but he looks scared to death. Like him just trying to read that, like sub committee, he didn't even, I mean he just to order. You're a student like now you have to read from the book and from the whole entire class and you know, Federman's probably like, oh yeah, I'm scared. And you can just kind of tell he was in front of the class and he's trying to read that. He's like, Congressman Boozeman, I mean he doesn't even know how to, he just, he has no charisma whatsoever. He has no brain. Yeah, I'm more concerned about the brain. I would take non charisma if you had a brain. But like even if you're the manager of a subway and you're like conducting a meeting, you'd have a little more personality like, oh, welcome to the sub committee. Oh hey, Miss Boozeman. Hey, I mean, he's like, hey Miss Boozeman, he doesn't even know her name. He's just reading off a cue card. I know. There's just no personal touch. It's very sterile. And it's almost like there's an earpiece and somebody's telling him, you know, working him from the inside. Yeah, which again is like, it's very sad that he had a stroke. I empathize with him for his medical condition. I also would recommend that they not put him in this position of power in the first place. That's a great reason to not run him and not vote for him. The American people sat down and watched him give speeches and were like, yeah, this is our guy. He was elected in by the American people. And the thing you say about, you know, the stroke, it's sad. I don't think people in the decision making part of our country should be, you know, in that bad physical state to where they would have a stroke. Like we need able bodied people, you know, if your body doesn't work, your mind can't work very well either. And clearly his isn't. I mean, I think that, well, first of all, I've said before, like I would be in favor of age limits for Congress. I just would. Sorry if that's ageist. I don't really care. But also I think that like, because I recall that they weren't releasing his full physical fitness and capabilities test, they just released like a very short note that said like, oh, yeah, he's fit to, you know, he's fit to serve. I think they all should provide some sort of documentation, lengthy documentation that you are fit to serve. Is that wrong? Yeah, I mean, I guess I would there be some litmus type test, I guess, or you know, I mean, I guess there should be some sort of like that you can function mentally. But I mean, John Federman, it's clear. It's just very clear that he's suffering from some sort of cognitive issue. You know what I'm talking about? Like it's just he's just not all there. The lights are on. What was your first clue, Alex? Well, I mean, it just obvious that it's like neurological. It's deeper than like, you know, like the stroke hits had permanent damage. So they're trying to say, oh, well, he's depressed. He's probably depressed because his body's not functioning, his brain's not working. So there's a deeper underlying issue that's causing him to be depressed. And I think it's very simple that his cognitive decline is at such a point now where he can't function. He can't lead a committee, much less be a congressman or senator or any sort of serious politician. It's a joke. He couldn't even manage, you know, 7-11, much less be a politician. And if his wife cared about him, she would not be putting him in this position to begin with. And it's a very important thing to do with John Feldermen. It's, you know, he's not an elder, I would say, but it certainly is abusive to do to him knowing that he is in the condition that he's in. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be right back. And we should have said that point. He looks miserable too. Yeah. Look at these marks. LinkedIn, of course, the job recruiting website that allows you to try to solicit either you're looking for a new job or you are an employer looking for a new employee. They have implemented features that appear to let recruiters filter potential job candidates by their demographic characteristics. And users can, they can edit the demographic information on the profile, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, because whenever I'm hiring someone, the biggest qualification I have is who do you like to sleep with? That always ends up turning out really well. And you can change it, update it to reflect what you would like. But LinkedIn updated their webpage explaining that the platform may use your personal demographic information in recruiting features to surface qualified members that may diversify the group of candidates displayed to recruiters who work for the companies with public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. They also said in an article last year that they created notifications when they've mailed to female ratio in a given job search is unbalanced. So the recruiters can improve the gender balance by amending skill, location, and company filters. And, of course, they can look, improve gender representation in your candidate pools with these diversity features. So they can make sure that if you're black, you get put to the top of the list. Congrats, Caden. It's the best day of my life. Congrats that if you identify as LGBTQI apostrophe 2S plus minus that you also can get put to the top of the heap. Unfortunately for you, Alex, you are an average white male. Hello average. Okay. I was trying to be nice. Okay, thanks. Well, you're just a regular old white male. Unfortunately, you're going to the bottom of the pile. Unhirable. We talk about social media platforms and they're basically all a dystopian hellscape, but none more dystopian than LinkedIn. And this may be a strong statement, but it's basically all you see, these headhunters on there, and they're looking for employees for their companies. And of course, they're going to give these people that, like I said, these headhunters, the ability to categorize people, but it's basically like a digital slave auction for employees. I mean, really, that's why they're trying to break it down by your sexuality or by your gender, because these companies have these ESG scores where they have to hire a certain amount of people of color, a certain amount of people of this sexuality. So I'm not surprised at all. And this just shows you that you're just a number, you're just a statistic. And a lot of people are going to get hired because of affirmative action. And because the world's not a meritocracy anymore, that's one of our biggest problems. I mean, it's just fascinating to me, Caden, because like we already have laws, rules on the books that say that an employer cannot discriminate and you can't be denied employment, right? So you don't have to already be an employee. You can be an employer seeking an employee and you cannot discriminate based on race, sex, all of these things. And now they're like, hey, want to see black people first? Click this categorization. Literally, it's going to be easy for me to get a job, I mean, an advantage. But no, the LGBTQIA crew, as we know, it's a mental illness, right, to be part of this crew. And then they organized a protest and said, no, we're normal. Acknowledge us. And then everyone's like, okay. And then now they're like, oh, also you have to hit this quota of LGBTQ people. What happens when the group of schizophrenics goes, hey, we're normal people too. And they protest and it's like, all right, now you have to have four schizophrenics in your office. And they just add all these different groups because a little protest and you're at the top of the group. I just think that you're absolutely right. It's also fascinating because I feel like we are watching the greatest example of DEI in the Biden administration right now. It's not going well. I'm like, it's right there. This is an example of what happens when you hire based on absolutely no qualifications to do the job you need to do. But they check intersectional boxes. You got Kareem Jean-Pierre, who is literally the worst ever. I thought poor man's peppermint patty was the worst, Jen Psaki. It turns out no. She hired the one person who was worse than her. You've got Sam Britten, who was just charged for taking people's luggage or I should say convicted, pled guilty to a lesser offense of stealing women's luggage because he likes to dress up in women's clothing. You've got Pete Buttigieg, who's too busy chest feeding to actually do his job. This is the epitome of the most incompetent people. And when you talk about taking that, extrapolating it and sending it into every American business, that's terrifying. Yeah, and you forgot to mention Admiral Levine. And then you're right. I did forget that. And then we go back to Sam Britten. Sam Britten right now, I believe, is going under a mental health evaluation to see if they even can, I guess he already got convicted, I guess to see what his punishment could be. So basically, they don't even know that if he's mentally capable to go to jail, yet you have him mentally capable to run the nuclear energy waste. I mean, give me a break. So this is the actual saddest part of it all is the DEI, the diversity. What is it? Exclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion. It's not even at a level that they're satisfied with. They wanted to get even worse. So it's about to get way more equitable in this beach. Last word, Caden. It's pretty gay. Oh, no. These two are trying to get gay. Gay's okay. It's okay. We love you. I never said gay was bad. I could be gay. It's pretty happy. It's pretty happy. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be right back. We got to take a break. I love to call them gay. I love to call them. Yesterday, we needed amnesty for millions of these illegal immigrants because, you know, who else is going to do things like clean your house? Who else is going to be your maid or pick your food? That's all they're good for, I guess. Watch. needs immigrants to survive. Immigrants pick the food we eat, rebuild our communities after climate disasters, help construct our infrastructure, power our small business economy, clean our homes, and look after the most precious in our families, our children and our elders. Okay, so they're only good for the manual labor construction workers, the grunt work, cleaning your home, so you're made, your nanny, or your nanny, or whatever you call them, and that's it, is what I'm hearing. But don't worry, they're not racist. We're the racist ones over here on the right. Yeah, and that's why they should jump the line for social services, you know, in front of vets. That's why we need to give them amnesty and help them out and give them as many vaccines as they want. And let's just, you know, not help these American citizens. I mean, honestly, the idea that they always say this, oh, well, these people are gonna clean your house, or house is not gonna get cleaned with them. They're talking about themselves. Yes. They're talking about themselves, they're not talking about the average person, average person doesn't have a housekeeper, the average person, you know, they probably, they might have a landscaper, but a lot of people don't even have a yard anymore. So it's like, they're not actually appealing to their, you know, their constituents. And they have no idea that it's racist, Caden. Yeah, I mean, what, but that's the thing. The, you know, demographic of these immigrants, if they were given amnesty, you know, one day they'll be able to vote, maybe, you know, they're still gonna vote for them, no matter what they say. Yeah. They could say the most offensive thing ever to them, but they're like, wait, no, but that's, it's gonna benefit me. Free stuff, right? Yeah, free stuff. And a free way in.
