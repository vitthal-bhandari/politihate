    "text": " MUSIC Hard hitting medical truth, cutting through conflict and confusion to the understanding you're searching for. Join Dr. Peter McCullough, world-renowned medical expert and practicing physician for this edition of the McCullough Report. Your life may depend on it. MUSIC Let's get real. Let's get loud at American Loud Talk Radio. This is a McCullough Report. And I'm Dr. Peter McCullough. It's a great pleasure to bring on the show my colleague, respected physician, Dr. Clinton Ashford, who's an obstetrician, gynecologist, very well known in the United States and has been, I think, a real leader advocating for civil liberties and giving commentary on the changes that we've seen in medicine, as well as in public life. And I want Dr. Ashford just to give us a few words about his background. Clinton, welcome to the McCullough Report. Well, thank you very much, Peter. And it is an extreme honor to be here with you today. And thanks to you for the champion you've been for civil liberties and for trying to bring some clear thinking to the medical profession. I graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in 1978 and then stayed in Augusta to do my residency in OBGYN, taking a special interest in hormone replacement therapy. I came, that married and my wife and I moved to Athens, Georgia, where I've been in practice since 1982. I did OBGYN, both specialties there till 2006. And since that time, my practice has focused exclusively on perimenopausal medicine, problem periods, the whole issue of the PMS problems, as well as hormone replacement therapy. So, that's sort of a little bit of my background, as I think you said a little earlier, and as you have made note in some of your own podcasts and other writings. Just over the relatively recent past last three years, five years, all of a sudden burst onto the scene, this concept of transgenderism, almost like an ideology. I really don't like the idea of a trans man or trans woman. I put that in quotes because I don't really think such a thing exists there. And I think it goes back to what we learned in medical school that in fact we learned it in high school and college, college biology, a sex is determined at the instant of conception. There are the uniting of an ovum and a spermatozoic, and at that instant, there are 23 chromosomes contributed to from the male and the female component. So, it's 46xx or 46xy, and it's either a boy or a girl and everything about that individual genetically is determined at the instant of conception. And then there's division of cells and the little embryo grows, of course, and then there's differentiation of tissues until probably about the age of 10. So, probably about a month later, a heart starts beating. So there are heart cells, other cells that are differentiated. It's almost unbelievable, a miracle. But every single cell continues to have the genetic material of the original cell. And the individual grows until birth birth. There's some three, three or four trillion cells, and an adult human has around 30 trillion cells with probably thousands of individual cell types. So, every single one of the cells is stamped with the identical genetic material that was there originally, and they're all either for women. 46xx or males, 46xy. So anyway, sex is determined at the time of birth and it stays there. So there's no such thing as trans anything. I think it's a good point. A lot of our listeners may not appreciate that, but every single cell in the body is either male or female, and that's determined at birth. So in a man, for instance, every single cell in the body of a man is actually a male cell. Not only is it a male cell, but the Y component of each cell in the body is determining characteristics of that cell and its receptivity to not just sex hormones, but other hormones as well. But for sure, the sex hormones, and that's what causes so-called sexual differentiation by males, develop differently at every stage than females, because as the cells grow and differentiate just in the womb and afterwards, there's each cell has signals that are coming from either estrogen or testosterone to grow and develop in a certain way. And so I guess the point is, as far as trying to change that, if you were to bathe human male, or I should say, 46xy cells in estrogen, it doesn't change the genetic makeup of the cells or the person. And it probably doesn't at the cellular level even completely change cellular function, because as you point out, XY cells have a different configuration of receptors, protein synthesis, certain orientation. So is it possible that a woman could be born in a man's body and vice versa? Is that even possible or is that something that, in a sense, is a construct created by others? Yeah, and this is one of the things that was, we've talked about a little bit, is this movie, Matt Walsh's movie, What Is A Woman? And he interviews one of the genius elements of Matt Walsh, is he just allows the transgendrists, different ones on his movie, just started to explain their view of it. And their view of it is whether you have biological sex, and then as far as you have your gender identity, and it's whatever you think you are at that moment, and nobody has a right to question it, which I think the genius of his movie is he lets people just say that. And I think most people think that's wrong. In fact, it's just a little bit weird. It's just like, if I think I'm a giraffe, you have to accept that, and that's what I am, or if I think I'm something else, and you need to conform to whatever delusion I may be having. I think that's an important point. A delusion is a fixed, firm, false belief. And so it's possible that indeed these have crept up, because it's not just transgenderism. Some people listening will realize that in this movement, some people believe they're cats, for instance, or they believe they're an animal. So there's almost like a ridiculousness of these delusions. But let me ask you, what is the role of puberty? So a young boy, a young girl, they approach puberty. How does puberty change the mind and the body? Well, I think I would start answering that by saying, I think nobody knows exactly. And this is part of the amazing thing about the miracle of life is just also so amazingly miraculous that we're here at all. And there's development from a single cell into a human being, and it's honestly, it's a miracle. There are changes, the very specific changes that take place in that puberty age group, 9 to 12. And then after it accelerates, the males develop in a certain way, and the females in another way. And it all has a purpose. And they ultimately gets to the point where there's marriage and reproduction, and there's a design to it. And it's an interesting question how the psychology of it all plays. We all have been through that age group. It's not the easiest. There's certain stresses in our lives, and we're looking at our friends and peers, and maybe it's a hard time. And one of the amazing things about this particular thing is that I think when I was growing up, and things I remember as a child, I don't remember any transgenders. Some different people had their different personalities, but I had thousands of friends over the years. So now what we're finding, just in the last few years, you hear that in some of these girls' schools, in fancy girls' schools in the northeast and maybe elsewhere, 30% of the girls are identifying as boys. What? Oh my Lord. This is unbelievable. Yeah, so all of a sudden, how can you explain this? So, you know, in one of your courageous discourse things, you mentioned the Salem Witch Trials. It's what I had been thinking. You know, in the Salem Witch Trials, you had this odd phenomenon where some 10, 11, and 12-year-old girls were getting creeped out by some elderly ladies who were a little bit cranky and in Salem, Massachusetts, and denouncing them as witches. And then some of the other girls joined in, and before you knew it, instead of the grown-ups telling them, hey, honey, get with it and you can't do this, they sort of reinforced it and took it seriously. And then human beings have their own pride, and so the girls kept sticking with the story. And here we are, back in 1691, 1692, they hung whatever it was, 20 or 21 witches. I mean, so-called witches. This is not Christianity, of course. It has nothing to do with the Bible. It was all this really mass hysteria. And I think this is a little bit of an element of what we're experiencing now. Yes, it has elements of mass hysteria or some type of distorted infectious groupthink. You know, I've learned from a psychiatrist, psychologist, that puberty is important because there always is some uncertainty as a pre-preneurability child approaches puberty, and there's a feeling of awkwardness and sometimes not fitting in or because the children develop at different rates. And when the human body goes through puberty, it's not just the physical change for the male genitalia and female genitalia in breast, but actually the mind changes. The mind changes. Mind changes. And so puberty is what creates a male mindset and creates a female mindset. So puberty has an essential role in individual human development. And in my view, violating that or trying to preempt puberty is fundamentally disturbing a normal process and it's going to lead to pathophology. It's going to lead to pathology and it's going to, by interrupting it and then reinforcing it and for sure trying to augment the pathology with inappropriate hormone therapy and the horror of sex mutilation surgery, you condemn the person to just a life of a dysfunction, a personal dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and on and on. It just is absolutely, you know, nightmarish, what's happening right now. I think honestly, of course, you hear a lot about this in the news now and some of the political aspects with various state legislatures taking the issue. I read yesterday or recently that 68% of Americans think it is inappropriate and wrong for shield for minors to be given puberty blockers and certainly surgery. And it's pretty amazing, honestly, given all the propaganda about this. So I think people intuitively realize there's something really wrong about this. And I think that goes for both Democrats as well as Republicans. And how about in the medical community, you're in the field of OB, Gen, you're senior. So I think it's probably you're probably more office based. Gonicology now, it sounds like you are. Do you know anyone in your circles who's taken up this practice of prescribing puberty blockers and doing gender change surgeries? Well, I don't know, but I can tell you, unfortunately, organized medicine, the AMA, the American College of OB-GYN, the American Academy of Pediatrics have all joined the mass hysteria about this. And for whatever reasons, I think it's their own peer pressure within their own groups have started advocating for this. So it's shameful for the medical profession to have done to be actively harming people in this way. But Clinton, it's one thing for indoctrination, infatuation, mass hysteria in the public. But it's another thing for mature physicians, they've all been through the same trainings, very standardized, to have the medical society, American Medical Association, American Pediatrics Association, American College of Obstactress and Gynecology, American Board of Internal Medicine, American Board of Family Medicine. How can they, in a rapid sweeping change, declare a new standard of practice, a new approach to basically promote gender change? How can that be? It's unbelievable. But it's happened before, the things that come to my mind, it became, it was very stylish back in the late 1700s to bleed blood out of people. So here's George Washington, he just finished up his presidency and he got a cold and he asked his doctor to come over and his doctor bled off two pints of blood and he didn't get better. So, I mean, here was the president of the United States, famous guy, named a famous city after him. So, he called up some of his senior colleagues, they came over. I mean, you can read about this, they came to Mount Vernon, he said, yeah, he's not getting any better. We need to drain off four more units of blood. Oh, no. So, and then George Washington, shortly after there succumbed for after having bled off six units of blood to make him better. So this was accepted medical practice. A few years later, of course, this was rejected, ultimately, and is bogus. A few years later, symbol wise, this is very interesting story in Vienna developed the germ theory and found that, yeah, the women that were exposed to germs developed childbirth fever, and the doctors who were delivering the babies were going down to the morgue and doing autopsies on the recently deceased women and coming back up to labor and delivery and delivering the babies and infecting the women. There's a consequence if the Vienna Hospital, maternity hospital, the mortality rate went up to 10%. Every 10th woman who came into the Vienna hospital died. So, symbol wise, had a hypothesis that maybe it had something to do with the necrotic particles that were being transferred from the unfortunate women in the morgue into the women who are in labor. So, he had, he started having the obstetricians in the residence there, wash their hands after doing the autopsies, wash their hands in a chlorinated solution. The instantaneously, the mortality rate dropped 10 fold. And so, symbol wise, spent the rest of his life trying to convince the really smart people in Berlin and Rome and London and Paris that the problem was infection and that there were germs. He was rebuffed. Here was this hick from Austria. I mean, what would he know? I mean, the problem had nothing to do with anything like that. It was humors and malleur and all these other things. So, it took 40 years until Pasteur came along in the 1880s and then Joseph Lister to say, yeah, well, actually, there are germs. And actually, there is infection. So, the medical profession has gotten way, way off track before. And then more recently in the 40s, there was the whole problem with, you know, people were acting a little out of sorts. And some of the neurosurgeons and neurologists felt like the problem was they could do some so-called, so-called psychosurgery. And they started removing parts of the brain and cutting parts of the brain. And this was very, very fashionable and evolved into the so-called frontal lobotomy, prefrontal, prefrontal lobotomies. I didn't realize this until recently, but the pioneer of this pioneer was a Portuguese guy who got the Nobel Prize for frontal lobotomy, developing the frontal lobotomy procedure in 1949. So, it took a few more years and became, you know, if we look back on this is just the most ridiculous, barbarous, unbelievable thing. But these were all smart people. Well, these are getting off track. No, but these are great examples of medicine, because people can, well, it asks the question, how could all the doctors do something? You just gave some examples of both right and wrong, where the mainstream medicine was in the wrong, and in the case of Washington, bloodletting was the wrong idea. And then certainly with frontal lobotomy that was just barbaric. It's interesting, on the platform, we have Dr. Peter Bragan, who's a very senior psychiatrist, and he was the one who in his sense brought the end to frontal lobotomy. He said it's barbaric, and he led the charge. I'll give you one other example. That it took about 40 years from the time it was suggested and actually known and proven, at least through epidemiological principles, that smoking caused lung cancer. It took 40 years of doctors smoking, advertising cigarettes, smoking in the hospital, smoking during surgery. It took 40 years of that before doctors finally came around and said, yeah, smoking causes lung cancer. That's how bad medicine can be and be on the wrong track. And it sounds like you and I agree that this current transgender medicine would be very similar to frontal lobotomy. It's an infectious group think. It's a barbaric approach. It led to disastrous outcomes, and we can see it unfolding right in front of us. Unfolding right in front of us. It's exactly the same thing. It's just around around the mulberry bush. And you know, this thing I've heard, you never really get out of high school. And, you know, where's the all these senior doctors are trying to be like the cool people, which I guess are the AMA and the these other senior doctors and they're all looking at each other in itself, reinforcing echo chamber. And that's what's happened in the past. And I think that's exactly what's happened. That's what's happening now within the medical profession, what has to happen. And it was happening in Salem, Massachusetts in 1691 1692. The cycle has to get broken. You after they, after they were they weren't burning witches in Salem, they were merely hanging them. And after the 20th or so hanging the sort of the church elders in Boston were the ones that came over and basically, you know, just put a stop to it and just told them they couldn't do it anymore. And it's just almost like breaking a spell, so to speak. And I feel like in some ways, that's what we're living through now. A lot of doctors, you know, a lot of doctors in the general population are don't feel qualified necessarily to speak on the subject. You know, if you're, if you're practicing internist and and you're not involved in this and you don't. It's just not part of what you're doing or you're a surgeon and you're doing appendectomies all the time. You just don't want to jump quick, your head out. Stick your head out and then have people criticize you and say, well, you're just, you know, backwards and you are just sort of a funny daddy. You need to get with the program. And I think people, you know, some of these, some of the large, you know, corporate medicine practices are doing this. And, you know, people have to do what their employers say. So there's just a lot of a lot of group think. And I think that we've been seeing this with COVID and the whole mismanagement of COVID, of course, and you've been a just out front on that. And it's wonderful, but it's, it's really kind of the same thing with this, isn't it? It is. But, you know, Glenn, we're going to take a break just for a second here for our sponsors. And we're going to pick up on the backside with some comments. I think probably some more constructive comments about your experience and and proper use of hormonal therapy in gynecology. But let's take a break now for our sponsors. You're listening to the Macullery report. Let's get real. Let's get loud at America. Loud Talk Radio. This is some color. I want to talk to you about an important trio of products I routinely recommend to my patients with long COVID syndrome. And that is the healthy cell trio of the immune super boost, focus and recall, and REM sleep supplement, all three of them. The immune super boost in the morning helps charge the body with essential vitamins and nutrients that help an individual fight off these frequent, recurrent infections of other viruses that people get during the morning. The focus and recall also taken in the morning helps address brain fog, this general difficulty in finding words, irritability. It works wonderfully to help clear up some of the neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of long COVID syndrome. And then lastly, at night, the healthy cell REM sleep supplement helps you go to sleep, stay asleep, get normal sleep architecture so the next day you wake up well rested and ready to go. So again, three products all work together very well in long COVID post COVID syndrome, the immune super boost, focus and recall, and REM sleep supplement.

This is a McCullough Report and I'm Dr. Peter McCullough. We're on the backside with Dr. Clinton Ashford. He's an obstetrician gynecologist who's now in the senior part of his career. So he's now office-based gynecology with a focus on basically menstrual abnormalities and all the difficulties women have with pre-menstrual, menstrual, post-menopausal symptoms. Dr. Ashford, we had a great conversation about the transgender craze and you and I are not going to be able to fix it immediately, but it sounds like we have a similar vein of thought like most Americans do and they find it to be something that's clearly gone wrong in medicine. But can you let our listeners know about the proper use of hormones or where they apply because we've heard about puberty blockers, hormones and post-pubit-er people for transgender reasons and some may be trying to paint a broad brush against the use of any hormonal therapy in adults? Yeah, so this really is what I do all day every day and I just preface that by saying, you know, going back to what we said originally, in women, there are an adult woman has roughly 20, I should say, 30 trillion cells and every single one of the cells has a chromosome complement of 46x and every one of them has estrogen receptors and estrogen has multiple purposes in terms of, as you said, recently, protein synthesis, various growth factors and other ways that it affects the cells that we just may not even know about. So around age 40, women start having some decline in the output from their ovaries and this decline from an output from the ovaries continues to their 60, maybe 65, maybe 70, and at some point in that time frame, they go through a threshold and most women will have some complaints frequently, the hot flash night sweat thing, but also they can have mood depressed, can't think, can't remember, can't come up with a word, an aim or number, can't sleep, go to sleep, can't go back to sleep, hair, skin, vaginal sexual fatigue, weight gain, honestly, there are about 25 different complaints that women may have with some declining output. So if a woman says, yeah, gee, I'm in this age group and about a few months ago or six months ago, I was at work on pleasant hot sensation, quickly subsided, woke up night sweaty, it's a pretty good bet. There's some declining output from the ovaries. And so if that person has the right supplement of the estradiol, those symptoms will go away. And if at the same time, she says, yeah, gee, this happened hot flash thing, but then right about the same time, my moods been a problem, some of the cognition and coming up with a name word or number, the fog brain, cloudy thinking, sleep, whatever. It's a pretty good bet if it all started about the same time, then it will all go away, not always in the sense that men have insomnia. But so you can't blame everything on decreased output from the ovaries, but a lot of it you can. So the exact mechanism of why restoring the proper hormone balance in these women is unknown, other than to say that it works in women who have the complaints. So, for example, here we are in 2023, the exact mechanism. In fact, anything about the mechanism of what causes hot flash night sweat is unknown. It's unknown. All you know is that you give the estradiol, it seems to correct it. And interestingly, there's the cognition thing, and I've frequently made note of the fact that women in this age group frequently will have this, they'll say, yeah, at this fog brain, I can't come up with a name or word or number. And it's interesting to me that you don't hear men say that. Fog brain, brain fog, English language, it means something, and it's a gender neutral word, but men don't seem to say this. And, or at least express it that way. So when women say, no, no, it's exactly right. I was fog brain. I have this can't retrieve a name or word or number. You give them the estradiol, all of a sudden clarity. So something is going on in the neurological system that the proper use of estradiol is helping in those women. So all of this circles back to this other thing we're talking about. Just because it's giving, it's having specific benefits to the women because of the XX chromosome. None of this applies to a man who is under the delusion that somehow he is a woman, or he's getting a certain sexual stimulation by a person. By addressing in women's clothing. So it's just it's a disconnect. And to simply say, well, gee, my delusion is I think I'm a woman and, you know, and therefore I should have ovarian hormones is, is, well, it's delusional. And for the medical profession to somehow endorse this and validate it is, is about like the all the doctors that jumped on board with the whole frontal lobotomy thing, which was, you know, thousands of doctors. It was considered acceptable treatment for, you know, people were having any number of psychological problems. You just do a frontal lobotomy and it became much more manageable. So anyway, that there is a proper use for hormone replacement therapy 100%. It is safe. It does not cause cancer given in the proper way in the proper dose. In fact, the opposite and women. Another thing that's been proven and demonstrated lately, women who are having the cognitive issues have less ultimately less dementia and live longer when they're when they're on proper doses of hormone replacement therapy. So there is a role for hormone replacement therapy. It's just not this role that is being promoted by these transgender ideologues. Right. And Clinton, I, I've always thought the huge benefit as a woman is, you know, a lot of my women in my practice are thin, they're petite, Caucasian, you know, high risk for osteopenia osteoporosis. If they receive estrogen supplementation, you know, early through this period, they eliminate this rapid phase of bone loss. 100%. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so otherwise, if this happens, then you really can't gain it back. And what we're learning now in elderly women is happening in my family. There's an absolute epidemic of senior citizen hip fractures and risk fractures all over America. Anybody listening to this, think about your elderly people in your, in your lives. And I guarantee hip fracture will come up in your, in your memory of, of people. It's happened in my family. It almost seems like a rite of passage. I think a lot of it is essentially just the allowance of this severe bone loss through men's disease, through the postmenopausal for a few years. Yeah. 100%. As well. The bone loss is tremendously slowed down as well as the cognitive decline. I mean, you name it in every single way. Well, you know, I mean, I think the medical profession, the OBGYN profession should be focused on this and not on trying to turn little boys into little girls in the other way around. But let me ask you something about something else that, you know, the other thing about menopause and when women approach it, you know, a lot of them, you know, have a sadness. I think it's going to, you know, bring the end of, of, you know, sexual activity or the, you know, the human enjoyment of intimacy. And what is the role of hormonal therapy in women, you know, enjoying to have a sex life after menopause? So two factors on that. And it falls back to the role of estrogen in the vaginal tissues. So the, as I mentioned earlier, estrogen serves as a so-called trophic hormone on certain tissues in the body. Probably the skin, probably other places, but for sure the vaginal tissues. So if one of the problems is with declining output, there's vaginal narrowing and thinning of the vaginal skin. And of course, you know, things hurt. So when you, when things hurt, you avoid them, right? I mean, if you're, if you're a shoes don't, if you have certain pair of shoes don't fit, they stay in the closet. So all of a sudden something's avoided, right? So what does it just pain or does also desire go down as well? So the estrogen, so yeah, so the estrogen component, the estradiol does not, seems to mainly focus on the actual anatomy. What the desire seems to correlate with is low dose testosterone. And, and I would say when women, and it goes from all age groups, even from the 30s on up, when women say, look, there's just the desires is down as well as other aspects, their arousal and so forth. As that goes down, and women are given a small amount of appropriate testosterone in one way or the other different ways of giving that, it will restore desire in about two thirds of women. So I think that may be new to a lot of our listeners. So testosterone, testosterone. So the women is really post menopausal or I guess sounds like through adulthood is a major kind of driver of the sexual desire. Yes, 100%. And testosterone also is one of the hormones that is put out by the ovaries. In fact, there's this people think, well testosterone men estrogen women, it's not exactly right. One is much more dominant in the women and one in the men. And the, the idea used to be that testosterone simply didn't have a role in women. It was a transitional form. I think that is out of date because in women who have this complaint and you give them the right. Those of testosterone, all of a sudden they say, wow, a back to normal. So the if you took women with the complaint of saying, yeah, like libido is in the sub basement, then you give them a test dose of the testosterone in the right way and the right dose usually is an injection. And within a few days, usually a week, if they say, wow, well, I should say, let me rephrase that about two thirds of them will say, wow, that was helpful back to normal, which is about a third of them will say, well, thanks, nice try. I didn't help in the two thirds that it helps. They will fall out into three categories. There's some will see him back a year later and say, well, yeah, we gave that shot. And they'll say, yeah, thanks. And got the old motor running and I haven't had enough of that ever since. Then there's another group that seemed to will give two or three shots over the course of four to six months. And they fall in back to the category. Yeah, it wasn't a problem after I took that. And then there's another group that seemed to benefit from it. It will last a period of time and then it will wear off and it's a slightly different story. And that's where the pellets come in. And so, you know, a lot of this, in fact, was developed in Augusta where I did my training. Dr. Robert Greenblatt pioneered all this in the 1930s. Very much forties. And so really the doctors generally, just because he pioneered this, he pioneered a lot of the basic science that went into birth control pills. So the doctors who trained in Augusta, a lot of times, were very aware of this and will use the pellet therapy therapies here. But in the pellets will have both the estrogen and the testosterone in them. Now, let me ask you in your practice, just in general, of women who are taking supplemental hormones, what proportion is it oral and what proportion is it by pellets and is it ever mixed. So the bioidentical human hormone, female hormone is estradiol. So you can give estradiol by mouth. The problem with that is that it is degraded in the stomach and further degraded in the liver. So what actually gets into your bloodstream is not the bioidentical version. So really, that's the reason that the actual bioidentical estradiol molecule is given you through a cream, lotion, a patch, or an injection. So for the pellet. And so, you know, different people will try different things and will appeal to them. One of the problems with all of this is that when you use the bioidentical molecule, it's not patentable. It's like you can't patent H2O, for example. I mean, tap water, right? So therefore, there's no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to promote it. And so, you know, so there are some products where they have the estradiol compounded into a lotion. Yes, they're proprietary. And then the patches, yes, some proprietary there. But in general, it's not promoted enough. I think the estradiol supplement for women who are symptomatic is extremely beneficial to them. And most women probably should be using it. Let me say the counterpoint to that is if someone says if an older lady says, yeah, but listen, I've never had these problems, I've never had none of these symptoms. She doesn't need the estradiol supplement, and that's been proven. They seem to do just well. But the ones who are having some complaints, yes, they tremendously benefit from the estradiol supplement. And as you said earlier, it does have this wonderful effect of alleviating and forestalling the a lot of the bone loss that some women get. So let me in the last few minutes, let's turn our attention to safety and let's address the need for a woman with an intact uterus. And she's, you know, postmenopausal or going through menopause. What are the issues there with hormone supplementation? Yeah, it's an interesting thing. So as far as safety, I'll come back to this intact uterus in just a second. There was this so called, this is another medical debacle that probably cost hundreds of thousands of women's lives. In the 90s, there was this so called woman's health initiative, which was a multi billion dollar study having to do with testing estrogen replacement with women. It was a poorly designed study and one of the arms of the study was giving high doses of Premarin without any. And the Premarin and a synthetic form of progesterone in very high doses and those women in that subset had a slightly high higher incidence of breast cancer. The women given the proper doses had in fact lower dose lower incidence of breast cancer. The study was discontinued. There were headlines throughout the country and I had your 2000 2001 women's health initiative. Study was discontinued because estrogen causes cancer. That particular headline got into the public mindset. Women all over the world discontinued. Home and replacement therapy and there have been a statistical study showing that the damage that was done from that discontinuing appropriate hormone replacement therapy caused untold damage early death in a lot of women. Having said that part of what is now totally accepted within the OBGYN field is the estrogen replacement therapy given early given in the right doses given in an appropriate way is safe women live longer and it does not cause cancer. In fact, very much the opposite. But in the modern treatment though, does a woman need to give progesterone to have uterine shedding? Yes, so I was going to get to this. A lot of this was started as I say back in the 1950s and the whole story about how Premarin got started. What was happening is women would feel better when they were given Premarin, which as you know is a different type of non-biode estrogen won't get into exactly how they make it. But it was effective in alleviating a lot of the symptoms women would have. And so they would give fairly high doses and there was this idea, you know, if a little is good, a lot is better. And when women would come back to the doctor and say, yeah, gee, you know, I'm having some irregular bleeding here, which was no surprise because it was stimulating the lining of the uterus. Then the treatment during the 1960s was to say, well, what we need to do is just give you more Premarin, double the dose, whatever it was. Well, I forget the name of the doctor, the OBGYN doctor in Chicago who sort of made an observation that a lot of these women who were getting these mega doses of Premarin started to be able to get the dose. And then started developing or had a higher incidence of uterine cancer. So this doctor lowered the recommended dose of the Premarin and then added the progesterone component with that adjustment, the rate of uterine cancer in women on the hormone replacement therapy reverted to significantly less than women on no hormone replacement at all. So I think, sorry for the long winded answer. But anyway, the answer is women who even today who have an intact uterus, if they are on hormone replacement therapy with estradiol, they also have to take at least some supplement with a progesterone component to balance out the estradiol. Do they have to have periods with that? Not necessarily. No, in fact, that's one of the main things that we do in our line of work is a lot of women are tired of having the periods in the first place and we will do the endometrial ablation procedure. When you do the endometrial ablation procedure, they're just not in our practice. They're not never going to have any periods one way or the other. Nevertheless, in women with an intact uterus, we will give some progesterone in women on hormone replacement therapy. Okay, but they may not have a period with it. It must be done a different way than in the olden days. Yeah, so, yeah, well, again, if women have an intact uterus with an intact lining of the uterus, which is the part that builds up in sheds and builds up in sheds, and you give them hormone replacement therapy, most of them are going to continue having periods. Most of them are not going to like that and say, yeah, but gee, here my friends are wondering what I'm doing here. So that's the reason a lot of times we'll do the endometrial ablation because it will stop the periods because there's nothing to believe. There's nothing to build up. This gets into another part of my particular practice is a lot of times these same women, when they have the build up of the lining and then it degrades, getting ready to shed, it releases a neuropeptide toxin into the blood, then that's what triggers a lot of the premenstrual things, meaning the bloating, headache, mood, fatigue, food cravings. And then I have a period, say, yeah, period, better, I feel better, my good week and the whole thing starts over again. This is not hormonal strictly speaking. This is coming from the degraded endometrium, releasing a neuropeptide into the bloodstream that is triggering those famous premenstrual symptoms. So a lot of those, you know, people talk about those premenstrual symptoms as being hormonal. They are hormonal in a sense. They're hormonal in the sense that they correlate with the hormone cycle, but they're not caused by the estradiol or the progesterone. They're caused by the degrading endometrium, releasing a neuropeptide. The way we would know that is that if you were to remove the uterus, but not the ovaries, the premenstrual symptoms go away. You haven't touched the ovaries. And similarly, if you do the endometrial ablation procedure, again, you don't touch anything. You don't touch anything about their hormones. They just don't have the premenstrual symptoms. Okay. Wow. This has been a fascinating discussion. Good. And we're going to have to leave it here. We're getting towards the very end of the interview, but this has been really absolutely educational eye opening. You've helped us, I think, understand, you know, that there is a careful, proper, modern day application of hormonal therapy for women. And it's very different than what's going on. And what we think is a distorted, hopefully it's just a fad in medicine. That's a distorted group thing. I want to thank you so much on behalf of America, out loud, and join us on the program. Peter, such a pleasure. And thanks very much to you and all you do for us. Let's get real. Let's get loud on America Loud Talk Radio. This is a color put."
