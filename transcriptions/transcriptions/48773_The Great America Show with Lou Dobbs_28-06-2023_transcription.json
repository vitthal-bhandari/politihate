    "text": " Hello, everybody. I'm Lou Dobbs and welcome to The Great America Show. Great to have you with us today. The DC swap is buzzing over new developments in the Biden crime family scandal. President Biden and son Hunter have managed, of course, to escape consequences for any part of their corrupt lives and may do so yet once again. Not only did Hunter Biden get a sweetheart deal in his tax fraud case, a judge yesterday in Arkansas delivered Hunter yet another sweetheart deal. The judge handling Hunter Biden's child support case made two newsworthy rulings. First, he cut Hunter's child support payments by 75 percent. And then the judge ruled that Hunter's daughter will not be allowed to use the Biden name. And Joe Biden has never recognized Hunter's daughter as his grandchild, despite paternity tests that prove that she is Hunter's last name, no matter how solid, obviously impressing law enforcement and prosecutors and judges. And now after a year's long investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the Department of Justice has released their findings in a report on the cause of his death. The Department of Justice concluded that Epstein's death was suicide. The DOJ blames the guards for not checking his cell and leaving excess blankets in the cell. In the 128 page long report, there is no persuasive accounting for why the CCTV cameras on Epstein's cell didn't work, why they removed a cellmate the night before his death, or why guards weren't watching a prisoner on suicide watch, both of whom were apparently sleeping. Remember, then Attorney General Bill Barr promised the Department of Justice would get to the bottom of what happened and that there would be accountability. You be the judge. Our guest today is insisting on government accountability. He Senator Tommy Tuberville. He has for the past five months been blocking military promotions for admirals and generals as he protests the Pentagon's woke policies and abortion policy. Senator Tuberville sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture. Senator, it's great to have you with us here on the Great America Show again. And I just like to begin with your update as to where you stand on those promotion holds in the negotiations. Well, we're within a week or so of five months of the holds on the promotion of all admirals and generals and just for everybody listening. It's a little bit about the abortion policy. Now we had an abortion policy in the military for years and years, but they decided to change it after row wait. Joe Biden and the Secretary of Defense wants to put as many people on notice it. How you can do an abortion at any time if you're a federal employee. So they just started with the VA and now they're with the military. And really, my focus is more on legislating from the Pentagon and the White House and creating new law and studying allowing the people of Congress to do that. And so I've told them, I'm not going to change this back. They are going to they got an uphill battle with me because the next thing will happen is they'll come out and say, okay, if we got a new law that's come from the White House that you're going to go to church one time a month. I mean, we cannot allow these dictators over there to run our country by the by an iron fist. We can't do it. So you said negotiations, blue, it's almost five months. They keep telling me, oh, you're hurting already, missing the morale and we need to get on with this. I've talked to the Secretary of Defense 10 minutes and one call about three and a half months ago. I've not heard one word from the White House zero. Senator Schumer on the floor, all he does is berate me every day that I'm not a true American and and I'm holding up progress in the military. So conversation is Neil none. They don't want to negotiate because they know they're wrong number one, but they're not going to give in because they know if we beat them on this, that there's a possible way that we can continue to slow them down for the next year before they before they completely run our country in the ground. Well, I want to just say to you personally, thank you for what you're doing and think about this, Senator, whenever you may get further frustrated by all that's happening in that swamp in DC, the country deeply appreciates you and your values and representing the American people. It's just extraordinary what this government, whether it's the Department of Justice or whether it's a Pentagon, the FBI, the intelligence agencies, we have a government that is totally out of control. Another way to say that is the Marxist Dems are in total control of our government, your thoughts. Well, you're exactly right. And you know, I was a football coach, I was an education for 40 years and I did this for service. I want to get back to the greatest country on the face of the earth and I wanted to go help the people of Alabama work to help our military become stronger and that's really hurts me to do this for our military because my dad was career military, I actually died on active duty and and of course, I want to do things for people in this country to make their lives better. But I'm going to tell you, since I've been there for two and a half years, it is over my eyes to what is really going on in this country. As you said, we have we have let our FBI become infiltrated with, I don't know who knows what same thing with the CIA, the same thing with the DOJ, which is absolutely the most corrupt thing and everybody wants to impeach by it and all this. The first guy needs goes Mayor Garland and the Mayorkas, those two need to go because they have created such havoc for our country, but they've also destroyed our education, but they've been doing that for years. Now they're working on our military and it's the most woke military in our history and continue to be that every day. And that's their aim. They want to bring down those institutions. And when they finish up with our education and our military, they will have all five or most important institutions in this country, absolutely bottomed out in terms of being true Americanism and making us more of a socialist country. Senator, I just want to continue with the holds that you've got on those promotions for the for the general officers. And what do they say to you? Do they have any kind of sincere and straightforward account of themselves? And haven't they? I just can't even to me, I'm absolutely ambusiled by the fact that they don't understand that you're a serious man during the people's work. And the office of US Senator is Trump's right now. They're all in their brass and stars. Well, and to the people who understand this, you know, again, I really feel bad for some of these people, some of these generals and animals, some of them I don't because I know there's a portion of them that's going to be woke. And I'm sick of that. But that being said, you would think that there would be some kind of conversation. I guess I think we've hit the 10th time that we've had to go to the floor in the Senate and fight off all the radical talk from Elizabeth Warren's and the Blumenthal's and the Bennett's, you know, coming and attacking me saying that I'm holding back readiness and, you know, people need to get on with their lives when you get families moved. You know, wait a minute now. I mean, the military, this military is supposed to be the protector, not just of our country, but of the world. We protect NATO. And but what they're doing to it is totally opposite to the direction this military needs to be going. It's going in the same direction. As I said earlier, as the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, it's out of control. And every time I talk with Secretary Austin and Milly and open hearing, and you can go back and listen, my question, I tell them and listen, you know, this is not an equal opportunity employer. The military, I mean, the military is there, protect the citizens of this country and our allies. And we're going the opposite way with all the transition transgender people that want to be in the military. And somebody asked me, you know, what do you think about President Trump? You know, he discriminated. That's the way to me. I mean, you don't discriminate being in the military because you flat feet, you can't get in the military. So what makes you think that we can take people in there that can't uphold the rule of being a military person in terms of discipline and order and fighting? I mean, that's who we need in our military. We don't need an identity politics military. We're talking with Senator Tommy Tiberville. And he is taking it to the the woke crowd in the swamp. And in particular, as we're talking today, the US military and the holding up promotions for the general officers until he gets an accounting from their respect for the American people and their representatives. We're coming right back with the great America show. Stay with us. We're back now with Senator Tiberville. Senator, I want to again just thank you for being here with us on the great America show. Thank you for what you're doing. Let us give us a sense of the support you have from the leadership in the Senate as well as your your colleagues in the conference. Well, we've got some, you know, Senator Mike Lee has stood out with me most of the time that I've been challenged on the floor about this the holes. We've had JD Vance. We've had Senator Marshall. We've had Joni Ernst. We've had several that have really stuck by. There's not a lot, you know, that have been vocal and that's our prerogative. You know, and people asked me about Senator McConnell. He came out that pretty much and said he didn't agree with my my assessment of how I was doing things. But like I tell him, I said, let's this prerogative ever center put a hold on anything. That's the only power you have when you're in the minority. And so as a party, as Republicans, we need to figure out are we're the pro-life or we're not. And at the end of the day, you can't write the fence on this and people say, well, you know, it's hardest in the election. Listen, this is this prerogative anybody to say what you want to say and to believe what you want to believe. I'm I'm pro-life. I believe in the sanctity of life. And I don't believe in in abortion, you know, in this country. And again, this is really not about abortion when it comes to this loop about, you know, because we've had an abortion policy. We've had several dozen abortions a year in the military for rape, incest, and health of the mom. But now they want to do it at any time. They also want to be able to pay for flights for the service member to go to any state that they want to go to. And then of course, the HIDE Amendment says money used for an abortion is illegal in the United States. And you know who voted for that? Joe Biden himself. So they have a short memory, but we have got to stand by our principles in this country, especially in the Republican party, because we know where the Democrats stand. And and these that continue to be a fight, we need to fight for the unborn. I mean, this is a crazy thing. These these people have signed up for the U.S. military and had this woke doctrine just slam down their throats. And that's why I understand we're losing just scores of experienced, talented, terrific service members every day. Well, I'm going to be used as an excuse for the the woke policies in the military, because their point that may now that I'm hurting readiness, I'm hurting recruiting in the military on all levels, which is totally false. It's all their woke policies that they're pushing and training and and recruitment and the less discipline that we have that we've normally had. And it's bending and we're backwards for all these identity politics groups. And so our our recruiting is down. It was down last year, 15,000 Lou and army. Now this year, it's probably going to be that or worse. We will not meet our goals in the Air Force or Navy. And the Marines seem to be doing well, because they stick with what they believe in the, you know, the discipline, the hard-nosed factor of of being a Marine. And so all those are working out. But at the end of the day, they're going to blame me for their their weakness in recruiting, and which is fine. I'll take the blame for it. I've done that before all my life being a coach. But that being said, they know really deep down what's causing this and and and something good is going to come out of all this. I surely hope that the military comes to a sense is but watching Lloyd Austin and General Mille, you mentioned, these are not very smart people in very important jobs, a little long, having the character that you would expect of a secretary of defense or a general officer. It's just very disappointing to me. I want to turn to a couple of other things if I may, which is obviously what has happened in Russia. Vladimir Putin says that things are not going to be all bunnies and rainbows for regardsion, the leader of the Wagner group who is decided he wanted to go to Belarus instead of try to get inside the Kremlin walls. Your thoughts on what is transpired there and what it means to the to the to the country. Yeah, that looked like a total mess at the beginning. I don't know whether we're involved in that or not. You never know, you know, with the people in our intelligence agency loop, but Ukraine is obviously not doing very well. You know, I'm a supporter of Ukraine, but I'm not presenting any more money. I didn't have voted for any money to go to Ukraine. I just I just don't think it's our fight. I think we caused a lot of it by telling Russia that we're going to try to get Ukraine in a NATO, which they don't need to be in NATO. They need to be a neutral country. And you know, there's a I think we've made a lot of mistakes in this. We've got a lot of people killed probably in Ukrainians and Russians that should have the problem I have with all this is we don't negotiate at all. And we should be negotiating every day in Joe Biden not talking to Vladimir Putin since the war started to me. That's a war crime itself. I mean, that's your job as a leader to stop this absolute madness. Now, for go, she is a you know, he's a he's a thug. And you know, I think he got more mad at the minister defense in Russia because he got bombed while they were in Bocamoot. And there were some bombs that came over their heads or maybe he had in his troops and he blamed on minister defense. But now you got problems. You know, Russia's going to have problems. Putin's trying to juggle a lot of a lot of eggs at one time trying to keep everybody happy knowing that, you know, he started this thing should never done it. But you can also blame your United States for not going in and trying to go shade and get us out getting Ukraine out of this mess rush out of it and get the world back to peace. It just seems like that there's nothing there's not been one positive step in the last year of this war. And hopefully we can get this thing over soon because you know, there's more and more people Lou getting killed every day. And we're not there. We don't see it. We're not living it. But you can imagine what the people Ukraine and the Russian people are going through as we speak. Absolutely. And our hearts go out to everyone who is who's just been devastated by this. Needless, needless invasion and war of attrition that's followed over the course of the past almost year and a half. We're talking with Senator Tommy Tuberville. We're going to be talking about what is China doing in this hemisphere. And what are the prospects of another Cuba missile crisis? We're coming right back with Senator Tuberville. Stay with us. And now we're back with Senator Tommy Tuberville and Senator, let's talk about if we may. This report that the Biden administration will do nothing about the another spy balloon over the United States. Yeah, it's this is a tough touchy situation. We're we're in a cold war with China. We know that they're our biggest adversary. They've got a growing military. I don't know how we stand up to them. Nobody would know unless we we we start fighting them and we surely don't want that to happen. But both countries need each other. I don't I don't I don't hear all this talk backing forward about we got through this to them and them to us, you know, about trade and the economy. You know, you got to remember, she pinging wakes up every day knowing that he's got to feed 1.4 billion people. Now, we only got 330 million people. And we struggle with that. Can you imagine? So he's got more problems than than what you would think. But he's putting a lot of money in his defense. He has gone to Cuba. Evidently, I haven't I haven't read anything recently on that. But obviously, if you look at one thing, if you look at the what we did, and just a few months back, we put a base or two bases basically in the Philippines. And I would imagine that got to the underneath the scan of ZG ping. And he saw us do that. And we put Marines. We're putting all kind of battalions in the Philippines. I would imagine that triggered his thoughts of how if they're going to do that, where's the next place we can go? And here we come to Cuba. Now, I would imagine there's some something to that. But we got to stop this madness knowing that we don't need to do anything in terms of creating a war with China. And they don't need to do it with us. We need each other, to be honest with you. And we need to work with each other. But I just it goes back to what Ukraine, we have no leadership in the White House. We have no leadership in the Pentagon. And we got problems with Ukraine and Russia. Nobody's trying to stop it. And we should be trying to stop it every day. And it's the same thing. We send Blinken over their sector state to China. And they pretty much laugh at him. Every time it goes over there, what kind of dignitaries this guy, what kind of negotiating skills this Tony Blinken got? You know, Joe Biden needs to do it himself. I guarantee you one thing, Donald Trump could have been over there already. He'd have been in Russia trying to put a stop to this. He would have been already back to China, back to North Korea. I understand that that's what he's got to do. That's his job. I don't understand what Joe Biden thinks his job is. His job is to stop this damn war in Ukraine. And his job is to settle all this commotion down with China and to escalate it. But it seemed like he wants war. He wants to keep everything going stirred up because he's got obviously problems himself. But just because he's got problems, he doesn't need to put the America in peril. Yeah, America has been in peril, I believe, senators from the moment that he walked into the White House. We know he's an impaired and puppet president. We have no idea we can suspect who in the world is guiding this country to the degree that it is being guided. In terms of foreign policy, but right now this is a this is a perilous perilous time, don't you think? Oh, there's no doubt about it. We're the ship without a rudder loop. And you know, the American people have no confidence in this foreign policy of anybody in Washington, D.C. It is just it's kind of a makeshift. What do we do now? There's not been one move starting with Afghanistan that anybody believes in every ever foreign country I travel to. They look at us going, what in the world happened in Afghanistan? You know, we just left we we talk a lot of our allies into going into helping us people and talk about this a lot. Luke in the Afghanistan of helping us. You know, we didn't even let them know we were leaving. We just packed up and left. Wait a minute. We're y'all going. Oh, we're out of here. And you know, you don't run foreign policy like we need our friends. We need our neighbors. We need our allies. But you know, these people do things on a whim instead of calculated understanding what the consequences are if you make a decision one way, if you make it the other. And but it just goes back to one thing. There's no leadership in this administration. And my gosh, if we don't get them out of there, it I just worry about what could happen in the future. Well, Senator, we always give our guests the very last word. And I'm going to ask for your concluding thoughts. Now it's been great talking with you and appreciate all that you're doing to to repeat myself. Thanks for all you're doing for the country. Well, thank you. And we got a tough row ahead of us. And we got a big election come up here in half. But you're in half a long time, Louie, Louie, and we we have got to find somebody that's got some common sense in the Defense Department and our CIA, the DOJ. I hope we don't get into a fight about impeachment with President Biden. But I am willing to hopefully they go after a Mayorkas who has opened the borders and killed many, many thousands of people here in this country with all the drugs he's led in. And then obviously, Merrick Garland, who's mad at the world because he's not a Supreme Court justice. And he just taken up the whim of attacking everything that America's about because he's mad at the country for not being in the Supreme Court. So hopefully we can get it straight. But people need to get on their knees, pray at night when they get up and pray at night before they go a bit for our country because our country is in trouble. Amen, Senator, appreciate your thoughts. And we will join you in that prayer. This country is in, as you say, very, very deep trouble. Senator Tuberville, we appreciate everything you're doing for this country, this great country of ours. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks for being with us, everybody. Our guest here tomorrow will be Conservative Republican Congressman Matt Rosendale. He represents Montana's second district, and he's a great American. Be sure to follow me on Truth Social and Twitter at ludobs. That's at ludobs. And our website is ludobs.com. Thanks. God bless you and God bless America."
