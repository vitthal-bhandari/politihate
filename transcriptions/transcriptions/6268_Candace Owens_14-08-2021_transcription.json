    "text": " Welcome back. I am so excited to introduce you guys to my next guest. A few years ago, I met a man named Walt Heyer and we had a conversation that really transformed my perspective, probably the most eye-opening discussion I have ever had in my life, to be honest with you. After living his life as a woman for eight years, he realized he made a terrible mistake. Here is his journey. So you lived your life as a trans woman. How many years? For eight years. Eight years. That's a very long time. And how old were you when you began to transition? I was in my early 40s, in the room 42, and then I began to detransition at 50. Well, in the household that I was in, my mom and dad encouraged our natural genders, but it was my grandma when she was babysitting me that somehow we got involved in this whole thing because she was made dresses and I became curious about this idea of her making dresses. So she made me a purple chiffon dress and then she began to firm how cute I looked. How old were you? I was four. Four years old. And so this affirmation process, which as a four year old, you don't know, I mean, it's grandma, so it's got to be okay. And so when you have an adult encouraging you and nurturing you along in this way, you don't realize that this curiosity that you have as a child is also a quiet curiosity because you're really trusting the adult to guide you, to nurture you and give you good information. I didn't realize what grandma was doing was going to be very destructive later on. It's child abuse. Once my uncle realized that I had been wearing a purple dress, then I became his opportunity to be sexually molested. He started sexually molesting me because of the purple dress. My parents loved to go camping and fishing, so they would drop me off at grandma's house and they would go away for the weekend quite frequently. So this began to develop over time. So I was two years into this cross dressing thing before my parents found out. I became so interested in being affirmed in that purple dress. I mean, I wanted to be a firm. And what young child doesn't want that affirmation to say, why you look great, you're this, you're that, and there's that thirst, you almost become addicted to the affirmation. Then what I realized was that I couldn't talk to adults about what was going on. This thing with the purple dress, and that blew up the family between my mom and her mom, and then talking about what Uncle Fred did. Then I began to internalize all my feelings. I just brought them in, and then I began to be kind of a jokester, a funny guy, use a sense of humor to try to deal with what was hurting me inside, because I didn't know exactly who I was. I divorced my wife in April of 1983. I underwent gender reassignment surgery at Trinidad, Colorado, and became Laura Jensen. Ladies and gentlemen, please help me give a warm welcome to Waltire. Kormos, thank you for coming back and having this discussion with me this time in front of a live studio audience. Remains to this day one of the greatest conversations that I've ever had, and it shocked me in a lot of ways our conversation. It shocked me because I already had that suspicion that there was a lot of lies and people were covering up, and we were intentionally not being told a full story. We have the media, the academia, and now even the scientific community that is in partnership to really focus on children right now, and talk about gender identity as if it's just such an easy thing that they can wake up and pick and make a decision. What is it like for you as somebody who lived this, right, and knows how harmful and knows what you went through to see this, what's become of today? Yeah, it's really painful to watch because the destruction that happens, when you start to tell a child, he can change genders. You plant the seed like they did in me, and all of a sudden the person begins to think there's something wrong with me. That's the first thing that happens. When you introduce a child to changing his gender, what you're really telling him, aren't you, is that there's something wrong with you the way you are. That's child abuse, and no one should be telling a child that you're better off this way or that way. God made you perfect just the way you are, and so I think this is the pain that I see. I have the opportunity to work with children through their parents quite frequently, and even recently I've worked with four mothers and their children with girls between the age of 13 and 15, and just working with the parents who are very interested in really delivering the right message to their children, four of them detransition just through communications, realizing that they didn't need to do this, and they realize how harmful this was going to be over the long run. So I think when parents realize how destructive it is, maybe we can step back and stop pushing this ideology on children that's going to affect them. I'm 80 years old, and I'm talking about it 77 years later, so you can see that it has a long term effect. People need to understand that. It's not benign. And I think one thing that I really want to bring to my audiences is how easy it was for you. You go to the doctor and you say, I'm confused. What was the story? I mean, was it like, wait, wait, let's check in on you, let's get into a psychiatrist, let's talk about this more. What was the process? Was it very easier or difficult? Yeah, the process is very easy. You walk in, you talk to the therapist. The therapist I had happened to be the guy, Dr. Paul Walker, that drafted the original Harry Benjamin International Standards of Care that they actually used today. It's called WPath. And he interviewed me one week. I went back the second week. He handed me a letter for gender reassignment surgery. I can have the surgery. I got the letter to get the hormones. Today is no different. They can walk into a gender clinic, actually get the hormones the moment they walk in. So it was really no different than it is now. So the harm done, and you're right, we need to sit down like I do when the people contact me, I began to work with them and say, why don't you like who you are? Because that's really the message. And so when we begin to discuss why do you want to destroy who you are, why don't you like who you are, what happened that caused you to not like who you are? That's an important question. And when we begin to dive into this, we find out that they were sexually abused, they're emotionally abused, they were passed around from foster care to foster care. Something happened in 100% of the people that I've worked with, and I've worked with hundreds of people. Something happened that caused them to not like who they are, and caused them to want to identify as somebody they really aren't and really can't become. And it's so interesting because it reminds me of, I used to watch that show my 500 pound life. Oh, right. And when I watched that show, they would go back and say, when did you start eating like this, right? Because they people have accepted that being 500 pound isn't good and they're going to die, right? And they do the right thing by addressing their history. And more times than not, the person suffered a very real childhood trauma. Usually it is a sexual abuse. And it makes them want to get rid of their identity. So they say, well, you know what, I was molested. And if I gain 500 pounds, men won't look at me anymore. And I can get rid of my identity. And yet we have something that, in my opinion, is more severe, right? To prompt a child who's then an adult to mutilate their body. It's a more severe action. And we don't have that same process put into place. In fact, if you even talk about having that process put into place, you can be censored. You can be called a bigot. You can be saying you're trying to stop the LBGTQ agenda, whatever it is. Why do you think that is? Well, you know, because they gain a lot of power from having this ideology planted in children. They control our families. They control the children. They control the entire process of this. And that's why I enjoy working with parents, because parents have the opportunity to stop them in their tracks. They're not going to stop them at the gender clinic. They're not going to stop them on television. But you can stop them in your home by delivering a message of why is it you don't like who you are? What has caused this? Was it the internet? Many of the children now are on the internet and they're getting all caught up in this and they get in these different chat rooms and their transgender chat rooms or their gaming. And so if we can identify where they're connecting to this idea and begin to break that idea down, realize that they are not transgender. You know, the fact that fact, the word is actually a phony word. Nobody really is transgender because that suggests that somebody actually changed genders. And this is a good point to make. No one yet has ever changed their gender biologically or scientifically or medically or any other way. It's all a facade. They can change their persona, which is an accurate term, but they can't change their gender. They can make themselves look different. They can appear different. They can act different, but their biological internal self remains the same. We will get right back to the show in just one second. But first, I know a lot of women can relate, but I do not know anything about cars. I simply want mine to work. So thank goodness for rockauto.com.

Now let's get back to the show. I know that you actually sat down with Serena Datiari who I had this Twitter back and forth with and at one point I actually said to Serena, do you actually believe that you are a woman? Do you actually believe that because you got a cosmetic procedure that makes you a woman? And I asked that question. I said from the bottom of my heart, I'm not even, I'm not trying to hurt you. I want to know that because it's such a deep insult for me as a woman to hear that you think it's just like my entire existence is just meaning you could just create it. A plastic surgeon is what verifies whether or not an individual is a woman or whether an individual is a man and that's diminishes women in a very big way. So I would like to know what was your moment? You know, you went through with a procedure, you were living as a woman. What was your moment when you went actually? No, this isn't real what I'm doing. What changed your mind? Yeah, I was actually down in near Santa Cruz and I was working for a carpet company as Laura selling carpet. And I remember leaving this place and I went, you know, this is insane. I am nuts. I've got stopped this insanity. And it just came over me. I mean, here I was, you know, I was selling carpet to commercial places and homes as Laura. And this is absolutely insane. I am not a woman. This is fake. Nobody changes genders. You can make yourself look like a female. You can make people think you're a female, but you are not a female. And that moment for me was the clarity I needed to get my sanity back because it's insane, really, to say that you're something you're not. And that's what goes back to being sexually abused and realize, you know, being sexually abused and emotionally abused caused me to not like who I was. And I think what I found out and working with people, this is kind of a serious comment to make. But many guys who are sexually abused by adult men like I was want to rid themselves of their genitalia, not to become a female, but so they will never be sexually abused again. It's a protection against being sexually abused. If you get rid of the thing that was, they were hurting you with, touching you, then they won't touch you anymore. So it becomes a way to protect yourself from sexual abuse. And I've talked to females who identify as males, and they have told me that they want to put on a phalloplasty and identify as a man so that they won't be sexually abused again, that they'll be so repugnant to the people who previously abused them that they won't do it. So I think there's a lot of this going on where this becomes a way to protect yourself against sexual abuse. And that doesn't cover everybody because there's many other issues. But those make up a great number of people. It so actually reminds me of you saying that is I have a friend who is gay, and he says to me, I was a starched here and say this. And again, this would not cover every gay or lesbian individual, but he says to me, for me, I was not born gay. I have daddy issues that were never addressed. That his father walked out, their emotional issues. And I also know a woman who was a lesbian. And again, not this isn't, I'm not meaning to paint a broad brush here, a broad paint stroke, I mean, but she was molested by a man. And now is a lesbian, she doesn't trust men. So it sort of becomes this way to just say, you know what, this is I'm more comfortable living with women. And even having that honest discussion, I remember speaking to this gay individual and saying, he could never say that publicly. Even though it's his truth, he believes it to be true, because there is this acceptance in society. It's almost like you get a trophy for saying you're a lesbian or gay or trans, and it's just everybody is just born this way. And if you don't accept it, you're a bigot. And actually, there are tons of people who are being silenced even within the LGBT community. Absolutely. Because they don't fit the mold of what society wants you to believe. Yeah, that's absolutely right. And what's so interesting is I, when people contact me about having regret, which I just had a young man contact, he's 26 years old, he had the surgery in March of this year, and he already regrets it. And he said, you know, I had bipolar disorder, I had schizophrenia, I was sexually abused, I had all these disorders, and yet they still approved me for the surgery. And he says, I'm miserable and I want my body parts back. Well, of course, it's not really possible. So we're destroying lives with this idea that people can change genders, and yet no one can change biologically, change who they are. This is such an interesting point of time where people come up and say, I really don't know who I am, so I'm going to try to become somebody else. And isn't it insane? It is totally insane. And I want to go back to your point about how it destroys families. And because when I see this, and it's a discussion I have often with my husband, is that a lot of times what the left, because it really is the left that's pushing this, what they're pushing, it promotes, it's a promotion of death, right? It's a motion of a certain kind of death, because when these people go to an extreme, and they go through gender reassignment surgery, like you said, you can't really go back, right? And that means that you're never going to have your own offspring, you're never going to have your own children, you know, you can adopt children, and you see them pushing this, and they want more and more and more kids to follow this without giving thought to their futures, right, in a productive way without actually giving thought to you, to make a decision so radical and glorifying it. They now have shows, I am jazz, I am this, you have Duane Wade celebrities coming out, and they get applauded, oh my gosh, you allowed your son to now say that he is a woman, and this means that you're accepting and you're a great parent, and it's that great cost to children to not have adults, be adults. Yeah, and you know, I'm guilty as a father, I was married for 17 years, had two children, and I thought I was more important than my children, and so I went out and did this in 1983, left the marriage, left my children, and I can tell you my sex change regret site is written because of the regret I had to what I did to my children, not because what I did to myself, that is so painful, you know, we're destroying families with this ideology, and I work with men frequently who are married like I was, and in working with them we find out that they had either some kind of abuse issue when they were young, or one of the other things that's so important for us to understand is there adult men that have three or four children that have been married 15 or 20 years, there's a thing called autoginophilia, and this is one of the things that people don't talk about because it's not socially acceptable, and autoginophilia is where a man dresses up in women's clothing, and he looks in the mirror and he becomes the object of his own sexual affection, that's his, that's his love affair, and so we have a lot of men who are identifying as transgender in reality or suffering from autoginophilia or a transvestic fetish disorder, and when I work with individuals like I have that have been going to therapy sometimes for 20 years, and they contact me and I say, are you becoming sexually aroused when you wear women's clothing? And they say yes, I said, well that's probably autoginophilia, or transvestic fetish, because I can assure you that a real woman doesn't become sexually aroused when she gets dressed in the mirror, so I think, you know, if you look at these things and realize there's something going on here that needs to be addressed, and so, you know, I can help them understand why they're doing this, and so many men who identify as transgender actually suffering from autoginophilia and transvestic fetish disorders. That is so interesting to hear. And it's sort of another area that's not being discussed is the suicide and the depression, so there's this lie that's being spun from childhood all the way up through adulthood, when they make a decision that once you just go over the edge, once you get gender reassignment, you're going to be happy and happily ever after. And that is virtually never the case, but those elements aren't discussed, but people don't talk about the fact that Caitlyn Jenner has talked about the depression, the suicidal thoughts, people ignore that, it's just you're happy and everything's amazing. Can you just talk about how untrue that is? Yeah, I tried to commit suicide with a cocaine overdose in Long Beach, California, and literally my heart was like beating out of my chest, and I really wanted to die. I was seeing all kinds of weird things in the room. I was done with my life, and this was not too long after I went through this process. I realized, you know, this is horrible. What am I going to do? Because you just destroyed everything. I was an executive with an automobile company. I was making good money. I had a great history. I worked on the Apollo Space Missions as an associate design engineer. I had a great career. I had a great family. I had great children, and I trashed it all for this idea that you can become someone you cannot become. This is what makes it so insidious and that we keep telling people, oh, you have to affirm them. No, don't affirm them. You can't become a woman. It's not going to happen. You're going to be a man in a dress or a woman dressed up like a man. The only thing you can do is feminize a man or masculinize a woman. You cannot change who you are. We need to understand that. The fact that they even mention these things is driving me a little bonkers because I know the pain that I've caused my children, my ex-wife, and in my own life, destroying my career. Thankfully, 30 years ago, I decided to detransition and try to work with people. I've been really blessed to work with people every single day. I'm working with somebody right now. We'll be right back to this episode of Candice in just one second. But first, I can say with full confidence that ExpressVPN is the best VPN on the market, and here is why. ExpressVPN doesn't log your activity online. Lots of cheap or free VPNs make money by selling your data to advertisers. But ExpressVPN does not do this. They even developed a technology trusted server that makes their VPN servers incapable of storing any data at all. ExpressVPN now uses Lightway, a new VPN protocol they engineered to make user speeds faster than ever. I've tried many VPNs in the past and they can sometimes slow my connection.

Now back to the show. And I want to ask you, I know that you sat down with Serena and you were very kind. And I have to assume that you were incredibly empathetic. What is your opinion when you see someone like Serena who is certain that this is the lifestyle that I will? I don't buy it, but I'm wondering what your true opinion is. Yeah, when Serena contacted me, I thought, you know, usually, you know, usually you don't want to go into the enemy camp, right? Because you know, they're going to tear you up. They're going to do something. I thought, you know, I want to know what's going on. I want to get there. I want to learn what they're feeling. And so we had quite a bit of time to walk around. And I found Serena had not at that time gone through the full surgical procedure. That's what had she told me or he's told me. And so walking around with Serena, what I thought was interesting was we were walking down the hallway to go shoot at a different location. And Serena says, you know, I think a lot of people have regrets. I think it's a really big deal. Wow. And so I think there's a lot of people that can't speak openly. And I really felt for Serena. And I felt there was a lot of pain, some deep pain. I couldn't identify it. I couldn't see where it was coming from. But I didn't want to cause Serena any more pain, but I could see that it was there. It was deep. It was real. Yeah. And I think that it's like I said, you can play pretend. You know, it's a bit like Halloween. You can play pretend. But at the end of the day, deep down, you have to know that this isn't real. And I think it's hard once you start that process to kind of get off, especially when there's so much universal affirmation coming from teachers, from professors, from doctors, from the scientific community. And I want to talk about the scientific community because I try to imagine if I went into the doctor and I said, I believe that I can fly. I'm a bird. And if a doctor performs the procedure to stitch wings onto my back so that I could live and affirm my belief that I am a bird, is that not criminal? Would that not be criminal, you know, to ruin a perfectly good body, to affirm somebody's, you know, mental disorder? How is this not criminal? It should be. And certainly if you tried to fly, it would be the end. And really, that's what happens, right? I mean, with the trans, this whole trans idea, because many, what we know from Sweden is when we talk about suicide is that 19% of them will die by suicide at some point, according to Sweden's records. And what we know today is that there's 19% Yes. Swedish records. 19 times more likely to commit suicide after surgery. After surgery. Yeah. And what they don't tell you is that, you know, they say very few people have regret, you know, this is their thing, only one or two percent. That's totally lie, because the way they calculate people who have regret is people like myself who say they regret it, they detransition, but if you don't have what they call a phalloplasty, if you don't go back in and have all this work done to have the penis redone, then you are not counted among the regretters. You're not counted among the detransitioners. The fact of the matter is 99% of the people who detransition don't have the phalloplasty surgery. So we're not counting 99% of the population, because people won't go through the procedure because it's non-functional. It doesn't often work properly. And it is actually more harmful to try to do that to a person after they've gone through it and try to make it real, which you can't do. So, you know, there's so many lies packed into this whole thing. The regret rate, according to the Europe, they had a thing in the Guardian Weekly that said it's probably 20% or more. Wow. Wow. And yeah, people are just pretending it's totally fine and celebrating it and now pushing this, which is where everybody should be drawing a line on children. They are teaching this. I mean, even you go on to Facebook and there's no longer just two genders. You can pick from what feels like an infinite amount of genders. They're talking about, you know, when you get born, they no longer want to put a gender on a birth certificate. So this is systemic, what we're talking about, which was totally different from when you were growing up, right? Where this is, it was more of a taboo. Yeah, it's not a taboo. This is mainstream. Well, now it's child abuse. Yeah. This is really child abuse. In my view, it's psychological child abuse, it's emotional child abuse, and eventually it'll become sexual child abuse. Those three things are in play every time someone tries to introduce the idea to a young child that there's something wrong with them and they're better off changing their genders. This is something that is horrible and it is destroying families as well. Not only is the father's leaving the home to become transgender, they have children. They're changing the parents who have, where did this come from? It came from school. It came from the internet. It came from I Am Jazz or some other thing. The stars on TikTok and Instagram and they're all, you know, bending gender, gender, bender and this idea of hyperfemininity. You know, it's encouraging all of this and in every single regard. And so my question to you would be what would be your advice if you had a call to action for parents, right, who are sending their children to these schools, maybe because they feel like they have to. It's public school. What am I going to do? I know they're not only, it's not even like they're just masking the kids now and they're also, even when they're learning, they're teaching these children, these ideas, like you can pick your gender. What would be your message to these parents right now during this time? Yeah, my message basically has been don't let them go to school because it's an indoctrination center. I want parents to deliver the message constantly to their children. They are beautiful the way they are. They don't need to change genders. This is not truthful. It's not factual. We're lying to our children and I think that we need to step up. We don't need to tell Johnny become Judy. You know, this is absolutely insane. Stop putting boys in dresses. Don't do it. 77 years later, I'm still talking about it. That should tell you something. And it's harmful. It's harmful in so many ways. It's destroying society. People are going around. Shouldn't we know who we are? I mean, for many, many years, everybody knew who they were, what their gender was, what their role in life was. All of a sudden, now somebody's put a hand grenade to it and said, no, you can do this. Pull the machine. You can identify with whatever you want. It's fake. It's nonsense. And most of all, it's very destructive. So I tell the parents, please be truthful. Tell them it's not possible. Look at my videos. I had one young child, 13 years old, look at my videos and detransition after looking at my video. And you know what? I actually also am recognizing right now that there seems to be almost right behind this general feeling to me that they're trying to make pedophilia okay. Like it's very short behind this. You're choosing to pick your gender, drag queen story time, bringing in the drag queens to do seductive dances in front of kids, having children, you know, dress up and a lot of these children who are trans children are hanging out with drag queens. This is not good for anybody. And I think that what it's actually going to lead to, perhaps, is even more sexual abuses upon children. Absolutely. And what's so interesting is that the founders of this whole thing in this country, which was Harry Benjamin, John Money and Kenzie, all were pedophile activists. So it really had its origins and its basis in pedophilia. It's all about the breakdown of family. And I think one thing the government knows that if it wants to grow itself and it wants to have real omnipotence, if it wants to be a truly powerful government, you cannot have stable families. Stable families are in the way of governments growing themselves. Stable families are in the way. In many ways, the government wants to be people's mother and fathers. They don't want that nuclear family unit around the table. And so much of why they've gotten behind this destructive pattern of thinking is because ultimately they know that this will lead to non-productive families. You're spot on. That's exactly what this is about. It's about destroying the family, destroying the church, destroying our society as men and women. They want to erase what a man is, what a woman is. They're taking them off the bathroom doors and saying, you know, you can be anything you want. The foundation of this country is built on a man, a biological man, a biological woman, producing children and having a family. That is what's stable and right in our country. That's what we need to fight for. That's what we need for all our families and we need to fight really hard to keep it that way. Well, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all. You remain one of the most inspiring people to me. I think you are fighting something that almost feels impossible right now and I can only imagine the hate that you receive. I want to thank Walt for his incredible and eye opening discussion on transgender issues and when we come back, I will be answering your questions."
