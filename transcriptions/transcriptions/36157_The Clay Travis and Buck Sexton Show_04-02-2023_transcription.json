    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show podcast. Welcome back in clay Travis bucks, Xt and show, encourage you to subscribe to the clay Travis bucks, Xt and show podcast. Make sure you don't miss a moment. Also a lot of cool original interview material dropping in there that you won't find anywhere. Uh, so search out clay and buck on Twitter. Uh, well, you can find this on Twitter. You can find us on Instagram. You can find us anywhere, but you can subscribe to the podcast by searching out my name or bucks, sex and his name. They are enjoying the tens of millions of cool kids who are downloading these episodes. Uh, all right. We've got some breaking news for you. Uh, that has just come down during the commercial break. Uh, the FBI, this is according to the Wall Street Journal. I'm reading their headline. The FBI searched Biden's former think tank office in November. It says the search was undertaken after an agreement with the White House. Now this is in the Penn Biden center where they initially found the classified documents. Remember, I've got the timeline here beside me. The initial discovery of those documents, according to the Biden crew was on November 2nd. Now we don't know when the FBI engaged in this search, but presumably it happened after the midterms, although it's possible it happened before the midterms. We don't have the date. Let me read you. It's a relatively short article. Uh, people familiar with the matter have told the Wall Street Journal that the FBI searched President Biden's former office in Washington in November. And, uh, again, they discovered roughly a dozen classified documents on November 2nd, but this is the important, uh, part of this story so far. It couldn't be determined whether investigators found any additional items of the classified documents that they found on the carpet inside Amara Lago. We have months of histrionic media coverage about what a threat to our republic. This was we're just finding out now on the final day of January that the FBI rated Biden's Washington office in November. And now we know the FBI has reportedly looked at his house as well, but this is the way that stories are covered for. If you are a Democrat, the story doesn't come out until the very end of January months later, this continues to make the White House look worse. Um, but they protected the White House because this information did not come out anywhere near the time that it actually took place. I think it's very clear that the FBI at a high level saw the Marlago documents as an opportunity to score some points with the regime in power. Because this is something I always say Democrats take care of their henchmen. You can be a Democrat who gets fired from your job in the FBI. You know what happens to you? You get a CNN gig, a book deal and probably a board seat or a professorship down the line. That's what the Democrats do. So within the deep state corridors, they understand, Hey, we got a chance here. They had a chance at Marlago to really dig in. I mean, to the point about the photos, why did those photos ever make it out? Why were they taken in that way? Why splay out the top secret documents? We all know why. And I think it's because senior people in the FBI, whose names we may not even know right now, but we might in the future, we're thinking, well, you know, I would love to be Homeland Security director or I would love to be senior White House advisor for whatever, right? So they took that as an opportunity because we've seen very different handling of the situation as it pertains to Joe Biden. And we didn't even mention this on the show yesterday, but you know, there are these concerns about notebooks that have been discovered in the Biden's Delaware home, its primary residence, I believe in Wilmington concerning classified material. So once again, Joe Biden made a habit of this. This went on for many years for everything that we find. That's a page of classified that is still next to the Corvette in the garage. He probably took a hundred other pages home. I'm just guessing, but this is not something that was new to him. This is not something that wasn't a regular occurrence. And it is pretty pretty much a slap in the face to everybody out there. You know, we get every time we bring the sub clay, we get calls from people saying, I had a TS clearance in the army. I had a TS clearance at, you know, DIA or FBI or wherever. And if I had done any of this stuff, my life would be over. And for Joe Biden, it's, it's not even a, it's not even really a slap on the wrist from not only the legal authorities, but politically they're trying to make it seem like this should be no big deal as well. The only viable defense that Joe Biden has against all this that is, that is iron clad. And I will say this, Joe Biden has an iron clad defense available to him, which is he's not of sound mind. And it's actually sad that he can't remember where he leaves things because of what's going on with him upstairs. But he won't make that argument, obviously, because then people might say, why are you president? Let me just go back to the timeline, Buck, because again, breaking news, this just came down during our commercial break, Wall Street Journal reporting that the FBI conducted a search of Joe Biden's pin Biden's center office after there were reportedly 12 classified documents discovered there. What I want to go to Buck is, and I've got this timeline here, people would have just seen it, who are watching on video at clay and buck.com. I got this timeline that I keep on my desk here because I know this is going to keep remaining relevant. When Merrick Garland came out and spoke, Buck, I jotted down several dates that he gave us. He said on November 2nd, the discovery of these classified documents were uncovered in Joe Biden's office. On November 4th, the archives notified the Department of Justice. And then he said something interesting. He said on November 9th, there was an FBI assessment. Just reading between the lines now that what we know, this to me would suggest that that FBI search occurred on November 9th, right after the midterm elections. And then the other day he gave us was November 14th, US Attorney Lausch was given this investigation. That would suggest to me, Buck, that the FBI may have found something on November 9th. You following my timeline here? If Merrick Garland says on November 9th, the FBI made an assessment, I would presume, and maybe there was a raid before November 9th, but I can't imagine the FBI now that we have this Wall Street Journal report would not have made an assessment based on doing their own search there. Now, why didn't the FBI at that time also initiate a search at Joe Biden's Wilmington Delaware home, which it appears they have done now? Why did they not also then initiate a search at the at the beach house? That's a really valid question that I would love to ask Merrick Garland right now. But we don't know again, according to the FBI report that we just got from the Wall Street Journal, whether they found anything. But it's possible, Buck, that they found additional classified documents there or documents that they believe might have been a significant nature, because on November 14th, we know a US Attorney, this guy Lausch was put in charge of this. But my point on this is the FBI assessment that's doing a little bit of work in the way that Merrick Garland defined it. Why wouldn't he have told the American public the FBI conducted a search in that public availability that he had when he announced that there was going to be a special counsel? And why did it take all the way November, December, and basically to the end of the month in January, why does the Democrat get three months before we know that this occurred? We all know why, right? I mean, we're asking these questions. No, either important questions. You have to ask them, but I'm just saying, you know, that these are actually, they shouldn't be rhetorical questions, but they are rhetorical questions, right? We we should be saying, wait, hold on a second. But we asked them because we know what this is really all about. And you know, we started out I'm look, I very much stand behind my assessment that even the special counsel designation with regard to Biden is going to be very limited in scope and isn't going to really, nothing's going to come of this, because they would have to choose to expand the investigation into other areas. And I don't look, we all know you can't predict the future. It could be wrong. Nobody could have predicted that good old Joe was papering his walls like Nash in a in a beautiful mind, you know, papering his walls with classified information. Nobody could have seen that one coming. But I don't think that this is, wait, is it who is the bat the basketball player is Steve John Nash is the Steve Nash is the basketball player you know, I'm talking about right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I know you know, I know you know, I know you're Nash is the brilliant mathematician from a beautiful mind who had all the, you know, the diagrams of all the classified super superstar. Yes, Steve Nash is the basketball coach, formerly point guard, very talented basketball player also far left wing. Oh, sorry, I get now you got me crossed up. I'm getting Steve current Steve Nash mixed up. Oh, we got Nash's got a nice name Nash. Yeah, a lot of Nash. So we have Joe Biden document fiasco and we talk about why this and why don't they push him or and why is the FBI treating him so differently. I mean, Clay, we started off the show just talking about how yet again, another chapter of depravity for Hunter Biden, which we have to put into the context of Hunter Biden was getting 80 grand a month from Burisma in Ukraine while his dad was the point man for Obama on US foreign policy in Ukraine. So again, it's not just about how Hunter Biden is gross. It's about the Biden family is corrupt and was operating what what seems to be a criminal enterprise. I mean, Hunter didn't pay taxes on money he only made because of who daddy was. So we know there. And then there's all the other crimes. This demanding, I mean, you know, if a normal person tells their their legal and tells a legal assistant, you better FaceTime mean naked or else I'm not going to pay you. We need that's coming out of nowhere for people out there who may not have seen this this this story. But yes, you're right. I mean, the Daily Mail, we need to talk about this when we come back out of the next break because it well, again, I wasn't expecting for there to be a breaking news story about the FBI. But the Daily Mail headline is exclusive. Hunter Biden texted his assistant, set phone up so I can spy on you showering. Hunter Biden told his assistant, threatening to withhold her pay if she didn't FaceTime him naked according to text. She is the buck fourth employee who he's had a sexual relation that we know of who he's had a sexual relationship with. I mean, that's great. How many people out there do you think have ever texted anyone FaceTime me while you shower probably relatively low? How many people have have done that to an employee? Surely there's not that many people who have ever done this. But this is what Hunter Biden is. We'll give you a few more stories about that when we come back. But my goodness, what a crazy world the Biden crime family has created. But I want to tell you as we go to break, you probably have home insurance, probably have car insurance, probably have some form of health insurance may have life insurance. Do you have food insurance in the event that suddenly you aren't able to get to the grocery? Maybe it's because there's a hurricane. Maybe there's a tornado. Maybe it's just the calamitous nature of the Biden economy. Why not go ahead and provide for your family safety and security? My wife was pumped when these arrived on our front porch. And we put them right into our pantry. I'm talking about food supply that could last for a very long time. I have relied on them at my my my patriot supply to take care of my family. We have three months of emergency food for the three boys here in my household and also for my wife and myself. And it'll last up to 25 years. These are a 2000 calorie count per day per person kit. And they can last for three months each person. We've got five different of these kits that we just keep for safety and security and food insurance in my house. Now you can do the same as my family and save $200 on your three month emergency food kit by going to mypatriotsupply.com Kitsil ship fast and free. And the rule of thumb on this is to buy one for each member of your household. Just like I did. We've got five of them in the Travis house. Go to mypatriotsupply.com one more time mypatriotsupply.com. Keeping it real. Keeping it honest. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. So there's this huddle Biden story that we're just spending playing on whatever we end up talking about it. You know, in commercial breaks before and after the show we feel like we got to talk about it with all of you, of course. And and this is so we got the details here. We're not going to spend a lot of time on this. And in a moment we're going to get into Trump and DeSantis a little bit of back and forth. It's out there. It's happening. Uh, but Clay, Hunter Biden, threatened to withhold cash from his assistance pay if she didn't face time him naked. This is the fourth employee with whom he has had a sexual relationship. See the problem with having a sexual relationship, which we all know with somebody who is relying on you paying them so they can pay their bills, pay their rent, feed themselves, is that creates a totally unfair power dynamic and a toxic situation for that individual, which is why you're not supposed to sleep with subordinates, people that are dependent on you for a paycheck for obvious reasons. Um, I just at this point where it's almost remarkable. Clay Hunter Biden makes the canadaies look like choir boys. I mean, Hunter Biden is a degenerate of a whole other level and degree. And this is the guy who is actually at the center of the Biden influence peddling scheme. Yeah, look, I'm just going to read one text to you. And this is up on dailymail.com. Uh, he sent her a message. This is his, again, it's his employee, right? It's not some random, you know, prostitute, which of which there are many. Uh, he said, you have to make up for back work by FaceTiming me and or going to our next club party. Uh, and he said another time, when can you FaceTime? If we FaceTime, the rule has to be no talk of anything but sex. And we must be naked and we have to do whatever the other person asks within reason. When can you talk? I can later tonight, she replied. Um, so look, I mean, FaceTiming shower requests to your employees and then having it documented that you did this on your own laptop. Again, his pecadillos as they are may not be all criminal, but it does raise the question, Buck. The idea that they have tried to sell of, oh, Hunter was just a great lawyer. That's why these Ukrainian and Chinese companies wanted to retain him. Buck, you wouldn't retain this guy to like go feed your cats if you were out of town. Like he's totally unreliable in all respects. Clay, it's just like the Clinton foundation, which people now the Democrats want to pretend this didn't exist. The Clinton global initiative was getting money from tyrannical regimes all over the world. And actually at one point, I think there was even a request to have Bill speak to some, I think it was, was it, was it backed by North Korea or something? Really like crazy stuff. And we were told it was all about charity. It was actually all about buying off the Clintons. We're not idiots. Bill Clinton speeches aren't worth half a million dollars a piece. They certainly aren't anymore, are they? Boy, my friends, the IRS has a plan to refund business owners who made it through COVID.

I told this to buck off there. I believe the story of 2023 in a big picture on this radio show is going to be Trump versus DeSantis as both men eventually start throwing haymakers at each other as we move towards the 2024 primaries. And the analogy I made to buck, I was like, Hey, bud, this is like Alleb, Auburn, Ohio State, Michigan, Red Sox, Yankees. Like this is going to be an epic 800 pound gorilla, both swinging arms at each other war Eagle versus real tide. That's right. Thank you. And we finally are starting to get kind of the the attack and the response. Although again, I don't think DeSantis, I believe, and I think Buck, you agree, I believe DeSantis will announce for president sometime around June. That's what I expect to happen. The Florida legislative session ends in May. I think sometime around June, July, the DeSantis people will officially step in and say we're running for president in 2024. The whole campaign apparatus will be up and running. Trump obviously is already in the field. I think there's going to be a lot of people who jump in the field, but right now the two heavyweights are DeSantis and Trump that we expect. So I wanted to play this audio for you. Trump did events over the weekend in New Hampshire and in South Carolina. And during the process of that travel, he took shots at DeSantis. Here's what he said. So Ron would have not been governor. And that's okay. And he double what he wouldn't have gotten the nomination. And number two, he wouldn't have beat the judges that we're out of bone. So then when I hear he might run, you know, I consider that very disloyal, but it's not about loyalty. But to me, it is. It's always about loyalty. But for a lot of people, it's not about it. Okay, so any thoughts, Buck in general, I mean, Trump has continued. He's put out releases, like he's kind of started to take shots at DeSantis in a way that you would anticipate if they're going to be running against each other. Well, I do think that when, first of all, when you're the president, you're going to give endorsements to a whole, a whole lot of people. But in politics, you know, Trump knows, right? He knows that at some level, there's no such thing as a loyalty of that kind in politics. You're not going to not run against somebody out of some sense of loyalty to them, because as we know, people usually run because maybe they feel called by God, they feel called by patriotism and their love of country, you know, it's there's plenty of reasons that are going to surmount or, or, or, or over leap, the sense of personal loyalty you have to another politician. That's one part of it. But obviously he is going to take it personally because Trump takes all politics personally. I mean, that's part, that's part of his approach. So the chance of this going down, like, you know, it's funny, Clay, I interviewed tutor Dixon for our new long forms, which are going to Clay and Buckfeed. I know you've interviewed tutor as well. She came came up just a little short in Michigan, but a great lady and made a really good run of it. And I asked her about Gretchen Whitmer on the podcast, which you should subscribe to the Clay and Buckfeed to listen to. And she's like, she was always very nice to me. And while we disagree on policy, and you know, it was just she's a really nice person, you know, she's just clearly somebody who you run against Trump and you're a, you're scum and you're a loser. You know what I mean? Like he's not, he has no other speed. So I think we could expect that to happen. The analogy I would make, and I think Trump would, would kind of not along with this because he's a big sports guy. Look, Tom Brady back in the day took over for Drew Bledsoe when Drew Bledsoe got injured and basically never gave the job back. And that was because Brady was better at quarterback for the Patriots than Drew Bledsoe was. If in sports, even if you will the understudy, right? You're the backup. You're sitting there. You're learning from the starting quarterback. At some point, you may get the starting quarterback job and never relinquish it. That's how sports work. And that's the way that I would analogize this. I don't think it's disloyal to believe that you are better at something than someone else is right. You're going to fight for the job. Who's getting more completions, touchdowns and yards, right? You're going to fight for the job. And Trump, if the Santis goes in, by the way, I'm not 100% sure in my mind. I mean, obviously, I'm not Ron DeSantis. I'm not 100% sure he's going to run. I think it's very likely, but you know, you don't know what's going to happen over the next months. I would be stunned if he doesn't run, but I'd give him to I'd give 10 to one odds that he will run, but I'm just saying, you know, so we're kind of getting a little ahead of it. But look, I mean, yeah, his wife just had breast cancer, right? And thankfully, she's recovered, I believe from that. But you don't ever know when somebody's going to have a health condition family, one of the kids could have an issue like the same thing in my life. Look at how different American politics was over the last 20 years. People often forget, you know, Rudy Giuliani was initially running at the absolute peak of his powers was running against Hillary Clinton. He had cancer. He had to step aside. I think it was Rick Lazio who stepped in in New York who was a nice guy, but you know, a third tier congressman in terms of notoriety, you know, name recognition, everything else. And Hillary as a total carpet bagger, right? Just just cleaned his clock and became the senator. And then, you know, was the heir apparent for the presidency. Of course, we know how that ended up working out. But, you know, things happen is all I'm saying, right? I mean, Rudy Giuliani very well may have won that Senate seat defeated Hillary. Think of all the downstream changes in politics that would have occurred. So we don't know if DeSantis is running yet. But DeSantis also isn't just sitting back and taking this stuff. He finally responded to some of this. And can we play DeSantis's response to some of the Trump, Trump jabs? I roll out of bed. I have people attacking me from all angles. It's been happening for many, many years. And if you look at the good thing about it, though, is like, if you take a crisis situation like COVID, good thing about it is when you're an elected executive, you have to make all kinds of decisions, you got to steer that ship. And the good thing is, is that the people are able to render a judgment on that whether they reelect you or not. And I'm happy to say, you know, in my case, not only did we win reelection, we won with the highest percentage of the vote that any Republican governor candidate has in the history of the state of Florida. So basically, Clay, this comes down, this comes down to Trump's pitch to the voters, is I'm Trump. All that that comes together, right? I'm Trump. DeSantis's pitch right now, and he's not even running per se is scoreboard. Look at the scoreboard. And by the way, can we pull a little cut there? Because I just jotted it down. He said people render a judgment on reelection. And then he said, in my case, that seems like a pretty good shot at Trump. Because Trump lost his reelection bid. It's like that's subtle. But when I hear that, can we play that again? I want everybody out there to listen because he doesn't mention Trump by name, but he says, in my case, what does he need to say my case if he's talking about reelection? And he said people render a judgment based on COVID. Just go back and listen and tell me if you don't think this is a sort of subtle shot at Trump not being reelected, maybe partly based on his COVID response. Listen, I roll out of bed. I have people attacking me from all angles. It's been happening for many, many years. And if you look at the good thing about it, though, is like, if you take a crisis situation like COVID, good thing about it is when you're an elected executive, you have to make all kinds of decisions. You've got to steer that ship. And the good thing is, is that the people are able to render a judgment on that whether they reelect you or not. And I'm happy to say, you know, in my case, not only did we win reelection, we won with the highest percentage of the vote. Right. Okay, you could stop. So we heard the rest of that. You know, this is interesting, because you know what I think this could be a little bit of a preview of clay is Ron DeSantis may at some point be if he runs, okay, and I'm just I'm getting a little ahead of the game here, but I think we could all see this. He may be the first person who stares at Trump on a stage and says, you lost the 2020 election from the Republican Party in a way that would really I don't know if he will or not. That you pick up on what I'm saying there, though, that feels like a very subtle. It's not a direct, you know, like he didn't say Trump lost in 2020 because people said they didn't like the choices that he was making potentially on COVID. I won the biggest reelection in Florida ever. The fact that little subtle pivot. Remember, Santa's a smart. He's a Harvard logger at that little subtle pivot of in my case and reelection. The fact that both of them stood for reelection. That again, I think that was a very subtle like jab at Trump. And I'm curious. I bet Trump would, you know, again, when he listens to that, he's a smartest stoop guy too. He knows what's going on. And I just I think the gla the gla here's what I predict. The gloves are going to come off. People out there who are like, oh, this is going to be like a really like Lincoln v. Douglas debate. No, you when you are going to go head to head with Trump, DeSantis is going to have to throw the gloves off and stand in the ring and they're both going to have to throw haymakers at each other. And it's going to be nasty. And if people are going to say, I hate to see Republicans fight, I'm just telling all of you out there listening. You may be a DeSantis guy. You may be a Trump guy. It's coming. And to me, that's a subtle little early jab like, Hey, let me see if you get your hands up or not. And he popped Trump a little bit in the nose. And Trump's been certainly kind of popping DeSantis in the nose. Just kind of testing, testing the reach, testing the reach a little. It's coming. It's coming, folks. And we already know Nikki Haley is planning to get in there. I think you're going to see Glenn Yunken get in there. I think you're going to see Mike Pompeo. I think you're going to see Mike Pence. Oh, isn't Bolton running? Michael Bolton. I know John Bolton, but I might as well be Michael Bolton. Isn't he running for president? Yeah, I mean, like some of these guys like I get that you're running, but I mean, come on, you're running so you can sell a few more books. You're not running because you think you actually have a chance to be the nominee. And honestly, I think the more people who run, the better it helps Trump because I think Trump's people are the most hardcore committed of any advocacy group out there. Now, I think I think he's 30% of the GOP right now is is Trump all the way to the very end. And maybe, you know, maybe higher than that. But I think at least a third of them, 30% of GOP primary voters right now are it's got to be Trump again. You agree with me right now, only person that could be Trump right now, things can change DeSantis. Nobody. I don't. I've never heard anyone else make an argument that was compelling to me other than that, meaning that I've never heard someone say, you know, who could really run the table here? Nikki Haley. I haven't heard that. I don't know. And by there, by the way, there's Mike Pence and Nikki Haley people like everybody is different, right? Everybody's got different advocacy groups and everything else. We're going to be the primary. I think source to be talking about this primary season. I mean, I always say this. I think Rand Paul, we have on the show a lot. I think Rand Paul would be a phenomenal president actually. Like in the job, I think Rand Paul would be a really good president. I just don't think Rand Paul is built for winning a national presidential election. Right? I mean, you know, this, there's different, there's a lot of nuances here. Did we just alley texted me that Bolton has already announced? I think he has. That's why he came to my mind. Yes. I didn't even know that he announced. It's not a good, it's not a good sign for Michael Bolton or John Bolton that John Bolton has evidently announced for president. And I didn't even know. And I don't even see an articles like they always say nobody else's announced, but Trump, they don't even mention his name. Yeah, but for Michael Bolton, I celebrate his whole catalog. So for the office space fans out there, office space. One of the funniest movies that's ever been made. Oh, man, got to get your stapler. Milton.

Welcome back to clay and buck. We've got a lot more coming up here in the third hour, including clay. Did you see this? It was just just breaking here. California cops have have shot a Oh gosh, it's a police involved use of force incident. You know what? Let's let's hold on this until the next hour. But a man who was a double amputee, an African American man double amputee and was shot by cops in California. There's video of it. I think this is going to factor into the law enforcement discussion heavily factor into the law enforcement discussion. The Thunderway right now will break down that story for you coming up in a few minutes. I want to get to some calls 800 282 2882 please give us give us a ring will chat. We have Kurt in Orange County, California. Hey Kurt, what's going on? Hey, Clay and Buck. Good to talk to you guys. Thanks for everything you're doing. Yeah, I just had a little bit different take on the the riots in 2020 versus the non riots after the Memphis situation. And the only difference there's not was more wonders, but the main difference is we have a Democrat president Biden now. And we had a Republican president then. And so the Soros and the leftists use that as a way to agitate in 2020 and create riots and looting and trouble to undermine Trump. And now they told everybody don't riot because Biden's president. Yeah, I get that argument, Buck, and I've heard it. And I do think there was a lot of encouragement of rioting from Democrats in 2020 that would not occur now because Joe Biden's in office. I also still think there would have been riots if the police officers have been white. I think an important and important data point as well for for this caller to remember, Kurt, thank you very much for calling in the original BLM riots happened under the Obama administration. It's where it started after. Right. So BLM 1.0 was when Obama was in office. And that was when you had the the first view of I forget, I think it was MSNBC. Later on, was it was an Ali Velshi who was standing in front of the flaming building saying it was mostly peaceful? But I think that was 2020. There was an earlier incident though back in the Obama administration. I think it might have been 2015 where there was a reporter in St. Louis standing in front of a building on fire saying, well, it was a mostly peaceful protest. And this is where we got that whole idea. Of course, only applied to riots in the context of BLM. But that happened under the Obama administration. Yeah. And I think really the biggest difference here was by black police officer. I think that has impacted the way that people responded in a big way. Also, I mean, look, I think everybody had the same reaction to the video. Have you heard anybody who said, Oh, you know what they've been charged as brought? I haven't heard a single person, not one, like of any kind of media prominence who said, Hey, you know what, I watched those videos. I don't think there was any inappropriate police conduct there. It's actually even more clear cut to me that the police misbehaved and engaged in criminal behavior than the George Floyd incident. I think the only difference is white guy in the George Floyd video versus black guys in the, in the Tyree Nichols case. A lot of troubling implications of that."
