    "text": " Today, a new $3.5 trillion budget plan. You may lose your mind when you hear what all is in it. Also, Obama's maskless birthday celebration and Dr. Fauci says to expect a flood of vaccine mandates. We have got a lot coming up this Monday and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today, joined by my good friends. We've got Chad Prather, America's favorite cowboy and future governor of Texas. Also, host of the Chad Prather show here on Blaze TV. Yeah, I was told yesterday I'm not governor material. Why? I posted a shirtless picture. I was at the lake and it was online. I'm sorry. Are you not allowed to be hot if you're governor? Hey Barack Obama did all the time. He tried. He tried. He tried. He didn't pull it off, but he did it. He did it. He did it. He did it. He got the Booians. By the way, Blaze TV contributor, host of the Aquabillion's show. Former model himself. He, self cowboy. Well, can I, we are going to get to Obama later, but he's, he was way too, he's so feminine. I know, I did not understand the hype with him. Oh, he's so dreamy with that, what him and Michelle rowing or kayaking or whatever that's what they were doing. That was actually, people said that, huh? I missed that. Yeah. Thankfully I missed that. Yeah, I missed that. Very happy. Well, I would say if you are not governor material, that would be great. We get a new shirt that says governor material. But I don't want governor material. I don't want the typical governor. I was telling him that earlier. Yeah. Why would we want the same? Right. Exactly. We're trying to do things differently around here. I don't think it's been working out. But I'm fully clothed today. Oh, that's a shame. All right. So let's get into the headlines of the day. So the summit, Senate Democrats unveiled the outline of their $3.5 trillion budget resolution, which I think people like, Oh, just the 3.5 trillion because it just your eyes glaze over. And you can't even comprehend what kind of money that really is. But let me go through some of the tags on it. So it establishes universal pre K for three and four year olds and a new childcare benefit for working families, community college tuition free for two years. The first ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit provides environmental justice and climate resilience. Let's see electrifies the federal vehicle fleet and buildings. Establishes the first ever civilian climate core provides green cards to millions of immigrant workers and families and you know, on and on and on and on. So I just it's just that like we're just like selling off all of the assets and money of our like children's, children's, children's, children. And I just am not sure that it's worth it for universal pre K from the government and environmental justice. Well, nobody's read this thing because it's longer than the Bible. First of all, it's it's a gigantic document. But I didn't know that we could just throw money and have climate resilience. Like you just fix it by just spending some money. Yeah. Of course, John Kerry, who again flew on his private jet to Barack Obama's, Barack Obama's party, and then flew to the what US PCC where they said, Oh, now more than ever, the climate is definitely but it goes back to the we're trillion. I keep saying this. It just has lost all mean really like it like if there's all punches out of it. Just done. We don't understand the concept of a trillion. So if you pull up your calculator, do it on your phone sometime. If you can't type in that many numbers, right, you can't put that many numbers because the screen's not big enough. We're way off base here. We're we're we're just every time you type that try to try about that many zeros. Just erase a kid from the future because they're not gonna they're not gonna be able to it's untenable. They're not gonna be able to exist. This is a weakening of the American citizen. This is a weakening of the American economy. This is the globalization of America. This is bringing us down to a level that is manageable by the rest of the world. The Chinese sit back and laugh. They know exactly what's going on and where this is this is as again. I hate to keep talking about the Messiah, Barack Obama, but this is the fundamental change of America that they asked for. It's just a little later than he promised, but it is here. It's a little later, but it's here and it's here in full swing. They make an up for it for whatever they whatever they lacked in being radical during his eight years, they're doubling down and they're speeding the train up faster. You can say fast and look, when we go through these programs, if you could read this document, if you could make it through it without falling asleep, right? You would start seeing all the little tethers, all the organizations and the programs and all the friends and yes, you'd sprinkle in little China there and maybe a little Middle East and you'll just see how money is just siphoned off from the taxpayer to go towards crazy stuff. And as if you could literally throw money at the environment and go clean up the environment. We just have to say this. The number one perpetrator on earth is in fact China for polluting the air and there's zero accountability from the US government to China. And this ball does spin. I'm not the flat arthur. We actually turn. So when China pollutes, here she comes, right? It's the earth's atmosphere, but now it's a game. And so whatever program they can come up with to print money that's backed by zero, we're talking about you said four generations, I don't know, we're probably 10 generations into the future. Yeah, I just felt like it. I didn't have enough time. We have borrowed into the great abyss. Maybe past the second coming. I'm sitting over and over again. The money's not there and the money's not theirs. It doesn't exist. This is this is ethereal, this whole stuff that we're talking about. Yeah. So to to your point, Yaku, about the them just, there's all of these other add-ons that we will find. I know Chuck Schumer told the Democrats that quote, every senator will have opportunities to shape and influence the final reconciliation bill after adoption of the budget resolution. He added, at its core, the legislation is about restoring the middle class in the 21st century and giving more Americans the opportunity to get there. This legislation will provide the largest tax cut for American families in a generation while making the wealthy pay their fair share. In all phases, we will concentrate on communities that have too often been neglected, including communities of color and Native Americans. So he seems to have tried to put all of the buzzwords in there to make it sound like his chat, as you pointed out. No one is going to read this bill. No one is actually going to know what is in it, but they are going to hear Chuck Schumer say, well, we're going to be looking out for you and we just want to help the middle class and we're finally going to make the wealthy pay their fair share. And that, I think, will be the talking points from the Democrats to push to adopt it. And of course, the sheep will latch right onto it. I think. To say we want to help the middle class get there, get where? The mediocrity to where? Where everybody, everything's just manageable and sustainable and they're dependent on the government. Well, and I think they pull the upper class down to the middle class. So that's not mediocrity. It's like paying property taxes. And when property taxes are going through the roof, you don't want to improve your home because guess what? They're just going to tax you more because now your home is supposedly worth more. So why do I want to work harder to become upper class or to achieve the American dream? Let's say they're just bringing the American dream down to this quote unquote achievable mediocre middle and it's disgusting. I don't get up every day with the hopes to just stay status quo where I am financially and in terms of business in terms of accomplishment. I don't do those things. That's not the American dream. I am a capitalist. I want to keep working. If, you know, hey, but they don't want that. They want to cheapen all of that. Yeah. No 100%. And if you look at other nations, when they start talking about lowering the grade point average or the ability to pass a grade or don't measure anymore, just pass because they show up or smile, all these things are about bringing the top down. Just go research Canada and see how this happened in Canada. How if you're an achiever in Canada, you're frowned upon. Yeah. Literally. Even as an athlete, you can't they'll give the man of the match trophy or the most valuable trophy to the guy who didn't do anything to make his feelings feel better. Right. Yeah. And just bring everybody back to middle. Control yourself. Don't get out of line. Don't overachieve now, Chad. You can't, this is hot, but you can earn. We kind of decided for you and then let Uncle Sam take care of you. You know, when I was a student at the University of Georgia, good dogs, we took I took a statistics class. The statistics class was so impossibly hard. He gave two tests. It was a midterm and there was a final. That was all midterm and a final open book, whatever. We didn't have cell phones and computers. We didn't have the internet, but it was open book, open textbook, open notebook. Well, you could take anything you wanted. There were only four problems on the entire thing. The midterm, I remember, was so difficult that if you made a 28 on it, you passed. That was how big the curve was. Right. If you made like a 60 something, it was considered an A in that. Well, you're not learning anything at that point, right? Because the curve has now gotten so out of control. It's virtually unattainable. So that's what happening now to America. We've done this thing and we've sold it in such a way that says, hey, man, if you just want to get there, as Chuck Schumer says, you don't really have to do that much. Let us do it all for you. That's right. And so now you have cradle to grave care on the part of the government. And now we're on the government team. Do you think I know we need to get into Obama's birthday party? But I mean, so I think the question for me is, at what point or are we already there where we have a generation of up and coming, let's say, high schoolers, 18 year olds, 21 year olds who don't like the American dream to them is now, how much will the government give me? Because they seem to be, I mean, that's part of their plan, right? They're doing the tuition-free college. They're doing the universal pre-K. They're trying to establish in these individuals that they are to be governed from cradle to grave. So I guess, I mean, I obviously you're correct about the American dream and what it actually is, what is supposed to be representative of it. But do we have these up and coming, you know, people in the workforce who understand that? Because I worry that it's already lost. For that bracket of society that you're talking about, it's changed. Yeah, I don't think that they can even call that. We go out here right now on the street and do a poll with, you know, a thousand 18 year olds to 30 year olds right now. That's what is the American dream? I think you'll be shocked. Remember I showed you the little graph I did Saturday of the other day about Bucky's paying their people like, I mean, crazy amount and had this 21 year old, you know, cashier say, oh, you don't want to work here. All right, it's awful. And I go, dude, you're making 19 bucks an hour for your starter job. Yeah, to sit at a cash, to sit at a cashier, it's complaining air conditioning and it's complaining. Right. He's not busting Knuckles, you know, chopping wood or lumber or the lumber yard or whatever. That tells you there's a whole different dream. And that dream is an uncle Sam's going to take care of his dream. It's like, it's actually they're supposed to. They believe, well, they're supposed to. Right. They're supposed to. What do you want me to do something? Right. And so I'm, I think I think we've seen a generational shift. Do I want it that way? No. Right. But I think that's the, that's just the fact that's because otherwise how would they can do burning cities down and defend these crazy people and put a mask on and throw? I mean, this is no. So then how do we get back? Well, Chad, do you agree? Yeah. So you put enough honey on the nipple, you're going to want to suck on it, right? Well, right now they're putting honey on the turd and we're still sucking on it. And that's the thing. We've sweetened it to the point we don't even know we're sucking on anymore. And we sucked on it so much that now we just suck. And so, what happens is we don't fight back because we're afraid of them taking the honey away. We'll keep sucking the turd. Sorry, mom and dad, if the kids will watch them. And this is just the fact you just keep on like, we're so afraid of losing the honey. And so we have this generation. And we're all guilty of this thing because our founding fathers would have already been in the middle of a revolution. They've been, they've been dumping tea in the harbor two years ago. Yeah, we're just like, oh, still wear this mask until I die. And even COVID aside, the reason as you alluded to earlier, Yaku is they've hit the nitrous button in the car, right? They're in fast forward because they thought they were going to have four to eight years of Hillary Clinton to get this stuff done. Well, they did and they had a hiccup called Donald Trump. And Donald Trump came in here upset the plans. Now they had to put the puppet in there. Joe Biden, a Mississippi cup, as you call him, I love that name for him. They had to put him in there and they can control the agenda. Right? So what's what is their hope? Not not with this mindset, not with this mindset we're scared of being shut down. We're scared of being started being canceled. We don't want to say anything that's not politically correct because they're going to come at us and let's face it, you know, the LGBTQ community, their militant and the cancel culture, they're strong. And I'm afraid to make a joke here, say something or speak out because I know that what are they going to do? They're going to, they're going to make it where I can't go to church anymore. I can't go to, you know, I can't speak up at the PTA meeting or the whatever the city council meeting, you can't do all these things. And we're scared at some point in time, I think you alluded to it on a taping of my show. So you put the dog far enough in the corner. And eventually, there's a, there's a good number of us out there that are just genuinely pissed off enough that you will not like what's going to come when it happens. Yep. Yep. Yep. And I'm telling you, I'm feeling that brewing and I'm seeing it. I'm seeing it in the communities. And we are in the corner. There's no more room. Just FYI. There's no more backing up. You back up one, I'm at the point where we back up one more inch. Okay, you're off the cliff by my country. And so now it's like that way. See, here's, let me say something this is because a friend of all of ours, call me on the phone yesterday. He's a very famous person, a very accomplished person, very outspoken person. He called me on the phone. He said, dude, you did a rant last week and I'm so proud of you. What you said on that thing, you're so passionate. And he goes, I'm afraid we're at a point we're going to shoot our way out. And he goes, actually, I'm not afraid of that. Let's do it. And there's a lot of people out there say, oh my God, are you threatening violence? Yeah. Yeah, because we're tired of being kicked around. You can't put your boot on the back of my neck for long before I get up and kick your ass. That's right. And that's where we're at in this crossroads of human history. Yeah. You start having people throwing stuff at church cohorts. And maybe we're getting into that. I don't know if we are the story today. But you starting to tolerate that. If for a second, you're an American today and you've caught yourself give that inch. You better check yourself in the mirror tomorrow because you're part of the problem because we may be coming for you. You cannot give another inch in this nation, not to the vaccine, not to BLM or whatever acronym you want to call them. Anything that is anti God, anti country, anti true patriotism, you got to start pushing back period. Don't give an inch for nothing anymore. I feel like that may end up being the motto of the entire show. We'll get into a maskless Obama boozy party when we return. First, we want to thank our sponsor home title lock. So most of you, you're paying your mortgage. If you own a home, you're paying your mortgage every month to build this equity in it for this retirement nest. I probably maybe you got 50,000, 100,000. However much you have in there. But what you don't realize is that the more equity you have, actually the greater the chance that foreign and domestic criminals can come after you. And here's how they do it. All right. They go find your home's title that is kept online where everything is kept now. And they can take it. They can forge your signature on a quick claim deed. And they can then refile as a new owner. They can take your equity. They can take loans out against it. It's awful. You don't want it to happen to you. And by the way, you're not covered by insurance. You're not covered by your bank or common identity theft programs. But home title lock will cover that protect your most valuable asset. All right, register your address now to see if you are already a victim and don't know it. And you will receive a complete title history of your home. That is a hundred dollar value for free. If you go to home title lock.com, you got to register your address. Don't find out when it's too late. Find out now at home title lock.com. I we're getting into Obama's birthday party. And it just dawned on me. I don't know. I hope my son's birthday was over the weekend, by the way. Happy birthday. So I and I hope that it's not the same day as Obama's because that just seems like a really bad omen. No, I look at it this way. If Swear's birthday is on the same day, he redeemed the day. Okay, I like that. I like that. Come on. You're going to get that. That's much better. So can you just give us a good Barack Obama? Barack Obama. Okay. Thank you. That guy. That guy had this birthday party. We talked about it last week leading up to it. We had heard that he was going to have this big giant bash 60th birthday bash. And you know, I mean, there's a little Delta variant going around. And they're telling you that you are required to do things like make sure that you wear masks at all times, even if you're vaccinated and things of that nature. But please, these are the elitists. All right, they do not have to follow abide by the same rules that you have to follow, which is why all of these videos and pictures surfaced of the party where they were, of course, maskless here is Obama. And I don't know, is that his daughter? I don't know. This is Obama completely maskless at his birthday party with how many people just like 700 of his closest friends will originally they were going to do 500 were invited plus 200 people working at it. And so they said we're going to scale back. So they went to like 495. Well, thank God. Yeah, thank God. Because because the 500 was right under COVID's requirement. I don't know if we're going to if this is on your headlines because I don't prepare for this show at all. But let me say, let me tell you something. You know, you know, Nancy, we're going to keep with you all Martha's Vineyard. This is great. She was on Martha's Vineyard. Why? Because she thought she was going to Obama's party. Right? Right. There's no other reason to be on Martha's Vineyard if you're Nancy Pelosi. Right. She was on Martha's Vineyard. And apparently she was one of the ones that got disinvited. Right. She couldn't do the white man over like like Barack Obama's double with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg and Oprah in the spring in the spring thing and Barack. Let me be clear with the crew, you know. Because Nancy, let's face it. I could just see her sitting there with a $60 pint of ice cream, right? Just try and let me go. Because she said I have other parties to go to. How many parties do these elites have? No other party. There wasn't one more party. I told you. There was one more party. It was a Zoom party. It was Nadler and Schiff and Herb. All just sitting in the ice cream. You know, Flip the Fattass was all about that ice cream. Listen, uh, you know, Barack Obama, he's got a tent out there in the front yard that's bigger than his $13 million mansion. Yeah. It's a massive tent, right? There's nobody. There's nobody in society and Martha's Vineyard. I'm throwing a party. The same night. That is in competition. How do you perish for Tarot? How dare you? That's no way. My very, my very are we sophisticated? Are we vaccinated? Oh my God. Let's throw a party. Okay. So that deal, the soterials are having one. Like literally that was the excuse that was you. She says you had other parties. But on CNN, they discussed this and the White House correspondent was like, well, don't worry that yes, they may have been maskless, but these are sophisticated, vaccinated people. So nothing to see here. Watch. Other people said, you know, this is really being overblown. They're calling all the safety precautions. People are going to sporting events that are bigger than this. This is going to be safe. This is a sophisticated vaccinated crowd. And this is just about optics. It's not about safety. Oh, because we thought for a moment you were un-sophistic. We thought for a moment you were not handpicked Barack Obama taken through an Ivy League school without attending class. Given your certificate to Grunne, by Lewis Farrakhan and Jeremiah Wright, right? And all the overlords of the nation. We didn't know you were sophisticated. This is sophisticated men who committed drone strikes on civilians and waged war in seven countries simultaneously, who sent millions of dollars in pilots of cash, large styles of the rich and famous. This is this is a but I want to say thank you personally to the Soterial family. Barack Obama single-handedly has wiped out COVID. We never have to worry about it anymore. It's done. There's no masks. You don't need to do it. Well, hold on. I heard that there was a motorcycle rally that was very, very concerning that people were going to spread. Yeah, those are not sophisticated people. Those are motorcycle people. Listen, listen to the message. So that would maybe explain why Dr. Fauci was he's no word on Obama's maskless birthday party, but very concerned about this motorcycle rally watch. Well, I'm very concerned, Chuck, that we're going to see another surge related to that rally. I mean, to me, it's understandable that people want to do the kinds of things they want to do. They want their freedom to do that. But there comes a time when you're dealing with a public health crisis that could involve you, your family, and everyone else, that something supersedes that need to do exactly what you want to do. I mean, you're going to ultimately be able to do that in the future. But let's get this pandemic under control before we start acting like nothing is going on. I mean, something bad is going on. I mean, we've got to realize that. He's such a giant. Nothing. It's just a wonder that they don't have Andrew Cuomo's fingerprints on him. No, no, hold on. Hold on. What supersedes your freedom in this country? Nothing. God. God. That's it. Nothing else. And the Constitution is written from the Bibles, from the Word of God. Nothing. Nothing. I feel like he is a little unclear on that because he seems to think that if he scares people enough, scares the American citizens enough, that there are times where you, well, look, we just, I mean, there's a pandemic. So we that we have to, that supersedes your freedom. We need to take it from you. And then we will determine when we can give it back to you. And by the way, Obama gets it back before any of you peons. Because he's he's another level of sophistication. I just remind people, how does the four foot two durable scare you still today? I mean, get, I mean, come on, people please. I mean, it's about this high, right? He couldn't scare a mutt right now. It's stop listening. How much longer does he have to go on about all of these things that could happen? Well, it could. I'm in the future. I'm worried this one could be why was wrong about all these other ones? But I'm really worried this one could be a super spreader. Why is he still on freaking look, I'll say this, the mistake we made, Mr. Prather is the following. When you vaccinate, they shed like crazy. They contract the virus like crazy, faster and unvaccinated. Okay. So the thank you, Obama for eliminating COVID. Right. But now the super spreader, that was a super spread. If you want to talk about a super sprayer, right? But it's done. Yeah, they're going to be shed and faster than a user of head and shoulders. Listen, there, and you think they'd report any hospitalizations? Any of that? I mean, if let's say, let's say, zero, I mean, who was there? Jay Z and Beyonce? I mean, let's let's say they're going the hospital with Chrissy Teigen. Chrissy Teigen. Any of those guys, any of those folks that were out there, I didn't get an invite, but it doesn't matter. I wouldn't go. It may have been. You wouldn't go. It may have been. No, if they gave me an invite, I told you before I would have, I would have, why not would have to go flip the tent upside down? Or, or I would say, yeah, five of us is coming and not showing up. You can eat my brew shut up, my face. So sophisticated. We have more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Tommy John. So Tommy John is, they're already, we know this, they're the champion of like men's underwear and lounge wear. So they've decided to just compete with themselves because there's no one left to compete with, which means I feel like one of you men should be doing this particular stuff. I was thinking the same thing. We're talking about men's underwear. There's two guys who are, let me just tell you, they keep, it keeps you dryer. Don't want to know the details on that when you're not wearing Tommy John. All right. And up to seven degrees cooler than the regular cotton underwear. But what I would like to talk about is the lounge wear that they have because they do, because they do have that for women as well. And I've gotten into a really bad habit. Well, like, I think it's a good habit personally. My husband doesn't love it because I, when I get home, I don't like to process anything at home until I have gotten into my Tommy John lounge wear, because it is literally the softest clothing I have ever put on my body, or will ever put on my body. And I just can't deal with the stress until I put my Tommy John lounge wear on. On your body? Sarah, I'm sorry, but I gotta go. Yeah, I can't help this. I gotta go. Tommy John should have a slogan, you know, for the men who have something down there, we can call you down because there's not many men today. There's something down there anymore. Okay. For the dudes with balls still, Tommy John's got you covered and ladies, they've got you covered as well. I am telling you guys, and my husband didn't believe me. And then he got, I got him some and he put them on and he was like, holy crap, this is the most comfortable set of underwear I have ever worn. So it's not, it's not an exaggeration. I'm just saying this is why it takes forever for Stephen and Sarah to text me back. They're lounging. They're lounging. They're lounging. Very sophisticated. With our Tommy John right now, get 20% off your first order at TommyJohn.com slash Y that is 20% off right now only at Tommy John dot com slash Y you're gonna thank me later Tommy John dot com slash Y. Now while we are on the subject of Dr. Fauci, let me just, let me just give you a few other tidbits about what this crazy narcissistic evil man has had to say. So he is actually saying that Americans should expect a quote flood of vaccine mandates once the vaccines receive full FDA approval. He said organizations, enterprises, universities, colleges that have been reluctant to mandate at the local level will feel much more confident. They can say if you want to come to this college or this university, you've got to get vaccinated. If you want to work in this plant, you have to get vaccinated. If you want to work in this enterprise, you've got to get vaccinated. Bob Bob Bob Bob, blah blah blah blah blah. And here's one problem with that. Okay. So, and I need you guys to help me figure this out all across the country. We've been not, not just the country, I'm sorry, all across the world we have been seeing all of these bizarre cases where being vaccinated does not actually protect you. Here is one chart from Dallas County here in our neck of the woods. It says Dallas County tracks hospitalizations and deaths for patients with vaccine breakthrough infections using this data to compare vaccine versus unvaxed outcomes. We see that the case hospitalization rate is 75% higher among the breakthrough infection group and the CFR is the same in both groups. So you have a larger, much larger hospitalization rate for the vaccinated people. At what point do we stop calling these breakthrough infections and just say the vaccine don't work? Well, not only does it not work, people don't understand. We're going to say trust the science, trust true science in history, in history. You cannot eliminate a respiratory virus. Right. It is not going to be eradicated. Ever, ever has never happened. And even like the flu, when you get the flu shot, if you remember, you get pretty dang sick, right? What happens is with this vaccine, you take the vaccine, it lowers your immune system. It breaks it down. Now you're contracting COVID while under the vaccine, 75% is not breakthrough. It's now the norm. Now you can almost say, it's the norm. You get the vaccine, you're going to get COVID and it's going to come back with vengeance. But then there's a and then they're going to then mandate super spread, right? And and mandate that you get a vaccine that we are seeing in real time data. I mean, you cannot get more scientific than all of the data that we've seen from these hospitals that it doesn't. It's not preventing people from going to the hospital or getting sick or spreading it. But the answer somehow is just to make everyone get it. It's not you don't, it's not your duty to get a vaccine. You don't owe anybody, right? Anything. That is that is that is a tyrannical thought. That is not freedom thought. You don't owe anybody anything. It's not your duty to do it. And inevitably you have somebody that'll stand up and say, well, you've just never lost anyone or had them seriously ill to COVID. Well, look, if it's that prevalent and that deadly and it's truly a pandemic, then surely all of us have lost someone, right? Or know someone. And basically, we do. Yes. Most of us do know some people who have died from COVID complications. Yes. So to continually push this and say this and then use this, oh, this, you know, worst-case, emotional, empathetic example, well, you just can't understand what it's like. In fact, no, what we're trying to do is we're trying to say you're doing this to the detriment of your own health. You know, somebody said to me the other day, well, I just, why are you making fun of that? I'm not making fun of it. You could get the choice to do what you want to do. I got the vaccine because I had a transplant. Well, I can't imagine getting a organ transplant and then pumping some unknown toxin into my body that I have no idea what it's going to do. So in essence, unpacking what Fauci said, they're saying, we've gone all the way from 14 days to flatten the curve to now once the FDA approves it, you can't stop us. We're going to make sure you get it. That's it. But it's by pressure, right? So force fraud coercion, that's by pressure, because the president himself said, well, we're looking into it and he's asking the CDC to look into it. Is there a legal way to mandate federal? No, there's not. You can't do this. So now they're just going to go to your Disney's who's already caved, your Netflix's and all these companies and say, Hey, you work with us, you work here, you do business with us, you sell us goods. We're not going to buy you goods. And then this is this is this is a surgery. You need a surgery? Well, I can't do that. I actually have seen reports of people who have had to, they were having to show vaccine paperwork in order to get into the hospital. What happens if you get into an accident and you need a blood transfusion? And now they're putting, they're going to stop, they're going to stop surfing. But this is what they want. They are the ones who pick winners and losers and ultimately I actually think let's flip the script. They know this vaccine is hurting people. They know this vaccine makes you a super contractor of the virus because they know they know the real data. Okay, I actually believe this is the game plan. This is the Marxist game plan of calling society. This is it. Why else would Cuomo throw the old people in the old age home and kill off how many people mean they know they understand. So this is the game plan. So I just say, say no, you're in the corner. This is it wake up America. You're in the corner time to fight back time to bite. All right, let me let me switch to something else before we go to break. Let me I do have the future governor here of Texas. So I just want to get your thoughts. Governor on the Texas Democrats who of course fled the state to avoid voting on this election reform bill. They have now filed a lawsuit claiming that their rights have been violated. They say that they they say that the people what date fell in and James White embarked upon a course of conduct which intended to violate state and federal constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and the classes of the citizens they represent by denying rights under the first fifth and 14th amendments to the US Constitution. And they are being violated because of race because you can't make this up because since some of them are quote either black or white. Wow. What you come on, man. You're not. It's it. It's it. I'm making it. They flushed the Constitution down the toilet. They flushed your rights down the toilet. They told you if you're white, you're evil. Now that the shoes on the other foot now all of a sudden it's it doesn't make this a race of black or less than certain plaintiffs are distinguishable based upon the melanin in their skin. Okay. And certain plaintiffs are descendants of persons born in other countries. Well, I'll say, you know, as a future governor, this race really gets you a long ways. I mean, it really does. You can go a long way with the race stuff, man. You played a car. You get a lot of stuff. There we go. So Dave feeling is a joke as the speaker of the house. And he basically he tweeted it out. He said, look, if you feel like this was representing your constituents in your area in your district, well, then we're not going to penalize you once you come back. So I put in a kid in timeout and given him the time to strategize about the next round of crap they're going to do to you. And that's exactly what Greg Abbott did with these house Democrats exactly what Dave feeling the rest of them did. They gave him carte blanche, freedom and liberty to the point of even them requesting care packages. Two of them that tested positive for COVID went from Washington, DC on vacation to Portugal. So this is a circus. The monkeys are running it. And I would already be in jail for my actions. I would already be in a lawsuit if I were the governor of Texas before what I would have done to those people. I'm on record saying that I would have changed that I would have personally changed the locks on the doors in the office. I would have taken their chairs off the house floor. I would set them on fire in the front yard of the Capitol. I would have fired their staff. I would have made sure that they I would have done it out of mandated they can never hold office in Texas again. You we would pass that bill. There is a bill right now that's that's being proposed that if you vacate your seat for 14 days, then boom, you it's vacant. It's gone. It's vacant. You've done you're out. So these are the kind of things. This is a joke. This is this is the children running the preschool is what this is. Absolutely. And they're running all over like a bunch of toddlers, spold brats. And now they're going to play the race card because let's face it. The race card always works just like Greg Abbott swung and missed on this executive order two weeks ago where he said that you if you if you're transporting illegals in the car, then we have the right to pull them over and to see if they're illegals or not. And they said, that's you know, Merrick Garland, the Department of Justice said, can't do that. That's wrong. It's unlawful. It's dangerous because you're now targeting and profiling Latinos. And what did he do? He backed off the thing. Oops. Sorry. You played the race card. Okay, you played the race card. I'm so sorry. I didn't want to think about the melon and in their skin. Thank you, sir. May I have another please? Yeah. I mean, you know, I didn't really have a point now where it doesn't matter. Everything is the race card. Okay. So you're racist. Who do you do? Who cares anymore? My God. They're going to call you racist. They're going to call you racist no matter what. You might as well do the right thing. You might as well have enough balls to warn you by Tommy John's. All right. We've got more to come. First, we want to thank our sponsor, uprising food. Okay, so I started talking with uprising food. I don't know, last month and they like you guys all know I'm I'm the health nut of the studio. So I do keto, I do low carb, I lost 100 pounds, like I'm very into nutrition and I could not be more obsessed with this company. They have cracked the code on healthy bread, right? Because Americans don't like we're going to eat bread. We're going to incorporate it into our diet, but it's not good for us. So they have actually made this bread. They've got these artisan chefs, our artisan bakers that have cracked the code on making healthy bread taste amazing. And it really does. It's two net carbs per serving, six grams of protein, nine grams of fiber. It tastes like just this homemade bread heaven. I eat it because I can on keto and I'm like, I can't believe I'm eating real bread again. It tastes delicious. They've got these chips that you can get that are they're made with real superfood ingredients. And by the way, you'll find things like almonds, MCT oil, apple cider vinegar, egg white, psyllium husk, olive oil, it's all really, really good clean ingredients. But most importantly, it tastes really good. Okay. I'm telling you, you've got to try them, especially for those of you who maybe are still trying to get off some COVID weight. This is the way to do it. This tastes delicious and it is good for you. It is going to change your whole mind about what eating healthy is like. You got to go to uprisingfood.com. Use code Y, that's WHY. You will get $10 off of the starter bundle. I am telling you, you are not going to regret it. You got to go to uprisingfood.com promo code Y. So we've been on the topic of science, right? And what? Yeah, like science, data, truth, untruth. So I just want to try and figure this one out using science maybe. So there are female prisoners and women's advocacy groups who pled with the state of California, not to implement a new pro-transgender law that would force state prisons to accept biological males, you know, the ones who identify as a transgender woman, right? Good reason. Gavin Newsom, what are you, a transphobe? I'm just telling you, I'm a person of truth. You want to see some beatings happening in that jail? Please, I don't know what you're talking about, Yaaku, okay? Because Gavin Newsom did it anyway. And now it's very interesting because apparently one of the state's major women's prisons now has at least one pregnant inmate who was just impregnated by one of the... Is her name Mary? Is it Immaculate? I don't think so. Not Immaculate. I don't think so. How? This is Gavin Newsom. Here he goes. Now he's going to run six trafficking operations inside the prison system. That's what he's going to do. And we're going to produce these babies that they can unregistered babies that they can do what the experiments on and what was this. That's dark, man. No, I'm telling you, this guy has no bounds. I'm coming for you Newsom. Like white on rice. We're going to hunt you down like a hall. Like white on rice on a sheep and a snowstorm on a paper plate, baby. Coming at you. He looks like he could like play the devil on TV, right? He really does. He's really creepy. He's married to Kim Guilfel. Blows my mind every time I hear it. Have you looked at the policies this guy has volunteered it? I mean, no one is worse for children or women than this guy. And let me just say, the state has a... This just went into effect in January, this new law, and the state has already received 300 requests for transfer and none of the requests have been denied. So we've just got that going for us. Yeah, it's Newsom. How did that work? If transgender women are women, but it's all woman prison. How did he... What happened? Oh, it was something that somebody put a wig on the rooster. I got it now. I'm comfortable, but I can't show. You got it. I mean, I just... I don't understand how far... You got to before the end of the show at least. How far do we have to go before women finally stand up and say, I'm tired of being erased. I don't accept it anymore. It's bizarre to me. I cannot understand why women are not in an uproar saying, oh, so you think it's easy to be a woman? Excuse me? No, you can't. Sorry, move over, buster. Not that easy to be a mom. Mom, not that easy to be a woman. Listen, if you guys want to take over the child bearing, I say again, the population of the world will be about two and a half million. Show me your uterus. If you don't have one, move over. Go to the urinal, stand and pee. The urinal in the men's prison. In the men's prison. I mean, we're just... It's like it's gotten... You're going to see an exponential rise in the objectification, the exploitation, the abuse of women you're going to because women by design have a role. Men by design have a role. That doesn't mean one can't do one thing better than the other. One might not do... You know, there's a place by an large... There is a place. Women are designed by and large to be protected, to be honored, to be cherished, to be cared for. And if you stop doing that, you leave them susceptible to... That's why these trans women that are in the wrestling matches with biological women and they're cracking their skulls. You don't see it the other way around. You don't see trans men fighting biological men. You don't see any of this stuff. Yeah. It's just... Except that... Well, except that the transgender weight lifter who like just totally... And if you are a transgender athlete, I will always pull against you. I want to watch you lose. Nothing's always... Always. I'm watching you lose. Look, I'll just say this. If you cannot defend and protect women, you are scum. Scum. Scum of the earth. The lowest of the low. And I'm telling you, Newsome himself hurts children and women every single day. On that note, we got to take a break. We'll be right. Hey, before we go, don't forget to make sure that you are subscribed to the Chad Parather Show YouTube.

I just had enough. And I mean, it was very visceral. Very good. But there's a language warning there. But I still think God blessed it because the message is strong. And the message is true right there, Yaku. And Facebook immediately pulled it down. Of course. A million views on his screen. Wow. It needs to be said. It needs to be said. It needs to be said. It needs to be said. It's about truth. And thank you for speaking truth. And look, when there's passion and there's purpose behind it, then people need to take it for the way it falls, brother. Yeah.
