Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show, you have made it to Friday and we are going to hopefully make this Friday afternoon or morning on the West Coast for you. Roll as fast as we possibly can, entertain you, hopefully make you a little bit smarter along the way. Today we've got a couple of fantastic guests coming Ian Miller, who is one of the foremost national analysts of the futility of masks. He wrote a book about it, he is incredible on social media, sharing his graphs. We'll also talk with Stephen Miller from the Trump administration about all of the issues that have taken place on the border, 130 and 230 for both of those guests. Anthony Fauci has come out of his hidden subterranean banker to question how dare the courts in any way raise issue with CDC guidelines. We will discuss that. But as we predicted yesterday, Buck, the number one story I would say that is captivating many people in the world of politics and news is the battle that is now emerged between Ron DeSantis and Disney. Disney, Disney World in particular. We brought you the news live in the past couple of days about the Florida Senate and the Florida House passing a bill that would end special treatment for Disney at its Disney World Complex. If you've ever been there and I'm sure a ton of you have many hotels for different amusement parks, a couple of different water parks, 40 square miles, I believe is the amount of land. That is included there. Basically Disney was given carte blanche by Florida in 19 in the late 1960s as they were building Disney World to control all zoning related issues. They could basically do what they wanted in terms of building on this property. Now, what I think is really interesting, Buck is to me, this is a important cultural signpost of the Republican Party being willing to punch back. Against what corporations, all of this conflict has arisen based on the parental rights and education bill that allows kindergarten, first, second and third graders not to be taught about gender identity and crazy story sex related such as those. Now, what I think is also significant, Buck is all this does because there's immediately been a tax, right? I was on America reports a little bit earlier on Fox News. Joe Biden has come out and said, oh, this is unacceptable and it's been criticized as socialism. DeSantis has fired back. But all this really does is put Disney back on an even playing field in the state of Florida. It eliminates the special treatment that they had received that SeaWorld, Universal Studios, Lego Land, other Florida based theme parks do not enjoy. And it eliminates the privilege. If anything, what is kind of fascinating about this is it's kind of brilliant because theoretically it could lead to Disney having to pay more in taxes and being treated more equally as a corporation compared to everyone else. But big picture, it is evidence that at least in Florida, they're not going to be bullied by corporations bending to a woke ideology. What stands out to you, Buck, as this conversation continues to grow? It's all about changing the incentive structure. It changes the incentive structure because right now, if you're a woke corporation at the top, or if you're just a corporation terrified of the wokeness, you think that it is not only a real person. You think that it is not only the safer bet. You think it is advantageous generally in the atmosphere up until very recently to push as far left as you can and to show that half the country doesn't matter to you. You think they're gross. You think that they are bigoted or not progressive enough or whatever, right? That had been the calculation that we see from every major tech corporation, a lot of the places where you go to everything from buying your buying books on Amazon, which I know people buy everything from Amazon buying shoes from Nike, watching cartoons from Disney. You get on the list. Wokeness is all over the corporate sphere. This is the first time that all of a sudden they might stop and think, hold on a minute. Maybe there could be a counterbalance here. Maybe it's not a good idea to decide to remember Disney explicitly waited on politics here. This wasn't even just about Disney's content, which I think is important forever. Remember, Disney's content became a focus of this once the wokeness came out and they all of a sudden were telling people that they don't say gay bill. And by the way, what a remarkable act of propaganda to, you know, imagine if all of the media ran around calling, you know, calling the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare people do call it that, but even Obama liked that. And that was something Democrats adopted. But imagine the 90% of media were calling Obamacare the Marxist Health Care, you know, destruction act. And that was how it was referred to one matters on every single screen, every news headline. Oh, I don't know why people are so in favor of this Marxist Health Care Destruction Act. Of course, that would have seemed Orwellian. That would have seemed like we're in some kind of a, that is exactly what they did with the don't say the parental rights and education law. I got to start saying law, by the way, too, because I signed into law. But so there's a change in the calculation. And I think the left is also realizing that there's a change in public sentiment about the issue specifically of children and what they're, what they're learning in schools. Chris Rufo, I know you follow him to clay. He's doing amazing, doing amazing work. He's kind of, he was kind of Libs of TikTok before there was a Libs of TikTok because what he does is find the instruction material that is out there in corporate diversity and inclusion seminars in LGBTQ plus training for toddlers. He finds the actual source documents. He brings the receipts and he shares them. And just yesterday he had this one, the Evanston Skokie School District. So Skokie, Illinois, right, has adopted a radical gender curriculum that encourages pre kindergarten students to celebrate the transgender flag, break the gender binary established by white colonizers, and experiment with neo pronouns such as z, zer, and tree. In pre kindergarten, the children are taught an introduction to the rainbow and transgender flags. Teachers then provide the basic concepts of gender identity, explaining we call people with more than one gender or no gender non binary or queer. For nursery school kids clay. Yeah, it's for kindergarteners. He's got the training manuals, right? And Disney went on board with them. Sorry. No, I'm just saying this is where I take my I'm a radio host, but I think the most important job I have is I'm a dad. And I cannot imagine if one of my kids came home with instruction like that at public school. Look, if you want to put and I don't agree with it, but if you want to put your kid in some sort of far left wing in doctrinaire school, that's private school. I don't agree with it, but I think you should have the right to make decisions as your own kids when it comes to their education. The idea that this would be occurring in public schools is is crazy. And I think this is evidence buck of why you don't even notice how Democrats don't really even know how to respond to this. We played the Jen Psaki audio the other day where she gave an example of how this could be a big issue and then said, but it's not an issue at all in schools. No, this is real. This is not made up. This is not some artificial aspect out there for everybody who's listening to us who has kids or grandkids. Your kids in many schools are being taught that America is an awful place that there's that they're not even boys or girls. I mean, these are radical revolutionary outlandish and unacceptable things for public schools to be teaching. Mr. Rufo goes on here, by the way, and this is all off of his Twitter account. And he's got the screenshots of this stuff. So you have the primary source documents in kindergarten. The teachers explain when we show whether we kindergarten, everybody, but Clay, do you remember anything in kindergarten? I mean, we were really young kindergarten. I remember I had Miss Rich and we had that year a brand new rug with the ABCs on it. And we had to take a nap and I could never fall asleep during the nap. Those are kind of the basics of what I remember from kindergarten. Well, there we go. Well, if you're in the Skokie Evanston School District, again, this is for everyone listening to this, wherever you are all across the country, this has infiltrated the schools. And you brought up private schools, by the way, Clay, and a lot of private schools. I know this from New York City, a lot of Catholic schools, Catholic schools too, which is, I mean, it's amazing when you think about it, kind of stunning. They're teaching this stuff. In kindergarten, the teachers explain Rufo writes here, when we show whether we feel like a boy or a girl, or some of each, we are expressing our gender identity. There are also children who feel like a girl and a boy, or like neither a boy or a girl. We can call these children transgender. There is official teaching template instruction for kindergartners. Again, I'm pretty sure I went into kindergarten a few times and told my teacher I thought I was a Stegosaurus. You know, right? I mean, you would say whatever. You're a little, you're basically a baby. And they're teaching kids about a little bit of a boy, a little bit of a girl, your transgender. Do we think that this is a, that there's no correlation between this and the massive? I mean, I can't even tell what the percentages are, but it's up thousands of percentage points of children under 18 identifying as transclay. Are we to believe that the sudden emergence of all this teaching and doctrine, there were, there was all of this pre-existing trans situation going on with kids that was being suppressed until now, or was being taught to kids and they're essentially brainwashed now. Which one is it? There are studies, Buck, and this is what you're referring to that up to 20% of kids now are identifying as gay trans. And I had a conversation with a friend recently who has kids out in school in LA. And he was saying, this is crazy. The percentage of teenagers in this school in LA that are identifying as if they're boys, they think they're girls or if they're girls, they think they're boys, this is getting to becoming growing and growing. People think, oh, you always point out Buck, oh, this is a slippery slope argument. No, no, we're at the bottom of the slope. This is madness. And for public schools to be involved in this in any way, I don't know. And I think this is an interesting conversation too, Buck. Where does this lead? Like, what is the goal? You know, I honestly think that the left has finally jumped the shark. I think that they have finally reached a point and they're realizing this and Florida is in essence the battle that they have lost that is showing them, you know, this is their ideological stalingrad, if you will. Like, this is the huge fight that now is going to change the whole trajectory and going into this midterm election. I have never been somebody that is overly optimistic about GOP, you know, prospects. But I do think that if Republicans get serious and focus in on this, this could be an electoral annihilation, the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. Because I really do think this is just crazy and everyone realizes it. I think you're right. And this is a question that I started asking years ago. It is okay. Where does tolerance and inclusivity end? Right? Because if you say, okay, gay marriage is now the law of the land. I think Democrats, this is a good example of the progressive movement doesn't stop. This has been my argument all the time when people say, oh, do you want to change the name of the Cleveland Indians or the Florida State Seminoles or the Notre Dame fighting Irish? There's always got to be something new. And here's what happens, Buck. At some point, you get so far ahead with the progressive element of where the rest of the country is because you have to keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing. And I think they've reached that now with the transgender arguments because most people I hear, whatever, if you're an adult, make whatever choice you want. Although I think a lot of people who are adults end up regretting the choice that they're making as an adult. But the idea that you would be saying and arguing from the White House that we need to support gender reassignment surgery on 14 year olds or 15 year olds. I think that people are hearing this across the political landscape, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, and saying, this isn't just a bad argument. This is madness. This is a form of craziness. Just to be, and they say that it is standard of care. Just so everybody, I have asked MDs that I know who, of course, are terrified of ever getting caught up in the actual, because they're like, look, if they're going to deny that gender exists, what am I going to do? Right? What is an MD weighing in on this? You're just going to walk into the political buzz saw. But there are no long term studies. There are no serious long term looks at what does it mean when you take an 11 or 12 year old give them puberty blockers. How's that? How's that looking at 30? How's their health? How's their bone density? How's their fertility? By the way, all those things are dramatically worse and undermined and destroyed, actually. Like usually you're infertile. Yeah, I mean, that's the point. I mean, from a parent perspective, I mean, this is crazy stuff that we're talking about. And I think we have to talk about it because it's become so mainstream that Jen Psaki feels comfortable talking about it from the White House lecture. Come back on this in a second.

We're going to be diving a little bit more into the, I don't want to say joy riding in the wreckage of CNN Plus's hopes and dreams. But I would be remiss if I didn't say there was a little bit of Chardon Freud, a little bit of justice feeling here at the reality of what CNN has become and what has happened here. I heard that they're giving the good news, because the lower-level folks, I do have sympathy for people that are starting their careers. They're a production assistant or they're a producer or whatever. They're going to get, I think, nine months of severance is what I heard. That's pretty good, Buck. I've gotten laid off before in media. Didn't get six or nine months of severance. I've been at places where it was like, you know, a fire sale all hands on deck and, you know, you're just lucky if you got to walk out of there with your wallet in your pocket. So, you know, it can be rough. But Tucker had a lot last night, because I think he just really nailed this about Chris Wallace in particular. So we're mourning, as we told you a moment ago tonight, the involuntary retirement of Mike Wallace's son. Oh, who? No more lectures on TV. I guess it's pretty funny. Look, man, you know, when you're the son of one of the most famous broadcast news people of all time, and you never stop to think, maybe I'm really lucky, you make bad decisions. Well, how about Fox News? Like, letting Tucker kind of have some fun with that decision of Chris Wallace to leave, right? I mean, that's why I think Fox News is so popular is they try to be as honest as they possibly can with their audience. And when somebody throws up the peace sign and says, I don't want to be with you anymore because you're not trustworthy. And then they get wiped out. It's hard not to enjoy it. Yeah. And that is where we are. That's what we're dealing with right now is that fallout from everything associated with that collapse. But in the meantime, I've got to tell you all about the people at Black Rifle Coffee. And early on in your day, you may be struggling.

If you decide that you want to weigh in, we'll take some of your calls throughout the course of today's program. Buck, we've been having fun with CNN Plus, which closed yesterday. Or announced it was closing yesterday about an hour before we came on the air. $300 million up in smoke just totally burned out. And do you know, this is according to Bobby Barak, who writes it out, kick. And by the way, 24-year-old kid doing phenomenal work. And if you at all are interested in somebody who is sane in an insane world, he does a really good job covering media. He just wrote this at Outkick. I'm reading from his article, according to two individuals with knowledge. Top CNN officials recently met with Keith Oberman about a role at CNN. But can you think of a more, this is just kind of a fun parlor game. I'll let everybody else out there also weigh in. You can find us on Twitter and whatnot. Can you think of a worse hire for CNN to make than Keith Oberman in terms of trying to rebuild legitimacy and trust in their brand? I'm not sure that I can think of anyone in media that would be a dumber hire, which probably means CNN's going to do it. I mean, they did hire Elliot Spitzer after all that stuff happened. So they- Well, they still got Jeffrey Tubin. That's true. That's true. They will make some pretty outrageous decisions. So it's not at all surprising. I do remember at the time, the rumor was that it was actually MSNBC employees who were revolting at the thought of bringing Oberman back there. But he's no longer a person. Look, when you're the tent pole, the media term for the big name, the 8 PM, who brings a lot of viewers and then that holds it up for everybody else. When you're the tent pole at MSNBC, that is something that is influence, right? That is a person that is in the national conversation. I think Oberman shows you where- and I really mean this- where leftism takes you, being bitter, nasty, unfulfilled, and just stroking cats that look like they belong to a bond villain. You know, like I think that's maybe even the hairless cat, you know, but I think that's where it is. I just- I can't think of a dumber move by them. By the way, speaking of the opposite of this, we should have mentioned this yesterday. I didn't realize it. Do you know that Sean Hannity has now been on air 25 years at Fox News, and that is the longest running cable news host in the- I don't know that anybody will ever beat that number, because it's so hard to get to, you know, five years of doing a successful show. He hit 25 years yesterday. It's a new all-time high in terms of length of time that somebody's been on cable news. That's amazing. I was a sophomore in high school. 25- Yeah, so when he started, I was in- You were like, you know, post grad studies, you know, 25 years ago. I mean, I was just- I saw that yesterday, and I was thinking, I don't even know who you would point to now. Matt out tapped out after a few years. She's not doing a nightly show anymore. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, Rush went over 30 years on radio, but that longevity is pretty impressive. And then you look at kind of- We're talking about how crazy Keith Oberman is, but some of these people, they truly get driven insane. I legitimately believe that Keith Oberman is insane now. Like, that's not even hyperbole for me. I think that he has lost his marbles. I think that he is almost unable to think rationally as an adult. Yeah, I think when your entire life just becomes your brand and self-obsession, you lose touch with a lot of things that make us all normal and people able to understand and connect with others on a level beyond. What are my ratings? By the way, Jimmy Fallon actually had- Yeah, I saw this. I saw this. Pretty funny. Jimmy, of the late night comedians, correct me if you think is wrong. I don't watch that stuff, so I only see clips, right? I'll see clips here and there. Jimmy Fallon has never struck me as mean-spirited in the jokes. You know, he may be a liberal, but I haven't seen nasty jokes from him compared to the way I have from the, like, Colbert and- Colbert, by the way, you see he had COVID. I don't think we mentioned it, but thanks to the fact that he is double-boosted and double-vaxxed. He's grateful. He said- This is his official statement. He's grateful to be vaxxed and boosted. You must genuflect to Fauci, the high priest of COVIDianism. But here is Jimmy. By the way, is my assessment of Fallon right, would you say? I think Jimmy Fallon has always seemed to me, and he really got dragged, I think, in a way that the other guys didn't, because he's just very light-hearted and effervescent. I think that's a good light. He's like he's trying to do comedy and make people feel a little bit lighter better at the end of their day. I mean, you know- And, you know, like, when he did that interview with Donald Trump, and he rubbed his hair. He rubbed his hair. And everybody was furious at him, and then Colbert had some success, and everybody just decided, oh, we have to go into that political space. I think he fits in it really poorly. Here is Fallon, by the way, with a joke at CNN. CNN- That's right. If you haven't heard today, it was announced that the streaming service, CNN Plus, is shutting down just 32 days after it launched. That's right, CNN Plus is gone, which means in six months it'll be turned into a spirit Halloween Plus. 32 days, oh my God, I have had avocados that last longer than that. Yeah, it was doing so badly. All they had to do was call their one subscriber like, hey, Doug, we're not going to do this. That's pretty amazing. I would also say it is the case that Zucker, who was ousted just a couple of months ago, this was his project, his vision. And he's a guy who just got very far by being in the right place at the right time on what was at the Today Show. And then they let him run CNN. CNN's brand is damaged, I think permanently, for anybody that cares about truth and objectivity. They became the anti-Trump network. It was obvious. And they became propaganda shills for the Democrat Party without any ballast, without any real attempt at a balance. And that comes with consequences. Apparently $300 million worth of them. It's the least, I mean, the biggest failure given time, because there's obviously been multi-year collapses that are worse. But I don't think $300 million in the history of media has ever been wasted more rapidly than what we saw with CNN Plus. I can't think of anything that comes that comes close. Here's Axios' media reporter on the collapse of CNN. There was this mover effort to stake a claim over CNN's future post-merger. There was a fear that if they didn't launch this, then the future of CNN's digital strategy would belong to discovery and not the folks at CNN. There was also this weird question of what do you do about the 700 people you hired? If you hire them to create all this content, to create a service, and never even launches, it's a massive morale problem internally anytime they try to do something moving forward. So I definitely agree with you that there were some politics involved, and then there was also just some concerns about how to just look politically with employees. Meanwhile up on CNN, right? I mean, that pretty much says that this whole thing is a collapse. It's crazy. I mean, and CNN, look, it's a really a caretaker role for both the hosts, for the man. You know, it's a, a non-standard channel to face that tragedy, and to deal with MLS, so you're there's some discussion. And even people can't disclose what the virus could go up could go down could be in the middle not too hot to warm yet this reminds me of remember you will certainly remember it as you were in the cia but when we were gonna get the color alerts for how dangerous terror attacks were it was not one of the best administrations better moments i will say that was not as i was not still does that still exist i don't even know if the color is around like it's an orange day yet what am i supposed to do yet what do you want me to do or a day yet more because the thing people say well it's for government readiness are i will then have it be like a government internal memo but we don't need i don't need to be all worried about my orange day look at the public hysteria over masks you think it's it's definitely not helpful to everybody you know any any reason why i bring it up is hopefully this cdc platform is going to go that way right i can already in my head see like the are people gonna care next year about the cdc's analysis of uh... of viral uh... viral threats especially because they get everything wrong anyway they're they're like economists buck they're good at telling you what's going to happen after it's already happened they can be like well this is what and even then they're still kind of making it up but the data they can use but they almost never get things right in advance i would say one bit of happiness for everybody so cnn plus lasted a month philadelphia's mass mandate lasted for day is really funny to go with what i've covered they put the mass on bucket it just went away immediately yeah come back to the second look my friends the time of the tower's foundation broke ground on its do good village in land a lakes florida just outside of Tampa it's the

mask mandate last so whole four days and they drop it pretty openly they're just saying it's because of non-compliance which i gotta say city of brotherly love uh... good stuff well done people just saying this is so dumb we're not going to do this i think that filly therefore is not quite as far down the fauci brainwashing scale as new york is certainly uh... not as far down will see as los angeles is because on the same twenty four hours or in the same twenty four hours or so where filly drops a mask mandate after four days because everyone's basically saying you know i i know what the bro with the bronx salut is i don't know if he has the equivalent of uh... what double you know you one finger extended in the general direction of the city's probably similar probably similar i think filly and the brox probably have similar uh... gestures and they've said this basically you know leave us alone in loss it that's one way of putting it in los angeles however clay they have gone to transportation mask mandate for all of you know for all their whatever i don't know what mass transit people take in l-a but the point is which is what yeah i've never had by the way that's a great point i spent a ton of time in l-a i've hardly ever seen anybody take the mass transit there is a there is a train that drop in Santa Monica i've seen it yet but you guys by the way still have to in new york city also do this right like there's uh... we talked about this a little bit the complicating factors of what would happen for instance if you're in l-a right now you have to wear a mask in l-a-x and then you can take off your mask in theory although i don't know how they're enforcing it when you get on the airplane and actually taxi to take off yeah i think that's true uh... producer producer alley does uh... that she was a bit uh... how many matter there are a lot of masks on the subway would you say was it yet all while she says everyone the subway pretty much masked up what what level we talking about all and people are getting aggressive about it their anxiety disorder is is coming out on the new york city subway system because he but i think here's the problem they realize cops don't want to enforce this stuff like what do you really that the reason airlines got away with being such tyrannical lunatics on this is that there's a very defined power they have right yes someone kicks you off a subway car guess what you're gonna just get on the next one you're gonna hop in a cab or whatever right like you're a great deal you don't have to show that that you know they don't have a full list of who's going on the subway on a day-to-day is where as for airlines they really can ban you for for life pretty easy you're risking whatever it is three dollars now for us as a subway you know i was just a subway token my god that's been a long time since we've had those but on your metro card uh... whereas on you know a thousand dollar airfare to go from you know new york to paris and your booty because you don't want a mask above your nose that's pretty that's pretty powerful that's why they get away with it it's also to me think about this super weird let's say you're in laguardia or you're in jf k or you're in l a x these are three of the biggest and busiest airports in the country who's enforcing the city directive on masks the tsa isn't requiring it right the tsa are federal employees so does that mean they just have random people who are walking around inside of the airport in conduction the conductors uh... the conductors are sort of like an amtracked train right where there are conductors so the mta would have their own the other and the airport to where those people all there's the port authority which is also a city a city authority that has its own police force that uh... and so those are the people that would be a radical yes the enforcing it they could they would probably think like who would be walking around because that's a big deal if you're in new york rl a given how big those airports are that there's just some random authority because not the tsa any more it's certainly not the airline agents so they just have a random third party now i guess it could be cops i guess it could be security at the airport i also think that we're seeing what the uh... what the by-administration play is here because remember they had the judge the amazing wonderful the talent is my job is that really in judge my cell down in florida federal judge who struck a an enormous blow for freedom uh... and the by administration was thinking well to your point play do we want the politics of this where we push for the mandate to come back to really want to be those you know on that side of it right now and it seems that what they're going to do is challenge but challenge because remember she only she only got rid of masks until may third when it was set to expire anyway so the by administration wants to have it expire on their terms it seems to me if they challenged they want to get the authority back but they won't necessarily use the authority starting may third here is senior white house adviser uh... doctor as she's joss saying just that public health decisions like this should be made by public health scientists and cdc admitted decision that mass were useful and was deeply disappointed to see a federal judge uh... step in and and uh... and take that decision away from public health scientists the appeal no question will a major goal of the appeal is to make sure that the cdc has the authority and the ability to protect americans uh... during health crises like this and whether that is used now or is used later or in a future pandemic it's essential that the cdc be able to retain this ability uh... to do things that are in keep american safe well this is why buck i think it's been so such a bad decision to appeal because right now it's just one federal district court judge who doesn't have necessarily a great deal of authority the eleventh circuit has a lot of conservative judges on it it wouldn't surprise me at all if they uphold the decision that she made and then it would go to the supreme court in other words the cdc if it's just a district court judge can still argue they have the authority if the supreme court tells them they don't then they're really screwed if the eleventh circuit tells them they don't then they're really screwed they're in a tough spot here a bad spot but i think it's interesting that they just want the power to mask you all up across the country everybody listening every time you get a plane they want to be able to snap their fingers and snap those masks back on your faces on planes trains etc they want the power friends they're actually saying it out loud even scarier buck are they doing this because they want the power to change elections in twenty twenty two again that's my concern and that coming up here play Travis and bucks
