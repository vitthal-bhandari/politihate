    "text": " The great Andrew Breitbart told us that politics is downstream of culture and of course he was right in a sense. Pop culture has dictated plenty of political transformations over the years from public opinions on socialism to redefining marriage. But politics affects culture too. As a banana duct tape tool wall sells for $120,000 at Art Basel as drag queen story hour hits preschools and as kids get hooked on hardcore internet porn before the age of 10 Libertarians beware we examine whether politics can help fix our screwed up culture too. Then speaking of bad politics and creepy sex disgraced former congressman katie hill publishes an op-ed in the shameless New York Times Which we will analyze as the dumbest article on the internet today all that and more on Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show All right, welcome to our new set we've been waiting for our new set for about 55 years now, I think we are on it very exciting. That's the good news here There's a lot of good news in washington at the white house bad news on the capitol for democrats And all of this actually tells us a little bit about our culture the impeachment hearings the way that's going actually does relate to $120,000 bananas and drag queen story hour and internet porn we will figure out how in a second first we just have to Mention the the really great news for the white house because obviously no one else is going to do that at CNN or MSNBC or increasingly even on ostensibly right wing sources so last week's impeachment hearings train wreck right don't believe the spin from the washington poster anybody else an Absolute disaster for democrats the impeachment inquiry hearings didn't come up with any evidence that trump committed wrongdoing Then you had those three awful professors one was less likeable than the next and the only one who had any sense was jonathan tearly Who's actually a liberal law professor though? He was called by the republicans And he pointed out in a really calm Aerudite ironclad way that the democrats don't have nothing on president trump You don't need to take my word for that. You don't need to just Accept and say all michael is putting spin on this for the president. It isn't just me even jake tapper even cnn believes that last week's Impeachment hearings were a train wreck tapper is now asking nancy Pelosi if she's afraid that she ended up helping trump With the impeachment she is asking if she will regret the impeachment process If the impeachment process ends up helping trump it looks right now like it will help trump and what is nancy Pelosi gonna say? She's not going to say yeah, you're right chuck we made a huge or yeah, you're right Whatever his name is jake. We made a huge mistake. We never should have initiated the impeachment hearings No, she's not gonna do that. She's gonna double down but her response is just not believable If you wake up the day after election day 2020 And exit poll show that impeaching president trump helped him get reelected. Would you have any regrets? No other said this isn't about politics at all. This is about patriotism. It's not about partisanship It's about honoring our oath of office This is the first president has committed all of these things as the constitutional experts said yesterday nobody ever even come close not richard nixon even came close to his Dishonoring his own oath of office. So no, this isn't a politics is not even a consideration in this. This is about Protect and defend the constitution You know it is actually impressive that somebody could tell such an obvious and egregious lie As the impeachment of donald trump has nothing to do with politics The impeachment that we've been pushing for for now four different reasons The first three of which failed and the fourth is probably gonna fail to since before he even took office yet has nothing to do with politics It is impressive that someone could be in politics so long to become so cynical to be able to tell an Absolutely egregious lie with a straight face, but you can see even in the way polosi is talking She stammers a little bit. She holds up. She's even for her and she is so past shame on this it's A little difficult to get it out. She says well look, uh, jake this has nothing to do with politics This is about how he's so he's so much worse than nixon It the implicit question here is how is he worse than nixon? What did he do? She never gives an answer in in all of the things that he did You know from the first thing to that other the thing he did after that and then finally the third thing I was almost worse than the first two Uh, well, how about you name them nancy except you can't because all of the charges that you've made treason bribery extortion This have been completely knocked down. There's no no evidence of it whatsoever. She might as well go back to russia collusion We had a two and a half year 30 million dollar investigation into that came up with nothing but go back at least that at least that one Has a specific charge. This is what bribery how is how is what he did? Bribe they got nothing right so nancy polosi does her best to stammer through this Representative al green one of my favorite members of congress this democrat who just he keeps saying the things that they're not supposed to be saying Like al green said at the very beginning of trump's I think it was just after he'd been elected but maybe not even before he was sworn in he said yeah We got to impeach this guy then it slightly after he got sworn in he says yeah, we got to impeach him Why I don't know we got to impeach him because if we don't impeach him he's gonna get reelected He just keeps being accidentally honest about the democrats plans al green knows that all of the current charges against the president are so vague so nebulous they're not real so al green has a new argument for impeachment The new argument is that we have to impeach trump to deal with slavery So I know that you introduced one of those first impeachable resolutions against trump and let's look at how that went down It actually lost 364 to 58 How do you think this process ends if more evidence is revealed and are you concerned at all that americans Are having a waning interest as this process drags on Well, it was yesterday in fact that we celebrated in a sense that we we had something that was brought to the floor I do believe uh man that we Have to deal with the original sin We have to deal with slavery Slavery was the thing that put all of what president trump has done lately Into motion until we deal with the issue of invidious discrimination as it relates to lgbtq community The anti-Semitism the racism the islamophobia the transphobia and also the massagini Uh that he has exemplified. I don't think our work is done. Oh Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So they don't have them on ukraine. They don't have him on russia They don't have him on taxes. They don't have him on stormy daniel So now we need to impeach trump because of slavery What what about the the other 44 presidents you're gonna impeach them over slavery? Nope just trump We need to wait We've had slavery in america We had slavery beginning in the 17th century And we had it up until the mid 19th century And then we didn't have it anymore after that and then we had to wait about 150 years And then we needed to impeach the 45th president to deal with slavery and that is such a ridiculous statement That he I think al green heard it in his head. So then he corrected it even during the statement. He said and also racism sexism misogyny homophobia transphobia Foba phoba phobia ism phobia ism. We need to impeach trump for phobia ism They can't nail him on any actual impeachable offense. So it's just all this vague neologisms Were new words that have been created for an ideological purpose all of which amount to Orange man bad now This is at the same time that trump got some pretty good at news on the political front this week And the good news on the political front is actually affecting the cultural front before we get to that I've got to thank our friends over at root insurance the thing about car insurance Is that good drivers? Subsidized bad drivers. That's just how it works The way it works is if you're a good driver you always use your turn signal. You're always paying attention doing a good job You are subsidizing bad drivers because the your the rates are going to go up for everybody when you can't figure out Who's the good driver? Who's the bad driver? Well, what if good drivers? Didn't have to pay for the bad drivers root insurance Things that the old way of pricing car insurance is unfair So they developed a mobile app that measures driving behavior. I really love it I love that they're bringing a new way of thinking to the car insurance market by by removing bad drivers from the equation roots saved good drivers Up to 52 in 2019 52 in 2019 root was the fastest growing direct insurance company in the u.s It is the world's first mobile first car insurance company They base their rates primarily on how you drive not on who you are right on how you're actually driving It's super cool root the root insurance card is available right from your phone If you get into an accident, you can file a claim directly from the app. It makes a whole lot of sense Very very simple. It's just look as technology evolves Sometimes certain industries get stuck in the old way of doing things and they don't take advantage of new technology Root is is innovating. They are leading the way all you have to do Download the root insurance app drive normally for a few weeks during the root test drive see how much you can save give root a try Go to the app store and download the root insurance app sign up in less than a minute to start your test drive today That is root again download the root app today Or visit joint root calm to learn more and see how much you can save root reserves the right to refuse to quote any individual premium rate for the insurance advertised here in savings based on national reviews supported by actual Customers form one not available in all states. This product is not available in california threats Okay, good news from president trump here Or from trump and for trump the good news is this jobs report what happened in the november jobs report You probably haven't read about it very many places 266,000 new jobs created Unemployment at a 49 year low 12 month wage growth is at 3.1 percent very very strong 54,000 manufacturing jobs created black and hispanic unemployment at or near record lows You couldn't ask for more good news Right pretty much every single box you could check everything is doing Great. This is great news and it really matters on the cultural front if politics Were merely downstream of culture Those numbers wouldn't matter Right because you wouldn't who cares about the the political events that's not going to shape the future The only thing that's going to shape the future is movies right if politics were merely downstream of culture But guess what putting food on the table is a cultural issue having a job at when your husband or your father or you know When when you have a job or when someone in your family has a job that creates dignity That makes you feel dignity that raises everybody up That is a cultural matter Those things those cultural changes in this case are coming by way of politics Just look at the black and and hispanic unemployment numbers, right? And then look at the black and hispanic approval ratings of president trump right now There there was a major poll that came out last week that emerson poll which showed that black support of president trump is 34 and a half percent Is that poll accurate? I don't know. I mean that's that's a very high number other polls have backed this up though npr Marist poll was showing the black and hispanic support of trump is pretty high Rasmussen poll showed the same thing That is strictly political Right and yet if those numbers hold Democrats are in huge trouble at the national level Democrats need to get about 90 percent of the black vote to maintain their electoral position If they lose that if republicans get 15 percent of the black vote Forget about 20 percent 25 percent 34 and a percent. It's over for the democrats If the democrats lose their stranglehold on black voters That's a big political problem for them, but that's a cultural Shift as well a huge cultural shift If you if you were to crack up this kind of racially homogenous voting among say black voters or to a lesser degree hispanic voters That is a major cultural shift that that speaks very well of our political process some libertarian-minded conservatives like to pretend that politics can never have a positive effect on culture, right? So what they do is they admit that politics affects the culture, but they'll say oh, it only destroys culture Politics can only destroy the culture. It can never fix the culture. That's obviously not true The trump administration has had a good effect on culture in many ways the ragan administration had a very good effect on culture in many ways A lot of people will tell you from the ragan era ragan defeated the soviet union amazing ragan fixed the economy amazing But one thing they'll tell you ronald ragan made us all feel good about ourselves again made us feel good to be americans that is a cultural Fact that is a morning in america as is as is ad famously said so once you grant that That politics can have a good effect on the culture once you grant that Then you've got to ask what is the role of politics in these social questions This has become a big point of contention specifically in regard to the internet porn debate, which we will get to I don't want to start with internet porn. I want to start with a hundred twenty thousand dollar banana But before we get to that I have got to speak about an intersection of politics and culture too Which is happening in the movie theaters and theaters right now nationwide You can go see no safe spaces Which if you look at the poster it says that it's starring Adam corolla and dennis preiger, but we know that that's not true We know that it's starring me because I am in the movie for about six seconds Adam and dennis take you on a wild ride in this movie to show you the effects of political correctness identity politics and cancel culture It takes you through the colleges. It shows you the impact on Obviously college campuses, but also big tech also in hollywood No safe spaces shows us why free speech is so important to a free society how it's being threatened what we can do to fight back This is not a typical documentary. Okay. It has animation. It has recreations It has a lot of adams just hilarious typical humor At which is really really great. We had adam come on the backstage show the other day and we you know It's like we couldn't even get a word out. We're laughing so much no safe spaces takes you behind the scenes on ben shapiro's riot filled drip To you see berkley jeremy boring the god king of the daily wire as a cameo and then of course you will find me in the film too It's really really great go check it out. I think you're you're absolutely going to love it My father saw it this weekend over in kinematicet. It's all over the country is rated pg 13 in theaters now Go to no safe spaces dot com slash knoll's knaw le s for ticket information and theater locations. You're really gonna love it All right. I Want to talk Before we get to internet porn. I want to talk about a banana duct tape tool wall because it matters an art basil this this art fair that happens all over the world this time in miami a banana duct taped to a wall sold as an art piece for 120 000 the italian artist marizio katalan took a banana Which will rot within a week duct taped it to a wall and then sold that art piece in quotes for a hundred $20,000 now there were three of these pieces the third banana Is is expected to sell for a hundred fifty thousand dollars and then here's my favorite part of it all right after it's sold a performance artist named david detuna ate the banana He ate the banana because he was hungry So some guy buys this banana duct tape to a wall for 120 000 dollars because he's an idiot And then david detuna eats his banana This shows us a major problem with our culture a culture that spends 120 000 on banana tape to walls A culture that considers a banana tape tool wall to be art has lost Its sense of the meaning of the word art. It has lost its sense of beauty It has lost its sense of what is good and what is true Another one of these a portrait apparently hyper realistic portrait. I'm not going to subject you to looking at it of chanting tatoms private area uh went up on ebay It sold for $6,600 This was done by an la artist contemporary art is terrible generally speaking without With very few exceptions is terrible the paintings the movies the plays the novels and the buildings Now politics is downstream of culture. Okay, but can politics play a role here? Of course it can I'm not saying we have to ban bananas taped to walls though. Maybe that wouldn't be a such a terrible idea But I don't think we have to do that But just think about the role of politics in art think about the buildings I was in grand central the other day. I was in new york grand central one of the most beautiful buildings in all of new york Maybe the most beautiful building in new york grand huge gorgeous It's it's made in the bose art style It's got beautiful intricate design and ornamentation and it's big and it's grand and it's central Compare that to the freedom tower The new world trade center building is ugly. It's an ugly building. It's nothing. What is it? It's nothing. It's a big glass Rectangle Cool great. Nothing permanent about it. Nothing enduring. Nothing beautiful. It's just a big box where people can do work The city is paying for as certainly for parts of both of these buildings and for maintenance and for security Compare the old pen station people don't remember this the old pen station in new york One of the most beautiful buildings in new york grand beautiful when you walked in there you felt like you were a king arriving Then there's a new pen station which has that monstrosity madison square garden on top of it When you walk in there you feel like you were rat scouring around underground Just trying to get to where you're going so you can run in your little treadmill for for long enough and then go back home And sit in your other tiny little box Those buildings or works of art. Okay, they're funded by the government. They really affect our lives We know that money affects our lives. Obviously we can buy things for our friends and family Beauty affects our lives too when you're in a beautiful place you feel better you feel more at ease you feel more contemplative You can raise your head up to hire cultural questions and ultimately to hire religious questions Imagine if the supreme court building in washington dc Imagine if that just looked like a regular office building like a modern late 20th century Just glass and steel and nothing nice about it. No ornamentation did a box That would affect the supreme court. It would affect our government There would be no sense of weight no seriousness. No history. No tradition to that building The government has to build public buildings It's it's not a libertarian question of does the government have to be involved. There should be no public buildings There should be no government should never interfere in any piece of architecture It does the government does that it has a role To play in the building of public buildings since it does The question we have to ask is what should conservatives ask from this and conservatives should ask the government To make beautiful buildings. We have a role. We want beauty. We Know that the government does affect the culture. We know that the politics does whether you want it to or not it does So we need to make sure that in so much as politics affects the culture. It's got to do it in a good way What else do we see a role for when it comes to politics in the culture a florida woman? Is in A modern relationship I'll call it. I'm not saying she's in a same-sex marriage. No, she's in a relationship With I guess it'd be called a quintuple. She's in a relationship Romantic relationship with four men. She's pregnant. She doesn't know who the the father is. That's modern. That's love is love That's to be celebrated. We'll get to that in a second first I've got to thank our friends over at rock auto rock auto dot com is a family business serving auto parts customers online for 20 years Go to rock auto dot com to shop for auto and body parts from hundreds of manufacturers Look, I know very little about cars other than I like them and I like to go fast in them This was about two three months ago. I broke down on the drive up from la to san francisco Now you go and you try to get the auto parts what's so weird about shopping for auto parts is you go to a store They don't have the part they just go online and they charge you a huge markup. You don't need to do that You can do it yourself. It's so easy to navigate Rock auto has everything from engine control modules and brake parts to tail lamps motor oil and even new carpet Whether it's for your classic or your daily driver get everything you need in a few easy clicks delivered directly to your door The thing especially I love about the rock auto dot cop catalog is that it is super easy to navigate You can see all the available parts for your car You can choose the brand specifications and prices you prefer amazing selection reliably low prices Rock auto dot com go there right now See all the parts available for your car or truck right knolls can it w l s in there? How did you hear about us box so that they know that we sent you rock auto dot com head on over a florida woman Is in a quintuple with four men. This was just A chronicled on a show called love don't judge here. She is This is Tori she fell in love with Travis and Ethan and mark And chris Therefore way relationship is working wonders for them the relationship could best be described by having Tori as the hub and all of us are spokes on a giant wheel But not everyone understands the dynamic I was like oh you're kidding that you're joking How will this poly relationship cope with a further addition to the family and so who's the father or the baby? Oh, you think that's weird. Oh, you think that's maybe not the best thing in the way How dare you you bigot? How intolerant of you how phobic and ism that is both ism and phobic that you're doing of course not of course not This is a cultural issue right this woman is in a Romantic relationship that she wants to be recognized culturally in one presumes politically with four men simultaneously they're having a child Together they don't know who the father of the baby is There is a role for government here The government has a an interest in protecting children the government has an interest in having a definition of marriage the government has an interest in This kind of social madness. How did this come about? If seven years ago Eight years ago You had said that this would be chronicled that that this woman would have a relationship with four guys I think a lot of people would have said yeah, maybe there are a lot of weird people especially No disrespect intended, but especially in florida. You see a lot of headlines, right? Except something fundamentally changed about seven years ago, which is that we redefined marriage for the first time ever We fundamentally redefined marriage from a relationship between husbands and wives to Anything goes we had a definition of marriage that had endured in the west for all of Certainly recent memory, but for our civilization, which is that one man Marries one woman and they have children together Now that has broken down we've expanded the definition of marriage to include monogamous same-sex unions Why monogamous if the whole argument for redefining marriage to include monogamous same-sex unions Love is love and how dare you judge and the heart wants with the heart wants Then who are you to exclude this woman and her four creepy boyfriends from marriage doesn't make any sense There will be a political push to legalize polygamy There already is in some quarters and There is no limiting principle on the supreme court's crazy decision to redefine marriage because justice Kennedy woke up and felt like a romantic poet one day so there will be a major push for this And that is a political issue Obviously marriage or our families are cultural primarily, but there is a huge political aspect to this There will be an answer. What is marriage? There will be an an there will be a political answer to that and If we decide to blow up in the doors to marriage, which in many ways we've already done that is going to have cultural effects You know, you say well, that's crazy. That's fringe. That's not going to happen anytime soon Look at drag queen story hour remember drag queen story hour This just burst on the scene like two months ago and it's this weird thing where at libraries they bring in drag queens to perform sexualized routines for Young children. We said that's insane some more libertarian-minded defenders of this said well Who cares? It's not that many of them. It's at libraries. This is a blessing of liberty All right, I guess we need to redefine blessing Maybe we need to redefine liberty or more clearly define it, but Obviously this libertarianism is never content to remain where it is. It wants to go further. So in Montreal now Technically not America, but it's America's hat and what you see there is coming here too drag queen story hour has left the libraries And it's headed straight to daycare This is what one of the organizers of daycare drag queen story hour wrote on twitter It's going to be Dan Kravitz quote I'm proud to have helped organize a drag queen story hour at our local child daycare Within these children. We inspire a love of reading while teaching deeper lessons on diversity self-love and tolerance of others You know a lot of the the recent debate on the right between the libertarians and the more traditionalist types is over whether There's a role for government to say you know drag queen story hour for little kids That's a little bit too far. Maybe we need some regulations on this. Maybe we need some laws And then the libertarians say no any laws regulating any social question or is completely unacceptable Where the rubber meets the road on this question is internet porn my colleague matt Walsh Kicked a beehive the other day when he said he wants to ban internet porn Massive debate going on online. I will give you the correct answer to that debate. We'll do that in a second first I've got to say goodbye to facebook and YouTube so you look you you like our new set right you like our new studio. It's looking pretty good Well, all of this requires money folks, you know that obviously they don't pay me But they at least need to keep the lights on so please head on over to dailywire.com subscribe you can become Now an all access to your bedroom Which means that you can engage in these conversations that we do regularly on the new website on the new app It looks super cool. Obviously you get me the bench bureau show the end of the clavin show the matt Walsh show You get to ask questions of the mailbag you get another kingdom you get the left to steer's terminal all very important stuff Head to dailywire.com. We'll be right back All right, this all comes down to internet porn It's where it all come welcome they say sex sells so we're now at the the sex portion of the show The culture is moving radically left at at an increasing rate Okay, you're that woman with the four dudes that's going to be a political debate very soon if it isn't already Drag queen story hour is certainly a political manner now And porn is where a lot of this is being thought. I frankly I think it's a cause of a lot of the confusion Matt Walsh kicked off this kerfuffle on the internet when he said we need to ban porn and we should jail pornographers This elicited outrage from the more libertarian minded segments of the right, okay the There's a writer for the dc examiner of brad palumbo palumbo Uh He tweeted out quote new rule All the young trad con dudes tweeting about how they support porn bans must post their Unredacted web browsing history Okay, this is the kind of Typical response of the more libertarian minded people which is hey you think that we should regulate something that's bad Have you ever done that bad thing? Well, then you have no standing here because you're a hypocrite. No first of all first of all hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue but Further beyond seeing in this a kind of contradiction Ha some guy looked at internet porn like all guys have done in america Well, then you can never say that internet porn is bad rather than seeing contradiction. Maybe we should see a cause here. Okay, amalia hallekius posted on twitter Very accurately quote it's obvious the porn is fine plus you can't stop me ha ha Chortle twitter shrieking is not representative of the dominant male view which is quote Yes, I watch porn. It's gross. It's bad for me. I should probably stop. This seems much clearer to me, you know Who knows more about the dangerous effects of crystal math some guy who's got his life in order who's Job it is to think and write in a nice air conditioned beautiful room on the Potomac or a methodic Probably the methodic to notice what's better You know, I I noticed the people clamoring for say the total legalization of drugs like heroin or crystal meth They're never the people who are hooked on heroin or crystal meth. It's always People who have really abstract ideological views of politics whose lives are basically in order That it doesn't doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me, you know Ben dominitch at the federalist he he tweeted at a similar version a I think a better objection to the calls to ban porn but still not sufficient he tweeted out quote Are the conservatives who think they can ban porn online? Purposefully ignoring the massive expansion of government this would require or are they too stupid to realize it This is another example where social conservatives should work to reestablish cultural stigmas which are far more powerful and enduring in government regulation so He's making the argument the politics is simply downstream of culture You can't really affect the culture in a good way with the politics and do you realize how crazy it would be to jail Pornographers we could never do that except we do that and we've done that recently Which perhaps banned and forgot and I think a lot of conservatives forgot We've been we've prosecuted hardcore pornographers as recent as 2008 We sent them to jail as recently as 2009 in 2008 in Tampa, Florida a guy named Paul little who goes by the name max hardcore this gets like out of a movie it's this guy His name is actually hardcore and we're talking about hardcore pornography is the real central problem here He was found guilty of distributing obscene material over the internet Not kiddie porn by the way, not something that's You know we all consider to be illegal He was found guilty of distributing obscene material Through the us mail and over the internet he was sentenced to 46 months in prison Here's a writer in Forbes magazine describing what the usual max hardcore scene looks like Quote His formulaic movies focused on the systematic degradation of his female co-star of the moment Who was not infrequently dressed up to resemble a child wearing pigtails discovered on a playground sucking on a lollipop The sex scenes took place on what would become an iconic yellow sofa where speculums were introduced hardcore's verbal on slots commenced and the young women returned into wild-eyed dazed zombies by the finale Okay That seems pretty obscene that seems pretty bad doesn't seem good for the Conservatives or so-called conservatives were saying if you're a conservative we need to support ubiquitous hardcore porn And if you think that we shouldn't have ubiquitous hardcore porn and you think maybe we should use politics to stop it You're not a real conservative. I think what that shows is that the meaning of the word conservative has drifted way too far When conservatism is boiled down or redefined to just mean libertarianism if not outright anarchy You've gone too far you've redefined conservatism too much. Why is porn bad? Why is it bad? Nobody thinks it's good. Okay, first of all, I don't I don't think I actually need to convince people that Widespread hardcore internet porn is bad. Okay. Do you know how I know that internet porn is bad? And that everyone thinks that internet porn is bad because of the incognito window because there is actually a function now built into every web browser That allows you to hide what you're doing when you look at internet porn Do you do you go and you kind of open up the window shades and you say oh hey there neighbors? How you know? I'm me. I'm just gonna go uh look at a bunch of really gross internet porn You can take a look if you want you I'll just be over here doing that thing that I'm so ashamed to do that I have to turn the lights off close the door and you know put on Your phones and put a towel underneath the doors so nobody can hear anything Yeah, that's but it's really good though. It's really it's a great thing. It's totally fine a blessing of liberty No, I don't think so. What does porn do internet porn? Decades people it specifically degrades the women who are in the scenes, right? It obviously degrades the performers it treats human beings who have intellect and will who are higher than the animals It treats them as brutes and it treats them as objects It literally objectifies people it turns them into nothing more than their flesh Which is crazy to think about to think about how much time people spend looking at internet porn when really all you're watching is just pieces of flesh Bump into each other and we all get titillated about that because we also have a sexual nature It degrades the performance. It also degrades the viewers Because you you've got to be that guy who goes into the room and turns the lights down and locks the door and closes the blinds And watches that thing and does that thing that doesn't look very dignified or cool That's the degradation problem. It's also ubiquitous. It's everywhere And it's viewed by children 93 percent of boys and 62 percent of girls report seeing porn before age 18 And I would add to that study 7 percent of boys are liars So I would guess it's even a little higher than 93 percent. Okay, the average age of first internet porn exposure today. Do you know what the age is? 11 It's the average age 10 percent of kids under the age of 10 have seen porn. Why else is porn bad? Highly addictive It has long lasting effects on your brain It is leading to skyrocketing rates of erectile dysfunction among young men men in their 20s who should be active who should be Vereil They're now suffering from ed like they're bob dole in the 90s It also has long lasting effects on your soul That's a question for another day. It's also disgusting. It's just gross Right. It's the porn is gross. I think the people who watch the porn which is statistically like every guy in america But hopefully there's a movement now to really fight back against this. So I hope that number is going down You know, especially when the internet was first invented like everybody was doing it I think only now are we seeing that the dangerous and deleterious effects of it The porn itself is disgusting But The very fact that everybody's looking at internet porn all the time is disgusting in itself because it makes us a nation of wankers And you don't want to be a nation of wankers because that's sad and pathetic All right, this is a very tough issue It's actually a very tough issue not in the clarity of it. I think we all know it's bad. It's gross It's new. It's highly addictive. Our brains were not built to handle this And we have a kind of vaguely libertarian politics at least The right has convinced itself to become libertarian in recent decades and that's made the problem a lot harder Virtually everybody's looked at the stuff. It's very addictive. It would be good to discourage it. Right. This was common sense Until we threw common sense out the window. So can the govern that that's the first question is porn bad Yeah, we should all agree with it And if you don't agree with that, I think you're kidding yourself Right, you've got an industry that exploits like 18 year old runaway girls and turns them into nothing more than flesh That's not a good industry The next question is can the government do something about it The libertarian immediately says no. Oh god heaven for fenned. Pletch your pearls Yeah, of course the government can do something about that We regulate gambling booze and tobacco on the internet You need to prove that you're 21 to buy a pack of cigarettes online when I try to buy cigars online. It's difficult It should not be difficult. All right. I'm we also should make it easier to buy cigars online It's a issue for another day. You need an id to buy a playboy if you go up to a magazine track So why is everybody so frazzled about the prospect of applying the exact same regulations that we have for cigarettes and nudie mags To internet porn doesn't make a whole lot of sense. There is no constitutional right to internet porn. Okay There's this common objection to regulating porn, which is that it's un-american to regulate porn. What are you talking about? We have had obscenity laws in this country forever We currently have obscenity laws in this country. We threw pornography is in jail under those obscenity laws 10 years ago It look you might not like it. You might say well, we got to get rid of those obscenity laws Okay, but don't tell me it's un-american. It's completely perfectly American The country was was founded by religious zealot Puritans who left England for lydan and left lydan for america And practiced a very very puritanical form of christianity, which I am not advocating But you can't say it's un-american, you know, there's this common objection I think it's one of the the most pernicious lies that people have bought into in politics, which is that you can't legislate morality That's what you hear. You can't legislate morality Of course you can not only can you you must You cannot legislate without legislating morality We exclusively legislate morality How do what what do I mean by that? When you're arguing about tax rates Something is basic and boring as tax rates. You are using moral arguments You're saying well, I have a right to my property and I have some duty to the government But because of my property rights I should keep more of my property when you're arguing about health care Those are moral arguments We're on the right side of history. We need to extend Modern medical technology to everybody because that is good and right and just And the other side of the argument will say how dare you you're totalitarian. You're stealing my money You're infringing on my liberty, which is a god-given right and i'm going to keep my liberty Those are they're both making moral arguments. Everybody makes the moral argument when it comes to health care and everything else Parking tickets Laws governing parking tickets Involve moral arguments The rights to public land the rights to private property You do legislate morality, right? When it comes to high-speed internet porn, it's a new problem. It's a major social problem. It has victims It's affecting people's health, especially young men. It's more or less completely unregulated now There's double standards when it comes to other kinds of pornography and gambling and other vices And it's making us a bunch of wankers Do not be a wanker. That's not a good country to have if you are a wanker go to confession and try to stop But at the very least forget the personal question just from a social Perspective from a political perspective We don't want to be a nation of wankers So we should take these questions seriously before we go. I've got to get to katie hill speaking of creepy creepy sex You remember katie hill she is that former congressman Who was involved in a throuple with her husband and a female staffer who was right at a college and she sexually exploited this staffer and she put her on the payroll and she dumped her And she moved her away and the staffer was heartbroken if katie hill were a man This would be the biggest sex abuse sexual harassment case in all of congress or if katie hill were a republican the same thing Because she's a democrat woman. They're trying to make her seem like a victim The New York Times absolutely shameless publishes an op-ed katie hill It's not over after all. I overcame the desperation I felt after stepping down from congress and i'm still in the fight Here's what she writes On november 6 2018 I was elected to congress at 31 I was one of the youngest women ever elected to the house of representatives One year later. I was sitting on a train to new york to meet with my lawyers about suing the daily mail for cyber exploitation And I was no longer a member of congress suing because she's a victim She stepped up to a microphone. It was the first time I had spoken publicly since my relationship with a campaign staffer was exposed Some of the naked photos of me taken without my knowledge and distributed without my consent Have been posted online since wild accusations from my estranged husband about a supposed affair with a congressional staffer Which i've repeatedly denied since I had resigned my hard fought seat in congress Now notice she doesn't actually deny the allegations She says that she has denied them, but she doesn't say they're not true Why because they're obviously true and by the way, she obviously knew the photos were being taken She's looking at the camera in many of the photos. So that's a lie too She goes on that day oddly. I didn't get nervous the way I normally did I got every part of the routine right. I felt common strong as I began to speak because I had to be I needed to say something to the countless people who had put their faith in me I needed to say something to the girls and young women who looked up to me I needed to make sure that my horrific experience did not frighten and discourage other women Who will dare to take risks dare to step into this light dare to be powerful Katie hill should dare to take a seat Sit down sit this one out We've been told for a very long time that Shunning our moral responsibilities shunning our conscience shunning our duties to one another shunning dignity Is empowering that's good. It's what we should strive for Overcome your conscience follow your will exert your will on others That's essentially the case made by Katie hill. That's the case made by the left That's a recipe for a terrible terrible society. We have to fix that We have to fix that through movies. We have to fix that through plays. We have to fix that through art and culture We also have to fix that in our politics. Katie hill is a political figure She needs to suffer political consequences for what she's done and we need to A acknowledge of politics that will acknowledge the culture that will make politics downstream of culture once again That's our show.
