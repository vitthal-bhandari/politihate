    "text": " All right, guys, it's Tuesday and some great news in case you missed my Instagram announcement. I am pregnant and today I'm going to tell you guys what the sex of the baby is. Does I know that inquiring minds want to know and why not tell you guys on my show? Then we're going to dive into modern love stories. I'm very interested and fascinated on the cultural brainwashing that makes people aspire toward modern love. And then beyond that, we're going to discuss a surrogate who is claiming that a couple of gay dads told her to terminate her pregnancy at 24 weeks after discovering that she had an aggressive cancer. All that and more today, coming up on Candace Owens. All right, so I couldn't hide it anymore. We got tired of thinking about camera angles. And I don't even know really know why I was hiding it. There really was no reason to. But yes, I am pregnant and we are so excited. We announced it the other day on my Instagram. You guys were so kind in the comments with all the congratulations. We are obviously beyond excited. I mean, I've really been pregnant for three years. If you think about it, I've had a child in 2021. I had one in 2022 and I will now be having a child in 2023. I'm basically an elephant. I think people are going to wonder if I'm pregnant again or still this time. I am pregnant again. And I'm pleased to announce that we are welcoming another little boy to the family. And I was right. I told you guys, I just have this amazing ability to know the sex of my children immediately. It was just like this mama intuition. I knew my first was a boy. I knew my second was a girl. And I bet my doctor, I said, I guarantee you this is going to be a little boy. And indeed, it was. So we are absolutely thrilled, of course, to be growing our family. I believe family is the greatest blessing and aspiration that any person can have. And I wish it upon people, even my enemies, because I think that becoming a mother or a father fundamentally changes you and informs your perspectives. And I also think that it encourages you. And I mean, quite literally, it gives you more courage in life to stand up to what is wrong. So just wanted to share that news with the world and share the sex of the baby on this podcast. All right, guys, moving on and talking about the love of family, I'm really struck by the concept of modern love. So I'm going to share something with you guys about my liberal past. I've been very open about the fact that I used to be more left leaning, which I think is really common in your youth, because you don't really understand how the world works. And what left is really good at selling ideas. And one idea that I really bid on in my youth was the concept of modern love. Now, what am I talking about? Well, the New York Times actually has this weekly column that comes out. It's entitled modern love. And essentially, it is readers of the New York Times that submit these columns, sharing their modern love stories, different ways that they're operating their relationship manners. I guess in a way that makes it seem that it's cool to be bucking traditional trends is the best way to see it. So I remember consuming these articles and being obsessed with this column and thinking how cool it was that people were sharing different ways they dived into love. And when I pause and reflect on why I thought that was cool and aspirational, it's because the way that it's pitched to people that are young is that it symbolizes freedom. You know, why have that natural traditional marriage when you can have something that's different and works for you in the person that you're in a relationship with? Of course, the idea here is that it's freedom. When in fact, it is narcissism, first and foremost, it's thinking that I do not have to be disciplined. I don't have to submit in any way. I can live my life as I want to the every impulse that I have. I should be able to give into. But the other thing that they never tell you is that it almost never works out. So I'm just reading to you here. This is just me on the New York Times website, a couple of recent headlines just to give you an idea of what the modern love concept is for the New York Times. This one is entitled My Spectacular Betrayal and the subheading reads, we had compromised in our marriages, denied parts of ourselves, often felt lonely, but who didn't? Weren't we happy enough? Next one is entitled, that's why I picked a younger man. The next one is entitled Kissing a Fellow Genitor Amid the Trash. So you get the concept here. It's people that are doing love differently. And as I said before, they're happy to share these stories. They're happy to make these stories aspirational. We never really get an update to how it worked out, right? How it worked out for these individuals. I'm reading one right here about a woman, a man who's in love with somebody that is Polly Amoris. How does that really work out in the long run? That's not the point they want to glamorize it and make it seem like it's cool and that it's free. It typically works on younger minds. It definitely worked on me until I woke up to the lie that this represented freedom. When it back in slaves you because you're not actually happy, because you're not yielding to your natural proclivities. You're not yielding to your biology, your biological instinct to settle down, to have a family, to produce children. You're fighting it. And typically, what can happen if you don't wake up to that is that you're fighting it until it's too late. Well, here's an example, by the way, in culture and in politics of a modern love example, Bill de Blasio, you remember him? He was a one-time presidential contender that nobody took seriously. And before that, he was busy ruining the city of New York as the mayor. But both of Blasio married a woman named Charlene McCrae. You probably know this because one of the things they really wanted to put in your faces, this is a biracial couple. I think it obviously helped him. That factor definitely helped him become the mayor in New York. Certainly, his policies didn't because he ruined the city. But something you probably didn't know about Bill de Blasio and Charlene McCrae is it's not interesting that they were in a biracial relationship. The more interesting factor is that she's a lesbian. Was a lesbian? Is a lesbian? Yeah, when he met her, she had written a column in Essence magazine entitled I Am a Lesbian, where she talked about her, being a lesbian. And they didn't matter to Bill de Blasio at the time, they married her. That's just different. That's just interesting. That is something that could almost be a column in New York Times modern love segment. Oh, why I married a lesbian and I'm super happy. Well, how did that work out? Well, they're splitting, but they're not going to divorce because you the only way to build upon your modern love failure is to add to it another layer of modern love. Now you can split without actually divorcing and remain happy and see other people. And that's exactly what they're doing. Yeah, they opened up to none other than the New York Times, of course, because only the New York Times could possibly glamorize a split in the way that they are doing with Bill de Blasio and Sherlaine McCray. I'm just going to read you an excerpt from this absurd article announcing their split. So the article is written by, if you want to call him a journalist, Matt, Flagan Heiner. And it reads, about two months ago, after another stale Saturday night of been watching television at their Brooklyn home, Bill de Blasio and Sherlaine McCray surprised themselves. It began with an offhand remark. Why aren't you lovey dovey anymore? Mr. de Blasio, the former New York City mayor asked according to Ms. McCray, his wife. It moves quickly, both said into the sort of urgently searching dialogue that had been necessary for years, but avoided until that moment, a full accounting of their relationship, what they wanted, what they were not getting. You can't fake it, Miss McCray said Tuesday from their kitchen table. You can feel when things are off, Mr. Blasio said. And you don't want to live that way. They made the decision that night. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray are separating. They are not planning to divorce, they said, but they will date other people. They will continue to share the Park Slope townhouse where they raise their two children now in their twenties. I mean, the article just goes on and on in this way, Ms. Manner, of depicting them like this modern cup of notes that are enjoying, dancing to music, talking about old times, sitting at the kitchen counter. It is the most glamorous portrayal of a relationship that failed because a relationship should have never come together. Obviously, I think it's even remarkable that she chose not to take his last name, that she was a lesbian. All of the things that I signaled for you to be red flags when entering a relationship, the things that for whatever reason they are making aspirational via Hollywood, via culture, via politics. And this article really becomes for me the pitch of everything that I despise about modern love. So I'm just going to read to you another portion of this is actually the end of the article. It reads, he, they were referring to Bill de Blasio quoted two favorite phrases of Ms. McCraze, quote, labels put people in boxes and those boxes are shaped like coffins. And I never want to be stuck. And one that was prized by his brother at Tibetan Buddhist, avoid attachments. They will continue to share the home for the time being, Ms. McCraze said, for now, a photo of the couple in Times Square on New Year's Eve still greets visitors, which may come to include suitors. Ms. McCraze asked dry Lee if their phone numbers could be included in the newspaper. Can I put a picture from the gym in there? Mr. Blasio asked. He added that he was not a believer in online dating. As the conversation neared its end, the former mayor pulled out his phone to play a song called Mango saying it might best explain their feelings now. Quote, I don't want nothing but you it went getting what you need, even if it ain't from me. Mr. de Blasio hummed a bit from his chair. Ms. McCraze danced behind him, gazing ahead. Isn't that beautiful? He said, that's quite literally how the art of plans. Isn't that beautiful? Oh my gosh, we are separated. We're going to date other people. She's probably going to dive back into being elected. We love each other so much that we're consciously uncoupling and we're going to share this home and our modern failure relationship is now becoming even more modern. And it's just absolute journalistic failure. No integrity in this piece because there is just no such thing as actually calling something what it is anymore, right? They will constantly try to glamorize these things. In reality, this person should have written the article and welcomed it to the home and commented on how strange this dynamic is. They should have prodded further about, you know, why aren't you going to leave the home? Isn't it bizarre to have your children come home? And with the understanding that their parents are seeing other people, is that healthy for your child? Speaking of your child, didn't your child get arrested at a BLM protest, right? Then we learned some things about, but how do you deal with that? Do you think that part of the reasons that your child seems to be suffering is because of the dynamic between your unhealthy modern love type relationship, which is now going to continue in this park slope apartment? No, that would be a person that had journalistic integrity, which Matt Flagenheimer, Flagen Hainer does not. In fact, what he has is a task set before him as a person that writes for New York Times to continue to make this seem like it's something that people should wish to attain to make the reader walk away and think, isn't that beautiful? Well, no, to answer your question, Bill de Blasio. It's not beautiful. It's ugly. It's horrendous. Everything that relationships have become in terms of their cultural and Hollywood significant depictions is something that no one should aspire to. It is the reason that so many women and men are unhappy in relationships. It's the reason why people can't come up to answers to why their relationships are failing. They don't understand what relationships are failing. It's because they don't even know what it means to come together in a marriage, right? Marriages are not meant to be experiments, right? It's not, wow, wouldn't it be different if I married somebody who was a lesbian? Let me try that out and see how it works out. That's not taking what's before you seriously. That's not taking your vows seriously. That's not actually choosing the right partner for yourself. It's not acknowledging all the red flags and all of the indications that should make it obvious to you that it's not going to work down the line. What this should be and what this article is to me when I read it is a major win in the Department of Traditional Marriage, right? It should read, if you are an intelligent person and you are reading this, you would understand that you are being sold propaganda and that obviously this is nothing but a remarkable failure on behalf of Bill de Blasio, almost as big of a failure, a bigger failure in his presidential campaign. I would argue, but it should signal to you that these sorts of arrangements don't work out and that maybe you should take into serious consideration what it is that conservatives are speaking about, what it is that Christians are speaking about, why it is outrageous that marriage is even taken outside of a church because vows mean something. Picking the right partner means something and there's no way that a column in modern love or a poorly written article should stop you from seeing that. In short, modern love is crap. That's what I want to say and that's all that I have to say about that. Okay, now it's time for some topics to join. Okay, speaking of modern love, you are going to have to indulge me. Fellas for one second. Actually, if you have a girlfriend or wife, you've probably already heard her talking about this cultural story because it's just been so compelling for anybody that is familiar with the couple, Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umanzki, who appeared 13 years ago, have been consistent. Bravo celebrities from the Real Housewives franchise out of Beverly Hills. And the reason why it's a compelling story to talk about is not because you should go watch the Real Housewives Beverly Hills. I certainly don't. I did, obviously, many years ago, but because they have been an unusual couple in that first and foremost, it's very rare to come across anybody today, which is sad to say this that has been together for more than 15 years, right? We live in a different time, couples are separating all the time. It's even more unique to me to couple that has been together for more than 15 years, that is on a reality TV show. You just want to root for them to make it the entire way and you would assume. But after 27 years of being married, that Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umanzki would not split. Well, there's a lot of drama for changing the split that I want to talk about because we are specifically talking about modern love today. And this, as I said, completely shocked me. I'll tell you why it shocked me. Now, a lot of times you think that what you see on TV is not what you see in person. So they have been remarkably loved up and loving toward another very adoring. They have a huge family, three daughters, actually four daughters. She has one daughter from a prior relationship. And then together, they have three daughters and they are very, very loving on screen, at least when I watched it, they were. But I actually happened to join into this couple in real life. They probably had no idea who I was. That notorious congressional testimony that I did where it went completely viral, where I was in front of Jared Naddler. Well, I happened to take an overnight flight, which is why I look so tired during that testimony from Los Angeles to Washington, DC. And I was sitting directly behind Kyle and Mauricio. I was like, oh, there they are from Ohio's wise. My husband obviously had no idea who they were. This entire flight, they were so loving toward each other. I mean, holding each other's hands for the full six hours, kissing each other. He was like gently stroking her face. And I just was like, wow, that is actually incredible that you actually have a couple that is on TV. And it translates in real life. And they've been married for 20 plus years. And they adore each other. And they were on. They were en route. I think we changed a couple of words to their daughters graduation, their daughter attended some school that was in DC. And that's where they were headed. And I just thought that's really beautiful. And that's amazing, which is why I was doubly shocked by this announcement, not just that they had split. But that included in this split was the fact that she had began a lesbian relationship with a country singer known as Morgan Wade, who was a female. I mean, obviously I said a lesbian relationship, was a female, a very butch type female. And I thought there's no way that this could be. But then because I live in Nashville and Morgan Wade is a country singer, people started saying, no, this is this is actually true. She does have a lesbian relationship with her and her and Kyle Amonski have been split. So she wasn't necessarily cheating on him. But she is now at the age of how old is she 53 years old, jumping into a lesbian relationship. And this is positively heartbreaking to me, not because I have a vested interest in their relationship, but because I have a vested interest in the concept of marriage. That's why. And this is a rare example, a rare cultural example, since, you know, real housewives, the franchise as a cult following of a relationship that has worked, as I said, a relationship that has worked, you just don't want to see something fail. So yes, it was reported that they have been separated and that Morgan Wade may have had a role in the breakup. The two women have been attached at the hip after meeting last year with Richard, even going as Wade's date to the Americana Music Awards in September of 2022. Since then, they traveled the world together visiting Mexico with friends and even going to Atlanta to spend time with Morgan Wade's family. Now to be clear, Morgan Wade is about 20 years younger than Kyle Richards. So that's also strange, in my opinion. If you thought that this was just a rumor, I think the statement that Kyle Amoreseo issued after this rumor went viral, all but confirms that it's true in my view. She wrote, they took their Instagram to write this, in regards to the news that came out about us today, any claims regarding us divorcing or untrue. However, yes, we have had a rough year, the most challenging one of our marriage, what we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrong doing it on anyone's part. Although we are in the public eye, we asked to be able to work through our issues privately. While it may be entertaining to speculate, please do not create false stories to fit a further salacious narrative. Thank you for the love and support Kyle and Mauricio. I mean, I'll spare all the details here, but she never denied that she was in a lesbian relationship, which should be obviously the first thing you would do is say it's positively ludicrous to suggest that I've been in a lesbian relationship with a country singer. Rather, she just basically says, yes, we've had a rough year, but we are not divorcing. Maybe that's the modern love. De Blasio, we're not divorcing, we're going to still save the same house, but live separate lives and date other people. Again, I can't comment on, you know, maybe they had agreed to separate and so therefore, this does not actually to them signify any infidelity. What I can comment on is how horrific it is for their family to go through this publicly, how strange it is for a woman that has been in a monogamous relationship for almost 30 years to then jump into a relationship with a woman that's almost 20 years her junior and just the dynamic of jumping into a lesbian relationship. It reads to me like a midlife crisis. And obviously, if we can make any predictions, it's not going to work out between her and Morgan Wade because modern love stories rarely do and jumping into a lesbian relationship when you are 53 years old after you have raised beautiful children. If you if that if there's not a red flag there, then I don't know what a red flag is. All right, guys, moving on to the story that I teased for you guys at the top of the show, a surrogate claiming that gay dad told her to terminate the pregnancy at 24 weeks upon finding out that she had an aggressive cancer and they barred her from having the baby prematurely or putting it up for a adoption because they didn't want their DNA out there. Now, I just say right on top of this is that everything that the gay gay gay couple is doing is well within their contractual rights. But as somebody who happens to be just about 24 weeks pregnant, I'm 22 weeks pregnant and knowing what that experience is like for a woman as you can feel a child in a life kicking inside of you. This is why I have been being the drum on the show about the unethical state of surrogacy today. These are things that nobody wants to talk about because everybody wants to be sold a fluffy version. You want to believe that it's women that are struggling with fertility, but have tried to have kids for 10 years who can at last turn to science to be able to give them that one thing that they always wanted, right? That's not what surrogacy has become. I said strongly on my Twitter that the industry is becoming demonic. I actually recently learned of a woman who shut down her clinic in California because she started realizing that something was wrong here. She wasn't seeing as the average person, a woman that was struggling to conceive one child and turning the science to give them that gift. Rather, what she was seeing was gay men coming through the door, listing what they wanted, making their demands and saying, I have enough money. Rather, what they were seeing were people like Chrissy Teigen who already has three kids, but always thought that she'd have four and can afford to impregnate a woman and want one more. Rather, what they were seeing were couples with excess in money and wealth just deciding what they wanted and what they were willing to put a woman's body through in order to get their wants, not their needs, not their desperate attempt. I am seeing, I'm happy that more and more of these examples are coming into the public view because I really do believe that people don't understand what surrogates are going through. I'm happy that more surrogates are speaking out. So yes, this California mother claimed that she was told to terminate her surrogate pregnancy at 24 weeks. Again, to paint that picture for you, that means that she is feeling the infant kick. She knows that this infant, that attachment that you feel to it once you begin to feel those movements, you begin to feel the personality that is growing within you as I did with my children. But the gay fathers after realizing that she had just been diagnosed with breast cancer said, no, you have to terminate this pregnancy right away. The woman who was speaking out, her name is Brittany Pearson. She told a Daily Mail that she was diagnosed with breast cancer in May at 22 weeks. This could literally be something that happened to me today. It says that after a full-body MRI revealed the extent of the disease, the gay couple who were paying her to carry their child used legal threats to pressure her in determining the pregnancy. For just want you to picture that scenario, you are already putting your body at risk. We know that it carries with it. If you are a surrogate, a high risk of going into preterm labor because your body recognizes that something isn't exactly right with this pregnancy. And you already are carrying that risk. You have just 16 weeks left. You find out that you have breast cancer. You are dealing with a trauma of realizing that you have breast cancer, right? You're wondering if you're going to be able to survive breast cancer. And typically, in these circumstances, when it is a mother and it is their child in the womb and it is not a gay person that is purchasing their womb, they keep going out of the pregnancy, of course, because your instinct as a mother is to fight for the life of your child. But the womb is not hers. It's been purchased by somebody. It's purchased by two gay men. And they get to dictate legally what's allowed to happen because they inserted their embryo that they paid for inside of her. So she in this circumstance is just a body that is being told what exactly she needs to do. Her body has cancer. They used legal threats to tell her, you have to get rid of this. Initially, this woman claims that the doctors at Sutter Health Medical Center believe that she would be able to have a form of chemotherapy treatment that would be compatible with pregnancy and would then be induced at 34 weeks gestation. The prospective fathers who haven't been named obviously in this article were happy for her to receive that treatment and continue with the pregnancy. However, then they realized that her cancer had spread further than expected that a more aggressive form of chemo would be needed to combat it. That is when the relationship relationship between her and their perspective parents broke down. Again, once this is a becomes a transaction, right? And they're thinking, I don't really that's not healthy pregnancy for us and what we had envisioned. It's very easy for them to say, you now need to have that abortion right now. You need to do that. That baby needs to come out of you right now. Not easy. Not something that any mother who's caring a child would ever even consider. They would say, absolutely. Of course, I'm going to consider continuing with this pregnancy. And I'm going to go through chemo and I'm going to every do everything to save my child. In fact, there are circumstances where the women have gone through without doing chemo. And they died from their cancer after giving birth to their child because that is how much how attached you are when you are growing with life inside you. But that is how removed you are when you are not. When this is just a transaction for you, it's a horrific story. They said that they feared that the child would have considerable health problems. So it was no big deal for them to simply use legal threats to get them to terminate the pregnancy at 24 weeks. And so she decided to speak out about this experience because she never wants any individual to ever go through this. And I'm glad that she is speaking out about this experience because it's important for people to really recognize up close what surrogacy has become, not its intention, but what it actually has become. And as I said, it has become a plaything for the rich who are completely removed from what exactly a woman's body is meant to go through, what exactly they're sacrificing because, well, they can afford to be removed from it. All right, guys, on that note, let's jump into some of your comments on episodes past. Obviously, I spoke with Brett about Chrissy Tegan surrogacy and how ridiculous I thought it was that she had three kids in the side that she simply wanted more and put a woman's body through this. Patty Miles writes, wow, I had no idea. I was thinking with surrogate was just doing a favor. And of course getting paid, but didn't know it was an industry now. You are right about how it's unethical talking about cases like the spoiled, self-rich people. It's disgusting. By the way, I love your show. Thank you for educating some of us that are out of the loop. I will add to that, by the way, that America, of course, is the most unethical country when it comes to surrogacy. In other countries in the UK, you can't decide on the gender because then they say that people will have abortions, like what they will do to achieve a gender that they want is unethical. In South Africa, as another example, you're not allowed to pay the surrogate. That seems pretty ethical. When money gets involved, it becomes much more corrupted. So, yes, so you should know that America is extreme on surrogacy just as we are extreme when it comes to everything else. The next comment reads, hi, Candice, on a similar note to the extra IVF babies. I am the only child between my biological mother and father. They were divorced and remarried and went on to both have more children besides me. However, growing up, I struggled a lot with loneliness and often wished for siblings who were going through what I was. I know that while my parents were together, my mother was on birth control and often wondered if I do have full siblings in heaven that were fertilized and would have been a healthy pregnancy if not for the birth control. I will say my mother came a long way since then, converting to Catholicism when I was born in deep, you regrets, things like that from her earlier life. Anyway, it's just another sad moral question that shows how disconnected our society is when it comes to morality of pregnancy and children. I love your work. That's from Mandy, who is a mother of six. We were that and that's obviously regarding the extra IVF babies. What do you do with them? Do you donate them to science so they can experiment on your embryos or do you have them destroyed? Do you put them inside of you? Ethical questions for consideration. Holly writes, I think it's true about the surrogacy thing. My husband and I won't do IVF because they discard the embryos that have the wrong number of chromosomes and I wouldn't even consider surrogacy. But it does make me feel really broken when she talks about the hand off of the child because I think about one day hoping to adopt and I can't think of something more beautiful than giving a baby to loving parents. I've always wanted to be a mother. My husband and I are considering adopting and I think it's good to be careful about how you talk about handing off a child from one person to another because adoption is a beautiful thing. Now, a mother's can mother their own children and lots of people want to feel called to motherhood more than anything else. We were not talking about adoption which I think is a lot different than surrogacy because again for me the thing that is so traumatizing about that immediate hand off is the trauma that the mother experiences right after you get birthed, your milk coming in for someone to take that child even in the circumstances of adoption. I don't think the right time is right after you get birthed. I really don't. You cannot just the second take the child away and give it to another mother in a waiting room. That mother needs something the baby needs something that is happening in that moment and I think that any person that has given birth understands that perhaps more than others can and if you had ever watched a birth even you can understand that. What that moment is like, it transcends, it's almost spiritual. It's a spiritual moment and so I stand by my assessment that it is deeply wrong and even in circumstances of adoption there are ways to avoid that. All right guys that is all the time that we have for today still coming at you from France. As a reminder a shot in the dark is available on Daily Wire Plus and you can hit the link in the description to subscribe to that right now. Other than that, I will see you tomorrow and we will still be here in France with a new episode. See you then."
