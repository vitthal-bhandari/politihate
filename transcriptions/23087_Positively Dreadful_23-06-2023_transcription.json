    "text": " Crooked Media's award-winning podcast, This Land, is back with a bonus episode delving into the recent Supreme Court ruling on Halend vs. Breqin and the constitutional battle surrounding the Indian Child Welfare Act. Host Rebecca Nagle dissects this pivotal court case in Season 2, revealing how the far right is trying to use native children to chip away at American Indian tribes and their sovereignty rights. That case, Halend vs. Breqin aimed to strike down the Indian Child Welfare Act and undermine the tribal sovereignty, but the Supreme Court's decision was a stunning defeat for the plaintiffs. The episode is out now, and you can listen to this episode plus the first two seasons of this land, wherever you get your podcasts. Hello, and welcome to Positively Dreadful with me, your host, Brian Boiler. The other day, Donald Trump said something characteristic for him, but unusually revealing about how he kind of feels around for talking points that keep his supporters agitated and mobilized. He said, it's amazing how strongly people feel about that, referring to the conversation about trans rights. He says, I'm talking about cutting taxes and people get bored. I talk about transgender. Everyone goes crazy. Who would have thought? Five years ago, you didn't know what the hell it was. Everyone goes crazy. That was his basic takeaway, and that's kind of how it's been going on that side of the aisle for a while now. The politicians want to cut taxes, just as Trump said, but their supporters want scapegoats, and red meat. And so that's what the politicians provide as a means to an end. Ron DeSantis, who's the country's most attention-seeking anti-trans governor, and a GOP presidential candidate, responded to Trump's comments by attacking Trump for having once celebrated the inclusion of trans women in his beauty pageant. There was no policy issue at stake. It's just that before he took over the Republican Party, Donald Trump wasn't instinctually cruel to trans people. And that, according to DeSantis, is reason enough to vote for him instead. And you can see from this degrading back and forth that these politicians who never gave any thought to girls, high school sports or women's collegiate athletics, or who gets to participate in beauty contests only latched on to issues like that because, as Trump said, everyone goes crazy. And some of them, of course, really do go crazy. Some of them get violent. And that's apparently okay with people like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, so long as come election time, anyone who takes issue with trans participation in society will vote for them. But that's the big question. The trans sports issue is the wedge, but the people holding the wedge are, in many cases, bigots who treat anything other than cisgendered heterosexual life as a kind of perversion. And so the politicians, pandering to them, ultimately can't stop at the issue of sports fairness. They have to go further to ban health care for trans kids. They have to threaten to separate trans kids from their parents if their parents are too accepting of their kids. Ban books that depict LGBT life in any kind of normal, positive way. They also, frankly, have to act like bullies to treat people, some of the most underrepresented people in the country, with contempt and cruelty. And that's where I think advocates for LGBT legal and social equality have been able to find unexpected support. At least that's my sense from the periphery of this fight. Against the backdrop of vicious, exploitative attacks, trans families, the parents of trans and adolescents have come forward in their communities and just been themselves. Normal. Particularly by comparison to the people leading the fight against their rights. They've asked the public not to participate in campaigns to bully children. They've emphasized just how normal it is for adolescents to want to play sports, much as gay and lesbian Americans in the last decade emphasize the fundamental awareness of marriage. We just want the same things other Americans take for granted. That basic appeal was, I think, integral to the speed with which support from marriage equality went from being a losing issue politically to a winning one. But with the Trump's and the Santices out there acting completely certain that the public is on their side in supporting trans discrimination. It's not surprising that many people looking on like me from the periphery worry that it's not working. Maybe the rights at stake are different enough that people won't rally against hatred or for the equal dignity of trans Americans. On the other hand, what if it just feels that way because the anti-trans voices are so loud, so good at attracting attention, that we miss how off-putting that kind of behavior is to the majority of the population? The most alarming thing may be how unsettled that question is. Polling does not show vast support for anti-trans extremism, but it does show that the majority support for seemingly settled aspects of LGBT quality has started to slip a little. And my guests this week have spent the last years living in this kind of limbo. Kai Shafley is 12 years old. She told her mom Kimberly, she was trans when she was 3 1,500 years old, and they've been advocates for trans rights basically ever since. Kai even wrote a book about it. But it has also upended their lives in profound ways, even before they know how the fight will end. But they've seen it up close. They can speak to what's effective, and they're my guests this week. Kai and Kimberly, welcome to Positively Dreadful. We're really thrilled to have you. We're thrilled to be here. So Kai, many of our listeners probably don't know your story, so I didn't tell it all the way through in the introduction there. But do you want to tell us a little bit about how and why you've advocated for trans rights and what joining that fight has meant for you and for your family? The story as far as that goes is like I always knew who I was. It wasn't until I realized the people around me didn't, so I told them. And then it took a while for some of them to realize, and some of them left and some of them stayed. And that's what helped me decide that I wanted to fight, because I want people in the future to have it where nobody leaves them for who they are. You've spent most of your childhood in Texas, and now you've more recently moved to Connecticut. Is that correct? Yes, I'm now a Texan living in Connecticut, and it is not at all like home. I want to get to that in a second, but Kimberly, is it basically that the laws and the government in Texas essentially force families to go stealth, I think, is the term of art, or else you'll be persecuted if you're living your life? Yeah, I guess what I would like to say is in the beginning, we could try to find mutual ground to meet with conservative churches and conservative politicians and tell them our story, to try to help them to understand. But at the beginning of the Trump presidency, those avenues completely shut down. It became almost impossible to even be able to try to explain. And, yeah, so when we first came out, we came under attack from the superintendent of the school district we lived in, and that made it into the media, so that spread through the community, and we ultimately had to leave the community where we were living for Austin, which is the safe bubble in Texas, and we did okay there, but for seven, eight consecutive years, the politics and the rhetoric around it just continued to increase the risk and the danger, both danger from the politicians, the leadership and neighbors until we ultimately did have to leave. And as far as stealth, if we had the option for kind of be stealth, we would, but that's not an option. One, that's not in her nature. Two, it's kind of hard to have a book out and an Emmy and a bit on babysitter's club, and all these things that she's done, it just makes it impossible for her to be stealth. But in that same token, with her teen years coming up, being stealth isn't safe either, because if you get found out, then you're at a whole new level of danger. Tell us about how you came to the decision to move and how it feels looking back from your new home. Do you feel like it was right as difficult as it was and has it gotten any easier now that you've had some time at least to resettle? So it was definitely the right decision, and before the last Texas legislative session even began, families were being investigated just on the orders of the governor. And I knew then that the legislation was going to pass. I mean, the writing was on the wall. It was passing all across the country. And so the decision to leave was just, to me, it was, is what I needed to do to feel like we could relax and breathe. And that's certainly what being in Connecticut has done for us, has given us that opportunity to breathe and reassess the situation. We miss Tex-Mex. We do not miss mosquitoes and we don't miss the heat, but... Oh, H-E-B. H-E-V. I'm back to my love. But we do, you know, we're homesick. We're country folks, and we'd like to be able to go home again one day. Yeah, Kai, you said that you're a Texan living in Connecticut, and it doesn't feel at all like home. Can you tell us a little bit about how life in your new community in Connecticut differs from the one you left? Well, first of all, the people here, their heart is cold as the weather. That is just a joke that she says. We've met some really nice people. You've got to watch how you joke in public. Their food is not the same. They don't season their food. Yeah. That's a boot problem in the Northeast in general, not an assault, right? Or spice. She does have a little bit of difficulty with the grammar being made fun of her southern draw, but we'll leave that alone. We're just thankful that the people in Connecticut vote in such a way that they do give people a safe haven. And there have been many, many, many other families like ours that have reached out to us and that we've met up with and spent time with that are here in Connecticut and all across the New England area. I think I can guess the answer to this based on what you just told me, but would it be your preference if the government there or the culture there changed, stop being a hostile place for trans people? Would it be your preference to return to Texas? It would be my preference that the majority of Texans who are not anti-trans and anti-everything, right? If the majority of Texans voices were heard and represented because I believe that, like you said earlier, the voice is really loud of the bigots that hate everybody and everything that is not exactly like them. And what I would like to finally see is Texans being authentically represented so that families like mine can come home. You referred to Austin as the safe bubble in Texas. Is it harder in this day and age you think to find welcoming places, whether they're bubbles within Texas or in a blue state like Connecticut, when the people who are trying to whip up mobs or whatever, they're working online. There are no state borders and they're just as happy to find things or direct hatred of people in Connecticut as they are in Texas or anywhere else in the country. Yes. And what I can say about that is there used to be a time when I would say that there's a whole bunch of people in the middle that just don't care either way, right? They don't want to attack trans people, but they maybe don't understand them, but they just don't care. And I feel sometimes like the right is gaining ground because their messaging is so consistent and hateful and somehow they're talking points and they're rhetoric and the large amount of time that they spend getting this false narrative out into the media and the social media has been a huge threat. It's a huge threat. I guess the question that I like to pose is what other medical diagnosis can your child get that makes people feel justified in hating you so? Makes them feel justified in telling you you can't offer the treatment to your child that the medical community hands down has said is the appropriate treatment. Apart from legal protections for trans rights such as health care, are there things that the governor of Connecticut or other free state governors for lack of better term are doing to sort of mitigate the risks associated with all of the vitriol, all the online sort of whipping up of hatred that you see that is creating incidents, not just in red states, but also outside of them. Is that an ongoing topic of political debate in Connecticut? It should be, but it really hasn't been. And even watching the local news here, oftentimes they want to both sides the issues. So when they do talk about trans issues, they want to give equal talking time to pro and anti-trans. I just I don't understand that thought process. Like how can you take a marginalized community and both sides it to bigots? Both sides it to people who literally are stirring up so much rhetoric. It's putting your family's life in danger and they give them equal airtime and I just don't understand how that happens in my blood starts to boil and I just turn the television off and I because I'll be honest with you. I mean, what we're doing now is we we still have to keep up with what's going on politically. I need to know if we need to plan to to leave the country in the next couple of years. So you you two resettled about a year ago. Is that right? It's it's been almost a year. You you published a book called Joy to the World about a trans girl named Joy in Texas fighting for acceptance in her community, her school, her cheer squad, and the whole community. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone listening, but the book doesn't end with Joy's family feeling no choice but to move to another state. So first question up. What was the timeline there? Did you write the book after you laughter? Were you writing it when you when the decision to move was made? I started writing it about just before we started thinking about having to move. Yeah. Yeah, she was about 10 years old when the process started. We just didn't realize it takes that long to write a book and get it out because we hadn't done it before. She started writing it at 10 years old. And so, you know, some of the things that we see in the book hadn't happened or passed in Texas yet. So I feel pretty confident that we did see the writing on the wall because we kind of nailed it. So what would you Kimberly say to a family in Texas or another state that's hostile to trans rights that's wrestling with whether to stay and fight or relocate. So they read Kai's book and it's all about the long grind of fighting for acceptance, but they also read that in real life, the trauma and the difficulty of living in an environment like that became too much for you and your family to bear. So you did move. So I've been asked what advice I would give to parents in these red states and I, the only advice I can tell them is to, you know, stay hopeful, stay positive and get connected with the queer community because, you know, we need each other. I can't tell someone if it's right to go or to stay because, I mean, financially, I don't know how I ever recoup from this move. Like retirement isn't even anything I can foresee anywhere in my lifetime at this point because of how devastating it is financially to move safe states are hella expensive. And, and the safest zip codes within the safest states are, are just simply not attainable to everyone. And, you know, I'm a registered nurse and my family is, is struggling because it's just so expensive in safe states. Not long after we got here and got into our apartment, I got a call from a mom I had never met in person who had fled from Texas because there was an open investigation against her. And she just drove straight through to Connecticut and she reached out because she didn't know what to do or where to go. And she was just scared and traumatized as were her children. And then she was having to. And for like five cats. So just trying to find housing because of these states that are accepting us aren't taking us in as refugees, then those of us who come here that don't have financial resources, we don't qualify for benefits because we're not citizens of that state. And so she came here with her children and then automatically had no housing and no way to feed them and no way to shelter them and no way to, you know, just all the things that you need when you relocate without a big plan. And so, you know, then her challenge, you know, was trying to convince the children's protective services in this state that she's a good mom and that she left to, you know, escape from children services in Texas because of the governor because of the government. Because her kid is trans. And then falls right into an open investigation here because of one in Texas. So it's very imperative, in my opinion, that these states that are saying that they're safe and welcoming, they need to understand that these plans have got to hurry faster. You know, it's like you don't invite someone to your home if you haven't planned enough resources to have us over. So the discrimination you experienced in Texas actually kind of follows you in a way. If you relocate a can. The most vulnerable among us, right? The most vulnerable among us, those who don't have the financial resources to leave, they're either going to be stuck in these unsafe states or they're going to run away to a new state with even less resources. And, you know, I just, I wish when I become king, I will fix all of it. You know, I don't know what else to say. So the book Joy to the World depicts, I think it's fair to say depicts the loudest and most hateful anti trans voices as being, even though they're loud, a minority, I think of the opposition to trans equality, that for the most part, the people who oppose trans kids playing sport, or health care for trans kids aren't like hardened ideologues or driven by by hatred. Has that been your experience in real life? Because sometimes it feels as if the loudest anti trans voices are drowning out everything else, and that's, that's who they all are. I believe there's a lot of people out there who truly believe that they are trying to protect transgender children because of the false information that they've been given. I don't know how we overcome that. Well, what have you found to be particularly effective ways of reaching people like that? Well, again, back before the Trump presidency, Kai and I would go meet with conservative politicians and we would go to conservative, evangelical churches and meet with the pastors and their staff. And we would speak at small congregational churches across the state of Texas. And the Trump presidency, when all this rhetoric and hatred started to increase, those avenues shut down. So what we do now is we continue to try to put out a positive, hopeful message through her book and through her social media. And, you know, just meeting our neighbors. We come to Connecticut and I'm surprised how many people here have no clue that there's even an anti trans movement. You know, and so I think just continuing to try to tell our story, and there's so many of us, right? When I, when I see some of the other families that have been doing this, you know, alongside of us for all of these years and some of them are doing, you know, public speaking and some of them are, you know, in the movies and some are doing documentaries and we have all these different avenues. And it's almost like you can see all of us parents just like throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks. And I think that that's kind of what we're doing. We're just throwing everything out there. We're, you know, like we have a documentary that's going to be on PBS tonight on Independent Lens. Kai has a book out. You know, she's been in a, in a Netflix show and like, like we're just doing everything that we can, everything that we can. And we just really need people to help us because we've seen this time in history before. I mean, where we're at now with book bands, like we've seen those historically and the things that come after that when when society allows these things like book burnings and book bandings and they let them go. It continues on a trajectory that we don't want to continue on. A theme of a lot of the of the trans activism I've picked up on. I think it's from the ACLU and other similar organizations is that they think the best messengers for persuading that kind of soft opposition or people who think that they're actually helping are the parents. And I think ideally the conservative parents of trans kids, has that applied to your family and has it has it been helpful to you as you've tried to persuade people in your community or other skeptics you've encountered. Yeah. So in the beginning, when Kai came out, it took a year for me to accept her because I was ultra conservative. I was a Republican. I was an ordained minister and one of the largest churches in the United States. I did traveling ministry to do revivals across the the Bible belt. So like I was the poster child for for being a conservative. And that did give us a pretty good, you know, platform for a while. And we still try to to to meet the. I'm going to be honest. I'm I'm not trying. I have to reach conservatives. They're the people that that can really help us. And I think that's the way we make a difference that the Democrats are already the majority welcoming us. But remember, there's still a large portion of the Democrats who are against trans people. There is a portion of the LGBT community that's against trans people. And we we do have to work those areas and but for me, it's the conservatives just trying to to reach those that population, right? Like other mothers with kids who have special needs. Or other needs or they have seemed to be able to to understand better, right? Because ultimately she was born transgender. We didn't choose it. It's not like we marked a box and we wanted it, right? It's just it's the hand that we've been dealt. We're just trying to do our best to make sure that she has a fulfilling life. What would you say or what do you say, maybe to people who are on your side of this fight who hear that and say, you know, that's that's just conformism. And you're saying that to achieve legal and social quality, we have to be or act like people who are unlike us. And we don't need to put our conservative foot forward to appeal to people who fundamentally just don't agree with the place we have in society or the place we're entitled to in society. Every person should use their own personality, their own gifts and their own talents to reach people. I'm not asking someone who is and who has always been liberal to try to act like they're a conservative to reach a conservative audience. I think every single family who has a trans kid in it, they need to be authentic to who they are and whatever their gift or their talent or their opportunity is use that because we have to reach more people. And for people who are on our side quietly, we're going to need you to not be quiet anymore. If I could ask a favor of anyone, it would be when you hear a transphobic comment, ask them, what do you mean by that? Like, call them out in a way that's not aggressive, but ask them, like, what do you mean by that? I don't think that's true or in the comment section and social media. I mean, it's just however you can shut it down. I want you to think about my daughter. When you hear people say things like that, she's 12 years old, she's beautiful, she's articulate, she's herself, she's happy, she's well adjusted. And I just need you to think about her when they say those things and realize that letting those comments go, it's not right. And I had to ask people not to allow those things to go and be challenged. And that goes, I'm guessing, you would say, for politicians too, that plunging your head in the sand and hoping that the sort of bigotry of, well, any bigotry will just vanish on its own because people will see that it's bad are kind of abdicating a moral responsibility. So it hasn't vanished yet. And it's completely getting worse. I mean, this year we saw it opened at Target stores and we saw what happened with Bud Light. And these things are increasing. And it's very scary. It's very scary because I want to know, like, are my neighbors going to be bold enough to help me? Are they going to be bold enough to help an adult trans person? Are they like, what are we doing? We need the help. We need the help. So earlier this year, the Biden administration proposed a new rule under Title IX that forgive me if I'm oversimplifying this, but it would ban outright discrimination against trans athletes in school. But what allows schools and communities to restrict trans participation in sports if the school or the community can articulate if fairness and competition rationale, they say, can't allow trans girls to play basketball because of whatever. Do you think the administration hit the sweet spot of consensus with that rule? Or do you think that they try too hard to placate people who can't be placated? What other marginalized group would the president come out and say, you can segregate them if you can find a reason to? That's all I have to say about that. I mean, I testified in favor of the Equality Act in 2019. Kai and I flew out to DC. They had a hearing in the Education Committee. I just thought something, you know, we have the presidency. We have like, I just, I just thought we would have gained more, more ground politically. And if the administration reached out to you or explained their thinking to the media or whatever and they said, we think this is the best way to keep the federal government out of the issue or we're trying to make sure that we can enshrine equality for trans youth in law without the Supreme Court telling us we're overstepping. And we think that this was as far as we could go. Would you believe them if they told you that that was why they wrote the rule the way they did? So I am not a political strategist. I'm just a mom, right? But I worry about the Supreme Court that we have now. I worry about the Supreme Court we have now, right? I do. Is that their long game? I don't, you know, I don't know. What I continue to say is what other minority group, marginalized group, is it okay for you to explain the ways that it is okay to segregate them from sports, segregate them from a restroom, segregate them from living? What other group, because right now the trans community is under attack, hate crimes, you know, prejudice at your work and in your housing and in your schooling. And I just, I feel like the trans community is the palatable group to hate an attack at every possible level. Even in the comment section on social media, it's just, it's getting worse. The rhetoric is getting worse and it's getting dangerous because when you read those comments, there's actually people behind those comments who think that. And the Equality Act, would the idea behind that legislation have been to basically leave out all the stuff, unless you can articulate a rationale, was the idea there that it would have created sort of a federal right so that the federal government always was on the side of trans youth playing sports in school? Well, the Equality Act wasn't just for trans people, it was for all minority groups to be able to have an equal footing, right? And that's just all we want is for her to be seen as a person. Kai, you just finished your school year, is that right? Yeah. For school year in Connecticut then? Yes. How was it? We struggled through school in Connecticut, but it was for multiple reasons, like just middle school is awkward being the kid that's not from here is awkward, having a southern draw on a really thick accent is awkward. I keep getting my grades cut down because I write words like, one, a gunna, an otter, and y'all. The challenges were more the kind of challenges that you expect to be faced with. Cabbard's, yeah, yeah. And of course, there's the rogue student or two who has anti-trans things to say, but when you're superintendent isn't attacking you and your mayor isn't attacking you and your governor's not attacking you, it's something that you can like kind of figure out a little more, it's not as horrible, right? It's horrible. Thank you guys for spending so much of your time with me with us on this episode. Thank you for letting us be here. Kai has to always say one last thing in all of her interviews. And Dolly Parton, if you're listening to this, call me! I've been waiting seven years! How about this if Dolly Parton calls you because she was listening to this, you have to let us know. For sure. All right, it's a deal. Thank you both so much. Thank you all for having us. Here's how I boil all that down. There's something about US politics and political culture and discourse right now that's making families feel like they have no choice but to pack up their belongings and move to more welcoming places. They're not moving for job opportunities or because the economy in some states is better than others, or they prefer one climate to another or they're looking for more affordable housing options. They're moving because they don't feel welcomed. They don't feel like staying is emotionally healthy and that it may even be a risk to their physical safety and freedom. That's true of many trans families. It's also true of women of childbearing age in much of the country now. It's created this free state ban state contrast that has put many Democratic governors on alert and forced them to create plans to protect their dogs. And all of their citizens for a retribution they might face if they happened to cross the wrong state line. Obviously, this kind of thing isn't totally new in American society, but how many episodes in American history that entailed driving minorities out of their homes and communities do we look back on today with pride. And as Kimberly and Kai both said, there's no easy way to uproot a family under those circumstances. Most families are not rich and just can't do it easily. Zero families, even rich ones, like feeling targeted in their communities and moving from state to state is famously hard for kids, even when they're doing it because dads in the military or mom found a new job. There are whole books and movies about that. And I guess what I'd stress to people who don't feel like they have a stake in the right-wing campaign against trans kids and their parents is that indifference means more kids will have to go through that. And the period of limbo girls like Kai are living through will last longer than it has to. Positively dreadful is a crooked media production. Our executive producer is Michael Martinez.
