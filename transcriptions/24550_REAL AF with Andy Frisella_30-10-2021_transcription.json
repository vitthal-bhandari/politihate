have a special Andy and DJ Cruz the internet and the reason is special is because it's not just Andy and DJ Cruz the internet yeah it is Andy and DJ and Christian Walker Cruz the internet yeah what's up dude so happy to join the party yeah dude happy to have you here I can't wait I can't wait for this for this picture to come out well hey hold on dude before doing some fire what that's been creating some fire on well it's a little bit of controversy yeah we're gonna talk about some controversial things today for sure guys before we get into it I like to remind you of the fee and if you don't know what the fee is the fee is very simple if you get any sort of benefit if it makes you laugh if it makes you think if it makes you have a new perspective if it teaches you something if it's something that you think people should hear do us a favor and share the show okay we don't run ads on the show we don't run ads for the show and you know a lot of people listen to the show for free by the way and gain a whole lot and never pay the fee guys that's just totally un-American right like that is dude come on let's uh yeah share it out if you don't like it don't share it that's all we ask I'm not saying hey share the shit if it sucks it sucks don't share it but um but yeah pay the fee I am super excited though today for this this version of cruise the internet we actually have a full-length episode with my man right here coming out after this but we thought a good way and if you don't know who christian walker is guys you guys are sleeping on the internet okay great guy super funny conservative voice been on all the news stations uh been very popular through the last couple years very outspoken uh in a very different perspective so uh i'm not for sensitive fucks no sensitive don't look me up yeah and uh anti-pc type of person for sure and dude we're just real quick because I want people to follow you tell people where they can get you at so I also have a podcast it's called uncancelable so that's on all the podcast streaming services and then I mainly work on instagram and twitter my handles at christian walker the enewalker is the number one so christian walk number one are cool guys make sure you're following him and you'll understand why as we go through this content yeah so we thought you know for the most part dude like your content is very serious but also comedic you know what i'm saying i think what you do the best is you bring real points and also make them uh relatable and humorous and speak common sense bro right um and i don't think a lot of people expect that from a black gay man uh who is conservative when you're gay well no don't love me i'm not a rainbow flagger so you won't catch me out of fucked up pride festival um but no people try to lump i think people try to lump everyone into different identity groups and i'm a free thinker i think for myself and yeah my my values are very common sense base it's just that our society is so fucked up now that when you speak common sense it's far right you're a far right radicalist no i'm just a fucking american that's it dude and you know the one thing i like about everything that you put out bro is it's fucking all fact it's all true um where did you you know start to discover that you had like more conservative values or or do you think because like how i felt is i was sort of just like you said common sense like okay this is right this is wrong this is what i believe is right this is what i believe is wrong and all of a sudden i got labeled all these things because i wasn't with what everybody else was thinking you know and and now i'm a conservative right you know i think similar to you but also um i really value hard work and i noticed that there's only one side that also values hard work and also values a merit-based system of you know the more work you put in the more you're gonna get out of life um so there's that plus i'm just so anti-woke i'm done with the woke bullshit i'm done with people getting participation trophies because of their skin color because they are attracted to the same gender it's just like let's stop all this and let's go back to working hard and getting what you put in dude i feel like most people feel that way i mean like even like the last couple years we were talking um we were talking yesterday about a couple things you know the hate that society has put out on people who are thinking uh like we think right common sense shit um logically you know has greatly diminished you know what i'm saying what at least on our side um what's it been like for you the last couple years um so i started right after what i call the BLM terrorist attacks because that's what it was they were terrorist attacks um is that really when you started yeah that started last year yeah holy shit bro yeah so it's been crazy because there's no one else who's willing to go against the mob yeah and you've grown tremendously um i think yeah our culture right now values group think and so when someone steps out of line with that not only do they grow extremely fast because they encourage other people to do the same and they're a voice for the voiceless in a sense but um the hate is out of control because as you know they try to silence anybody who doesn't go in line with the narratives right um the hate's been bad but i don't give a fuck because i'm an introvert i don't crave validation from the group or from the mob so i mean it has an affected me right yeah dude i get it man you know i'm introvert too so it's kind of like you insulate yourself from all the shit yeah i don't care i love it yeah i listen at first i was like man what the fuck you guys talking about and then when i started realizing that every single person that doesn't agree with every single thing they say is a racist a misogynist or a fucking white supremacist far right conspiracy theorists like all the things you know like i was like this is a fucking joke like i can't even take it serious yeah they're just labels they place on people to scare them out of talking and when you reach a point where you're like i don't even care what you label me i'm gonna continue speaking they pretty much leave you alone and they become scared of you oh yeah well you see it too because they're they're now just simply attacking you just for having like facts aside just having an opinion i like like for example uh so i'm gonna show this this is not one of the first articles i just wanted to pull this up for you guys real quick uh this is seeing an article hannah hannah gazby fans which one i don't even know who the fuck that is but they're not happy with dave shapil for saying that she's not funny he they're saying dave shapil's getting fucking slammed like you read this article just for literally thinking that somebody's not funny yeah but bro nobody reads this shit that's the thing like dude look see it in gets less fucking views than then then this fucking show you know what i'm saying like so this has become like this shit that these that these media conglomerates are now clinging to has almost become like the inquirer at the grocery checkout like you read this shit you're like holy shit no way and then you're like give me that fucking twix you're gonna walk the fuck out you know like it's it's so ridiculous now that we're just kind of like what the fuck and if dave shapil says she ain't funny i'm pretty sure she probably ain't funny well that's what that's what the comment but that's what i was because when i first saw this article like that's that's what the comments were about it's like her like i seen like no who the fuck is in who the fuck is in this like dave shapil's a fucking guy when it comes to this shit so i'm pretty sure he's pretty accurate and knows who the fuck is funny of him who's not bro we were talking to you last week with dave shapil came out remember when he came out and said hey fuck this shit yeah do you remember what i say you in my text that screenshot of my old fucking post oh yeah yeah you you work that was what 2015 2015 yeah i made a post saying dave shapil's the only man that can save the fucking world yeah yeah yeah it'll be 2015 i got fucking receipts bro you know why because he makes fun of fucking everybody equally bro everybody's got ticks everybody has stereotypes white people are funny black people are fun totally gay people are funny trans are funny like dude we're all fucking got our little things and if we can't talk about those things and give each other shit people like dude there's a i know it's hard for some of the sensitive people who really understand this but 80% of america bonds through talking shit you know what i'm saying like so we're outlawing all these things that allow us when you think about what they're trying to do right and they start banning language and jokes and making it offensive and this and that what they're really doing from a bigger picture is is cutting any sort of commonality between us out so that we cannot relate as humans you know what i'm saying like bro when we get all sitting in a room and talk shit and laugh you walk out a stronger group that's what comedy does for society it's the great equalize for sure bro and you know what and we lost that like for you know fuck dude go back and look at stand-up comedy from the 80s and look at fucking Eddie Murphy okay and now look at this gatsby shit yeah like look at the humor they try to use it commercials this witty super fucking like dry friends humor when you know it's a fucking super bowl commercials they've been trash for our last fucking few years and one thing these of sensitive fucks try to do is they try to pretend not to understand jokes in an effort to attack people and it's like no if it's funny it's funny get over yourself dude that that joke Dave shapil made about the trans community you guys know like the impossible burgers and shit and when he called you know i'm not saying the trans pussy's ain't ain't pussy i'm just saying it's like it's like impossible pussy it's like that was a funny issue it just ain't the same it's just like me like bro if i was a trans person i could still laugh at that that's fucking hilarious dude it's listen man if we don't find a sense of humor like in America again we're fucking we're doomed you know like for real bro like if you really think about how people really interact like i i don't want to hang out with people who are totally stiff and totally like rigid and no sense of humor and afraid to offend anything or say anything that's like interesting because they're afraid of how you might take it guys that's self imposed like prison like really think about that that's thought control that's self censorship you know these tools of of censorship and um you know politically political correctness are instruments of communism and and and what they do is they eliminate our ability to communicate and find common ground uh in the name of possibly offending someone at some point in time but i saw an article yesterday um and i posted it about pita uh saying that they wanted to rename the bull pen and baseball because it was offensive to fucking bulls and like dude this is the shit right like and and i posted it and i said guys this is what you guys don't get like nobody's seeing this from a 10 000 foot view they're seeing it like this well it doesn't fucking matter give it to them okay but what you guys don't understand and what most americans don't understand is that what they're actually trying to do is remove american culture completely things you used to call something or no longer call those things teams that you used to root for or now something else uh you know term history that you used to think was true is now bad like dude what they're doing is ideologically dismantling american culture step by step by step by step and they're doing it through political correctness and through censorship and until you guys start to understand that it's our duty to be politically incorrect okay and talk about truth and talk about things that bro we're going to continue to go down this road we're going to continue to um be at the mercy of the fucking 1% who are fake outrage about fucking everything and none of us are going to be happy so like can we just all agree like all right let's tell some fucked up jokes and like be cool and i think if you expect people to walk around being politically correct because you're overly sensitive you are a fucking adult you need to grow the fuck up and stop thinking everybody needs to watch their speech to protect your feelings how about you mature and be able to handle whatever's thrown your way bro and what's weird about that is like that wasn't always the way you know what i'm saying like that people are like well where's that come from well i told you where it came from a long time ago guys it comes from rewarding people for last fucking place and including everybody on the winning team when they didn't contribute and you know and and pacifying uh children throwing fits and all of the shit that you guys did for the last 20 years which were horrible failed 100% fail cannot be argued parenting strategies you guys created this okay and now you have to fix it you have to say fuck i made a mistake that's not the way it should be and you know what this is what that is instead of hanging on to it because you think you're more virtuous than everybody else because you believe that um you know transgender yeah like you because whatever your beliefs may be transgenders you're not allowed to make a joke about a transgender no you're just ridiculous well dude and we talked about this uh before like who who's the oppressed it's always the people the people you can't make fun of are the oppressors yeah the people who claim to be victims in our culture are always the oppressors because victims can't get people canceled from their jobs victims can't start a riot outside of the netflix office because dave shapelle made a joke no you are the oppressor you're oppressing speech and people who disagree with you wow that's not a victim no it's not and you know we all of us people who still live in the world of logic in fact need to start just going along with our lives because people are like well what's the answer what's the big pivot what's what's going to change what's going to cause it to flip over it's really simple if all of us go out and live our lives and say hey uh why are you throwing a fit and they say well i don't like this you say cool and keep walking you know what i'm saying like that's what you do like we we've been we've been bullied for so long under all these titles that are now like like unfortunately completely worn out and the reason i say unfortunately is because you know when you call someone a racist or a sexist or a transphobe or a homophobe or any of these things what happens is those words become so commonly thrown out and they are by the way that the people you're calling them are it doesn't do anything to them and what it really does is it creates a scenario where when those situations actually exist the the victims don't get any attention because people say well yeah it doesn't mean anything we've devalued some pretty serious terms you know and and that's unfortunate that's why i said unfortunately fortunately um we're we've caught on to your game you know what i'm saying like fortunately we don't give a fuck if you call us a racist because you're not it's not true bro and that's where society has got to get society has to get to a point where people are like yeah okay bro and so anyway how about that game dude it doesn't have to be this you know violence and shit like some of these guys talk about it's just as simple as standing up for yourself you know it's like you said your show's called an uncanceable how do you become uncanceable bro you just say what the fuck's on your mind instead of caring what other people think you can only get canceled if or socially canceled if you start apologizing and caring about other people's validation if you don't care to begin with you just speak truth then what are they canceling you for you're like i'm gonna keep speaking my mind how many people have you had come at you and say shit like oh i'm so disappointed or oh i'm fucking look at what he's saying or this shit like that a million yeah and what a million and i have two million who come up and say i love you you're speaking for me it's just there you go the love always outweighs the hate people don't understand that dude i think it's i think for me it's it's fucking 50 to 1 yeah it's maybe even more it might be 500 now it'll probably be fucking yeah a lot of people have come around yeah dude i was talking to Ian Smith yesterday or two days ago on the phone he had a pretty cool experience um so they had this guy that would call his shop his gym every day and fucking tell him he's a piece of shit fuck you like this went on for months and months and months well he the same fucking guy calls and and and asked to talk to Ian and fucking apologize to him oh wow yeah whoa and said dude i don't know what was going on but like now i feel like total shit because i recognize that like this shit is out of control and you were trying to stop it all from the beginning like dude it was like a pretty powerful thing because he he voice message me and was telling me about it and like i was just thinking i'm like man society's finally gotten to a point where these people who have you know had the luxury of freedom right we've had it so cushy and so nice and so soft that we can attack each other for meaningless shit right and now these people with because of what's happening in the world right like our paychecks aren't going as far uh you couldn't get milk today you know you know i'm saying like people are now seeing oh shit uh it's more than just my feelings and it's way more important maybe i got misled and dude that's kind of a beautiful thing to start seeing man it is yeah well we don't have any more time to give have you guys have you been seeing that too i've been seeing a lot of just different you know people that you start identify as in these mob-like communities whether that's the ghetto trash BLM or LGBTQ i call it the rainbow cult start coming to me and saying you know i don't identify i'm an individual i i'm kind of finished with being lumped into these categories when all we share is one facet of our identity and i i'm an individual so i kind of agree with what you say isn't that the solution to all of this so 100 individual thought individual economy you know i'm saying like dude we have all these politicians all these people out there running for politics and they they're quick they're so quick to say i'm a democrat i'm a republican i'm a this how about this man like how about are you a good person do you have a good moral center um have you made enough mistakes in life to know that there's between right and wrong are you willing to look at every single issue as it comes and make a decision based on that issue and the circumstances of that issue instead of saying i'm all for this or all for that i mean dude to me that sounds pretty fucking basic shit right and it seems like our country's truly lost it i agree man i agree and i would say also too for every one of those guys that reached out to me and there's probably 10 000 more that just haven't haven't had the courage just yet during their own call yeah you know i they're out there oh yeah definitely out there yeah dude i've had i've had thousands of people message me and be like bro i thought you were full of shit or i thought you were this or i thought you would just some loud mouth which dude okay got me there like but uh you know i was just this jacked fucking yeah well yeah yeah yeah hey that's a little bit i'll take you know but uh but yeah man you know it's cool to see people starting to see it it's unfortunate the state that our country's in but it's almost i also have this like weird feeling like this had to happen yeah because you could have never convinced those people through words no one thing also to take that step a step further to guys like because i'm sure a lot of our listeners and viewers like you guys have those same experiences right because you've been fucking trying to tell your your buddies and your fucking care workers right the important thing here though is when those situations happen when those conversations happen when those phone calls happen except them in forgive yeah you know i'm saying like oh yeah bro that's so important dude i think that's a great point because people don't talk about that because i see a lot of people who are you know because it's easy we're all good listen man and i do it a little too i do too bro because it's fine yeah but christian you know why we do that because we took so much so much use yeah less fucking however bro i've been getting this heat this exact heat since 2000 fucking 13 right you know what i'm saying like i like i've been warning about dude if you go back and read my post from all the way back then dude i was talking about the same shit you know and now here we are i think it getting closer and closer to some sort of precipice of awakening to what's actually happening and um it feels good yeah so like dude it does like if i talk a little shit like hey fuck you guys like i still will give you a hug if you come in and i still might even talk shit to you later like you know the fucker you fucking thought back oh i won't forget it yo i won't forget that no i'm gonna remember that but like it is important because i think that's also what's holding a lot of those other people from speaking up dude listen because i know they're you're still with me you're way worse bro this country's been through way worse this country during the civil war we had family fighting its fucking family yeah okay we've been through way worse we can heal from this there's no question but it is going to take some growing pain that's right and it's going to take a lot of discipline from certain people to not rub shit in and it's going to take a lot of open-mindedness for people to say and humility to say man you know i was kind of talking about things i didn't really know uh or or they were like bro they were lying to you and they've been lying to you and and i've said this the whole the whole time this has been going on i i i can't blame someone for falling for it because it's a it should be at least a reasonable thought that here in this country at least in this country that what we see on tv as the news should be based in actual fact and not be manipulated not be exaggerated not be overblown to create hysteria not be divisive don't listen we have we should have a reasonable expectation for truth from the media and unfortunately um we haven't been getting that and that's why you know when we look at headlines from cnn they get more and more and more exaggerated and more and more crazy because dude they're grasping for that that uh sensationalism you know for real just like the inquire like yeah you'd walk through and they're doing what they can to catch the my balls that's right you got to click on that you got to keep business for them dude you're your eyeballs and they've fucking dollars and they fucked all their customer base so like if this was my business and here's how i'd be assessing it i'd say well my business would never reach that point but if let's say i was assessing it as a business i'd say well you guys weren't aware of how intelligent your customers are you tried to pull too much fucking shit on them and now they don't trust you at all and if you want to ever be trusted again you're probably gonna have to clean house get rid of all your personalities start with new ones and start a new narrative of the truth and stop being so biased like you guys run in these media companies that that you have to think of it you cannot force your will on people that are not willing to accept it so you have to understand that the people are speaking with their fucking views and their eyeballs and their attention and what they're telling you is we don't want your shit right you know and that's very clear so until we stop um and well until they stop doing that you know i think it's just going to continue down the down the shitter for them you know people are going to lose advertising dollars they're going to go broke is what happened yeah which is the that was maybe for the first time we'll see a media bailout by the by the by the well fuck we saw we never know well did you never know i i think you were going to use one of these yeah let's go ahead and start with that one and we'll talk about that so guys you guys know how this work this is cruising in and that so i'm going to put up some headlines we're going to discuss them and uh just go from there so this first one that uh i mean i don't know if you guys have seen this yet now normally i don't know the headline but i did know this one because we were all abuzz about it before the show and then dj said i was going to bring it up on the show so that's how come i know but now normally i'm not supposed to know but i would have been prepared anyway this is so ridiculous yeah so we were talking before right here in you know in in good old mozzura with uh with our big giant smores fires and tractor trucks and all of that shit the first yeah the rest of state the transphobe state just moors outfit oh i got it you get a clean i got it all right i got it the first boy to win homecoming queen at rockbridge makes his mark beyond the crown so a high school emissary rockbridge high school um they've just elected the first homecoming queen that is a biological young man so not biological as in like he's transition now no this is he's still identifying as a man yeah he is he is a full blown man in address who beat a woman for homecoming queen you guys want to play the video please welcome back rock bridge senior Zachary wilmore is the new homecoming queen they won that title friday and becomes the first boy in school history to win the honor his victories were a reflection of the impact he's made at the school it's kathryn murk joins outside of rockbridge high school kathryn has influenced started long before friday night noa before he won the crown Zachary wilmore was posting videos like these to his tiktok page in a lot of these videos he's talking about the dress code rules at rock bridge high school he's being noticed by his administrators and honored by his peers it's a tradition that's been around a long time your 2021 homecoming queen Zachary will not everyone gets a moment like this it was literally like a dream but the fact that um that like i won it was just really special to me rockbridge senior Zachary wilmore won the title of this year's homecoming queen he's the first boy to do so at a school i took a really quick instagram poll which i was like should i be king or queen and they were like queen would look pretty on the sash and i was like you're so correct so i chose queen hey guys we're live from rockbridge his decision for the queen spot goes beyond just the sparkly dress queen is a term used by gay men specifically i'm as an endearing thing it felt really good as the parent of an lgbtq student who is sitting right next to me that they felt that inclusivity and then like just ever no one gave me a hard time about it in the hallways all i got was like just compliments however this isn't the first win for the teenager with over a million followers on tiktok will more has become an influencer online he's shown the outfits he wears to school that got him dress code violations a lot of the times i did feel like they could target students and i felt a little bit targeted let's talk about what to do if you want to change your school's dress code the district says they're making efforts to change the dress code before will more graduates they put me in charge of creating the new dress code which is really nice i originally made it because i was like hey i am upset that this is happening to me um and oh i stopped there sure i am i can't watch anymore first of all like the the fucking the fucking outfits looks like if you if a girl was wearing his outfits they dress code he looks like a prostitute yeah all right keep going i just had to say that like bro you get set home as a female for that shit yeah that's just like this is my story and eventually it did create change i'm a savage these kids are part of mainstream community and culture at this point as well they should be as time goes on this tradition looks different at rockbridge i was the final stepping sound and now more people can experience this moment just for me to be like people do like me like i feel happy Zachary will graduate from rockbridge high school this year as for his future plans he told me it was a pop it's like his time and he's our own camera he wants to pursue fashion design that was that was discussed i think it's disturbing like for real bro because think about like this like what about like what bothered me the most like what bothered you the most about that video what bothered me the most is that he i sound like a feminist which i'm not but this is a spot reserved for a woman and a man beat her at being a woman and it's being celebrated by the society that claims are all about women yeah it doesn't make sense and it's shit like this that wakes people up who have been fooled like we were just talking about it shit like this that winds up waking people up because for a year we heard about oh if trump gets back in or whatever it's going to be an anti-woman society and now we have men beating women left and right coming queen yeah in sports in the olympics in the ufc ring i mean this is fucking crazy and dude i don't know man like hearing those little girls scream for that kid not understanding what they just cheered for not understanding that dude little girls grow up with the dream of possibly winning something like that like i know that sounds shallow a little bit and people might say oh it's so shallow just like little girls wake up or dream about being married and shit like those things are big deals to their life and we're removing those things for the sake of what narrative is popular right now you heard what that woman said she said well these people are mainstream now and like they feel inclusive my lgbt son felt included well had he run for homecoming king in one i don't even think that would be even it would be cool like that'd be cool yeah like cool dude dude yeah like but the fact that we're taking a spot from a woman that's the problem and that's the problem with all this shit it's it's creating unfair situations for women it's destroying potential uh goals and dreams that women have worked their entire lives for like i think about in sports you know my brother uh and i both played sports our whole lives and and even we were little kids dude we didn't do anything else like we didn't have a normal childhood we put fucking sports and these girls who are high level female athletes they do the same shit they're working they're playing soccer or softball or whatever the fuck it is basketball that they play they're playing you know a hundred games of fucking summer they're doing all this training they're giving up all these things and then you know they go to the olympics and lose to a dude or go to a wrestling tournament and and you know what i'm saying or like whatever it is they do and like dude this this shit right here should not sit well with anybody for that reason and alone it's not about like like and and dude these these causes have creeped their way in under the threat of being called a bigot or a homophobe or a transphobe and that's why nobody says anything and everybody's just like oh cool and they go along with it and this is why people think like social issues are always a slippery slope because all this gay shit or pushing the gay agenda it should have been done after gay marriage was legalized we shouldn't hear a thing about oh gays being oppressed in society whatever because gays have the rights of everybody else we went from gay marriage to now this wasn't even a trans person this was just a gay guy stealing a spot from a woman and i see that in society a lot now i see a lot of feminine men and no issues i mean i'm not some masculine man i i totally understand that but a lot of feminine men kind of trampling over women and stealing their spots and that's not right and and don't don't ask why there's homophobes genuine homophobes when if that was your daughter who just lost out to a gay guy and you already had something against gays what do you think you're going to be now or even if you didn't row even if you didn't have anything against gays totally and that's your little girl and let's just say it's like homecoming queen okay for me it's like yeah whatever okay but it's principal that's right but like i think of it in terms of like a competition right right like think about like these girls and their dads who and it doesn't matter what fucking race they are where they come from what their background is motherfucker if you're a high level athlete you fucking work okay and you've had help from your family belief from your family from probably for most of those people you know and if you think about like parents right like and that girl goes to her competition and loses to a fucking man that to me that's going to make people resentful it just 100 yeah and and just like you know these things where the education system is then bent around and we're getting into other topics now but like when a small and i've talked about this on the show plenty of times but like when the trans community is pushing their education which they represent 0.5 percent of the population and they're pushing their educational agenda because the teachers want to pretend that they're woke and that they're moral and that they're just and that they're on the leading edge of shit when in reality they're just the people who couldn't execute real life let's be fucking honest okay and these people are like you don't think that that's going to create more and to me like when i look again i see i'm of the opinion that all of this shit is pushed so hard to completely remove our identity to completely weaken the social structure of our country and when you think of it like that like what's this real what feelings does this really create it's almost like dear it's on purpose their purpose yeah yeah and it's sad man it's it's not like you know and just another note on him like there used to be rules that you had to follow and no matter how big of a tantrum you threw the rule was the rule get over it follow the rules this guy's dressing like a prostitute dressing like a hooker yeah complaining about the dress code policies no the dress code policies are because we're not for sexualizing children you can't come to school dressed like you're working at the strip car down the road i was doing an interview just so you know if you didn't see the video in like booty shorts and thigh high as a skirt yeah whatever it was i didn't notice but i yeah what was it it was it was a short skirt which is even worse than booty shorts and then he's wearing thigh high boots okay white ones like there's only one place i see nose before yeah it wasn't in fucking school okay so like dude and what's that dude and they bended the rules for him now he's in charge of the dress code so we're gonna have all the little girls walk through high school looking like that like dude that's that's demoralization of society that and it's not like demoralization in terms of like ruining the love for our country i'm talking about actually removing more moral structure from our civilized society dude and dude that's not that's gonna end bad like i think you've said this you're like hey as an adult or whatever if you want to be sexual that's on you do it on your own time but with our kids yeah big difference yeah no dude for sure like i don't judge anybody how they want to dress or walk around or what they want to wear i don't care either but like when you're in fucking high school and they're promoting the shit um there should be some structure there yeah you know i'm saying i think everybody agrees with the hell 100 percent i would question anybody who doesn't agree with children shouldn't be sexualized oh yeah really okay with the my mind i've already i've just in my mind if you're okay with any of that shit to me you're a parent of all yeah like like to me that's just how i look at it because there's no there's no justification on it there's none i can't think of one logical reason while that will be okay you know this fucking high school there's still you know 12 13 year old kids there but let's change your name in the bullpen because it's offensive you know you see our climate change time it changed while while our kids are learning to cut their penises off to be just and woke and transgender and that's going to get them the new job not only that bro no i will i will i will i'm gonna give a four star fucking general position in our fucking government yeah does that dude cut it off oh did he i don't know i think it's illegal to ask no but you can ask if you got a vaccine or not yeah dude that that's another thing like the whole hypocrisy of all of this woke shit like how can you be a feminist and woke and then be for uh lgbtq oh uh elemental p shit like this you know what i'm saying you fucking can't be about it you know it doesn't go anymore it's just like saying you know you know i'm i'm BLM i love black lives and all of that but you also support this vaccine mandate shit like or or pro i'm pro choice but i'm not pro choice on the vaccine yeah like dude that's that's the thing i'm actually like like i'm happy with this is because it's creating so much like it's exposing hypocrisy 1000 and people can see that and so like all right cool i mean by whatever means you got to fucking wake the hell up whatever it is if this is the means it's going to get you to get get it cool you know yeah all right hell on number two so this one i saw this and i'll be like i got a lot of people oh man i'm not happy with this oh man people are mad about this and they should be as they should be absolutely i just hate the justification so the headline is this guy so us is in talks and i hate how they didn't try to put by biden is in talk um to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to families that were separated at the border not just families that were separated on the border under biden because there's actually a shit ton more that has been separated under biden but the government is considering payments of four hundred and fifty thousand dollars per person that were affected by the trump administration zero tolerance policy in 2018 what in the actual fire so basically the government saying americans can go to hell so we shut down all of your businesses for covid we don't we you have to wear a mask going everywhere so many mom and pop shops that are the backbone at least of the california economy and i'm sure of the country you all have to shut down and we're gonna pay hundreds of millions of dollars to people who broke into the country or we're trying to break into the country that's derangement yeah we're not supposed to say retarded but what do you call that retarded i listen no argument for me bro this shit is fucking out of control think of like like what about what about all these military guys that went overseas and lost legs and lost fucking arms and lost their lives yeah and our homeless military families or that the people that all the people of fucks walk right by all these people who just got their livelihoods taken from them because they wouldn't take a shot that hasn't been studied right you know i'm saying like what the fuck is going on it's insane i've seen a lot of the black community really really upset they should be 100 100 but but a lot more really really i mean because dude here we are it's almost november we're almost 11 months into this administration right and we've had the alphabet bill that was passed we've had the anti-asian hate bill that was passed we've had like all of these other things that have been passed and the black community's still waiting there for the fucking crumbs and trying to realize or figure out why the fuck they're not getting help what about all these motherfuckers that voted for Biden exclusively because he said he was gonna wipe the debt exactly you know and so it's like i mean there's your fucking student debt motherfuckers there is yep yes yes yep well and and the black community was manipulated into voting for Joe Biden but Joe Biden was doing terrible in the primaries and he went to south carolina north carolina i think it was south carolina and representative jim cliber and told the black community we're all in for joe biden vote for joe and he only won the primary and then went on i mean i don't really believe in the election but he won the primaries because of the black community and joe's done nothing he manipulates he manipulated his voters the entire way through man and so it's like i mean just see a more shit like this all again this is just the left showing the true colors and i think people are able to see it um at this point and and you know i'm glad that they're able to see it i'm glad that they're upset that's great but now what well and then now what is the scary part right right like because like now it's like oh fuck we're only nine months ten months into this shit and this motherfucker has destabilized our country that's what's happening one hundred percent and and now we have this huge micro chain coming up through mexico right now biggest one of history you know dude there's all kinds of theories about what the fuck that's about they've already caught chinese nationals afghanney nationals fucking uh iraqi nationals trying to pass the border okay like bro there's been two over two hundred thousand saying like these people come in bro and what's to say they're unvided they're unchecked yeah what's this what's not vaccinated well you know that only applies to fucking that only applies to conservatives right you know um but you know what about these people possibly potentially getting armed by someone or what about these people taking over little towns or broke because like we are literally being invaded through the border and it's it's disturbing to think about and talk about because uh who the fuck is going to stop them like nobody stopping them you know what i'm saying so what i am a little concerned about what's going to actually happen pretty soon because when you have millions of people coming across the border unchecked and you don't know where the fuck they are but then you got the patreon act on the other hand where they're going to spy on a fucking american parents yeah on parents this is fucking bullshit backward shit and i do feel like sometimes and i'm just being real dude like sometimes i do feel like this is some sort of fucking operation because like every yeah every fucking thing they do is clearly designed to destroy the country yeah and the only people that aren't getting it are the people who are still believing that these people are good people and that and that's your pride in your ego in the way of your actual brain and it's disturbing like when is this going to stop and for anybody who kind of looks at this immigrant thing um illegal immigrants and goes oh well we're we're helping people out no we do help people out because we take in the most legal immigrants of any country in the world we do our part plus we have an asylum program so no you have to come in the right way you don't get to break into the country and it has nothing to do with we don't want to give you opportunity it has to do with we have citizens in a country to protect and take care of our citizens come first so you either wait in line or you don't come in dude you know what i think this is like i've been thinking about this since i saw the headline last night i think that this is a tactical headline that they put out to get people who are marginalized in any capacity by the in the united states to scream for their 450 000 and so what i think they're trying to do is to put this headline out to get people to say you know uh i was i was oppressed our group is oppressed uh you know we need reparations we need uh we need uh um compensation for the the attacks on on on homosexuals and and so dude like when i see this as a bigger picture is like they're giving the person its most least deserving the money so that the rest of the people instead of like thinking oh shit this is a crazy idea that they'll never do that they actually start screaming for it instead well that's so we've seen how you know the minority voices can make some huge what that's what i'm saying like dude it's only in but i i don't listen i've already seen 15 fucking uh other personal celebrities saying what about our group right what about our group right what about that's that's what they want you to do so that they can then fund that group and then own your ass completely right you know who you gonna vote for that's a surprising motivation that's my opinion of what i think they're doing yeah that was brilliant yeah i i think these people are pretty smart and pretty calculated on what they try to do they know how to use the media they know exactly what to say and how to say it and uh you know this is stirring up some shit and and i think that's that's what i think they're trying to accomplish with that i don't think they'll ever do this no but i think what they're gonna do is get people to scream for that shit because um you know with the midterms coming up and shit like that you know if you could change the social climate to we want free shit again well here here come here comes the promise to start getting rolling that's right that's right that's right and we have to be smarter than that like dude those are not free things those dude it's the last since 2008 your motherfuckers have been out there wanting free shit and look at our fucking country now versus 2008 it's a fucking but those of you that don't know it's not better you see all these things that say oh like i saw these headlines this morning um uh wages are up for the first time in 20 years yeah they are do you know why wages are up wages are up because inflation's up and the cost of a gallon of milk they used to be two dollars is now fucking 10 and responsible businesses like myself we go back and we pay our people more money to compensate for the cost of living rise okay so they're not actually making any more money they're not getting more goods and return for their money it's just responsible companies are recognizing that their employees will literally not be able to fucking survive if they don't raise their fucking wages okay so it doesn't it's a fake headline these people are pumping cash in the economy to be able to claim oh look what we did for the economy the stock the stock market's the highest it's ever been wages are the highest ever been unemployment's low blah blah blah which none of that shit is actually true it's all a fuck job on statistics you know when you know the people saying the statistics can be manipulated this is what they mean yes and like dude that's the first thing they teach you in fucking college statistics classes like hey look dude a smart person with statistics can make you believe anything exactly yeah you know so we have to be smart dude like this shit is anti-american come 100% you know it's anti what you were saying bro like merit-based winning competition you know it's fucked up man yeah all right the third one third and final before we get to our two-thumb section so this is actually some really good news this makes me happy and i'm sure this is gonna make a lot of people happy so the Biden administration has temporarily been barred from firing employees seeking vac ex-vax exemptions after a dc judge issues in the junction um until this applies to all federal employees and it also applies to the military so this was just passed through by a judge um he granted an injunction um for all this anti-vax or people who are vaccine hesitant as they like to say um i like this i think this is a fucking win i mean while it's temporary we don't know how long this may last it's a win yeah sort of i mean the fact that it's even a discussion is a fucking problem i agree yeah like the fact that we're even to a point where we're talking about people being literally fired over a vaccine and then the fact that you are happy about that headline yeah that's brainwashing we should have never fucking accepted this from the beginning this is why i've been so vocal for the last fucking two years bro the mass the shutdown it should have been we're not doing that on day one yeah and now you guys are understanding after the last two years and what's happened in the last nine months why the fuck i was so vocal about it because now we're at a point where you a very conservative smart man is now excited about this bullshit fucking win this is not a win it's not a win you know these people out there protesting these vaxmandates and they say oh we won they're gonna test this every week it's not a fucking win yeah it's not a fucking win and you say oh cool we get to we get to keep our jobs no motherfucker this is fucking this is all again this is against everything america has ever fucking stood for and we can't take these little wins and take our little sliver of fucking satisfaction and go balls of soup yeah yeah yeah bread let me bread ration please sir like bro that's what that's what people are acting like with this and so while i agree with you that it's definitely a step in the right direction we should have never fucking been here in the first place and that's what i will continue to stand for because this and that's what all of you guys need to get to you know like these little things where it's like oh well mass are optional at school it should never be a fucking issue like if dudes if people do want to wear a mask cool but like no wear it and leave me alone that's it and and we and now we're at a position and this is the fucked up part guys now we've normalized shutdowns we've normalized the closing of businesses we've normalized this this sort of reaction to a pandemic which which is what i said two years ago and so now you know just like they're doing in australia where they turn on and turn off the fucking lockdowns at will that's what is going to be the the method from here on out unless people make actual legislation that bans it which which is something for your dad to talk about but yeah he needs to be at all town christian's dad is running for senate in georgia uh hershia walker you guys might know him maybe yeah you guys might have heard of him uh but you know uh well he will absolutely be running on that i haven't heard any people talk about that like we have you guys out there running for office dude we have to push our our our demands to a point of you know before any of this happened because we cannot allow the cdc or federal agencies or the government or the media to shut down our entire economy and ruin lives and get people fired and all of this shit that's happened none of this should ever happen and here's a thing what stupid people don't really seem to understand is once you give up a little bit of your freedom it is so difficult to get it back so we have to fight like hell right now yeah take out our rights back and to unnormalize the shutting of businesses down the vaccine mandates this can't continue on and when we get it back if we get it back which i'm hopeful and confident that hopefully we can uh we can't we can't lose our way again or it'll be over yeah and and we need guys like us and like your dad and other people listening to get involved to not allow these little things to be our little bread crumbs that we walk away with like this is a free country and i'm committed to freedom i'm not committed to privilege all right and and doesn't matter what you decide to do in this country it doesn't matter what the issue if you're going to ask me what i believe i'm going to always tell you i'm aside with the fucking freedom always always always always and and dude we need to get back to that bro we're gonna fucking lose this country you know what so what's our last one so guys it's time for two thumbs so two thumbs are you familiar with this i'm not so so so i show a headline i put it up there and it either gets two thumbs up like yeah ganonia or gets two thumbs in the butt because it's completely garbage um so that's what this has this thumbs up like we'll talk about it no like thumbs up we approve and if it's shit it's two thumbs in the butt got it all right yeah because then you got some shitty thumbs all right all right let's see it all right here we go you guys i'm i'm sure you've already seen it but oh come on Facebook change is too easy easy as fuck man well i mean we've been doing we've had two thumbs uh hold on three we won't even read a headline let's see if we all agree on this on three you're gonna say thumbs up or thumbs in the butt one two three thumbs in the butt yeah thumbs in the bro facebook changes facebook changes its company name to meta now i don't even know what the fuck that means um yeah what shady shit are they doing dude that's what i'm saying i'm like it's scared me when i saw it yeah i mean like so so facebook's changing its its company name as it shifts the focus the the metaverse um and confronts wide ranging scrutiny of the real world harms from various platforms after a whistleblower leaked hundreds of internal documents oh they're gonna be censoring us so everybody get ready to get your facebook deleted yeah if you speak out against the regime well dude and that's what that means that like did you watch the video the whistle blower oh no i haven't seen it no no you don't watch it uh yeah we can say it's sad dude it's sad it's a sad video like it's a guy who clearly doesn't relate to people like being forced to fucking say some shit on camera it's uncomfortable to watch like somebody's coaching him on his hands like it's just so crazy it's time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do to reflect who we are and what we hope to build i am proud to announce that starting today our code i'm just now this way right our mission remains the same still about bringing people together our apps and their brands they're not changing either and we are still the company that designs technology around people hey and welcome to connect today we're going to talk about the metaverse starting with the most important experience of all connecting with people i don't know fucking dangerous weird but i saw this and i just thought it was fucking perfect yeah is that real though i saw that too where he's got sweet baby rays i'm the fucking i'm the fucking i mean what do you want to tell me on their shelves bbq songs about right if he does if he's down with sweet baby rays dude he might be all right he might be real okay sweet baby rays is good shit i don't know why it's on his shelf though but dude like watching this shit man it like part of it like it makes me angry because it's like dude fuck you because you're 30 fucking six years old and you think you know everything for everybody and then part of it's like this dude has been living under this intense spotlight since he was fucking 18 years old yeah then it's like i feel sorry for him because clearly he has trouble relating yeah to regular people but it's because he's never been a regular person and like so like dude i have some empathy for the guy like he's trying right like he's been put in this role like and he's like man you know i don't think to my in my opinion i don't think the dude's is evil is like what these other people try to make like i think these other guys are way more evil same but i think i think he's you know i think he's an ignorant person to the way people really are and he's running along his vision unaware of what most of the people are like that uses pop yeah bro and like i think that's you know it's interesting because i don't think his platforms will survive what's happened over the last two years and people laugh and they think i'm crazy but i they're huge right they're huge companies and all the shit but we're at a point now where a majority of the of the population of america can't comfortably say any of their beliefs on his platform and like they're censoring me okay i'm a big customer of their brand they censor all kinds of other people who contribute money to their brand and it's not responsible in any way the reason freedom of speech works is because the stupid fucking ideas get washed out right you know so if our ideas are really that stupid and that this um your ideas would be winning but they're not winning you know it's the opposite of what barack said the other day of his speech yeah he's like oh bring us your ideas we're not allowed to bring us your ideas motherfucker you censor what we're allowed to say so so if there's only one idea and it's only your side of course you think it's the best because you don't want to hear our shit and and then he's like and he told a projection do you see it yeah it was ridiculous in Virginia yeah and he was like oh it's like they're trying to rig the election because they don't want you to have voter ID and i'm thinking in my head and i even posted this it's like okay how did all the people in the crowd get there where how did they get a hotel room right how did they fucking drive their cars to see him like the people you're talking to bro all have ID and who are these people on the conservative side that don't want uh black people yeah like who are they who are these people on the conservative side that think this is some this is this is a manufactured fucking narrative that nobody on the right or the middle believes like everybody says and then left to everybody says hey guess what it's a pretty good idea that that every american citizen she have to show proof that they're a citizen to vote we all believe that or those people breaking in from south america are going to be voting in our elections which is illegal that's what they want though and we all know that that's why they're giving them 450 grand a country right that's what they want and the 450 grand if they do end up giving it the going back to that topic the reason that they will be doing that will be because they have lost the black voter base for the most part yeah and they've lost the latino voter base for the most part and a lot of people say oh you're selling conspiracy because no dude they're trying to bring in people get them sucking on america's titties okay and then fucking make them vote for it yeah and that's what we're the guy i have actual numbers here in order to cheat right yes and so like dude you you guys guys you guys have to look at the 10 000 foot view man like why are they allowing this why are they doing this why would they do that and i don't know man like when i look at this dude like sometimes like literally like sometimes i fucking hate him sometimes i feel sorry for him and i want to like put my arm around and be like bro look this is how you do it you know what i'm saying and then but like dude we cannot as a society continue to allow 30 something year old men with no real life experience okay and that goes for fucking dorsey it goes for zuckerberg it go uh i think google dude is a little bit older but still okay these guys have been doing this since they were young 20s and they were all celebrated these guys were instant billionaires when they're 20 years old do you really think that a person with that perspective of growing up at 20 21 22 with being one of the richest humans on the planet and the most power on the plant do you guys really believe that they have the perspective to make decisions for all of common america no no man they fucking don't you're fucking your book club fucking people dude listen bro it is what it is people are nerds some people are this or some people are that i don't really give a fuck dude i got friends that are fucking all kinds of different friends and some of my best friends are the biggest fucking nerds you know i'm saying and but like dude i wouldn't trust them when making the decisions of cultural relevance in our society and that's where we've gotten to you know like when you allow people to censor really like they've used these independent fact checkers to censor every fucking thing they don't like because that's what happens how is it an independent fact checker when only one side gets fact checked dude doesn't really make any friends what's crazy is right now if you make a post if you make a post in your story that's that's against their guidelines but you post that fucking get vaccinated sticker it will not get a warning label oh we found a bug in their fucking system yeah bro yes so if you post hey the fucking vaccine is at least today they might change it by the time the show comes out if you post hey if you get that vaccine uh it'll fucking kill you right like which isn't true we all got to agree that it's not going to kill everybody just most people just most well they wouldn't want to kill off their voter base so no way yeah right so so so what i'm saying is it's like and by the way i'm just kidding about the most people who fucking freak out it's almost most yeah dude so it's almost most it's most of the most it's most dude so somewhat all but yeah it's not everybody yeah so dude but like i fuck up the guy what was i gonna say oh the sticker that's right thank you dude so the sticker uh if you put the sticker in on that same post it won't get fucking fact-checked local covalable that's fucking crazy okay it's me on my story in a hour yeah like dude in like i you know what sucks too and i'm just gonna share this publicly because like i'm getting shadow man like super hard like 10% of my normal traffic on my story and you know we talked we have a big account with facebook and instagrams because we spent a lot of money there and uh the guy's running the shit like that or like having the answer to us they're embarrassed like they're not like oh yeah this is you shouldn't do this or that they're like bro it's out of control like their conversations are like bro it's almost like it's like it's just my job thing you know what i'm saying but they're also like bro that's not right like they're they the guy's actually doing the shit that we're working with to get this fix which they'll get a fix because they're good dudes but they're embarrassed of it you know what i'm saying it's gross and by the way i got a DM yesterday that someone one of my followers tried to follow you when they got a warning label four times are you sure you want to follow this person they've posted misinformation oh so he's posted his opinion yeah and so he's posted some sex yeah so what they do is and what i figured out is they actually retroactively scan your page every 90 days so what you post today okay um they won't check until 90 days from now and then what they'll do is they'll come back and look at your shit and say that was that was fucking not fact and they'll ban you for for for things that were in dispute at this point in time today if you post them you understand what i'm saying yeah yeah and then they become not true they will they will fucking ding your page and shut your traffic down for things that you said in the past that didn't become true which is ironic because everything i fucking said has come true right they went that they were i had a force them to show me what they were censoring me for one of the posts was um that i cited a study that said mass were ineffective motherfucker the studies show that studies on studies like so now we have fact checkers these independent fact checkers who are supposedly not funded by these groups but that are almost almost almost mostly funded by these yes that consistently side with them a million percent and they're making decisions based on things that if the evidence isn't good enough for them you understand yeah like that's not okay bro are these or you guys like dude there's so much fucking shit going on right now that nobody has the exact facts right well the funny thing that i find because i mean i get them all my fucking posts all the time like right and so like i'll look at them oh you know so this this post is missing context but then you when you actually go into the fucking fact checks they literally have nothing to do with what you actually fucking post it like does that make sense so like i'll post this meme like this this this meme is missing context right and you actually click it up you open what they're saying is missing context has nothing to do with what i actually post it now that happens every fucking time yeah so it's like it's just like they're putting out these catch-all fucking messages and hopes that no bro people see that all i think on the biden thing that we just talked about the four hundred fifty thousand dollars yeah someone said someone said biden biden's given four hundred and fifty thousand dollars to immigrants what the fuck blah and this person was ex-military it had a fact check sticker on the bottom that said biden has not decided if he's going to get exactly like bro they just try to change it just a little but that's the game these fuckers are playing and i i personally don't believe that zucker bird wants them to be like that no they're a little overboard that's what i think i think these people are running wild with their with their fucking power and what i imagine on the other end is some you know it's some computer program run by somebody who's fucking probably got purple hair it's like fuck this guy fat yeah it is what it is like dude i've moved all my followers on my email list anyway you know i'm saying so like it's it's uh it is what it is like i'm not mad about it but it's just like to hear the embarrassment in these guys voices about their own company that's what that's one of them things that makes me realize like they're crumbling right now that's whose fat check exactly and i get a lot i get a lot of jing's for hate speech and listen there's either free speech or there's not hate speech is free speech it's a made up concept and hate speech is just you disagreeing with my perspective or what i believe in like i there's nothing hateful about me speaking my beliefs it's a made up term bro hate speech wasn't a term when i was growing up bro if like if you said dumb shit or if you said ignorant shit or you said racist shit guess what happened to you people said that motherfucker's a dick and you probably got your ass yeah and that is what happened you get your ass kicked and then you would say you know what man i'm sorry i probably shouldn't say that no more and dude like like like that's that's how society his in nature is run and it was great there's a checks and balances for your words and your actions yeah and and like dude people give me shit about this because it's like violent but it's like dude we went wrong when people stopped punching other motherfuckers in the face i agree no for real dude and they started using weapons and shooting people and this like all of the shit well when i was a kid like and dude i said fucked up shit before guess what happened i got fucking dealt with right you know what i learned to do i do not stick that shit you know what's even funnier bro is it through those conflicts that i had with people that were different than me after the fact we actually became way closer because dude those conflicts usually end with a handshake or saying hey you know what bro i listen i went a little overboard it is what it is and they lead to an actual understanding resolution because no one wants violence every fucking day over stupid shit and so that's how my generation grew up like i guarantee you talked to your dad that's how it works oh totally you know what i'm saying and bro we we've got to get back to i'm not saying i get back to punching each other in the face but like but get away from oh what you said to hurt my feelings grow up yeah you're gonna have people who don't agree with you and don't like you i get my feelings hurt every fucking day and i get over it it's like it's not a big deal well dude and i'm sure you do because you're in a fucking you are a black gay man who is supposed to fucking think like these people fucking think and i do not what i do not and like dude and then what happens to you from those people oh oh those are the the groups that claim they're the most tolerant rainbow cult lgbt oh even the the blm mob oh we care about black people you disagree with one of their points and they become the most intolerant group in existence and actually they are intolerant because i think tolerance is tolerating people who think differently than you i think our country period tolerates people of all different skin colors as it is we've come so far this is not the 1960s real tolerance is being able to tolerate people who have different opinions and that's right that's right dude i can't imagine some of the hurtful shit that people say to you dude i mean it's not like oh it affects me like oh we're like so but it's like get over it there always gonna have people say hurtful shit yeah i know but like it's just the people who who claim to be the most understanding and most tolerant and most loving and most caring are the meanest motherfuckers on the fucking planet and i've been trying to tell you motherfuckers this for for fucking two years like dude none of my gay friends i literally none literally none zero of my gay friends and i have a lot of gay friends identify with the rainbow shit they're all like look bro that is not what we're about that's a media narrative do do they have a rainbow sticker somewhere in their house probably but like the way what it's become has become this symbol of almost i see it as a hate bro this is like it's getting to that point scary it's i don't know man we got a lot of fucked up problems you know but but you know i think at the end of the day the best thing that we can do is talk about them the best thing that we can do is address them and with the truth have conversations try to restrain from fucking calling each other names which i would say that most people do a really good job of where do most of the names come from most of the names come from the far left fucking people woke woke blue haired leftist people only use those names when they lose an argument yep so i don't know i know that most of people listening right now are shaking their head in agreement like yeah i know but like okay we all know so let's not need to do something about that right let's stop catering to this shit you know this is where that non-compliance comes in this is where the independence comes in this is where building a life that you're proud of comes in this is where building a skill set and becoming financially independent comes in the less people that you have to answer to the more free you can be to actually speak out against the injustices that you see as true and i'm done hearing about this silent majority because at the end of the day the loud minority which i think these woke blue haired leftists the woke people are the minority the loud minority will always beat out the silent majority because they get to run shit yeah they get to do whatever they want so stopping proud of being the silent majority and let's start speaking up and let's be the loud majority and take our country back the silent majority is cowardice it's cowardice if you're sitting there right now and you're like i'm part of the silent majority no at this point you're coward just being real it's true that's fair because if we won't win without you that means you're irrelevant and democracy is democracy only works to the extent that which people participate in it and if you're not participating because you think silent majority bro the media can that phrase silent majority to weaken the whole fucking movement they wanted people to take pride in the fact of being complicit being quiet moving in silence and then letting their vote being heard but then what happens what happens to the vote are we all sure that the vote was even accurate absolutely i'm not personally i think most people with common sense who understand all of these coincidences and the people who have been paying attention all people who have been paying close attention to this whole thing they all every single one of them is like now this was fucking stolen all of them okay and dude election reform regardless of your opinion should be the number one thing because unless we have quality of elections then we can't trust that dictators and communists and all this crazy shit uh which we got into on the other show we recorded pretty pretty good um can come in full trade yeah bro and and that's where we're at and any developed country runs an election based on voting in person with an id you only vote by mail if you want to cheat yeah but the barak stands up and says oh why don't they want you voting like by mail because they want to suppress your vote because they want to cheat no we want you to show up with a fucking id and proof that you're in a american citizen that's it and we don't care what color you are we don't care how much money you make we don't care what your background is if you're a fucking legal citizen of this country we want you to vote because i guarantee you if those people only were the people devoted we would have a completely different fucking program going here on here in america okay so anyway bro remind people where they could find you again you can
