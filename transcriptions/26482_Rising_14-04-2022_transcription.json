    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. We've got another fantastic show for you today. Will Juana and Willika Duol are in for panel and will weigh in on Biden's latest polling numbers, which are not great. And Kim Iverson of course will join us later on. But first the Brooklyn Subway shooting suspect Frank James was caught and taken into custody yesterday in Manhattan. Mayor Adam celebrated the arrest of James during a remote press conference saying quote, my fellow New Yorkers, we got him. Adam's is currently in quarantine after testing positive for COVID. It wasn't the NYPD who caught him. It was a 21 year old man from Syria working as a security guard for a shot near Manhattan's East Village who spotted James on the cameras on his way to work. Here's how the man, Zach Tahan, described the scene. What happened is I was working inside the store. I do security cameras. And I was washing the street like how I see how the camera looked like we was doing the adjustment. And I see this guy, he took the problem. And I was to today's house people and I see the people die like this from this guy and nobody got him. Look how many people have in New York. Nobody got him. Like I was working inside the store and I got him. It's nice to see like just just a guy having like the best day of his life after a genuinely well deserved heroic moment. I love New York. I miss New York. The idea of like basically your favorite, you know, Bodega scenario. Being the one that actually catches it. And looked to a lot of our reporting yesterday in our interview with O'Liami. At the end of the day, it is kind of a damning reality that despite having almost $11 billion police budget, officers in every corner standing around, posted up at every subway station, it was this guy. Yeah. And it's eagle eye that just happened to catch the guy. Yeah. It's hard to. I mean, yeah. What else can you say? Big points for community defending, community policing. A lot of police out there. Not didn't catch him, but this guy did. So I don't know what else to say. It's a good thing that he's caught. Eric Adams had like a kind of we got him. Yeah. Sort of. It's not that this wasn't this bad guy. He did a very, very bad thing. It's not, it's not a sum of been laden. I didn't know. There was a kind of, do you know what I mean? Yes. I mean, he is the kind of guy who was going to try to capitalize on a moment. Like this, and maybe that's not fair. Maybe every mayor would try to use this as an opportunity to see the crazes. He's got a tough guy. I'm the sheriff. Right. Right. And it's especially. Swagger. Inappropriate. And a lot of people's view because who was the we? I saw a lot of people responding to that to be saying who was the we exactly and we caught him because you literally didn't do it. And you know, there was reporting that, you know, the, the suspect had been called in and identified. But before the police could even get to the scene, the civilian was able to identify him first, which also really begs the question why is the responsiveness rate so slow? Why didn't even come to this in the first instance? And there's some people who are even saying that the reluctance to really honor Zach is all about trying to keep him from getting the I think it's a $50,000 reward. I don't know. He certainly deserves it. And did he have prior arrest? I thought I saw that maybe he did the suspect. I believe I saw that he had been investigated by the FBI looked at the FBI and then he cleared. Right. So it's another. That's so frustrating. Flipping through the cracks moment of these institutions. Or like not even slipping through like like was on top of the cracks had not fallen through them and then was like shoved through them by the FBI. Because that was the same case. I mentioned this on the show numerous times as I followed the Parkland school shooting. I reported on a lot and that guy in that horrific Marjory Stone and Douglas shooting, he was reported to the FBI. He was reported to the school authorities. He was reported to the Sheriff's department. He was every person who was supposed to see something, say something. They saw something and they said something and they said this kid is going to be a mass shooter. Can you do something about it? And law enforcement didn't do anything. Yeah. Which is pretty frustrating. And then they say we need more resources. We need more of a police state and et cetera. But but you don't you miss the stuff you're supposed to catch when everybody does what they're supposed to do when the citizens do. It's very frustrating. Very frustrating. It's very frustrating. Yeah. I won't say the words of fun because I don't want to trigger anybody. But no way out. The funding isn't working. The fun. Yeah. Let's not fund. I don't know. We either defund nor fund. I guess sit here and complain about it I guess. All right. Well, we're going to get into some other big news that happened yesterday. President Biden moved another $800 million in additional military aid to the Ukraine, including transfer of helicopter artillery systems and armored vehicles. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters why the US signed over the additional aid. Let's watch. It's the first time that we've provided these 155 howitzers and the associated rounds that will go with them. And again, that's reflective of the kind of fighting that that the Ukrainians are expecting to to be faced with here in this a little bit more confined geographic area. They specifically asked for fire support and that and specifically asked for artillery support. This comes as the World Bank is preparing to deliver $1.5 billion in aid to Ukraine. Yeah. So more more support for Ukraine, which look obviously, I mean, I don't know. I think maybe we disagree slightly on this Kim and I disagree on this. I am basically fine to continue giving them weapons if but we should be putting diplomatic pressure on them obviously to actually settle something with Vladimir Putin. Well, this is the tension. Right. It does providing more weapons, facilitate a shorter diplomatic process. Does it make it more likely for parties to come to the bargaining table or does it elongate the process because Zelensky is under the impression that he can win the war, hold off Russia for a longer period of time when anyone who looks at the military abilities of these two respective countries understands that ultimately it's just a matter of time for obviously Russia, the military power that it is, the nuclear superpower that it is will ultimately prevail. Now to what end? How much of the country can it take the whole country without use of the kind of force that would trigger the involvement of Western allies? That's all up in the air. But I think it's a really interesting philosophical question of is the real thing that's driving us and unwilling to make the kind of compromises that are ultimately bound to happen? Right. But ultimately they are being invaded and they're the ones playing defense. So it's a little different than the just kind of arming people. I know this is a proxy war in some sense but it's one that Russia started. So I don't have, I don't like have the moral, there's less of a moral struggle to, no, they are wrongly being invaded. So it would be better to bring this war obviously to an end as fast as possible but that needs to end with Russia ending the war. Russia is the one doing the thing. There is an open debate about this. There is no debate about the fact that Russia invaded Ukraine and that's a violation of international law. It is also true that many people are pinpoint the beginning of this war as some place other than the invasion. And they see it primarily as a proxy war and America has been the proxy party that has been instigating the kind of diplomatic maneuvers that from some people's point of view have all but provoked Russia into a situation that they're in because they're back as up against the wall. Now obviously, reasonable bias disagree about that but the fact of the matter is that that perspective is largely absent from mainstream media and it is now largely absent from even alternative media as the Russian state perspective that you were able to find on places like RT are now banned from much of the internet. And that's a concern because even if you disagree with the Russian perspective, I think it's important for Americans to know what they're up against and what the thought process is of those who they are hoping to deter from continued aggression through the provision of additional aid. And I think the other question that really gets left out of this is even if you believe in every way, shape or form morally, strategically, et cetera, that Ukraine is in the right, that they need to have weapons to defend Russia, there is the secondary kind of imperialist question of what role should America continue to play as the world's policeman. And some people might think, you know, Donald Trump certainly thought, you know, we were overly involved in Europe, we were basically funding the military ability of an entire continent while there are people enjoyed on any number of social programs. And that there was a reasonable question of why we were intervening in Europe in these kinds of circumstances, but not intervening in other places in the rest of the world where there's an equal level of tragedy on an ongoing basis. That's a fair point. But we also learned yesterday from President Zelensky that the country captured Viktor Medvichak, a pro-Kremlin politician who was living in the Ukraine, allegedly escaped his house arrest shortly after Russia launched its invasion. This morning, Ukraine is saying they hit a Russia warship off the Crimean coast as Russian officials said a fire caused them to evacuate the ship that was severely damaged, however, reports are conflicting as to what actually happened as they so often are. It's, you know, it's hard from where we are to make sense, just like you said, and that's a downside of having this situation where, yeah, we're canceling, we're de-platforming any of the pro-Russian voices. I mean, this show is one of the only places you can hear. Like Kim talked about on her radar yesterday, she just said, well, here is what Putin is telling these people. I think that it's lies, but you should, we should know what they're telling them or what the Russian people think. It has so many people noted. I interviewed Abby Martin on my show and she was pointing to the fact that if, but for RT, she would have taken a lot longer to realize all of the kind of ghost island stuff and some of the early stories coming out of the conflict were in fact fake. And it was, for better or worse, Russian television sources that were reporting on some of the misinformation that took forever to trickle down to the rest of the Western media sphere because there is not that openness to what the alternative perspectives are. Yeah, no, it's a huge problem. And we have just been speedily going down this path of saying, nope, we're not going to hear any of any of, and it's one thing to, I guess, do the sanctions and not want to do direct, although I have a lot of skepticism about the sanctions as we talked about with our friend, Judge Legum yesterday, but to not even be able to consume just information, just information about what's going on over there, what they think. Are we so insecure? Right, right. It can work our perception of the war. It does work our perception of war. And we don't want to be right, we don't want to be overconfident. I do think the Russian military has from, you know, from looking at all sources and what they say, it looks to me like the Russian military has badly underperformed during the course of this invasion, and it's been really bad for them. But like you said, that doesn't mean they're going to lose. That doesn't mean they like there are more forces they could commit to this thing. So we don't want to, because we're not listening to what Russia says, be overconfident and then be, you know, subtly or not so subtly, urging Zelensky to hold on until, until I think Kim called it, a last man standing in Ukraine kind of scenario. Right, right. That is the worst case scenario, it seems. Yeah, that would be bad. Well, we'll tell you what's on our radars coming up next. Stay with us. Briana, what's on your radar? Well, it's big news and progressive world yesterday as Congressional Progressive Caucus weighed in on the Ohio 11th rematch between Senator Nina Turner and Shontel Brown. Now Nina Turner is the co-chair of the burning 2020 campaign is a supporter of Medicare for all a $15 minimum wage, the Green New Deal, and student debt cancellation. She takes no corporate money and last summer was able to out raise her opponent with small dollar donations alone. Shontel Brown, on the other hand, was funded by Republican donors in her last race, faced an ethics probe for awarding millions of dollars to her partner's company and just received a $1 million ad by a crypto billionaire who has supported a number of Republican senators. She has not only taken money from right-aligned individuals like Trump ally and Patriots owner Robert Kraft and former chair of the Kiahoga Republican Party. Some of her most substantial financial support during last year's special election came from Democratic majority for Israel, a conservative pact that donated to Republican candidates like Lindsey Graham and through which individual conservative donors laundered donations to Brown. So you might think that the choice for the Progressive Caucus endorsement was an obvious one. But if you assumed that the Progressive Caucus would be supporting Senator Nina Turner, you'd be wrong. So what seems to be the rub this time around? Why has Primella Jipah's caucus made the switch from supporting fellow Bernie alum and alleged ideological ally Nina Turner to Shontel Brown, a corporate funded candidate who seems to offer the left little other than fidelity to the establishment Democratic agenda. I'm sure more details about the decision will come out over the coming weeks, but too much of the left, this decision is but the latest in a long line of disappointments from Jipah who some are dismissing as a Progressive leader altogether. And when you assemble all the evidence, it's clear why so many progressives are considering cutting the court with the Democratic Party. All together. Now, progressives first became skeptical of Jipah back in January, January of last year, when some voters and media figures, including myself, were pushing for progressives in the House to withhold their vote for Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker of the House in order to gain some any concessions for the left. Because of the narrow margins in the House, any six or so progressives had the power to hold up Pelosi's nomination for Speaker in exchange for concessions like, say, better committee appointments, ending pay go, ousting Richie Neil and Medicare for all opponent from the Ways and Means Committee, or having a hearing on Medicare for all, a crucial issue at the time when the pandemic was raging and no vaccine was yet available. When asked, Jipah explained away her decision not to exploit one of the last remaining leverage points for the left by saying that she would not force the vote because she feared that Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy might become Speaker of the House if she did. Of course, that wouldn't be possible unless a significant number of Democrats were to vote for Republican McCarthy, an extremely unlikely outcome. Even if progressives abstained from voting for Pelosi and McCarthy got more votes, absolutely, he would not become Speaker of the House unless he got more than half of the total votes in the House, not just a bare majority. So, Jipah is either ignorant to the point of concern about House procedure or she lied and neither is an especially reassuring outcome. Strike two for Jipahl centered around the fight for a $15 minimum wage. Remember that a minimum wage raise was initially included as part of the 2021 COVID relief bill. At that time, it was reported that some progressives considered holding up the entire COVID package and last $15 minimum wage was included in the bill. In an interview with Ryan Grimm on his podcast Jipahl revealed that progressives had successfully threatened to do something similar to ensure extended unemployment benefits were in the bill. And it worked. But when it came to the fight for 15, an enormously popular policy, well, Jipahl threw that fight. After the $15 minimum wage was stripped from the bill, it was reported that, quote, when a $15 minimum wage increase fell out of the package because of Senate rules, some Democrats considered withholding their votes entirely. Jipahl helped persuade those members to support the deal without the minimum wage raise. A two birthday. Since then, Jipahl has been one of Biden's biggest boosters. Instead of using her position to drive home the extent to which Biden has betrayed his fairly moderate campaign promises, she described him thusly last summer, shortly after the $15 minimum wage debacle. President Biden has risen to the moment, she said, and I really do give him an A in what he's done so far. It's been bold. It's been progressive. It's been what the country needs. Polls disagree. Here's more evidence. When progressive squad member Rashida Tlaib made a speech on behalf of the working families party following the state of the union address this year, Jipahl seemed almost miffed that she'd stepped out of line. Here she is speaking to Mehdi Hassan. I just want people to understand the progressive caucus doesn't give a response to the president. We will all be out there talking about what we thought. And I believe that the president's going to raise some really important progressive priorities. Big she doesn't speak for me energy here. So much for progressive unity. Moreover, or some progressives like AOC warned Democrats that separating Biden's traditional infrastructure bill from the human infrastructure bill, bill back better, was a mistake. Jipahl went through with the plan and even said later that she had, quote, no regrets about doing so. That was the moment Biden's agenda died and Jipahl had no regrets about it. Everyone with eyes could see that mansion was lying when he said he'd support the human infrastructure bill. It's only they passed a traditional bill first. It was a Lucy Charlie Brown in the football moment as obvious as the nose on my face. But Jipahl pursued that agenda killing strategy with impunity and apparently without regret. Now, I'm not the only one who was noticed this pattern of Jipahl playing cleanup for corporate Democrats. Just listen to Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell unironically applaud her ability to spin political guano into gold. And then your show's optimist in chief, Garthman Jipahl actually presents an optimistic view of what's next. She actually does it and it's real. I listen to it. I sit there with all my experience trying to tear it apart and no, it's real. It's legitimate. And I gotta say, she's brilliant at it diplomatically in her presentation of it. But it's just my favorite thing to watch those words of optimism, just washing over you and you just making them, let them get into your heart and go on with life that way. It is like a recurring bit on this show. You're completely right that I bring Congresswoman Jipahl on and I say, looks to me like nothing can happen. Looks to me like it's all over. Oh, this was a dark wine and she's every single time. I hear you Rachel, but actually. And then she's got something to say that is not pie in the sky and there's not some made up thing and it's not like there'll be better days ahead. She always has some constructive thing that can happen. And some little based in reality thing that I'm not factoring into my little dark cloud. She I mean, to be the chair of the Progressive Caucus is by design to always be asking for things that you are mostly not going to get. But she has this gift of asking for things and presenting the case for things in a way that is both reasonable and makes it seem likely that she is going to get at least a lot of what it is she's asking for. And that is it works even on me. I am I am the original dark cloud, but it works even on me. If you were looking for a substantive analysis in that clip, I promise you won't find one. It is nothing but empty words of optimism and yes, a recurring bit. Now, it should perhaps come as no surprise given her reported political ambitions that Jipahl has been this disappointing. As David Saroda observed yesterday, quote, this is very likely Premier LeGia Paul selling out the entire movement because of her unbridled ambitions to get a fancy but meaningless leadership title among a house dim caucus that will be obliterated in the midterm elections, a total betrayal on every level. Democrats may offer some explanation for this betrayal, but all the excuses that I can think of fall fall flat. Democrats sometimes say they're going to support the incumbent or the candidate with the obvious lead. But when Nina Turner was pulling ahead of Brown last spring, the establishment Democratic support for Brown ramped up with endorsements from stars like Hillary Clinton and Jim Clyburn. Look at how some establishment Democrats are backing Connor Lamb over John Fetterman despite Fetterman having better odds against Republican general election opponent Dr. Oz. And remember how establishment Democrats abandoned India Walton after she won her primary race in Buffalo fair and square. It's becoming clearer and clearer to many progressive and populist voters that the odds of changing the Democratic Party from within, returning it to its working class roots are growing slimmer and slimmer and many are advocating for a clean break after all with allies like these who needs enemies. If Biden is unable to boost his low poll numbers and Democrats lose one or both chambers due to apathy from the base, they'll undoubtedly blame progressives but let the records show that progressive leadership clamoring to be included in the in crowd did this to themselves and for what? For what? Now, Robbie, this has been a long time coming from my perspective and I have wanted to give Premier Jayapal and the Progressive Caucus the benefit of the doubt. There have been plausible outs for many of these moments as they've happened on the pipe. When the force of a moment happened, they said that we're going to hold out for a fifteen dollar minimum wage. When the fifteen dollar minimum wage happened and the reporting was that Premier Jayapal was the one that convinced them not to hold out and make sure that this enormously popular policy, a policy that won with 60% of the vote in red Trump Florida wouldn't get included in the COVID relief bill. That was the final straw for me and this I think it's going to be the final straw for a lot of other progressives. I hear you but I'm just letting the optimism walk away. Isn't that clip ridiculous? It was yeah utterly insane. When was that from? It last fall I think around the time that the bill that better fit. I can't understand that as it occurred. Yeah. Yeah I know this was not the subject of your radar but it shows to you the kind of priorities of like the MSNBC pundits and I guess their viewers like no everything like literally doing the it's fine dog meme thing. No everything's fine. Everything's fine. The house isn't burning. You could see the flames around Maddow and Lawrence. Yeah and that's the thing. It's clear that their role similar to what Pramila Jayapal's role seems to be serving in this moment is to provide cover for the failures of the party as a whole to make sure everybody feels as though Democrats are doing the best they can when it's obviously not the case and of course it's true that Republicans are not doing the best that they can and that we have a court court court court a flutocracy that is retrained the interest of American voters as a whole. But my interest as a progressive in particularly in particular is making sure that the people who say that they represent my interest and are using the progressive labels do so sincerely and I think that this latest betrayal not not supporting a woman who you worked with so recently on the campaign of the leading progressive in this country an enormously popular independent senator from Vermont it's going to be really difficult for people to look past. So I'm really interested to see what the continue response to this will be online and in real life and I'm also looking forward to your radar next Robby. Robby what's on your radar today? Well Florida Governor Rhonda Santis and the Walt Disney Corporation are currently at war over the so-called don't-say-gay bill which the governor recently signed into law. Critics of that law say it stigmatizes LGBTQ students and teachers and would even make it difficult for public school staff members to disclose if they are gay or in gay relationships. Now conservatives on the other hand say detractors have totally misnamed the law which does nothing except prevent teachers from talking to very young kids about highly political and controversial concepts that relate to orientation and gender identity. They've also claimed that the law is designed to target grooming which is the idea that public school staff are using conversations about gender and sexual orientation as a pretext to actually sexually abuse the children. Now that's an incredibly serious and incendiary allegation when I actually plan to address more fully in a future radar. In previous radars I've explained that I do think some of the concepts taught to young kids in public schools actually fall under the category of political activism and parents have every right to object to them. Race and equity training often lumped under the umbrella of critical race theory is actually the bigger offender here but I have seen some bad instruction with respect to gender identity. I'm totally in support of the parents who don't think that's the right thing for young kids. Opponents of the bill are correct however that its wording is extremely vague and undoubtedly some unreasonable parents will use the law to punish teachers who merely mention that they have a same-sex partner or acknowledge that gay and trans people exist and thus I understand why many flidarians are ultimately against it. Now employees of Disney who oppose the law have successfully persuaded the company to speak out against it albeit belatedly and as a result of that conservative media is going after Disney claiming the company allows children to be sexually assaulted etc. The best criticism of Disney though is that is the hypocrisy charge because for as much as the company claims to object to laws that don't acknowledge gay people Disney absolutely excuses such laws when other countries are the ones enforcing them. Let me refresh your memory this is from my recent radar on the subject. Have you ever heard of Dominica? Dominica you may not know is a small island nation in the Caribbean. Dominica's government is very anti-LGBT not only is there no gay marriage there but same-sex sexual activity is actually illegal. Gay marriage is also illegal in Antigua and on the Dutch island of St. Martin where same-sex couples have to travel to the Netherlands to get married and if the marriage won't be valid if they then return home. Yet Dominica and Tigua and St. Martin are all locations visited by a Disney cruise line. So Stryksme is a little odd that Disney would want to denounce the government of Florida for merely approving legislation that makes it more difficult to acknowledge gay relationships in schools but would continue to give business to an island nation that puts gay people in prison for being gay. So that's Disney here's something new Disney is not the only major media corporation engaged in this hypocrisy surprise surprise so today I want to talk about Warner Brothers which is owners of the Harry Potter film franchise of which I am a huge fan. The latest film Fantastic Beasts the Secret of Dumbledore comes out this week. Now one of Dumbledore's secrets, fellow Harry Potter fans will recall is that he and the series antagonist Grindelwald had a same-sex attraction to each other. Now this never actually comes up in the Harry Potter book series and in fact Grindelwald is an extremely minor character who's really just part of Dumbledore's backstory but one day author J.K. Rowling declared that in her view Dumbledore is a gay character. It's funny to think about now since J.K. Rowling's negative views about transgender activism have subsequently rendered her a pariah to many progressives but she was once considered quite progressive herself in part because of the Dumbledore declaration. But don't expect to hear anything about Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship in the version of the film that's being released in China because Warner Brothers has admitted that it removes some dialogue from the film in which their relationship is discussed explicitly in order to appease the authoritarian and anti-LGBT government of China. Now Warner Brothers has not explicitly taken a position on the Don't Say Gay Bill but it has professed a stated commitment to telling LGBTQ stories and to nurture queer talent but not in China I guess. So this is what annoys so many people on the right and I think it's a valid thing to be annoyed about. All the boycotts and the getting mad at Republican governors and legislatures for promoting bills and the religious freedom bills from a few years ago. Again most of these bills being things I acknowledge issues with but then a total blindness to the actual much more serious discrimination against these categories of minorities who should be protected in other countries especially by China. Yeah look there's an awful lot of performativity that happens in these spaces and that's not to say that there aren't people with sincerely held beliefs but to think something you get a lot of the corporate buy-in that you get whether it's you know people objecting you know Disney objecting to the Don't Say Gay Bill or JP Morgan Chase putting a Black Lives Matter sign in the window it does very much feel like they're doing it because not doing it would it cut their into their profits more than the alternative and you see that hypocrisy play out when you look at what happens when the instance of bigotry is just out of the eyesight of the general public or just just beyond the edge of the balance sheet you know just beyond the edge of American attention they're willing to do something but not go all the way and I think that really creates vulnerabilities for liberals broadly in the left when they open themselves up to the idea that they're acting in bad faith. Now of course there's a lot of performativity in the creation of all of these bills anyway nobody you know the idea of making a whole political project out of CRT or Don't Say Gay Bills when if you ask somebody specifically you know if there's an instance of you know racism or prejudice that comes up in school should the teacher ignore it should the teacher allow kind of identity-based bullying should the teacher allow gender-based bullying if a student asks a question about something that should that be ignored to this could be put in a dense cap in the corner and then not be addressed most people would give you a very reasonable and obvious answer but all of the stuff is full it is focused on in my humble opinion to keep us from talking about anything that might be going on of substance in Florida or anywhere else in the country and it's really dispiriting because I honestly think that most people are not as far away from each other on these issues as the media circus circus pretends they are. Well I agree with them most people right even people who are ideologically different distinct were Republicans of Democrats there is a shared frustration honestly in what's going on in schools part of it just because of the pandemic was a frustrating experience for so many parents for working parents etc school stayed closed longer than anything else even today the restrictions on students relating to COVID are stricter than any restriction on anyone anywhere else in the country and that was not they did not meet parents needs and also parents saw I think some of them for the first time what was being taught in some of these schools and they have some issues with it and I mean there it's there the parents I do think parents have a right to to to know what's going on in their schools and if they object to it they should have some other choice but what's being sure look the only thing I'll say to that is when I was growing up there were lots of things that I objected to in my mom objected to in the context of my education even though I went to a generally probably progressive school in the grand scheme of things and the instinct wasn't to say let me try to get some dominion over the the school system of the faculty or the curriculum it was that I had a relationship with my parents who taught me what they believed was the right thing and I learned at an early age to personally mediate between what I was told and taught about in school and what I learned from my parents and I am sympathetic on some level because I also would prefer would have preferred not to have been subjected to some of the nonsense that I was subjected to but at the end of the day you're never going to have a system where every single parent feels completely satisfied with what's going on in the school so I do think it's important to I'm sorry develop resilience and have good relationships with your kids and to be able to trust them that they can be the kind of decisions between the lessons that are getting at home and the lessons that are getting at school and the lessons that are going to get out in the rest of the real world because you cannot insulate people forever and to the extent that the right talks an awful lot about snowflakes and safe spaces and all of this it feels to me like they are trying very hard to create safe spaces and quotation marks in the classroom beyond kind of a normal reasonable extent and that this is I just want to emphasize this is a concern of anything a lot of parents share and she'd be kind of trying to work through in a in a communal sympathetic way as opposed to using legislation to try to press their agenda on other people's families and other people's kids. I hear you I think they would say that but but the other the views they disagree with are the ones currently being pressed on everyone things are like everyone things that the rest of the world is that Jim and Ian they're the minority that the school officials in a lot in Virginia especially in a couple places reacted to this criticism did not uh was not successful at making people right there it was very like no we're in charge of your kids you don't get to tell us what to do you don't like it tough you don't care and you know what they're in it they're an elected they're they're they are supposed to be responsive to the public and they were so unresponsive to public and so many of these school boards not right I agree on the actual teachers like there's a range of it varies in terms of quality it varies in terms of what's being taught the hostility of school boards in many deeply progressive locations to like common sense or or what the parents want were just like anything reasonable uh we saw what happened in San Francisco obviously they actually tossed them because they were so insane was uh it worries a lot of parents and it even worried me so do you see yourself as a homeschooler someday Robbie if I uh I know probably not I might homeschool my kids I might send I myself on the product of catholic school I have perfectly good catholic school upbringing the solution I want for families is school choice they should be able to take whatever which you don't like I know wait that's a whole other day but they should be able to take the education dollars whatever educational environment they see fit all right we should move that at some point in the near future absolutely well on a day when I'm not distracted by a harry potter who's headline which I have to discuss can't help it our rising panel joins us next for more well it turns out Putin's price hike isn't working out for rebranding inflation new polling from CNBC shows Biden's approval rating taking a nosedive over economic concerns and inflation Biden's approval rating slid to a new low of just 38 percent according to the survey which found only one in five described their financial situation as getting ahead the weakest in eight years and according to a new Quinnipette poll Biden's approval rating with Hispanics dipped to just 26 percent the lowest of any demographic besides young people only 21 percent of people aged 18 to 34 approve of Biden's job handling our rising panels here to discuss the numbers council member at large Montgomery County Maryland will jiwondo and republican strategist Malik Abdul join us now to discuss welcome to you both good morning good to see thanks for having us yeah thanks for joining us so will I mean these numbers are just terrible they keep getting worse every time you think well how much lower can Biden sink he sinks lower what what possibly can the party even do at this point to reverse these numbers and you know to prepare themselves for the in what looks to me like the inevitability in in November which is going to be catastrophe yeah well as you were speaking I saying it's reminding me of a luau you know how low can you go here it's not it's not pretty and I think that the higher gallon of milk goes up the higher the gas prices go up this is real and people feel it every day and you know look there's always a context is important there's always the president in power always loses in the midterms there's always difficulty but you know we're in uncertain times coming out of a pandemic obviously the health pandemic doesn't rate high on people's minds but we're still dealing with the inequity and economic fallout and then we've got the war on top of it so it's a problem you know in this same poll though you did see that you know 66 folks blame corporations for taking advantage I think another 55% blame Vladimir Putin and 49% blame Joe Biden on why the prices have gone up but doesn't help him with his overall rating but it shows that there's a lot of blame and anger to go around and when prices are this high people look to who's in charge and whether rightly or fairly or not and say what are you going to do about it well really it's interesting to contrast this with Trump's approval ratings obviously the last year of his presidency was also marred by the pandemic and yet in some ways didn't quite dip to these deaths at this at this juncture do you think this is all circumstantial or does it have something to do with specifically how Joe Biden is leading in this moment I think it's has a lot to actually more so to do with the expectations that people had with Joe Biden coming into office because Joe Biden really did promise a lot of things about what would be different now under his presidency but it failed to actually capture the realities of the ground of what people are feeling so yes coming out of the pandemic there was a lot of economic anxiety there was a not all anxiety all around the country but also now we're dealing with inflation and I think that the numbers are really showing they've been trending in the republican direction for some time now even most recently I think that was the Wall Street Journal poll that showed that the approval ability factor for republican candidates among blacks and Hispanics has really I think it's probably about a six or so percent but it's really substantial I think that there were a number of things that people expected Biden to do and in office and many of those expectations were unrealistic but Biden is now having to deal with over promising a lot of things and the realities of governing so I think this is something that we're going to get we will continue to see and I don't think it's necessary because we've seen so many polls moving in the same direction we're beyond circumstantial now this seems like this is laying the blueprint for what we're going to see in the term well Malik says that it's an expectation gap and that some of the promises were unrealistic others are quite realistic there are things that progressives have been highlighting exactly because it can be executed by Biden via executive order and there are also issues that disproportionately affect the base blacks and Latinos who as we see from the polls are shifting away from support of Joe Biden what do you make in particular of Joe Biden's reluctance to go ahead and fulfill his promise not just to cancel at least 10,000 dollars a student debt but to also cancel all HBCU debt for people who earn less than $125,000 a year which was a campaign promise that it seems most people have forgotten at this point yeah well there were a lot of expectations and I think a lot of people were happy with the shift back to some sort of normalcy you know if you take the nomination and confirmation of Judge Kataanji Jackson Brown Jackson Jackson Brown excuse me that normally would be a huge bump for president you didn't you're not seeing that right these are unusual times I think the extension of the delay on student loan payments was a good thing I mean I agree I think we should be moving towards cancellation at least for a large percentage of debt for folks that are really really struggling that that would help it in economic time the child tax credit we weren't able to get that and Senator Joe Manchin was a big part of that not not being willing to extend that you're seeing that that people have stopped receiving that and so I think there are there is some angst about what's going to happen and then if you look at one of the major accomplishments the infrastructure bill you're really not going to see that Americans aren't going to see the impact of that for a couple of years and so that's the issue too is we're just now getting the money as local elected official states and local governments and deciding how to get those projects going so it's really I think a combination of the context of the incoming president always loses seats and then this massive inflation this war and coming out of covid which was always going to have a long tail because of how inequitable it wreaked havoc on our economy and on certain communities like the ones we're talking about. Well last week Deutsche Bank became the first major bank to forecast a recession and now we are hearing a similar cry from Bank of America who warns that high inflation is out of control and predicts the recession as the Fed raised interest rates to get prices under control the risk there is that the Fed will do too much in seeing the economy in the process. What are you making of this right now Malik? And so this is something that I think we've been watching probably since early maybe around this time last year what the economists were saying what the Wall Street is saying. Obviously the hope is that we don't enter into a recession but I think it's a very difficult thing and people need to be realistic and that this is not the president does not control whether or not inflation anymore than oil companies control the price of gas at the pump so this is some of the things are kind of built in but I just wanted to address one of the things that you actually said about the things that minorities particularly African-Americans and concerned about I'm not sure exactly so those big things voter the voter reform bill the chat even things like the um college tuition keep in mind these things are constituency so not every black person went to college not every black person is um has college tuition a high on their list the same thing with the voter voting rights legislation um police reform we know that the Republicans tried to get that through when Trump was in office and it didn't happen under Trump and now that Biden is under in office it didn't happen then but if you look at the polling numbers while those things may actually rank well as far as polling they're not the top concerns when you have our our kitchen table issues you know the price of chicken the price of vegetables even are exponentially higher than what they were around this time last year even and even when at the height of the pandemic when Trump was in office so it's a lot of juggling going on and that's why I mentioned earlier talking about the unrealistic expectations that somehow the college tuition that thing was going to be a real thing that he was going to eliminate the debt for hbc u's but I guess if you if you are black and probably went to a pwi predominantly white institution you may not get that same um elimination of debt so I just thought it was a very unrealistic goal overall but we're really dealing with the realities of governance right now not just campaign promises but governing yeah i'm sorry it is it is fair to say that most people don't have student debt 44 million people do however and it's disproportionately concentrated among black women are the light largest percentage wise dead holders the reason we constantly talk about student debt or I should say I constantly talk about student debt I will fully admit it's not because I believe to your point belief that it's American's highest priority it absolutely is not and if there was some policy that Joe Biden could act by executive order without having to go through congress I would absolutely be emphasizing that as well I think medical debt cancellation for instance should be a huge priority but I will know that if we're talking about child tax credits the constant refrain isn't that well most a lot of Americans don't have kids you know if we're talking about housing reform or mortgage subsidy well no it is a good point against the child tax credit I love you it seems like it's okay to do a lot of different things for a lot of different constituencies with an understanding that not everybody belongs to every constituency but there has been a particular resistance to doing the one thing one of the few things that Joe Biden can't actually do by executive authority and which can be a substitute for millions of people who are having to afford higher price groceries etc so that have to pay another thousand dollars in student loan debt is meaningful for them I suspect this is why actually Andrew Yang and his policies have resonated with so many people who watched this show for instance the kind of you know payments to everyone independent of circumstance independent you know the guaranteed basic income kind of proposal because it gets around some of this but we got to go in a minute but Will I just wanted to get your reaction to I wanted to specifically address those Hispanic numbers are so bad what do you think is going on you know with that specifically are our Hispanics Republicans now what's going on no I think will look the Latino community has always been very diverse I think there's always the unfortunate you know kind of urge to lump people together and like the older African American community there are you know some strings of conservatism moderate moderate folks in in those communities depending on the issues so you know I don't I think again you'd have to dig deeper into those cross tabs but I think those economic issues are paramount if you look at Latino and African American communities I think that alone gives some disproportionality into why you're seeing a change in the numbers but no I don't think I don't think there are Republicans there has been a trend in that way on certain issues some social issues that's being drummed up again in certain states by certain governors by the Republican Party crime and safety issues and the like so I think there are there's some reasons on the Republican side too of why they're trying to make a play for that community but I think things will you know will equalize here on the general ballot you know it's still congressional ballot it's still tied 43 43 I still think Republicans will do well we'll get to work hard and to your point Bria maybe maybe we can push the president to just hold off on that cancellation you know a month or so before the election maybe that'll help well well Malik thank you so much for joining us thank you thanks for having us and we'll have more rising after this California Senator Dianne Feinstein's mental decline was on full display during an interaction with a Democrat in Congress according to the San Francisco Chronicle as they prepared for a policy discussion in which the lawmaker said they had to reintroduce themselves to Feinstein multiple times during the interaction the last several hours they said it appears that her memory is rapidly deteriorating and it appears she can no longer fulfill her duties that require her to represent nearly 40 million people in California so she's 88 years old she's up for reelection in 2024 I believe yeah and she's filed paperwork to now it's a formality she might not run I mean there's no way she can but there's nothing stopping her the depressing part is that these kinds of stories were coming up before her last run they were and nobody seemed to care and to the extent that people raised this as an issue a lot of them were dismissed as ages ages sexist how dare you not let a woman live out her time it was very like our R.B.G adjacent yeah I remember I seem to remember a story where a bunch of young I'm talking like elementary school age climate activist came to her office and asked her very gently because you know they're elementary school students they weren't exactly aggressive whether or not she was going to do anything for the environment and Green New Deal and all of this stuff again California and Green New Deal children this should be a very bucolate kind of a situation and she called them Jack booted tots Jack booted tots and basically asked them to get out of their office this is who this person has you know become and certainly nobody is relishing somebody's mental decline but you got to really ask yourself what is going on with the system that is holding on to her staying in office so tightly yeah and after a lehi retires she'll be third in line for she'll be technically the ranking the oldest in the senate that's ridiculous now I also want to point out that when these kinds of questions are being raised in the context of the democratic primary I remember there were two democrats presidential candidates who are broadly liked and supported by the party who raised these issues it was a Cory Booker and um who in Castro and I remember them doing a presser after one of the debates during which Biden had been particularly seemingly not really with it and they both very gently kindly raised the issue in the spin room and you never heard from it again about it again no one ever brought it up on tv after that and it seemed like those two were pushed off the debate stage very quickly after that so there really does seem to be a system in place that protects these very very aging senators the democrats are much older than the republicans it's hard to think of who the new talent is it's hard to come up with like five senators under 60 democratic side and this is why it's it is a bigger problem the democratic side there are a lot of old republicans too gracily it's gonna run for reelection he's 88 um the average age of the senate has just gone up and up and up over the years we don't have we have I guess we have weaker parties my understanding is that in other countries they don't have this problem as dramatically because like the party just pushes you out eventually so that the the younger people can take over that doesn't happen here because there isn't as strong enough central party to say these people gotta go I guess yeah and there's no accountability there's no political accountability you can be someone like Jim Clyburn who's been in office for what's got to be about 30 years at this point who has never really faced a real primary challenger never participates in debates he's being challenged right now I think by two democrats in the primary but the odds you know frankly are very slim that they're gonna break through and he is a representative from one of the poorest districts in the country have you ever even heard anyone mention Jim Clyburn's district what it's like who lives there in South Carolina no we hear him as a king maker we hear about his political bona fides we hear about his power in the party and no one asked the barest minimum of questions about whether or not he's actually delivering for his constituents with all the power that he has and frankly all the money that he gets from these interests whose interests are antithetical to those of the people he represents namely the pharmaceutical industry uh he is the largest recipient of money from the pharmaceutical industry in congress yeah you know the these if we were asking those kinds of questions if people understood politicians in a context outside of their political power then I think there would be a much stronger push either to get them out or to at least make them more attendant to their communities yeah I mean it becomes a national security concern at some point to have so many of your top government officials be be so old and possibly you know past the state of mental preparedness yeah he's clearly exhibiting I you know we have questions about Biden obviously I think he doesn't uh his ability to communicate well has totally deteriorated whether that you know reflects his actual mental state I'm not quite sure yeah he certainly does not communicate as easily as he did when he was president of all you look at look at old videos the difference is obvious and look I'm not I don't want to be ages here there are plenty of older senators for whom this isn't the cognitive difference at that age is is very start like Bernie clearly still Bernie still got it you run it down the house you know love love just like he's clearly like he has not changed yes still him people like Chuck Schumer Elizabeth Warren these are people you know in their 70s don't seem to have any kind of issues so that's not it's not just an age issue it's not a chronology issue but this day and fine sign it's clearly yeah yeah so I don't know what the but they can't they can't force her to do anything and and you'll see the thing because this would happen with um with RBG someone would say reasonably from your perspective to say she's got she should go now so she can be replaced with someone of a similar ideology and then you would see a backlash be like no that's ages she doesn't owe you a seat yes it was like okay you're not you're not playing the game here friend no and that is why the federal courts look like they do if you there's people who have charted out and studied when republican um federal judges stepped down strategically versus when democrats do democrats it's never strategic yeah it's never shoot it and that has had a cumulative effect over the years and and we're screwed over it and there were a lot of cheerleaders who were still out there on on tv today or on twitter today talking about who who were the very people who said oh you were so sexist and horrible for trying to push RBG out who will now turn to a progressive like myself and it cues us of having been responsible for the deterioration of abortion rights across the country I'm like I'm not the one who was encouraging the octogenarian who regrettably was suffering from pancreatic cancer and the obama administration to continue her reign because she wanted he briskly to have a woman president in hillary clinton replacer that wasn't me i'm guilty of a lot of things but that one's not on me well brier retired strategically yeah so yeah i think because of the nice little rhyming couplet the retired brier related to the did the work that was that that was it well i'll i'll i'll trust your judgment on that all right we'll have more rising right after this ben shapiro got into a scuffle with a student on monday at an event called men cannot be women held in north carlanta college hosted by young america's foundation popular conservative podcaster and outspoken critic of gender identity was put on the spot during the question and answer portion what a student to identify himself as a mathematician and physicist said this i'm a mathematician and a physicist here a double major and i also just won the most prestigious award in the country to pursue research at any institution i want the national science foundation graduate research fellowship so i think i'm pretty you know qualified to say that most of what you're saying is based on like old data but my question to you and so i was like last month by sure um like for example gender identity disorder that's the dsm4 bro we use the dsm5 now for psychologists to be able to talk literally cited the dsm5 in the speech and it's called gender dysphoria which i literally said that i use throughout the speech not gender identity is one of those over and again i'm pussy and you can even make your wife web bro so what's good so number let me just say the nice thing about having several small children in this society to have a masculine we're using a western colonial idea of gender then why should it apply and we use it because because the gender binary is a western colonial is a western colonialist framework of gender you're right men and women don't exist in any other culture no no no no i'm no think about native american and third gender people i'm not saying that third gender people are just native american societies western african societies like southern native american societies like mexico so in other places that are not white dominated and they are united states for a year and so you're saying white by a lot of non-white people i'm a mathematician in a physicist you cannot tell me so i have a question and also you're not a biologist so i have a question i'm 20 as a mathematician and a physicist what in the hell do you know about human biology and you got your logic you know about biology you got your logic and frankly and frankly i would ask another question if your logic is so flawed as a mathematician and a physicist i would suggest that whichever institution gave you an award revoke it immediately jpero promptly responded saying quote the nice thing about having several small children is i don't feel the necessity of having my masculinity challenge by someone like you i think that was in the clip we played the university of north carolina at greensboro hosted the event defended its policy on not censoring discourse thank goodness media relations edan boss told the hill in an email quote as a public university cannot regulate free expression on the basis of content whether we agree or disagree um i thought the student humiliated himself and like don't so it actually did about 18 things that annoy me one is to like drop credentials like nobody cares just say what you think um it wasn't relevant credentials they would have been relevant but it was weird for him to call out then jpero for not being a biologist when he identified as lots of credible wonderful things but not a biologist there was there was no question in his statement you should ask your question in the form of a question uh when you're responding to speakers and then don't if you're going to disagree with him disagree with him but you immediately discredit yourself if you like make that stupid personal attack or whatever yeah so here's here's the problem people on the internet really felt like this was an own on both sides and i thought it was an own only in one direction but i delight in a funny it's all you know i understand this made me cringe i understand why people just like the idea of getting an insult off at ben Shapiro point-bling period but i agree that it's really frustrating because so often i find myself as the leftist who was on the side being on the side of various people who i agree substantively with who are not making the case very well and who are making the case in a way that undermines it fundamentally so for example one of the things that i had an issue with in addition to i think your good point was that he talks about the fact correctly that other societies and all kinds of parts of the world have had different a different way of understanding gender and that is relevant because people like ben Shapiro ben Shapiro himself often rely on this idea of tradition specifically western tradition to make the point that because it's always been this way this is how it always has to be or all of these years of practice validate why we should continue on in the same way now to point to the fact that there are many many years of tradition that militate in the opposite direction is a relevant rebuttal to that point but by making it about non-white people think this therefore the white you like i don't really understand what that had to do with it and elect ben Shapiro with this opening to to start to poke holes at it and again started to undermine the sky's credibility if your point is that hey ben Shapiro i agree that i disagree with you on with the idea that there are only two genders and there's these specific heteronormative roles here's other ways that very successful societies have modeled different kinds of behavior and i don't know what difference it is to you then that's that's a solid point i don't know what the rest of it is doing yeah and look i'm not uh on social issues on gender issues i'm not as far to the right and not nearly as far to the right as ben Shapiro is but i i think he was basically correct in saying that i mean if you're gonna make the the gender binary male and female is basically replicated it not just in western culture but in other but now there are exceptions in in western culture and in other cultures it's a it's it's this is a pretty seems to me to be a pretty dominating norm cross-cultures there are many exceptions to it and some large exceptions like the the with native americans that that got brought up right some some cultures have women hunting and men staying at home in prehistoric times there have been female monarchs there have been like there's all sorts of exceptions but a general the general male female dynamic is not just a western culture invention and does it no it's not prevalent in that's why he undermined his point by trying to pretend like this is how white people do it this is how malm white people do it different people in different places have done a lot of different ways i think the better point to make is that what we think is exceptional or deviations from the norm is a little has been a lot more prevalent both now and over the course of history than we understand it to be because of the selective reading of said history now that's not the point that was made and instead you you're right we did open with his ad hominem which you may or may not think is amusing and then and then basically let this whole door open by literally saying making a claim to your own authority based on credentials that had nothing to do with anything and then when ben Shapiro points out that your credentials while they might be impressive had nothing to do with the subject of the conversation his reply was if you got a law degree from harvard which i guess is supposed to be a dis but they're equally unqualified and it's just like you're randomly singing praises of his resume for no reason it was cringe it was cringy it was cringe and it's disappointing because the people who are at that event seem to be very much with ben Shapiro and nothing that was said in the context of this exchange is going to push people in either direction also it's not really clear to me from the substance of this what arguments are being made i would like to ask ben Shapiro okay what difference does it make to you why is it that you have this kind of disproportionate focus on how other people are living their private lives in a world where there's such an emphasis on individuality and freedom of choice i fully respect your ability to impregnate your wife many times and have the many children that you're very proud of but why is there this constant focus and attention on the way other people are living their lives and to have a substantive exchange about some of the tensions within his own ideology because by making it like even you just said you just said deviations from the norm so don't we have to then concede there is a norm i think it's okay for there to be deviant for the norm may be ben Shapiro disagrees but there is a norm and it's okay to not conform to it i feel that way but that doesn't mean there isn't a norm that most people fall into and that has mostly existed and it's okay to be different yeah i don't think anybody would dispute that i think there is an extent to which i think actually i think ben Shapiro and that student would have disputed it in opposite directions there is no norm norm is an invention of western colonializing society that they're forcing on everyone on one hand and yes there's a norm and everyone should conform to it on the other all right i think neither position is correct but we're both trying to read in a lot to our events that remain not free well in a very short clip but i am once again frustrated by the reductive nature of the internet but amused a little bit i confess by a sweet ad hominib let us know if you agree in the comments we'll have more rising after this inquiring minds want to know ken what's on your radar today well as robbie is covered extensively here on rising mask mandates are being reinstated in cities like philadelphia and in university such as george town extended in situations such as traveling on a plane and in some cases just haven't been lifted like for toddlers in new york city daycare centers the reinstatement of masks made me wonder where this is coming from what's the justification for this so today i want to go over the data with you plus i'll show you some surprising data from the cdc themselves so let's start with philie if philadelphia is reinstating masks they must be seeing a significant surge in cases right well let's take a look i think this graph speaks for itself what are they doing the cases are low look at this extremely low they're currently looking at a seven-day average of 176 cases per day and that's in a city of one and a half million now compare this to the little baby wave they had in september which had them seeing about 450 cases per day and that was during uh and that was during their baby wave now during their big wave in january they were seeing about five to six thousand cases per day on average again today they're seeing 165 cases per day on average and they're reinstating the masks now let's look at their deaths we know deaths lag by a few weeks but this here is showing that there's no reason to be alarmed the deaths are low very low they're averaging two per day but we don't know if these people died of covid or with it so a lot of places will list a person as a covid death if they just test positive despite them dying of other obvious ailments like cancer or injuries okay now let's look at washington dc where george town is if they're reinstating masks there must be a giant wave going around right also we've heard about that fancy gridiron super spreader event that infected marrick garland adam shift and new york and new york city marrick arrick atoms as well as about 70 others plus nancy polosi who wasn't even at that dinner also tested positive so dc must be just raging with this virus let's take a look here's dc okay so we can see that there's a slight uptick it's a little more than filley but it's still very very slight and here are the deaths for washington dc they're at zero they're at zero so clearly like philadelphia george town university is re-implementing mask mandates while cases are very low and maybe you're thinking that's exactly when to do it before the cases get out of control but by this logic we can never take off the mask until we reach zero covid if the idea is to wear a mask while cases are low and if covid is never going away then when does this end so let's look at the us's overall cases since federal airplane mask mandates are staying in effect they've extended them from april 18th when they were supposed to end and now they're ending not until uh may again cases are extremely low they're going up but they're very very low so is the plan to wear masks every time the ticker moves upward covid doesn't look to ever be going away so there needs to be another plan besides masking up and worst of all keeping toddlers masked so as long as covid exists and cases go up now i'm going to show you this graph this is from the cdc's own data and this is from justin heart from rational ground dot com and the graph is based on data from the cdc it's showing us counties with a population of over a hundred thousand and their seven-day average of cases per 100,000 people so the blue line represents counties that had mask mandates and the orange line are the counties that didn't now the counter to this is people say not everyone is compliant mandates can be in place but it doesn't mean people follow them okay fair enough now if you remember people often pointed to asia as the exemplary model of masking people in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan have a culture of mask wearing so compliance to the mandates haven't been an issue so let's take a look at how they're doing now most of these countries didn't see a big wave when the west and and south america did they instead are seeing their surge now which is why shanghai for example is under intense lockdown so let's take a look at japan now you could see that huge spike and then a little dip and they're now going back up again their seven-day average is currently at 50,000 cases per day at the height of their big wave they were seeing a hundred thousand cases per day they all wear masks all the time here south korea they're currently at 150,000 cases per day and at the recent peak peak they were seeing a whopping 400,000 cases per day on average and again they wear masks all the time with solid compliance so we have everything we need for you to choose to say to stay as safe as possible from a negative covid outcome you can decide to socially distance get the vaccine multiple times take an early treatment drug and yes if you want you can even mask up but as the world is finding out preventing transmission seems to be very difficult and every mandate we've tried besides extreme social distancing and total border lockdowns before a virus gets into the country has been unsuccessful at accomplishing it so lots of questions here you know just wanting to go over the data i know robbie you're very very much you know you've made yourself clear many times on this show about how you feel about masking but you know here we are reinstating some masking in some areas not allowing the masking to drop in others and i think there is just a general question that we need to ask which is what is the goal what are we trying to do yeah there are a couple of i think devil's advocate questions that i might want to ask one how much research there is about the efficacy of say the kn95 or the better quality masks versus some of these paper masks and cloth masks that people have been wearing and also about the efficacy of the one-way masking if one way masking in a high quality mask is getting the job done then obviously the arguments for having mandates goes way way way down but i do think can you make a compelling point that there are these other places that seem to have been implementing and reinforcing mask mandates pretty consistently they don't have big differences in outcomes yeah the cdc has acknowledged i believe the benefits of one-way masking or they've acknowledged that that's a solution you know people who want that extra level of protection absolutely they they should be able to make that choice 100 percent but for everyone else who has you know particularly for people in a situation many people have have already had it or maybe even already had it multiple times they're they might be vaccinated and boosted they might just not have to they they might not be afraid of covid more than they would be afraid of catching a cold or the you know the kind of seasonal illness that most people come come down with it it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to impose on all of society mass restrictions or requirements when that basically we've gotten covid to that stage you know you can make a different argument for the earlier stages of the pandemic but look we're in a stage where we're going to see upticks in cases periodically probably forever we're not going to get to to covid zero and and you know countries that are still charting that course look pretty authoritarian miserable so learning to live with the virus i think means devolving the choice to individuals and i i really thought we we've gotten there but you know places like philadelphia many college campuses i i think dc i don't know if they're going to bring back the mass mediate or not it wouldn't surprise me if they wait if they wait until what is it three weeks from now the white three weekends from now the white house correspondence dinner and then as soon as that's over they say oh yeah yeah now mass are back like the you know yeah rich wealthy the political people that as long as they got to have their party with maximum fun which is another you know part of this that we talk about frequently we got the compliance mostly falls on the least powerful well okay i'm curious the the other thing i was thinking of is this conversation about how some of the data is affected by the reality that testing uh is not as frequent as it has been in the past it's a possibility that if we're seeing such high profile figures even like Nancy Pelosi and all of these politicians come down with covid there does seem to be a little bit of a gap cognitively for me as i'm trying to understand all of this all of that happening and actually experiencing in my personal life a lot of people it seems are getting covid again in a spike and the lack of a change on the graph could that be in part because we're not testing people are going to the hospital with flu like symptoms and i'm reporting that they're not even given covid tests in that context we have a lot of these home tests that joe biden sent out and people are kind of testing in the privacy of their homes and not reporting through any kind of mechanism are you concerned at all that we might not have an accurate picture of what's going on with the disease especially because it's politically advantageous for biden the democrats right now to say that they've got this under control right well the one the one thing that we can't fudge are the hospitalizations and the deaths so even if the testing is lagging or people just aren't testing as much and they're catching covid and we're not recording that we do know whether or not people are showing up at the hospital and they're just simply not so you know and even with the omicron wave we saw fewer people going to the hospital than what we saw like for philadelphia for example they saw way more hospitalizations at the very beginning of the pandemic back in early 2020 in that spring way more hospitalizations what way more deaths and hospitalizations but particularly deaths then they did even during the omicron wave when they had way more cases than they had in that first wave now the first wave they may have had many many many cases as to your point they just didn't test and they didn't know that they had all the cases but we saw that the hospitals did you know they they had a significant number of people showing up and needing to be hospitalized that is not happening right now so now what they're saying of course is well we're trying to prevent that that's why we want people to go back and mask up because we're trying to prevent the spread which would then hopefully prevent the hospitalization but we don't even have you know clear data at this point on how can take how how a deadly or severe this latest new variant is the cousin of omicron that's even more virulent we don't know and so but to go back to masking again you know you can't wear it all day every single day and we know that the the the place you're going to most likely catch covid is at home somebody comes home they've got it and then you're sleeping in your circling here i can't wear it i can't wear it any time of the i can't wear it for another minute longer i will just be perfectly honest i'm going to but i i will say robbie unfortunately that i i wouldn't be surprised if they bring back the mask mandates in the fall when we definitely see the the waves surging through people rise up what i think i want is a wonderful point i'll i'll join you that is worth noting is that there there is a lot of um buzz in the disability community about what the obligations are that even if most of us because we're vaccinated aren't going to you know succumb to covid the worst effects as you were pointing out kim in early 2020 we're because a lot of people of course we're getting very sick and dying before the vaccines were out uh that there are people who are a middle compromise and have other things going on that are similarly vulnerable but that isn't that is why i'm so interested in this question about one-way masking if people can stay relatively safe and protect themselves if they have a different threshold for illness then that really does eliminate one of the biggest arguments for mask mandates but interesting as always kim oh thank you all right we'll have uh more rising after this well it's official the rumors are true elan musk wants to buy twitter he has offered to purchase the social media company for fifty four dollars and twenty cents a share or about forty three billion saying that the site needs to be transformed privately because it can neither thrive nor serve free speech in its current state and this comes a little a week about a little over a week after first revealing a nine point two percent stake in the company and with the news that musk declined to join the board so now i guess we know why a letter to twitter chairman bret taylor musk said quote i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy as a result i'm offering to buy one hundred percent of twitter for fifty four cent uh dollars and twenty cents per share in cash wow yeah so yeah big news so some people on twitter were pointing out that it was worth more was worth seventy dollars per share a year ago but obviously that that's a year ago yeah that's a year ago you buy one of your work that ever again so i this i think this is a pretty strong offer for the moment so the they absolutely had they they're required to consider it they wouldn't be acting in twitter's best interest if they didn't and people are kind of so what i'm seeing on twitter is a lot of people sharing the view that i feel that this is kind of exciting um you know elan musk at least has articulated a vision of twitter that is probably closer to my own heart one where the you know moderation of political speech is a little is less aggressive uh and that there's more of a kind of free speech dynamic going on then i see other people freaking out that oh no he's you know he's gonna let trump back on or something uh which he very well might do and might be the correct thing to do if he if he took control of twitter but uh yeah it's pretty funny yeah i don't obviously care about trump coming back on the platform uh and if he plans to run twitter as he says he is in terms of the investment in free speech i think that would be fine i'm a little curious about why there's so much confidence that elan musk given the way he's you know historically behaved on twitter given how sensitive he is sometimes about interacting with people on twitter given his kind of generalized temperament and some of the choices that he has made in terms of how he's lived his life and with his money that there that that is actually what's going to happen and that he's not going to use it to continue to make his own little fiefdom the way that he's trying to make the sky in all of his space his own fiefdom why are people is there any concern from either of you that he might not actually be willing to follow through in his process but promises to make twitter more free well i mean i think that there's always a risk right that when somebody gets into that position um you know for one it's a lot harder to run a social media platform than to just say free speech for everybody i mean we know that you can't really have you know carte blanche free speech there's you you've got to say well we can't have anything that's going to be you know illegal like calling for violence of against somebody or doxing maybe maybe doxing will become something you can't do on twitter um obviously uprisings you know there's things that you have to be cautious about when you're running a social media platform but look i mean better than the alternative i think it's worth a shot let the guy run it let's see what happens it's better than what's going on right now and that is that the platform is just run by pretty much one side you can't say a lot of things on twitter uh they banned i mean the former president of the united states i to me how can we even pretend to be a functioning democracy when we've literally banned the former president of the united states that's just bizarre if you don't like what he says don't listen to him don't vote for him it's pretty simple um but no i i mean i think it's worth a shot and by the way here you know i mean this is an enormous amount of money 43 billion bucks maybe he could even up it a bit that guy elan musk has nearly as much money just to put this in perspective as jeff bezos and bill gates combined i'm not really concerning him i'm just curious because we understand that there's an alignment of interest between kind of liberal politics and the people who run a lot of these tech sites right that's how we get stuff like donald trump being banned in the uh hunter biden story being wiped from the site and all of those kinds of things but it's not like elan musk doesn't have his own interest as someone whose wealth is kind of historically unprecedented and who has plenty of reasons to want to have certain kinds of information flowing or not flowing but here on the internet but here's the so here's the viewpoint of the kind of regime that runs twitter right now so max boot is a columnist for washing post he was like a neo-conservative and then a never trump and now just kind of exists in the resistance democrat side i he he writes on twitter i am frightened by the impact on society and politics that elan musk acquires twitter he seems to believe that on social media anything goes for democracy to survive we need more content moderation not less and so that's what the people who run it right now exactly you're a bully to speak terrible and share things should be further constrained that's the that's the governing ethos right now so which is one i disagree with and one i don't want for the company so i'm sure of course elan musk could screw anyone could screw it up but but the difference is that the difference is that elan musk is one person with unprecedented wealth and power as opposed to a potentially diversified board of people and joint control but at least would have multiple opinions jockeying for primacy and i'm not saying it's ideal but my instinct is always going to be for a more democratic setup than a more autocratic setup and i'm i with you i'm hoping and praying for a benevolent ruler and elan musk if it comes to that i'm just a little bit more skeptical i guess then then you guys might be on whether that's going to be the case it's terrible right now i mean it is it just sucks so anything i mean you know for that type of attitude that robbie just you know it just shared with us that is so alarming and that's coming from somebody working for jeff bezos by the way who owns the washington post so you know what are is are all the writers at washington post worried because when jeff bezos bought it you know so i understand that there is this fear and maybe this hesitancy but the reality is is that you know if you're willing to work for and read the washington post under jeff bezos i don't understand what the difference really would be with twitter except that if elan musk is saying i'm going to promise that this is going to be more of a free of a free speech platform and if he doesn't uphold that then people will just boycott the thing i mean people will just say hey you turned and you know law i mean he doesn't want to one person also doesn't want to end up being hated by the masses and he would be hated by the masses if he and by the way briana something that i think is true that nobody wants to acknowledge the greatest gift anyone could give to democrats would be to bring donald trump back onto twitter right now it would be in that benefit i thought i thought i'm tweeting every day but you guys know i'm already about trump this this point that you just brought up kim i i i don't know i just i'm concerned that there is this belief i i totally agree with you about max but but in the newspaper context there are other washington posts there are a diversity of newspapers that is may as there used to be that's a problem the idea of defecting from twitter people have had issues with twitter for a long time now but the problem is that some of these these outlets like twitter and facebook these platforms don't have duplicates in the world in the same way that some of the media class does and that is part of their charm that is part of the whole magic of these is that everybody you know is in the same place and i think that part of the concern here is exactly how difficult it will be to set up an alternative and flee twitter if it actually does become more restricted i mean of the major where there's twitter and facebook and youtube and some other things and actually right now and i like the idea that there are that there are different companies and i actually think if the policies were more different between them something we might figure out what we like best their policies aren't all that discordant because they have very similar kind of ideologies in how they're governed if now twitter actually has a very different ideology i think that might be good for society that might you know we might figure something out like oh yeah that was a better idea that twitter is doing or no that's actually yeah that's not good it is this kind of view of content moderation doesn't work we would actually get to see that with someone who thinks very differently in charge of one of these companies yeah i mean look i don't think he can make it worse i don't think he could just delete it and like with this that would that be the end of the world maybe not for some of us for some of us it was for journalists twitter is so important i feel like my whole career wouldn't have existed without it used to be this democratized platform it is but it it is important it's important for me right it's where i see what people are talking about it has important news gathering value but it also has news warping value right it it it causes journalists to think that some stories are more way more important than they are i mean i think it's been unhealthy for the democratic party this is obviously not making the democratic party healthier is not a top concern of mine but that it has mutated and warped and affected the priorities of young staffers who staff democratic campaigns because they pay way too much attention to twitter which is not to say twitter isn't important it's very important because the things that you know political staffers think are important but they're so not reflective of the rest of the country and it i think it's caused a lot of people who work in the party to miss that well i would be much more concerned brie if elan musk where let's say a big conservative guy and then he says oh yeah i'm going to take it and finally you know like how trump was trying to do with his truth social or something like this where they say okay i'm going to create this and it's going to be finally free for everybody you know because conservatives are being censored but elan musk is a libertarian guy he's not either left or right he gets smeared by both sides and he doesn't fit into any box so i think it's if you know look i i hate the fact also that a billionaire has to come in and rescue us and and give us back our free speech that's not what a democracy is but better to have the billionaire and and the wealthiest one in the world at that wanting to give us that free speech and democracy then to want to take it away all right let's see if the benevolent billionaire this is our the world's first benevolent billionaire i hope you guys are right what about Bruce Wayne tomorrow on rising senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and author of hacking Darwin Jamie mexel will join us to argue why we
