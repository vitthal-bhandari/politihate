    "text": " Happy Friday, everybody. You did it. You made it. It's the end of the week and it's going to be a long weekend. Very exciting. It's been a fun week on the show. Question of the day for you guys. I want you to think about this realistically. Is it plausible that I am in the Illuminati, that I am a George Soros puppet, that I am somehow related to the world's economic forum, that all of these things are plausibly true or... or... is the black pill getting a little bit dangerous? Are people that have moves from the red pill to the black pill no longer to process reality whatsoever? Have they just believed that everything and everyone is corrupted, everything is a conspiracy theory. I want to talk about that. Plus later on in the show, Elon Musk says that in elites LA school, $3,000 per year, brainwashed his communist trans daughter into hating him for being rich. That's one take. I'd like to tell you my opinion on that. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. What's up? So I do not like George Soros. I do believe him to be an incredibly evil man. I have dedicated hours onto this show, trying to expose all of the ways in which he is using his money to corrupt the West. I believe that he's got allegiance to the East for some reason. I have questions about his childhood. But if you've listened to this podcast, you know that to be abundantly true. And yet, despite all of these things, despite me talking about George Soros on the show, despite his media arm, I think it's called Media Matters, that or constantly doing hit pieces on me. From the very first time I appeared onto the scene, all the way through to now, trying to get me effectively canceled, calling me anti-semitic. There are people in this world, people on the conservative side who believe that I am somehow tied to George Soros. I kid you're not, this is not the first time they've made weird allegations about me. They saw me tag a picture of one of my best friends whose last name is Schwab. And then they connected me to therefore that girl must be related to Klaus Schwab, because obviously every person on the planet who's got the last name Schwab must be related to Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum. And thereby, George Soros's money is somehow related and Candace is bought and paid for. And if that sounds crazy and difficult for you to follow, then you should know how difficult it has been for me to follow throughout my career, all of the various things that I get accused of being. I mean, depending on what hour of the day it is, I'm either a raging anti-semit or, or, I'm being controlled by Ben Shapiro and Israel. Which is true, which is true. Am I a raging anti-semit or am I being controlled by Ben Shapiro and Israel? Or is it plausible that neither of these things are true and people are interneting too hard? I'm actually going to show you this picture of me. It's an interesting one. To exactly where I was, I was here sitting here doing my show thinking as we had a live studio audience about something that I was trying to keep my thought on. I put my hands here. Somebody grabbed the screenshot of it and this image has been shared all over. You know what it means? No, it doesn't mean that I was just thinking on my show trying to gather my thoughts before a show like this. This is how I think I always look to the side, typically hold my hand. It's very talladig a night. I don't know what to do with my hands. That would be too reasonable. No. What it actually means is that I am a free Mason deceiver shill according to this person on Twitter at Inverter Eyes. Candace Owens, free Mason deceiver shill. Illuminati pyramid symbolism, Hakeini Mudra symbolism allegiance to her master state in Candace Owens and invert. She is not for the people. Thankfully that Steve Rogers invert your eyes able to piece that together because that would be way too rational to think that I was literally just thinking. Oh, this picture, this one's one of my favorite stories of all time. That was in New York City interviewing Eric Trump when New York City was shut down for COVID and when nobody was allowed to even go into restaurants unless they were vaccinated. Now, obviously you guys know I am not vaccinated. I speak out passionately against vaccines. I have an entire series dedicated trying to show people that vaccines have always been a scam for children, not just the COVID one. And so I thought after concluding this interview, wouldn't it be funny if I figured out how to get pizza in Manhattan, which is a state point? Obviously, in Manhattan, I love pizza. The pizza is not that great down here in Tennessee without being vaccinated. Challenge accepted. We figured out how to do it. We got somebody to go and get us a whole pizza. And I said, let's snap a picture bragging rights. Bit into that pepperoni pizza and whoa, whoa, whoa. The comments under Instagram. Candace Owens is evolving pizza gate. Candace Owens, she somehow connected to the Clintons. She somehow collected to George George. She somehow connected to children in tunnels because she ate a piece of pizza in Manhattan. And then when I yelled at these people and said, literally, you're demented. There's something wrong with you. Obviously, there's something wrong with you. If I can't eat a slice of pizza, trying to be funny to show how I scurried the laws in New York City without you thinking of children being abused and trying to associate me of all people with that. They commented and said, well, you should at least nobody. You have a platform. You know, you shouldn't even be eating pizza on the internet. Oh, I'm the problem, not you. Not that your brain has somehow been bent and you can't even see straight. Luminati, pizza gates, Schwab, a friend of mine, yes, who I met in Trump's White House actually and is not related to Klaus Schwab whatsoever. This is what is happening now where people that are on our side are no longer able to see straight. And I understand the distrust. I get it. Trust me. We have been lied to over and over again. There are huge questions that are not answered. Those weird pizza emails with Obama among them, but absolutely. But what you cannot see a single person that enters into this movement straight, when you cannot process anything but the worst evils for every single individual, that's not helping our cause. That's hurting. I'll give you an example. I don't love Ron DeSantis. I've made no mistake of the fact that I don't think he should be the next president of the United States. I think he's a great governor. I don't know how many times I can say that. But I think he's fake. And I don't like when he does that weird, straining smile. I say all of these things on the show. I think that he's got way too much donor money. I don't accuse him simply because I don't like him or I don't envision as president of the United States of somehow being involved with George Soros. I think it's pretty obvious that he's hit hard against the George Soros DAs in Florida. And I'm grateful for that. It makes him actually a really strong leader. But no, no, no, no, people now, if you don't like someone, they know. And this almost feels fraudulent, right? Oh, if I don't like the person, I'm going to just smear them. I'm going to just say that they are a Soros puppet. And then a bunch of people will believe it because a bunch of people on the internet have had their minds bent and they can't process reality. A great example of that recently is people are arguing, trying to say that the vague Rama Swami is a Soros puppet. But also Trump is a Soros puppet because both of them have potentially taken money from George Soros in their past. Now, context matters. If you care about the truth, but again, if you've taken the black pill and you just need to believe that everybody's satanic in the Illuminati, then maybe the context doesn't matter. Here's a vague on Glenn Beck talking about the Soros money he took when he took scholarship money to go to law school. Take a listen. You have a longtime association with Soros. And I'm probably the number one anti-Soros guy in the world. Can I give you a one word answer to that question? Glenn, I know you're the number one anti-Soros guy. I'm not saying false to you. I'm saying false to the longtime association with George Soros. Yeah. Why? 100% lie. Now, let me actually give you guys the facts. And again, this cookies clickbait conservatives online. I don't know if they feel threatened or whatever and they need to make up stuff. I was 25 years old when I went to law school. I got a scholarship funded by Paul Soros, not George Soros, but Paul Soros that allowed me at the age of 25 to pay for law school. And I took it. You want to know why? Because I'm smart. Now, it's hilarious to me that the same people who bring that backed up from when I was 25 years old, taking a scholarship funded partially by somebody who's related to George Soros, don't say a word about the fact that, again, Donald Trump, who I love, who I respect, I'm not criticizing him, took a $160 million loan from not Paul Soros, but George Soros himself. I have no problem with it. No, no, no, why? Because it's business. Donald Trump knows what he's doing. I don't think he's corrupted by that. I'm not criticizing him for it. He's a friend. But I think it's funny and I think it's revealing that these same people will talk about a 25-year-old kid taking a scholarship to help him pay for law school. From a relative of George Soros, make a big deal out of that without saying a peep about Donald Trump taking $160 million loan for George Soros. And I say that as a friend and somebody who respects Donald Trump because I don't think that disqualifies him or taints him in any way because he's a man of integrity and he's doing business the way he knows how. But I think that when you're in positions like I've been or Donald Trump's been, you get that. I think if you're sitting online all day on Twitter, it can be a very different story. So what's the truth there? Do you listen to that and you think, oh my God, what a horrible excuse because common sense before Bewick ever explained that. When people started mentioning the fact that he took a scholarship for school, I thought, how wealthy are you? I remember sitting down and applying for every single scholarship, fellowship. All I had here from the guidance counselor was that this would reduce costs and I applied. I wrote essays. I had no idea that people were. I wouldn't have known if you had said 18-year-old Candace. You're applying for a sorrel's fellowship. I would have written the essay and sent it in. Just like you're sending in a bunch of college apps. You're trying to get as much money as possible. If somebody dug that up, I don't know. Maybe I did. Maybe I did apply for a sorrel's fellowship. If somebody dug that up and meaningfully tried to connect me to the Sorrel's empire, I would think you are just such a fundamentally dishonest human being that you do not belong in the discourse of politics. That's what I would say, right? I'm sorry I was broke. I'm sorry that my family couldn't afford to put me through college. I'm sorry I couldn't afford $35,000 per year and I was just trying to get money any way, any which ways I can. Do you want to know who else I took a loan from? Sally Mae. Oh my gosh. I must support the big banks. That's what it is. I must support JP Morgan. I am certain now since I took a loan from Sally Mae because I was broke that certainly this must mean that I somehow supported the crash. I must somehow be tied to all financial crashes because I am funding the big banks, right? I mean these are the sorts of ridiculous things that people are saying right now and it's getting annoying. It is why I'm not having a fun time engaging in politics anymore because nobody is being sincere. These critiques are not sincere. You don't have to like the big promise for me. You don't have to like the sanitation. You don't have to like Trump. But can you at least be meaningful and be sincere in your critiques? Hell, you don't even have to like me, right? But can you at least be real when you attack me with something? Can you at least be honest and say that it's highly unlikely that a girl that came from absolutely nothing is in the Illuminati because she's taledigat nights doesn't quite know what to do with her hands when she's thinking? You know, we so often talk about how the left is demented because they believe absolutely everything. They watch the media and they say, oh, that's exactly real. That's reality. There's no way. There's a COVID conspiracy. Oh, no. We should say at home. And they're like program bots because they can't think on their own. But we have a small contingent of the right that is becoming equally as demented because it's opposite sides of the same coin. They believe absolutely nothing. The problem ties everybody. They don't understand the rule about six degrees of separation. I can connect anybody. You give me six jumps and I can connect you to George Soros. I promise you, I walk through your house and tell you what product his deal, what deal was done at his $25 billion hedge fund that you're purchasing. And that means that you must support George Soros and all of his interests. That means you're funding all of these bizarre movements. We all need to get real. The black pill is becoming dangerous. And that's all I have to say about that. Okay, now it's time for some topics to draw. Elon Musk is in the news because he is blaming an elite LA school for brainwashing his communist transition. He is a communist trans child into hating him for being rich. And this is an interesting story for us to cover, definitely compelling for me as a parent. Essentially, Elon Musk believes that had his child not gone to this $50,000 a year school, the child would not have thought that they were transgender. The child would not be hating him right now and all of his riches. And to be clear, there is definitely some merit to that. Obviously, first off, it's Los Angeles. If you're sending your child to school period in Los Angeles district, you probably have a problem, especially if you're sending them to an elite school in Los Angeles. We can probably predict all elite schools in New York and Manhattan are incredibly left leaning. They're going to be funded by not funded by liberals, but the parents that are putting the money into it tend to be left leaning. And so it's not a surprise. We often talk about the role that these schools are having, even the Department of Education, which is currently sending down all of these narratives and wanting children to believe in these indoctrinated beliefs, such as LGBTQ agenda. And so I'm not discounting what he's saying here. The reason I want to talk about it is because him solely blaming the LA school is something that I think is actually wrong. And I think that it removes power away from the parents. So when I see a situation like this, yes, there is a part of this, you're sending your kids to school, who don't know what they're learning. And I think that we saw this with the birth of parents going to school board meetings and realizing I had no idea these books were even taught in the school. And as I've said, that was intentional. There was this effort to make women feel guilty for staying at home and effort to say that both parents should be in the office, which allowed the government to step in and to raise the next generation of children. And a lot of these children do, of course, turn into little commies. Or hitting the streets at the behest of the government and fighting for whatever the next government cause is. But my question when I read this article was where are the parents? And I perhaps in this particular situation, where is the mother, right? Because Elon Musk is changing the world in which it's why I'm not going to hit him over the head too much on this. I genuinely believe that he is fighting a war, a very serious war. I view him as a soldier in the culture wars. And more than that, he's a general in the culture wars. What he did in terms of taking over formerly Twitter now ex and who he had to stand up to the entire establishment media, people that are trying to paint him like he wasn't. What he has done with his riches has been absolutely tremendous. And we need more allies like Elon Musk who do something that no benefit to themselves. There was no reason for Elon Musk to go from being this techie guy in Silicon Valley that's building rocket ships. He's suddenly saying I'm going to take over X. It was to burden without question. But he did it anyways because he understood how severely demented things were becoming in America in terms of free speech. He understood what was happening during COVID, how you had people that were literally being taken off of the internet for wrong. I think it was a very scary time. Twitter was a very scary place under the stewardship of Jack Dorsey who I think just didn't have the spine to handle it. So I want to give Elon Musk the full credit for what he is doing. I don't want to give him as a person as I said in general that is out to war. But where are the women in his life? The women that are birthing these children then? If daddy's out fighting a war, where is mommy? And so I don't want to remove the responsibility of the parents here. Because I can tell you right now despite the fact that I am a working mom, there is absolutely no way that this could happen to my child in any school district and I not know about it. Because I understand that my role as a mother is to be in the trenches understanding exactly what it is that these teachers are doing, what they're saying, how they're speaking. We showed you that example yesterday and this week of that wonderful mother to young 12-year-old Jaden in that Colorado Springs school district who stood up for her child was sitting talking to the principal or the administrator and saying, uh-uh, that there is nothing wrong with what my son did here with this, don't try it out on me flag. You are actually in the wrong. That needs, you need to have that close of a relationship with your children's school. And if you're just throwing money at the problem, if you're just saying, I'm going to have children and you're not thinking about the women that you are marrying or the women that you're impregnating and looking for them to be a person that is going to steward your child, then that is where you went wrong, right? So there is a mother in this circumstance who failed miserably to understand what their child was taking on indoctrination can only happen at the behest of the parents. And again, I say that with full credit to Elon for all of his accomplishments and the ways that he is saving Western civilization by restoring free speech online. All right, guys, I want to move on to this incredible speaking of Twitter updates. You know, Twitter is doing the community notes and they are glorious. I have to say it's one of the greatest things that Elon Musk has brought forward because it really allows you to engage with the media in a meaningful way, meaning that you can understand what utter BS they are feeding people at all times. And in the past, under the stewardship of Jack Dorsey, the BS would just go unchecked. People would just look at this and say, this headline must be real. So CNN ran this headline, CNN, which obviously has very nefarious agendas at all time. They ran two men in Uganda are facing separate charges of aggravated homosexuality and offense punishable by death under the country's conscience. And under the country's controversial new anti gay laws. So we've talked about the Ugandan anti gay laws, the West tried to make a big deal out of what they are doing because obviously we think everybody needs to be gay and lesbian and trans here in America. That seems to be what we're after, I guess, to some regard. And some countries are saying this is not good. We understand what you're doing and stay out and we're going to do what we want to do. And so now the job of the Western media is to make it seem that these countries are really scary places and horrible things are happening. And by the way, this headline serves that purpose. Oh my gosh, this is their gay men are going to be put to death simply for being gay, aggravated homosexuality. Under these new anti gay laws, how could this possibly be happening? Well, thankfully a community note came to the rescue to tell you about those two gay guys who are simply going to be put to death potentially for being gay. Here's the context. It reads, one man is accused of having a sexual relation with a disabled man. The other of a sexual act with a 12 year old child both are charged with aggravated homosexuality defined as same sex relations with someone who is HIV positive. A child, an elderly person or disabled. Oh, okay, well that is some very serious context there. You forgot to mention the part where somebody was a pedophile and you wanted us to instantly in your headline scenario to feel bad for the person because they're gay. You can't even stomach this kind of dishonesty, but it's been happening forever because they need people when they're pushing their narratives. They need to remove the truth because they just need to make sure that the narrative is that homosexuals are under attack. They never do anything wrong. Earlier this week I told you about how it was crazy for me to process that everything that I was told about Matthew Shepard of the Laramie Project was a lie. This is exactly that. We're moving crucial details so that we can't have a meaningful discussion about what's actually going on because for whatever bizarre reason we are obsessed with all things LGBTQT, IA plus every other letter in this country. All right, guys, let's talk about this woman Amanda Holden. I actually would say that I am still taking a lot of flack for having gone and interviewed Andrew Tate and trying to understand closely the phenomena of Andrew Tate. He has a past and audience, millions and millions of men follow him. And of course the media take is that he's a toxic masculine man who is making men treat women terribly. And so when I saw this headline, I was keen to say, to see what it was that Andrew Tate said that was so bad. The headline ran on the Daily Mail. It says Amanda Holden 52 breaks her silence on Andrew Tate's controversial criticism of her racy snaps and reveals why she refuses to retaliate. So immediately ahead of mine like that, you go, Amanda Holden is a victim, Andrew Tate has done something horrible to her, and she is taking the high road by not even retaliating and they have this picture of her in a bikini and she looks really sexy. And the entire episode article was written was really interesting because they were trying to already make you hate Andrew Tate before they even got to what it was that he said that was so controversial that she was taking the high road and refusing to retaliate. It says here in July, the heart FN presenter 52 years old tweeted a racy image of herself enjoying a poolside shower in a sexy black bikini, igniting a vile response from the former big brother contestant who's dubbed the king of toxic masculinity. So in journalists do this, they're already implanting into your head how you are supposed to think of this, that what he has done is already vile before he even tell you what he has said. And he is the king of toxic masculinity, he is bad, she is great, got it. So what did Andrew Tate say? He said to this 52 year old woman who is married with children, you are a wife and a mother and your far past a teenager. There is no need for this post. That's all he said. Didn't call her a bitch, didn't call her a hoe, didn't speak down to her, he basically called her exactly what she is. A wife, check, true, a mother, check, true, not a teenager, check, true, no need for this post, check, true. Nothing happened here, nothing happened to her. But again, as we just spoke about, there are all sorts of media agendas and one of them is to make women think that there is empowerment and nudity. And that somehow it makes you cooler or somehow more relevant if you're constantly naked on the internet. And this has actually been an ideology, but I speak out against often, not because of Andrew Tate because it's been crucial for me to let young women know that being this way does not make you happy. It doesn't make you happy. They're aligned to you, which is just a media simulation that women should constantly be taking their clothes off, you know. A lot of these women end up alone and unhappy. So he says this to her and the media jumps to her side because how dare he criticize her while she's wearing a bikini. And what I found to be particularly interesting is what she said back. She said, honestly, I had another shot of me in a bikini with just a close up of my bum. I was tempted to post with the caption, kiss my 52 year old arse. But you know, something like that is just going to go on and on and in the end, why give him oxygen? She insisted that she only dresses for herself and no one else and isn't that the truth because we live in a culture of narcissism that's supposed to be empowering. She's dressing for her. She's being sexy for her. Never mind the fact that she has an 11 year old child at home. Never mind the fact that she is also a mother to a 17 year old daughter. It's about her and how she feels and what she wants to do every single day because again, we live in a largely selfish culture. Nobody is selfless. Nobody thinks about their kids first. I don't think about their husband, whether or not they're respecting your husband. It's all about you, you, you, me, me, me. And if somebody dare says, hey, have you ever considered that you are leading a family? Have you ever considered that you are the matriarch of a family? Have you ever considered that your daughters are looking to you as an example that your husband wants to be respected? Then you're supposed to snap back and say, well, I was gonna act. I actually have a picture of my bum and my arse and I was gonna put it on the internet and I might do it next time. Yeah, that's a sad way to be when you're 52 years old in conclusion. And your tape was right. All right, guys, we started this week going over incredible videos of Black America responding to Trump's mugshots. And I thought, what better way to end this week before we get to your comments than to wrap with this last video that we found on TikTok of a young man discussing Trump's mugshot? You got to feel good. It's Friday. I want you going into the weekend feeling right. Take a listen. And I don't give a damn who this a things. But if that Trump get convicted of this crime and he can still run for president, I'm voting for his. I'm voting for that. I'm voting for him. If that is convicted and he can still run for president, just to see what the **** he do. So that's funny now. Trump is funny as hell. I'm voting for him. I'm telling you right now. Okay. So just miss me with it. Make America great again. It's got such a good laugh. Make America great again. And it's just honestly it's objectively hilarious to hear him keep calling Trump the N word. I just think it's absolutely hilarious. All right, guys. Let's jump into some of your comments on episodes past. First set of comments are about Barack Obama. We were exploring whether or not he is a homosexual. He definitely is a homosexual. And here's what some of you guys had to say about that. Cherry Delion writes, I heard and thought it was propaganda. Today, I'm fully aware and awake. Will appreciate my conspiracy theories badge of honor. Thank you for shedding light on this content. The chef's death was not an accident. Yes, the chef's death. I have to be honest, I haven't looked too far into it. I know people were saying that there were a lot of weird things about it. And it just hasn't really crossed my radar. But maybe I should do a little deep dive into what is going on because I've heard that that's not the first person that is drowned back there, which of course is usual. A little bit suspicious, but I also have don't want to become a blunder. I don't want to become a black pill person and suddenly think that every single person that dies must have been killed. Mr. Prios writes, being in the military, I find it corrupt that I have to submit to constant drug tests, having to piss in a cup in front of an observer about once a year to keep my security clearance. At the same time, these politicians who have authority over us get to run around and do what they like because they will never get tested. At a minimum, they need to be tested once a year, just like the servicemen. That is actually such a valid point and one that I've never thought about. It is incredible. It is incredible that you can do cocaine in the White House. You can bring cocaine in the White House and they can just look you down in the face and say, we don't know who it is, which means they definitely know who it is. And it's somebody like Biden or Hunter Biden because otherwise they would have no problem throwing a person under the bus. And yet you're right, the way that we treat our servicemen, the people that are willing to die for this country is absolutely despicable. They are constantly also forcing you guys to get vaccines. It feels like with politicians, it's always rules for everybody else and not rules for them. Moving on, we discussed that teacher who moonlights as a drag queen yesterday who also got arrested on child porn charges and then had them expunged really on a technicality because they couldn't prove how old the person who looks like a child was in the photo, so the judge threw it out. John Fish writes, how do you get arrested for child porn and then get a job as a principal at an elementary school? No betting, they didn't care. Beyond him being a drag queen, this is very disturbing. They had the meeting private to the public who knew the guy was a petal when a drag queen couldn't show up and kill the idea of him working there. Yep, I think it's very strange and I think that all of these sexual fetishes, people with prosthetic breasts, people that are moonlighting us, drag queens, I just have questions about why it is that so many of them are demanding access to children that they want to talk to children about their sexuality. It makes me uncomfortable and it would not be allowed to happen anywhere that my children were at, but I can only control what I will allow in my household. It's going to take parents of an elementary school to stand up and do something about it if they so choose. All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time that we have for today. As a reminder, my 10-part series, Convicting a Murderer will premiere on X, formerly Twitter, on September 8th at 9 p.m. Eastern, and it is going to be free for everybody to watch. The second episode will also be available for free on Daily Wire Plus, so if you are a true crime junkie like me, I know you're a true crime junkie, you are going to love this series. Don't forget also to subscribe to the YouTube channel if that is where you are watching. Have a great long weekend, everybody. We will see you on Tuesday."
