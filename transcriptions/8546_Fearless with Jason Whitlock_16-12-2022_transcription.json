    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaisetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. We made it. It's the weekend. It's Friday. And you know what? It's the last show, the last new show of the year 2022 for us here at Fearless. We're going to enjoy our Christmas break. We're going to enjoy the holiday. We will put out some content over YouTube and over Facebook and over Instagram to keep you interested. But in terms of full blown episodes of Fearless, new episodes of Fearless, this is it. We're going to have to enjoy this time together. I do think we're going to re-air some of our greatest episodes from the last 18 months, two years. But in terms of the new episodes fresh up to this is it. We're going to have to enjoy today, embrace today, celebrate what we've accomplished and what we've enjoyed together during 2022. And look forward to 23. I think we'll be back on January the 3rd or whatever that Monday is after the New Year's. We'll be back with a fresh episode of the show. But this is it, baby. And so let's make the most of it. I have a fantastic, awesome show plan for you today. Let me check my notes here. The Korean Co-Sell will be here as will be Delano Squires. We're going to talk a potpourri of sports topics with the Korean Co-Sell. Delano's written a terrific column about, and this card's not right. Oh, well, yeah it is. Anyway, Delano's written a terrific column about Joe Biden and his commitment to the alphabet mafia and the throne he has ascended to atop the alphabet mafia. But we're going to do it. Korean Co-Sell, myself, Delano Squires, I don't think it gets any better. We're going to stick the landing for 2022 today. And we'll start by sticking that landing by talking about one of my favorite, if not my favorite sponsor, of this show, Good Ranches. Have you ever had an unforgettable Christmas? You thought you received the thing you wanted the most and then figured out it was just a normal pair of socks. They weren't even blaze socks, so they just sucked the happiness right out of the room. What if I said you could fight inflation, eat luxurious food, and give your family the awesome gift you could have received yourself. Well, you can. Make someone's Christmas unforgettable by gifting them with a Good Rancher subscription. Good Ranchers is the sure way to give 100% American USDA prime and upper choice cuts of beef, chicken, and seafood. Plus, you can get the gift of a subscription and look in someone's lock in someone's price for them this entire year. I don't know about you, but an inflation-proof meat budget beats a new pair of plain socks for me, so head on over to goodranchers.com and use the code FEARLESS at checkout for the $35 off your delicious gift of meat. If you know someone that likes meat, then you know someone who will love good ranchers. Head on over to goodranchers.com and find the perfect box and a curated selection of America's best meat and seafood. Give the best meat in America, support local U.S. farms, get $35 off with my code, support a business that supports me, you, and us and our way of life. Avoid inflation this Christmas with good ranchers. American meat delivered be a good fearless soldier. Feed your soldiers, your personal soldiers, good ranchers. I'm going to take my own advice and I'm going to send my brother and his family a subscription to good ranchers. I'm going to take what you guys I don't suggest things to you that I don't do myself. It's going to be a perfect Christmas gift for my brother and his family. I'm going to start giving everybody my family a good ranchers subscription. It takes the thinking out of my head. I'm going to think about Christmas gifts. I've hooked them up with a gift they will enjoy for months and years. Do the same. All right, let's roll out to Los Angeles and bring in the Korean Co-Sell. And Co-Sell, I want to start here with a slight curve ball. I'm looking at, they give me these cards here and they got the topics listed and they tell me what's going to be on the screen for the lower thirds. And I'm looking at something that says Korean Co-Sell hour. That's the title of this hour. The Korean Co-Sell, who came up with this, who authorized this, were you involved with, this has nothing to do. This isn't the, this is the Whitlock Fearless Show. We haven't carved out some special hour for the Korean Co-Sell. I hope you weren't involved with the decision making because whoever I have to put on blast for labeling, and we're only going to go 59 minutes just because I don't want to, I don't even want to be a, the Korean Co-Sell hour. Yeah, there will be no take over here, Co-Sell. Yeah, well, I'm not Mike Wallace. I ain't 60 minutes either. But I tell you who demanded it, it's our audience. And then to do with that, John Hadley had them do with me and the audience, they demanded. This is the last Korean Co-Sell segment of 2022. Wow, where did the time go? Wow, it's been fun. It really is. But someone's going to be held responsible. According to this card, the first topic we're going to do in the Korean Co-Sell 59 minutes brought party in the 49ers beat Seahawks, clinched the NFC West. Were you impressed? 21, 13, the line was four points. I hammered that line. By the way, I knew the 49ers would cover. You impressed the 49ers beat the Seahawks, clinched the NFC West. You feel even more confident about what the 49ers are doing without trade lands, without Jimmy Garoppolo, brought party. Can he get them to the Super Bowl? Yes. And I know that might surprise people if that defense plays the way it does. Now, keep this in mind. That defense allows the offense to be relatively conservative. If that young man right there can just stay off the turnovers, move the chains and create 20 to 24 points. That in most games, in most instances will make the 49ers the winning team. The score was 21, 13, but Jason, I thought it was very, very much a game that felt like a blowout. And if you take away that, it would have been a blowout. You know, the rest stopped the blowout with that rough in the pass or call on both. We got to get into that. Yes, that game was a blowout. I don't if there's ever a game that felt like a lopsided score with just an eight point margin. It was that now we got to get into that real quickly here. That call is very dangerous because a flag at any time that's thrown by a referee at their discretion can just flip a game. If I'm not mistaken, that was a pick six that would have turned that game, I believe into a 28 to six or something like that. And the game felt over until that flag came. Now, here's the guy that I want to rip on that besides the referee. Kirk, Herb Street, your old buddy. He actually, I watched this game. He's like, well, you know, that's a pretty good call. You know, he kind of time out. Hey, Kirk, can you have some balls? You played the game. Can you can you at least have a little modicum of honesty, like Detroit statement? And I'm not asking you to tell them the worst skirt. But when Kirk said, well, that's probably what he's trying to justify the dog. And that's what I hate about the mainstream media and guys like Herb Street. They've made a lot of money during an exalted position, but they don't have the guts to just tell the truth and say, bad call, bad rule, I hate it, because they don't want the blowback. That's honestly, I know that's your guy. Her car street has done a very good job with Thursday night football. I had low expectations for he and now Michaels. I thought they've done a great job. I do think Kirk and other broadcasters. We got to remember Troy Aikman had to come out and apologize for saying put skirts on them. Everybody knows the rules. They have to sell the lie that nothing has changed with football. And the NFL is just as difficult as it used to be. That's their job to sell the lie. So I'm not going to rip Kirk Her Street. It is our job, the rest of the media that aren't that isn't attached to selling the actual gaming product to call out and point out what we're seeing and what you have to basically ask the quarterback to fall to the ground now. You can't put your body weight on it. That was a ridiculous call. And part of me, I'm going to go 10 full hat. I don't care if people don't like it. Part of me thinks there's referees in New York in the ear pieces of the referees on the field asking for these flags at hey, this game's getting out of hand. Throw that flag there. Let's back them up. Let's don't have this game changing. Let's don't have blowouts because I just don't know how any man who's been involved with football for any length of time would look at that Joey Nick Bolson play and go yeah, that's roughing the pastor. Somebody had to be in your ear. Throw that flag. That's roughing the path. I just Jason, I can't take it. Go back to when the body weight thing really started. The play where they started to examine that particular dynamic of football. It was, I believe the 2000 AFC championship game where Tony Saragusa just folded rich Ganon and just like late on. It looked like something out of the WWF. Now that type of play I can see like hey, this the quarterback, they should be protected a little bit. I get it. But this is the double standard in the hypocrisy of that call. Last Sunday we referenced this. Jalen Phillips sacks the quarterback, but because he didn't put a pillow underneath his head, it's a penalty on a sack. Mike White that very same Sunday was getting blasted by the bills. I mean absolutely blasted to a point. He tapped out twice and he kept coming back for more. And then I'm asking, but wait a minute, what is the difference between what happened to Herbert and Mike White? Well, one guy is a franchise player that is the face of the franchise. The other guy's kind of a journeyman back up. We don't know where he stands. But it was funny. It almost felt to me that Jalen Phillips was penalized because the guy didn't get rid of the ball. Well, Mike White actually got rid of the ball both occasions where he got knocked out of the game. So then you go back to yesterday saying, okay, maybe that's the rule. Don't tackle a guy with the ball too hard. Well, both got Geno Smith who got rid of the ball. There's something very wrong about that rule. But it's just maddening and I get it. Kirk Kirk Street is a very sensitive guy. He likes to gauge the temperature of the American public. But come on Kirk, have some guts and be honest and say that's a terrible call in the terrible world. Let's shelve it. Steve, Steve, I'm on a defend Kirk. You do realize that they have meetings before the season where the NFL spells out. Here's what we want you to talk about. Here's what we want you to avoid talking about. And these broadcasters know that if they go past that line of what they have specifically told you, we don't want you talking about this, then those $10 million and $15 million a year checks they're getting for calling football games can disappear. And so everybody has been instructed. And that's why Troy Aikman came out and apologized. Everybody's been instructed. Hey guys, where every this whole game is dependent on selling these quarterbacks as big TV stars. And we're committed to doing everything to protecting the quarterbacks and making sure they don't get hurt. We don't want you talking about how soft the game has become around quarterback play. We're selling the myth that these guys are heroic gladiators that have to take all these anti-depressants and all Percocet and anti-inflammatories all to get on the field. This is a gladiator sport. And so we don't want you talking about that it's no longer that it's not a gladiator sport anymore. It's organized, very controlled, orchestrated football. We don't want you talking about that. I want to give you an example of how soft things have become and just how it's all throughout pervasive in American culture. But one of the great things we love, you love about boxing, is like, man, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali just they nearly killed each other in the ring and Muhammad Ali hung on and won the Thrill in Manila. Or the first one was the fight of the century or something or Muhammad Ali over in Zaire when the rumble in the jungle and how he took that beating. And I think about one of the last great heroic injury riddle sports narrative stories that I remember is Tiger Woods winning that U.S. Open on one leg in 2008 or 2009. And in this environment we have today, they would have pulled Tiger Woods off the course and said, hey man, you can't limp around here. You're too injured. You can't go on. They would pull him. We won't, there just won't be moments like that anymore in sports where it got, oh Michael Jordan, you got a flu and you're sick. No, uh, load man. You have to sit down. Are you comparing price fighters and football players to golfers until Tiger Woods takes a jab to the face. A left took to the body or blindsided by a linebacker. I kind of get it. But man, I know you're a Tiger Woods homer. Oh God. No, don't do that. Did you not see the man limp around the course and win the U.S. Open in 2008 or 2000? I can't say. I think it was the last major he won before winning the Masters again. It was an incredible heroic courageous performance. It's one of the, it was amazing Steve. I don't ever want to hear the words heroic and courageous with golf. Let's just get that out of the way. I know for some reason you love Tiger Woods. Uh, I'm the anomaly. I'm the Asian. I hate golf and I'm a good driver. This is what you're getting with me. I'm sorry. Yes. Was it an achievement within that dynamic of golf? Yeah, I guess so. But do you really want to compare to YA Tittle with blood running down his face getting blasted? Come on, Jay, come on to stretch. It's a stretch Jay. Got to admit that. Jeez. It was a great moment that I'll never forget. I'm a Tiger Woods man. I'll never forget. You really you're not you don't you weren't into the Tiger Woods thing at all. I was not a fan of the Campbell and Asian. I the only golf tournament I've ever gotten into. It was in the spring of 1986 when the Golden Bear Jack Nicholas now there was a golfer. There was a great American. The way he just made that comeback on the last 10 holes and Vern Lundquist with that great call. That's the only golf tournament I can honestly tell you that I kept it on CBS for a couple of hours because I like the Golden Bear. I thought he was very relatable. He looks very friendly and he was to the fans. Tiger Woods always kind of came off as a jerk. Honestly. In fact, Mario Lopez who likes everybody. He's only badmouthed one celebrity in public and he did it on our show. There's one interaction with Tiger Woods and I said, wow. If Mario Lopez don't like you, you must be an unlikable guy. So I've never gotten in the golf. I don't care. And it used to piss me off on a big like sports weekend. I would never want Tiger Woods to win because Sports Center would make it sound like Tiger Woods did something. I'm like, let's get to the football highlights. I don't need this putt putt thing in my screen. I have a code Jason. I have a code man. I live by it. I can't help it. It's what I am. What I am. I'm going to ignore. I found Tiger Woods very relatable and maybe it speaks to just how ratchet I used to be and how it's about the stripper. I get it. It's the stripper. How debaucherous. It's you know, having known a Rachel Ucatel in my life and you know, having spent some time in Las Vegas in my life, I found Tiger very relatable at that time. The new this Jason would probably be a little less into Tiger Woods. But I found Tiger relatable. I can't believe you said that. It just used to bother me when there actually used to be comparisons. Who's the greatest athlete we've seen the past 50 years and they put up guys like Bo Jackson, Dion Sanders, the great Michael Jeffrey Jordan. Of course he's number one and then Tiger Woods. And I'm like, hold on, hold on. I am not taking any credit away from Tiger Woods. He's the greatest golfer post Nicholas ever. But to compare him to those other athletes and this is going to piss some people off. Your average six round fighter that makes about $500 for their night's work is a better athlete, a tougher guy than any golfer. No disrespect to any of the golfers. But that's the truth. I'll just leave it at that. Yeah, please do. Just leave it at the you know what I'm going to leave it at that because I'm going to move on to Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA during the Korean Co-Sell 59 minutes. Adam Silver stated yesterday or I saw it in the front office sports article. He wants a female NBA coach within five years. Is this a good priority for the NBA to have a female head coach within five years? I don't think it's any time. Can we be very honest about this? And this is fearless Friday, right? In the deepest recesses of these players minds, none of them want to be coached by a woman. I think they tolerate the assistant coaches. I think in the football, they say, okay, um, then, you know, I guess we got to listen to them. But the reality is at that level of sports, they want male leadership. Now it may not be the leadership of what 30, 40 years ago, Bobby Knight and Bill Parcels and guys of that, they don't want to listen to a woman. I mean, honestly, if who and you know what's funny, then in 10 years of Adam Silver, still unfortunately, the commissioner of the NBA, he's going to put a timeline on wanting a transgender coach that it's about that time. And then in 15 years, it's going to be, okay, Roo Paul is calling for a 22nd time out. I'm sorry. This is another publicity stunt. I mean, you want to turn people off, but you know what the most used phrase would be from that poor NBA team, that poor squad, they would have to go through this social experiment. The thing that they would mutter under their breath after every practice or a loss or a game they didn't like. And again, I'm going to excuse my language. They're going to be like, bitch, please, that's going to be used a million times. You know it's true, Jason. To be honest, Jay, you know, please is going to be used a lot. You know, that's true. No, look, I'm not hurt street. I'm Kim. This is where we go. This is what we do. You wanted the 59 minutes. I'm just packing it in. But you know what, none of these players, and they're all going to say the right things. Well, you know, we respect her as a coach and, you know, she knows her basketball and, you know, she's she's a great person and we're going to know they're not, no, they're not. And that team to me, unless it's just overloaded with talent, is going to be a disaster. And as I was thinking about this, preparing for this segment, my greatest fear as a Laker fan in hiatus is when that LeBron guy leaves. I'm going to go back to my Laker fandom. Because what I do, I am just deathly afraid that Jeannie Bus is going to do the whole girl power thing so that she can become popular in all the media that already gives her the softest treatment. They're going to call her a pioneer. They're going to call her a visionary. And I'm going to be like, Oh my God, be honest, Jason, if you were a big time max player free agent and you had various offers and you knew like, Hey, I could choose a winner here. Wouldn't one of the deciding factors be I want to play for a guy, not a girl. Be honest, come on. Steve, Steve, I want to take you a completely different direction. I think you've misread this. I don't think your finger is wet and in the air and figuring out which way the wind is blowing. I don't know how you have your Instagram feed rigged or whatever. But I disagree with you. I think there will be 30%, 40% of these players that would love to be coached by a woman. I they've been so feminized. They've so bought into the matriarchal culture, talking primarily about the black players have bought into this matriarchal culture. They'd love to be coached by a woman. They'd feel like they get more relatable, easier to manipulate work with whatever. And then and Steve, you got to you got to have your Instagram feed triggered the right way to get the stuff. Go look at these on Instagram. It doesn't take a lot of hunting, but there's a lot of female basketball coaches that have leaned into the fashion show element of their wardrobe while coaching during the side. Everybody's got their boots on. Everybody's got their tightest stuff on and they're taking pictures of themselves, coaching, and then posting them on their Instagram and they look like Instagram models. And so if you think some of these players, I'm just keeping as sexually immoral as this society has come and how there's just no rules and regulations to anything. There's no protocol, there's no standard of conduct. These players would love to be coached by some woman. They find attractive who's down for the play. And and I'm just sorry. There's go look at the big three and how they rallied around. Is it Nancy Lieberman or whatever's one of their coaches? They rallied around her and how and again, I'm not saying there's a lot of coaching going on in the big three, but no one has a problem with it. There's old Fuddy Duddies like myself and you, but these athletes, they believe in the matriarchy. Their mother tells them what to do. Their sister tells them what to do. They don't have problems taking marching orders from women and actually like it because they have so much animus towards their tattered relationship with their father or non-existent relationship with their father. You know, I could see it happening. I could see, you know, go go look at Don Staley and how she in she's putting on $7,000 jackets leather jackets. She's coaching in and it's all a fashion show. Look at the NBA players and how they come dressed to work to walk down the runway. This whole thing has been feminized to the point that a female coach love it. I still disagree when it comes to athletics and it comes to a men's league. These guys want male leadership or traditional coaching. I have a hard time believing that a big man plays a little bit soft doesn't grab a rebound or doesn't finish hard and you're going to have some like five foot four lesbian girls. They don't want to be coached. They don't want to be coached. Are you watching the NBA? They're not really coaching. They're jacking up threes. I agree, they don't want to be coached. The coaching doesn't matter. A lot of these guys are practicing. They're not they stay in physical shape. They're in good cardio, vascular shape, but they're not running any real offenses out there. No one's working. None of the big men are working on low post moves or anything like that. Everybody's working on jacking up a three and iso ball. It doesn't require it's no different than what I've said they've done to the NFL quarterback position. You don't call plays anymore as the quarterback. They tell you exactly what to do inside your helmet. The whole thing's been eased and dumbed down. That's why JB comes on the show every week and that's what John Gruden in public conversations and private conversations talking about. Man, this isn't even the playbooks and everything has been shrunk to a point. This is high school football that they're passing off as NFL football. I look at the end of the day, they may think they want it until they get shoot out or screamed at and they're going to be given the side eye. That's my view of it. And they're like, I'm just telling you, no man wants to be coached by a woman at that level of sports. It's the truth. It truly is. And no one wants to say it and I'm going to get blasted here. I don't give a damn because I just telling you if you actually, but look, could you imagine? You know, you are right about that. The game is a little bit less masculine. Could you imagine asking a woman? Hey, yeah, here's your team. Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason and Larry Johnson. Good job, girl. Go get him. I'm sorry. This is not a movie. What is that movie world? Whoopi Goldberg, Coach the Knicks. Stay. Okay. Yeah, whatever that movie was. This is real life. It wouldn't work. Stay, stay. And I say this in all seriousness. These players and these female coaches in our lifetime on their road trips, they'll be going to nail salons and beauty shops together as a team. We'll get their nails done and their hair did. You think these guys getting their hair colored and braided and I was looking at DK Metcalf last night with his green hair what he would love to have some female coach go to the beauty salon with him and get his hair colored. These guys have got their hair all twisted up and Barney, what a Betty Robble or Wilma, Flintstones, hairstyles and all that other stuff. They'd love to do that together with their head coaches. We let's go to the beauty shop together. We can go over the game plan. They'd love it. I don't get it. But going back to David Silver. Adam. Yeah, Adam. David's turn has to be rolling over in his grave. My God, out of all the guys to get to replace maybe the greatest commissioner of any sport alongside Pete Roselle, we get this guy. And I don't get this whole thing of why we need representation in certain things. You know what? Maybe it's a long time overdue for more female construction workers or coal miners or dig ditches. You know, as a Thomas solo, he says, well, wait a minute, you want representation. You know that tough job where you have coal and explosions happening right in your face. Hey, you know what? Let's get some gender equity there. I again, I will disagree with you. It may seem like a great deal. It may seem easier. It may seem like a softer touch. I just don't see it realistically working. Let's move on. Uh, Co-Sell, MSNBC columnist Dave Ziren, who works for the nation most of the time. He's written a guest column, you know, and Davis to the left of Karl Marx. He's written an MSNBC column complaining that NBA fans aren't cheering loud enough for Brittany Griner. He's very offended. And he in his column, he talks about how, you know, Utah Jazz or fans are known for their brutal treatment of Black athletes. And when they announced, they put Brittany Griner up on the big screen, I guess, at a jazz game. And we want to welcome her home. And allegedly, there were a smattering of booze. And Dave was, I think, talking about, he was at maybe a wizard's game where, you know, they reintroduced John Wald and there were loud cheers, but their cheers weren't as loud for Brittany Griner. And he's upset about it. And I'm like, hey, man, you do know she took a dump all over America and said this country is racist and oppressive and she's ashamed of the national anthem. It's not all that surprising that traditional American sports fans aren't, you know, just overjoyed that we traded the merchant of death for some woman who doesn't even appreciate America. But Dave's very upset and it's a sign of just how racist and unfair America is that we're not cheering lustily for Brittany Griner. Okay, my response to Dave Zirin would be very simple. This is my trademark line. Yeah. And this is the issue that I have with columnists like him. And Dave Zirin, every time he pops into my Twitter feed once a while, he does give me a good chuckle. And it's ha ha, but not in a funny way. The issue is Dave, if you care about Brittany, that's fun. That is absolutely your prerogative. But your overwrought whining and complaining about how everyone should agree with you and be in lockstep with your thoughts. That's where I think we've lost it. Like every time I write something, no matter if it's controversial, incendiary, out there, whether it's the hottest take of all time. I actually don't expect anyone to agree with me. Now everyone should, if they have a motive of him intelligence, but I understand the world that we live in. And it just comes off as you have to agree with me, or I'm just going to cry. And that's all that he does now. Dave Zirin, I used to enjoy, I believe that he had a regular column or still does called louder than a bomb for slam magazine, which I subscribed to for years. And there was a time I actually enjoyed his writing. But now he has gone into this industrial complex of white guilt. And you know, everything is the white guy. He's the cool guy. He'll be invited to the barbecue. He gets it. He understands it. But I would ask him, how many WNBA games did you cover? In fact, before all of this, I would like to ask how many cover stories on Brittany Griner did he pen? And by the way, who was that? Yeah, Andy Warhol, he called me. Yeah, special line, Andy Warhol. He just called me and I said, what's going on? Yeah, Brittany's 15 minutes. Yeah, Steve, it's over. And what did we say? Now, last week, we talked about it a little bit, right? It's almost like it didn't exist. Because we really don't care. But that's, that's my biggest gripe with Davis, not even his own opinion. He has the right to think America is this vile, evil, racist country. Even though every day streams of people, all sorts of people from all across the world are fighting to get into America, which I've always found interesting. But to, to actually emotionally extort everybody else to feel sorry for someone who seemed to be a perennial malcontent, that's where again, he completely loses me. Dave's iron. I'm just going to keep it 1000%. You said it's fearless Friday. Dave's iron is not a white guy. He's a Jewish guy. He's a Jewish guy who thinks it's his job to police the thoughts and all the activity around black people. That's his job. That's what he does. And so he's trying to, he's, he doesn't actually like white people. And he, he, he wants to demonize America and use black people to demonize America. And he's using Brittany Griner. And he's used his relationship with some, you know, Eton Thomas, who, you know, I don't think ever scored more than five points a game in an NBA game or certainly didn't average, average that. And so he and Eton are the Batman and Robin of vilifying white supremacy. And, and if he can find a Brittany Griner, anybody used to further his narrative that America is terrible. And, and that's what he's going to do. The guy's a joke. He, yeah, he, he tried to forget, let me just be completely transparent. You know, for years, he's been one of my biggest critics and stalkers and running around trying to tell me what I should think. And I've never liked or respected him. Because he can't control what I think right say. He's, he, you're not, I get you're the overseer for Eton Thomas and some of these other black dudes that ain't got no balls and don't have a brain for themselves. But they miss me with that. And I'm not gonna feel bad because I'm not overjoyed at Brittany Griner's home. She don't care nothing about America. I didn't care about her when she was over here playing basketball. I'm not gonna, you know, run around and fake and pretend like I'm overjoyed that we gave up the merchant of death for some woman who didn't even appreciate being an American. Yeah, I mean, look, I'm honest about this. If a WNBA game was taking place in my backyard, I'd close the drapes. And if that game involved Brittany Griner, I would just leave the house and go to lunch. And like, if everyone feels this way, but they won't say it, it reminded me of one of your other old nemesis, old Katie Kate Nolan. She went on this rant one time and then I saw a video where she talked about how the WNBA does deserve equity with the NBA. She made this big spiel. And then someone actually went to her social media. I think it was her Instagram account. And she's had a lot of games, Red Sox, Patriots, any male league. She was that you know what they didn't have one picture of? Or at any other WNBA event. That that is the hypocrisy. It is a classic case of do what we tell you, but not what we do. Steve, let me take a moment here before we continue with our sports discussion and talk with you guys about my great friends at Preborn. Tragically, every minute unborn babies futures are sucked out of existence. But amid the darkness, there's a light that shines and that's preborn.

Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie The Blind is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. All right, let's go back to Steve Kim and close out the Korean Co-cell 59 minutes. Steve, we'll go on a more serious note. There's a story that we covered heavily here on this show. Mike Hickman, the P-Wee football coach in Dallas who was shot and killed by Yakeb, Yakeb to leave. Yakeb to leaves brother during a P-Wee football game. We argued and talked about and interviewed the coaches and people that were on the scene that Yakeb to leave started, instigated this confrontation and was responsible or at least partially responsible for the death of Mike Hickman, a father, a husband, a P-Wee football coach, a former college football player. We talked about it extensively on this show. The mainstream media ignored this story. Here's a key to leave a borderline Hall of Fame player, a multiple-time pro-boy or all-pro Super Bowl champion was scheduled to be the Thursday night football, part of the Thursday night football broadcast on Amazon, was a broadcaster for NFL games on Fox Sports. This man's involved in the murder of a P-Wee football coach and the mainstream media completely ignores it. Oh, his brother did X, Y, and Z. The family, we had coaches come on, tell the story directly about a key to leave role in it. Well, now the family of Mike Hickman is suing among other people a key to leave for his role in the murder of Mike Hickman. I'm glad they're doing it. I guess I'm going to start with you. Why did the mainstream media, ESPN and everyone else, ignore this and will they continue to ignore a key to leave role in the murder of Mike Hickman? Well, my sources tell me that Dave Zaren's going to write a column blaming this on white supremacy and systemic racism. But yeah, of course they are. And I'm going to get a little deep here. The reason why they will not cover this at length or at all really, because it really was buried. I mean, in fact, it's interesting. The story that you are referencing now about the lawsuit, it popped up on my timeline on Twitter of all places, TMZ. Wasn't ESPN, wasn't Fox News or Fox Sports. I think there's a belief from the little deep here. If this was a white black situation, and let's say specifically a white man killed another black coach or something of that effect, it would be covered. It would be covered 24 7 365. It'd be hot on that new cycle for a good few months. We know this, but because it's basically a black on black crime, for lack of a better term. And I've said this before, the expectations you set on somebody, the standards you have, that's what you think of them. And maybe because of the demographics involved, there are those who believe number one, we can't touch it because it doesn't play to our core audience. We can't pander with it. But also, maybe this is what they expect. And so to them, it is not a new story, regardless of the status of a keep to leave. So let me walk you through a real life example, or analogy that illustrates and buttresses your point. Stephen A. Smith and LeBron James, fan flames over unknown BYU students who allegedly hit some Duke volleyball player with a racial slur at a volleyball match. That was worthy of being discussed on first take. And we got to get to the bottom of this blah, blah, blah. A keep to leave instigates according to multiple eyewitness reports, a confrontation that leads to the murder of a 43 year old former college football player, P-Weat Coach, in front of his nine year old son and his wife, but nah, let's don't talk about that. You know what's interesting is that some BYU student may have yelled a nasty word at a Duke volleyball player. Proving to be untrue, but may have. That's worthy of Don Staley calling off playing BYU. That's worthy of going on TV and trashing all of BYU. They're all racist. But a keep to leave, sparking a fight that leads to his brother pulling out a gun and murdering someone in cold blood. Nothing to see here. That speaks to, we have super high expectations for random white BYU students and how dare they not meet those standards. And we have no standards for a keep to leave and black people at P-Weat football games. Well, fight broke out in someone guy's shot. Involving a Hall of Fame potential football player and a broad yet nothing to see here, nothing to talk about. We expect that from them. We don't expect it from white people. Jason, let's go back. When you say there's nothing to see here, problem was there was a video. We could actually see it. The investigation with BYU, I don't want to say exonerated everybody, but there was never any clear evidence that this happened. But to a point, there were still ramifications for that university. Didn't Don Staley cancel a game against BYU? You know, so they paid a penalty or price, whatever that is. The other thing that's interesting with a keep to leave, there's a history of this. So that in itself could be a story that, hey, there's a pattern of certain behavior. But you know, now you leave a family fatherless and you say you care about people across the board, good average hardworking Americans. Now, someone gets slain. It's on video with a noted athlete that is caught on videotape. And really, the silence is deafening about this because you knew those people that always pushed certain stories. They were never going to touch it because the demographic were all wrong and also the role play did not fit that narrative. And this will be interesting to see what happens if there's actual real ramifications of this, whether it's financial or criminal. Will any of the major outlets outside of the usual wire story, will they examine some of the deeper rooted problems within the community and the people involved and the certain individuals? Because there is a story here. But unfortunately, my guess is Jason, it will not be told. I think you're right. Let's keep it moving. There's another story in the news cycle that I wanted to get to earlier in the week and then news just built on top of itself and kept pushing it back, pushing it back. But now we got an update on this story. Draymond Green a couple of days ago gets a fan. A Milwaukee Bucks fan booted out of the arena. The Warriors are playing at Milwaukee. Draymond gets the guy booted out of the arena under the pretense that the guy had made threats towards Draymond Green. I think we have the video of Draymond getting the fan ejected and then we have Draymond's exclamation explanation of what happened. Let's play those two things back to back. Scan the QR code to learn more and pick up your Google Pixel today. Draymond Green pointing to a fan. That's the same fan he was talking to on the other end of the floor. I think he is alerted James Capers the crew chief. And not exactly sure. There is a police officer down in that area. So now James Capers getting with security here. Looks like they are going to remove a fan from these seats. We can see it earlier. What did they say to you? Ah some threatening stuff to my life. So you know I was this close to really going back and like diving all the way in. But time just went back and told the official. And when I told the official what he said he said he got to get out of here. Do you like that? I guess you know I know you got to find a couple weeks ago when you said something like that. Do you like that's kind of an option to you I guess? Oh yeah I mean I can't necessarily say that that hasn't been an option. That's kind of been an option but I think there are times where you're just in the moment you know and you're responding. So you know that's been an option that wasn't like oh I just found out that was an option once I got fine. Like that's been there. The league has made that clear to us for years that that's been there. But like I said where our human beings in there are times where you just respond. Try to learn from the mistakes but you know like I said there's still that human side that human element to it. Sometimes you're just going to respond. So you hear me talk on this show constantly about the feminization of sports and American society. And you keep your mind. Draymond Green is one of the tough guys in the NBA. He beat up Jordan Poole. He's the tough guy. Draymond's a pansy. He's as soft as butter. That's why he beat up Jordan Poole because he's soft. Because he's got that female bitch energy. Sorry for saying it. I apologize. But that's why he did that to this man. And so now the fan has actually been tracked down and he gave an interview and offered his side of the story. Here's what he said. Transpart. He ain't shit. What pass? I said man like we giving you a pass. You know man so evidently he was ready for it. He was waiting for that to happen. And he just he blew it out of proportion actually. So basically I don't know how he can take that as a threat. When you say giving him a pass what what were you referring to like why why does Draymond need a pass when sitting in the wall? Man basically you know I was speaking up I was speaking up for the city of New York. Basically telling like man we giving you a pass we we haven't forgotten about what you did. You know what I'm saying? Big bully. We haven't forgotten about what you did and we giving you a pass we forgive you. You know what I mean but we haven't forgotten. These athletes from Russell Westbrook to Draymond Green we love to sit around and pretend like oh there's all these white Karens and they're running around it's the Karens it's all this racial blah blah blah. What's Draymond is Karen? Draymond Green is Karen. Some fan is yelling at him and and he can't take it and he goes and gets some tossed out of the arena under the pretense under the lie that this man threatened his life. This man said during that interview like hey man there were police around and security around that all backed me up that I never did what Draymond said I did. He says the Milwaukee Bucks have promised him courtside seats for a game later that they know that Draymond Green is lying here but again no one will touch this. No Stephen A. Smith no one Charles Barkley should kill O'Neill. Everybody got something to say about Kyrie Irving tweeting out a Hebrews to Nick Rose documentary. They'll look at Draymond do some of the most feminine passive aggressive disrespectful female energy just driven behavior and no one will say anything. These athletes aren't interested in social justice they're not interested in fairness and equality they want to be rulers and kings and oppressors and the elite and everybody else's beneath them and how dare you yell something at me at the game I'll get you tossed out this is why I don't respect them they're not trying to improve anything they want to be the rulers and the oppressors now that they have some money that's what they do they rule and oppress here's a man sitting at a game trying to enjoy the game tossed out of the game and and I'm glad the guy is black because everybody can't play the call I'm defending some white guy no man this is the mentality of the elite they don't care what color you are they only care whether you kiss their feet rings hands kiss their butt whether you bow to them I have no respect for Draymond Green well Jason if that guy was white Dave Zierin has his next book but anyway here's the thing about craymond so that's interesting what he said about why why I almost went there I have a question so you have more restraint for a random fan than your own teammate think about what happened here with Jordan Pooley comes across and cold clocks them cheap shot right broke his jar whatever but with the fan he's going to be the gentleman and I'm going to let cooler heads prevail I'm going to escort you out it's amazing that's why I believe there's a disconnect with the NBA fans or the general public with the league but this has got me thinking you know what I now have a whole new respect for Vernon Maxwell one time someone disrespected him and his fan he went all the way up in the Rose Garden he he went no that's old time basketball Vernon I want to now say I apologize you're a real man you went there he f'd around and you made them that's old school basketball Charles Barkley at least spit on somebody yeah hit a girl thousand accident you know whatever but anyway um that's why you're right about that in terms of the quote unquote feminization of the league but it is interesting because when I first heard this report I saw it on Twitter and I said oh boy here we go and then all of a sudden when they found out it wasn't a white guy I said oh okay that story's dead it's dead it's just like when you have a random shooter and no matter what if it's a random shooter and if and then it becomes a what do they call it like a group killing or serial killing more than three people you brace for it and then when it's not a night a white guy story's dead it's like clockwork the story just dies right there and it's the same type of dynamic that exists in these situations in sports these it's across the board with athletes and and I wish that people would come up out of this racial brainwashing that's been done and realize that it's elites versus the working class it's elites versus normal people and and Draymond Green from beating up Jordan Poole who's black to getting this fan tossed out of the arena who is black Draymond Green don't care about black people none of these guys do I'm talking about none of them I'm talking about LeBron James I'm talking about none of them NFL player Malcolm Jenkins and Quam Bo and all these social justice in racism in the in the back of the in zone out none of these guys they're just talking they don't really believe any of it they're elites putting on a performance for social media clout put it on a performance because that's what their agents in the puppet masters to again when the real smoke comes they all scatter and run like cowards that again Kyrie did Dremond Green the big powerful Dremond Green when the smoke came for Kyrie Irving did he utter a word did he have the balls to say hey man y'all mistreating Kyrie Irving let me take a stand for Kyrie Irving and his freedom of religion freedom of speech not a word but oh can I get a fan tossed from a game who said something I disagree with and is annoying me can I beat up my teammate because I don't like him yet they're all down for that they're all they want to stay on the side of their puppet masters and we know who their puppet masters are Kyrie Irving and Kanye West have exposed who the puppet masters are and who who they're really afraid of all of them it it it just it infuriates me it it it it it let's move on to one final topic before we go into overtime in the Korean Co-Sail hour and Justin or Christian or Hadley whoever's responsible for this Co-Sail hour your pay will be docked this week I want to get this final deal Troy Vincent number two behind Roger Goodell at the NFL offices high-ranking vice president whatever I can't remember what his full title is but former NFL player former Wisconsin Badger long-time NFL player used to work for the NFL Player Association that's worked in the league offices probably close to the last decade he told in an NFL owners meeting he analogized the combine to a slave auction and set off a disagreement and some bickering among the owners Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons was upset Jerry Jones of course was upset some other NFL owners were upset we have a high-ranking NFL executive former player who's analogizing the combine which is basically a long interview process for who wants to be a millionaire that somehow is a slave auction and and this is what when I say the idiocy starts at the top and runs downhill Troy Vincent is the guy who is in Roger Goodell's ear telling him what to think about ratio issues Troy Vincent's the quarterback on all the Black Lives Matter BS that goes on in the NFL this guy is arguing to NFL owners that the combine is like a slave auction and we wonder why the NFL is completely off course and has swallowed all of the woke ideology well again it seems to me like mr Vincent is certainly now dabbling in the industry of oppression but here's the question I would have for Troy okay you can analogize that so what is your solution what exactly is it that you want do you do you want the combine wiped out because you know the other thing is certain players don't actually go to the combine they do personal workouts universities hold workouts for all their seniors or draft eligible players I don't understand exactly look I guess you can kind of sort of draw an analogy outside the million dollar pay and the benefits and all that other stuff but my question would be to Troy Vincent if I was in that room okay uh then what like what is your solution are you just airing a grievance are you just making a statement which is fine but is there an end game like what are you suggesting here are you are you suggesting that we disband the league that you don't want these poor souls being put through the rigors of a national football league career I this is a thing that bothers me about statements like this and I don't really have any feelings one way or the other towards Troy Vincent but he has made his living a very lucrative one in the very same league going through the very same process and I don't recall and if I'm wrong let me know did he ever bulk at it before because I'm assuming he went to the NFL combine back in what 91 or 92 had a very good career with I believe the Eagles or the Miami Dolphins who first drafted him at any point did he ever raise his hand and say well wait a minute guys this is dehumanizing on my body's main use for athletic and entertainment purposes yet now he sits on the ivory tower and he wants to make this incredibly uh I would say provocative statement maybe in his own mind but again what's the end game because I think one of the owners should have asked him okay so what do you want to do about it Troy what do you want to do you want to end the combine and I don't think he'd have an answer but this is my this is what I think a lot of people are turned off by this type of thought process is that you complain a lot you air your grievances you use fancy word salads you never actually offer up a real solution or a plan of action to eradicate it I just look at this again as again more virtue signaling from someone who will have no accountability when it's all said and done for his words he's not virtue signaling though Steve because he doesn't believe any of this he's using this hypercharged racial language to acquire and secure and protect the power he's amassing he he's playing the race card won the owners as a tool hey back up off me I know many of you don't like me but I can frame you all as racist as it at any time I can be your biggest critic they have a cancer inside of their organization called Troy Vincent they can't get rid of it because again that they feel if they if they remove the cancer they're worried about him pissing on from outside the tent they'd rather have him inside the tent and inside the tent he uses race to maintain power over these NFL owners he does not believe the combine is a slave auction he knows that he went through the process probably he's had many friends that went through that process people are honored to get invited to the combine because if they if it wasn't at the combine everything that happens at the combine would then happen on an individual college campus during an individual workout and and then just quite frankly as a black person there is not a black person in America today that was born and raised here that knows anything about a slave auction nothing we've heard about it we've perhaps read a few things about it we watched roots whatever but but there's none of us there's not an athlete that has gone to the combine oh god I feel like I feel oppressed I feel oh this is so dehumanizing someone's actually looking at my body athletes except maybe for a handful of linemen love to have people looking at their body and evaluating them we spend their whole life training for that evaluation and the right to make a bunch of money off of it Troy Vincent's playing a game with ownership he needs to be eliminated but Roger Goodell is weak most of the NFL ownership is weak they don't know how to get rid of their problems and so and they've let guys like Troy Vincent bully them with threats of your races and I'll smear you as races and Troy Vincent works them and again I used to have a relationship with Troy Vincent until I figured him out as some kind of race I knowledge or phony and and and he has ushered in helped the NFL usher in all this racial idolatry and all this other phoniness or whatever but I know Troy Vincent not that bright not really qualified for his position but he's got a stranglehold on that position by playing the race card strategically on Roger Goodell and NFL ownership and and these NFL owners aren't man enough to do anything about it and and that's why I was in a discussion oh TJ Mo and I have this discussion all the time and TJ is always telling me it's like it's the weakness of white men that's at the root of all of America's problems because again those NFL owners could clean all this up if they were willing to take the criticism and blow back that would go along with saying you know what Troy Vincent you're an idiot you're out over your skis you don't know what you're doing you just come in here and play the race car you're not really helping us grow the game by we're going to replace you they don't have the balls to do that and that's why the NFL is compromised and so I do and I like Jerry Jones and I like several other NFL owners but they're all weak they're not man enough to fix these problems and so we live in a constant state of chaos and the country keeps going in a bad direction because of the weakness of white men in power in leadership and look do they have collaborators and people like Troy Vincent that are bullying them that are baby Al Sharpton's and all that yes they do but a strong man and again that's what this entire show is about trying to give men of any color the balls to stand up and to do what's right screw everybody's little games do what's right Jesus I don't think it's just a swath of white men I think it's specifically white guilt not everyone has it but those who have white guilt I believe is they are the biggest cancer in Americans aside and going back to hold a Troy let me push back one let me I'm sorry for cutting you off but let me push back on why I don't think white guilt is the answer because I don't think that these NFL owners really feel guilty I think they're afraid of because of they're looking at what's going on with Daniel Snyder and how he's getting and they all feel like I got skeletons in my closet they can come after me at any time so I'm just going to keep my head down and say what they want to make sure that they never turn the wolves loose on me I don't think it's guilt I think it's fear I think it's fear that they can't withstand the criticism and the scrutiny so they just keep their head down and survive Roger Goodell I don't think really believes in a lot of the things that are going on in the NFL but in order to protect that 50 million dollar year paycheck he's just gonna go along to get along why get if Troy Vincent or some are some outsider Al Sharpton stirs up some kind of racial narrative about me and and they know the New York Times the Washington Post and everybody on social media will play along with it yeah Roger Goodell's a racist in in fifth grade you know he he dressed up as Jim Brown or whatever they all these guys feared that they're vulnerable and they feared that the media will pile on them and demonize them and in order to protect that paycheck they'll go along with virtually anything these guys will all bend over and take a 12 inch broomstick right up the rear end if that's what it takes to keep their paycheck they have no courage intestinal fortitude there's nothing they really stand for they're coward I'm sorry you got me on one go ahead no then finally you're right about the invite I don't think Kunta Kinte was cordially invited uh it we're gonna provide the travel and you're gonna land in Cape Cod or wherever and you'll be put through a battery of tests to see if you qualify for this non-paying job you know I'll never forget when I was growing up in Valencia California Santa Clarita Valley before I moved to Montebello uh they had a very very uh competitive baseball league youth baseball William S Hart and this league has produced hundreds of college players division one and a lot of major leaders so it's a really good league and I'll never forget your first year there and then Bronco division they actually try you out and it's like a combine we're little kids we have numbers given to us and it's the most nervous thing they're like okay number 57 Steve Kemp and they put you at shortstop you have to take some grounders and they put you left field then they make you throw then you get 10 cuts and I'm just telling you these coaches or like regular fathers they're actually scouting you and they're looking you over and they come talk to you then they actually had a draft now this is for youth league this goes on it almost every level of competitive sports if it's a specific league but never once did I say God look look at those white slave masters god that's my oppressors it's one of my ball just want to play ball you know anyway Steve uh we've gone more than an hour what I do I'm gonna let you go I'm gonna let you go I'm gonna let you go we're gonna get you Delano thank you so much enjoy your holidays you can email me and us fearless blaze show at gmail.com Delano Squires just all right welcome back time for the smartest man on the show professor d Delano Squires joins us from Washington DC Delano has written a terrific column today that connects Joe Bright Joe Biden's pivot into the first trans president to a overall Democrat strategy around gender identity and politics and and he goes back and makes the point that hey you got to remember uh Bill Clinton was called by Tony Morrison and many black people the first black president huh it was kind of a joking thing but Bill Clinton certainly leaned into and enjoyed that description Newsweek magazine labeled Barack Obama the first gay president and I don't know if President Obama leaned into that but he certainly didn't set the record straight as it relates to that and it was most mostly a reflection that Obama did a lot to normalize same-sex marriage and all of that and so you know that they called him the first gay president and now Joe Biden got the transgenders all up in the White House he'd lit the White House up in rainbow colors to celebrate the respect for marriage or the dis dis respect for marriage act let's watch Joe Biden let's watch an old clip of Joe Biden saying he's against same-sex marriage and then just compare it to where he's at now today we're going to debate the next three weeks I'm told gay marriage a flag amendment and God only knows what else I can't believe the American people can't see through this reality have a law the defense of marriage act we've all voted not where I voted another said look marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that nobody's violated that law there's been no challenge to that law why do we need a constitutional amendment marriage is between a man and a woman what's the game going on here that was in 2006 earlier this week Joe Biden's got Cindy Lauper and everybody everybody else he can think of at the White House celebrating the disrespect for marriage acts that codify same-sex marriage and according to Joe stop some of the animus towards children that are transitioning or whatever anyway Delano expound unpack your column today yeah Jason I mean you you you hit the nail right on the head I think the democrats love bending identity they love to use different terms to sort of color outside the lines and you know Bill Clinton was the first black president supposedly Obama was the first gay president in my in in my column I argue that Joe Biden is the first trans president because he's done more than any single politician to normalize the idea that men can become women and women can become men through both public policy the laws of our land and social custom he's done it through personnel and as I said he's done it through policy so he hired Admiral Dr. Rachel Levine who was born Richard Levine and was married for several years and had two children and put this person not as you know an assistant deputy advisory under secretary in the department of interior he put this person as one of the highest ranking officials in the in the department of health and human services a pediatrician who now oversees federal policy as it relates to you know gender confused children and those actions by the president make clear to me that he's shooting to become you know probably the most prominent straight ally to the lgbt community that we've had in in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue so it begs the question Delano why is he doing it why did a devout catholic from Delaware in 2006 marriage in between a man and a woman why did he pivot over the least last 16 years to be Rachel Levine Richard Levine is a woman why is he doing this I think there's a couple of reasons I think one of the reasons is that Joe Biden is clearly experiencing some some cognitive and mental decline any any old clips of him whether from four eight ten 20 years ago you can tell the difference between the man you see in those videos and the man you see today who has to be led around you know at at White House events he has to be people have to point and tell him which direction to go they have to give him palm cards to to tell him which journalists to call on so he's he's a shell and if I really want to go here and I didn't want to do it because I didn't I didn't want to seem like I was trying to be disrespecting on the office um Biden is really also the first puppet president like truly a puppet like nothing internal just he's he's the the exterior right he's the Pinocchio and someone has his their hand up his back and all he does is parrot the words that they say he saw this man is 80 years old he was born in the middle of World War II he eulogized a man who was an exalted Cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan Joe Biden is an old dude and he speaks like a freshman at Bryn Mawr or Brown University who's majoring in queer studies and you know Jason if you were to get him over a beer you know in Scranton and he asked him if if he thinks men could get pregnant he would say come on man but but when his handlers are around and he gets asked these questions or when he's in front of a trans activist and he and they say oh I'm in day 221 of transitioning to a girl and he says oh god bless you god love you you know that he's speaking his mouth is moving but somebody else's words are coming out and I think that's one of the reasons in terms of how he's gotten to this place the other one I think is a deeper reflection on sort of the moral bankruptcy of of leftism which is there's not anything that someone on the left believes today that they won't move away from in 10 or 12 years if the political winds start to blow in a different direction and and this is why I think every American but particularly conservatives and conservative Christians need to understand that what a biblical worldview gives you is both an explanation for why the world operates in the way that it does and something to hold that explanation in place because again the same people who say today well the disrespect for marriage act says that federal law recognizes marriages between two people have nothing to guard themselves against moving to three people or an adult and a child in 10 to 20 years because this is what they do and this is what I you know put it in the piece it's always a movement there's always new territory to be conquered and eventually on this trajectory in 15 years we'll be carnating the first map king or the first map president mine attracted persons president and that's the direction that our politics is going in so I'm gonna go a step further because I see it as and you and I talk this morning after I read your column I see it as a Democrat political strategy and a left strategy and it's why they talk so much about being on the right side of history and so when you're trying to be on the right side of history you're concerned about well who's going to be writing that history and the left believes they are and so and this is why I correct people when they make the argument when I when I see believers talk about being on the right side of history I'm like now man that's not our standard we always want to be on the right side of God that that's that's that's standard that book is old the rules are right there in writing there's no confusing it's not about whoever happens to be in power and who has the pen at that moment and so I think the Democrats believe that they're going to continue to write history and that in 20 years from now they will have created so much gender confusion and fluidity that the largest base of voters are going to be voters who vote based on sexual and gender fluidity and so and so they'll take what their game plan is for Delano and your wife is like yeah Delano that they're firmly conservative they're grounded in that biblical worldview but man if we can get one of their kids to come over our direction if we can confuse one of their kids and get their kids gender identity screwed up get them off into the lgbtq issue now we have a chance to get Delano and his wife on board with our team because if your kid identifies it and it's like well I got to do what's in the best interest of my kids that's not the republicans that's not evangelicals that's not christians that's the democrat party which is a whole coalition of sexually fluid gender fluid people and and that it's like to me the immigration thing isn't working out for them as well as they thought because too many of these Latinos and Muslims come over this country and well you know I still kind of like god and I still kind of you know I'm not hopping on board with the democrats but as it relates to these issues around being gay and queer and trans and all that you basically Caitlyn Jenner may still be a republican but the overwhelming majority the drag people and again you and I were talking this morning about they've come up with this term drag phobic now here's a new classification of of people that you can be drag phobic and so it's like all the people that want to live their life without any sexual or gender rules that's going to be the democrat coalition and joe biden will be seen as the father of that coalition that will be his legacy that's how the history that'll be written by the left will be written is like well we got obama on board with the gay but things really hit the ground running when we got joe biden on board with rachel laveen and sam britain and dillin was mackelvie or whatever his name is melva yeah I think i think joe has bought in to that legacy and strategy absolutely and in honesty Jason this this started over a decade ago a lot of people who forget this but it was joe biden vice president joe biden who got out ahead of the white house and like ahead of barack obama president barack obama when he said in the interview that he's open to the idea of same-sex marriage and then it was obama who had to then come and say you know and now i'm open to it and so on and so forth and when he did an interview with robin roberts he said yeah joe got out a little bit of over skis you know but it was done in the right spirit and and from there they they ushered in you know that that new wave and and i agree with you i think he he wants to be known this way i have no doubt that he sees himself as an ally my point is that when you get into this specificity and language and the understanding and ideology there's nothing that makes me think that this 80-year-old guy is speaking his own language right he's getting fed these lines from from jepetto off off off stage and he's just sort of repeating the things that that he's been told to repeat but yeah i i think you know the the democrats the left everything for them is a movement and movement infers that nothing stands in it's in one place and in the same way they have drag phobia eventually they'll have map phobia and and and there'll be a phobia for people who want to practice bestiality and polyamory polygamy and and they just they just plan to continue pushing the ball in their mind forward but in my mind they're pushing us all downward because at the end of the day being in the right destination in eternity is much more important than being on the right side of history well i know i i want to i don't push back it's not the right word but i want you to think about this which which you said i'm a little bit harder on biden i'm not going to give him age as an excuse cognitive dissonance as an excuse i i think this is more calculated i'm going to use your own words to argue that you started out by saying a decade ago he was out ahead of obama on this and so and and i that's factual and so i think he started thinking about his legacy and where he was going to end up and how if he was ever to get the presidency and how it would end up for him and so he he may now be too old to come up with all the ideas but i think he agreed to this a long time ago and and i think the democrats as as and just taking your words they think everything's a movement they talk about everything about change and i think about boba change we can believe in and now i think here we are in 2022 athletes love to put on the back of their helmets inspired change and i keep asking people like what changed what what what what why has changed now the goal of everything and then as christians i sit there and go is changed really what we believe in when we think that this word right here stands the test of time century after century after century after century and so who has put this thought in our head that changes the end all be all the left and movements and again i'm not denigrating the civil rights movement but but i'm saying that this whole mentality of like if things aren't changing if we're not out provoking change we're not being good americans and we're not out for justice and like now i would standards i like standards more than i like change and i i want to promote some standards because if we hold when people hold me to a standard hey jason you know there's only 1500 calories we want you to eat today that standard will do me justice and good hey jason you're a christian we don't go to strip clubs that standard does me good and and and hey delano you're married you sleep with your wife and that's it that standard does delano good but we we've been convinced change and movement and all that that's progress that's progressive it's a pass straight to hell in my opinion i agree with that but here's here's what i would say to your to where you started on on in that particular segment right yes biting got out ahead of obama that's that's that's true that's a fact um what i would argue is that very few people even on sort of the mainstream left were ready for the onslaught that the the trans movement brought because again this stuff has been around in some respect particularly on campuses for quite some time i would say you know probably the first person to sort of mainstream it bring it into the mainstream of public consciousness i would i would put that say that that was katlyn jenna it was the act the act there levern cox before that interview with katie kurick katie kurick said you know what's going on down there and levern crocks tried to pivot away from it so on and so forth but when espn gets to the point of honoring um bruce jenna who now goes by katlyn jenna that was a monumental moment in the culture and what i'm saying is i want to say that was 2015 so we're not even talking a decade ago and since then there has been an onslaught in terms of emphasizing the t and lgbt to the point where the l the g's and the b's have had to take the back seat and i i don't think people like buy it in or even some of the people you know that we may criticize the the joyeries the jamael hills the rachel madhows the women who are in media in industry in sports have been able to set their feet and really come up with within a defense of the encroachment on the t's into their spaces so if this was monday and you let me get a little piece on on on the you know uh post weekend football wrap up i would say that this is a blitz that is attacked the offensive line and and they just they just don't have enough people to protect the quarterback so it's it's not that i don't think that biden is into it i'm saying there's no way in 2012 he knew that he would be supporting the idea that men can get pregnant in 2022 that that's what i'm saying all of this stuff has been because Jason think of it that think of how long the civil rights movement was but for black folk even the gay rights movement what has now turned into sort of the lgbtq movement again you're talking decades the trans thing shot up like a like a like a supernova seven years that's that's not even a full decade that we went from Caitlyn jennaby and honored at the sp's to the the federal government acting as if uh quote unquote his uh gender affirming his direct amis and prescribing uh lupron to to adolescents is good government and good policy that that is a monumental shift in a very very short period of time and that's why as i say even though the the women who have made sort of a living in sports and media and industry have not been able to form an affirmative defense against this stuff and that's why they just would rather remain silent than stand up to it there's no way that somebody like jamaill who spent her entire life in sports and in broadcasting actually thinks that if lubron james took estrogen for two years and then went into the mb the wmba at the age of 40 that he would not dominate all the competition there's no way that she thinks that if he donned a wig and tried to turn jawanna man from a comedy into a docu drama that she would actually say yeah lubron the lubron that i've seen for the last 20 years oh no he's a woman now no she don't believe that she just knows that she can't say anything other than that and that's what i'm saying so if she has no chance then someone who's an octogenarian and whose mind has been addled no disrespect he definitely has no chance i'm gonna respectfully disagree with you and you made a very logical argument i'm just going to respectfully disagree by saying this i'm not that smart you talked to any of my friends i started saying 10 years ago hey the p is silent and all of this stuff they're going to legalize petafilia in my lifetime i'm not that smart but i could see it i could feel it and then the other thing i'll say when you're exposed to as much information as joe biden's been exposed to 47 50 years in politics at a high level vice president blah blah he he not the smartest guy in the world but just exposed to a lot of information and a lot of their conversation and what they're planning i i think he these technology companies none of it's surprising twitter's influence facebook's influence and i'll go with a silly example here like a what they know that the average person doesn't know i go back to when i was a kid i used to watch star trek has a little kid and they pull out these little flip phones beam me up bobber they be communicating basically on cell phones and i believe that people that may star trek knew that there was going to be cell phones around the corner and what captain kirk and all them guys was communicating on we'd all be communicating on eventually i believe joe biden barack obama hillary clinton george bush it ain't no just left wing right wing thing all these globalists have been let in on a secret and where this whole thing was headed and they know that social media is the amplifier and the accelerant to all of it i don't think they're sitting here amazed at at like look how fast things have transformed i i think they're actually frustrating like man don't trump slowed us down for four years uh you know and we still made a lot of progress but not the progress we could have made if if that hadn't happened uh i i i think joe you know i think he knows exactly what what they're doing and what they're doing here and what he signed up for uh you know he's not as competent as pulling it off now but he signed up for this so so here's here'll be my response to that two things real quick one the the p is different than the t right the the p has been around in popular culture for a lot longer than the t so whether you're talking about um roman polanski or marvin gay i mean the the notion that adult men right gay or straight would want to have sexual relations with let's say uh post pubescent or pre pubescent children is not particularly new it's it's something that we at least have known about and actually stretches back way further into history i mean in terms of you know greek society and so on and so forth so so what i'm saying is there is a distinction i do want to make a distinction between the p and the t right the other thing that i would say is and this this goes to the broader conversation about these trends and sort of the the diversity inclusion and equity movement the dye movement joe biden was the perfect patcy for the democratic party it sounds counterintuitive but he's old he's white he's straight he's a nominal catholic and he's male so even though the the the people who may criticize him say oh he has all these points of privilege what that means is all of those groups under him have leverage against him because they can say you're a racist you're a sexist you're you're a bigot against religious minorities you're a homophobe and you're a transphobe and and this is this is the play all the time it's the same play they run on black men they can't call this racist so they say you're sexist you're you're transphobic black men black men are the white people of black people it's the same play that they that they run on straight women even black women they can't say you're racist or sexist but they can say that you're transphobic and that's how you get somebody like the actor uh angelica rals who was on polls coming into a show produced shown on the open winfrey network and telling a room full of black women that they have not been um supportive sisters to her in her transition from male to female and all of those black women just sat there and they had to take it now these women are being lectured by a dude right with with broader shoulders in them and a more tapered wasting them telling them that they that they are insufficiently sort of uh uh black females so so what i'm saying is in in our society the way to amass power is to paint yourself as oppressed and when you're someone who's higher up the food chain the people below you have all types of leverage against you and and we went through this in the last couple weeks with the whole Kyrie urban thing when you heard his black detractors in the media um jamael hill shannon sharp steven a smith to some extent j williams jesse washington a bunch of other low rent writers on bleacher report espian so on and so forth all of them said the same thing a manual acho all of them said the same thing he was spreading harmful misinformation and stereotypes about a marginalized and oppressed community right that's that's the play and it and it doesn't have to be harmful if we've been completely honest in our country a black man who expresses admiration for the financial success of jewish people is taken to task while the same black man who expresses a desire to kill other black men in his in his rap lyrics is rewarded with emmys and and grammys you understand so our priorities are completely screwed up and part of it is because we have bought into the notion of intersectionality and the notion that to be oppressed um actually gives you more power against your oppressor so so what i'm saying is joe biden has all of the privilege points and that makes him the perfect patcy for the people who want to paint themselves as oppressed thank you delano have a great christmas break great job as always i will i'm on end on this note though and to say first transgender person 1952 christine jorgensen the stuff's not new and then the last thing i'll say is you know part of the leverage they have over joe biden is that silent pee anytime you're showering with your daughter your suspect very suspect that's tomorrow we'll see you live and in person in the new year we will be releasing content during the holidays but it'll be you know won't be live won't be me and you sitting here talking but to enjoy your holiday break enjoy your christmas break enjoy your family love everybody and we'll see you around the corner I want free I' Body"
