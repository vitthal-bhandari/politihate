    "text": " Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansola. So what was the top story for you, Mr. Glenn Beck? Top story today is the second coming of Christ coming to a country near you. Is it Canada? All right. That's a win. But take it, I'll go with you. The racist. You just sue us, Canada, instead of Mexico. Unbelievable. That's true. You're right. I'll go with the national emergency and the Democrats tipping their hand a little bit. All right. And Andrew Heaton from Something's Off with Andrew Heaton. The draft. The draft. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to hear Andrew's take on the NFL draft, actually. I saw that Zeki is getting recruited for basketball and then I was like the secretary of the interior and then it was Zinky. I don't know what I'm talking about. Before we tackle all of that, one of our sponsor American Financing. American Financing is a company that I started doing business with 2008 actually right after the crash because I had said to this finance company, hey, we do mortgages and I'm like everybody does mortgages now. You can get them and cash checks. And I said I'm not going to represent mortgage. And the only company I do is this one still from 2008 because after the crash, all of their customers were fine because they didn't shoehorn them into something they couldn't afford. If they look at your finances and if they don't think that this is wise or right, they did it to stew. He was doing some sham. They were like, hey, idiot. This is not really a good idea. We don't want to do that. They don't jam you in. They try to do the right thing by you. They close really fast. They're really great. It's American financing net. American financing net. All right. So Jesus, we need him right now. Jesus is coming. We need him. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting to me that in a country that is supposed to be pretty religious, that I'm not hearing this everywhere, that when the Democrats are going to be in the United States, they're going to be in the United States, they're going to be in the United States. In the Democrats in 2012, voted against God three times in their platform. I don't know if you remember that, but it was pretty shocking and especially, we're just going to ask you three times, not two, not four, three times they had to deny God. And if you look before that, they were crazy, but they were all still kind of in hiding. And then it just started getting crazier and crazier and worse and worse and worse until today where we're like, yeah, what? So what is a baby? We don't like the look of it. And they're willing to kill them. Pretty crazy. And it's happened really fast. Well, yesterday, by not voting to not kill children, I think, I mean, I don't know where God stands on the vote balance. I'm not really comfortable with only 53 votes against that, but at least it was a majority. But the Democrats, including every single presidential hopeful on the Democratic side, refused to say, yes, that's a baby. We shouldn't kill babies. I think this is a sign of the imminent demise of any kind of divine providence and protection, perhaps for the country. But definitely for the Democrats, the Democrats, I think, have revealed themselves for who they truly are. And once you're in bed and you're willing to say that, can you think of anything more horrible than, oh, yeah, it's a newborn. So we snuff its life. What's the big deal? We just leave it in a closet to cry and starve. I can't think of anything more horrific. Where do they go from there? Because you don't go to Happytown USA from there. You just get darker and darker and darker. I think the Democrats who are my friends, Democrats who are in the center of the country that are not these progressive socialists now, baby killers, they better wake up because their party has had a hostile takeover and it's going to go downhill fast from here. Still you want to weigh in? I mean, I like to believe that they think there's something else in this bill and it's such slippery slope. And I think that there is a, that was certainly the argument they made on the floor, right, which was, look, this is actually going to weaken doctors and it's going to hurt health care for women. But I mean, the bill really doesn't do that. The only thing it does is if a doctor were to have a live baby that was born again after a failed abortion, so this is born and it's alive, that's not a bad idea. If they did not treat it, they could get sued by the mother. That's how the real damage to doctors in their health care. I mean, look, I think there is an argument that they were making that this is just a show vote, right? This is just trying to get people on record for this thing and it's ridiculous. We already have a law on this. But the law, the previous law is somewhat, shows how far we've gone because this is 2002. And in 2002, this, the same thing passed without the additional, the one additional step of saying you had to have medical care. So it defined a baby that was born after a failed abortion as a human being with the rights of a human being. And that was in 2002. This added on, well, you also have to treat it, which is kind of, I think, implied in the first law, but not specific. So, you know, we have a specific on such a thing. It's 588 cases of these since 2002 that we know of, that we know of, where doctors just put them in a closet and let the children die. Just neglected them. 588 children. That's 588 too many. That is murder. That's murder. But again, this bill in 2002, which did essentially the same thing, passed with zero no votes from Democrats. How many people were running for president at that point? Apparently not enough. I think most of this is posturing. And you can get, I think you get mad at people for posturing, particularly if it involves infanticide. But I think that's what basically is going on. No Democrat running for Congress wants anything or running for president wants anything that looks like it might be anti-choice. Yes. And any capacity. I would agree, although that only, it only describes, that's only five of them. Right. So, I mean, you've got, you know, you still have a lot more. What was it? It was, the final vote was, I think, only three Democrats voted against, against, or with the Republicans. West Virginia. And I kept. Yes. West Virginia, Casey, Pennsylvania, family, obviously, famous. So, yeah. So, yeah. Right. And Alabama, right. Which again, two people. I mean, Manchin's been consistently like in the middle sort of, and Casey's, you know, has a pro-life history. Jones, we don't know exactly, but he obviously is running an Alabama for the Senate. So, he kind of falls, I'll give you that one as Jones will be a Republican. 47 other states. Yes. I have to tell you, you can't tell me, I mean, what would make you say, oh, I'm going to vote for the presidential election. Is there anything that is, that would make you go on record? I mean, this is, this is the lack of the fear of God in our, in our nation now. What would, what would allow you to have a record with your name attached to it for all time, that you said, no, no, we don't need to resuscitate or, or cuddle or care for, or do anything to a baby that's been born. We tried to kill it, we missed, so we're going to let it die. I mean, I think it does say a lot about, it does say a lot really quickly about our society, as you were saying, Andrew, if this is posturing, I mean, that says a lot. Yeah, prioritizing. Right, that's what we'll see. You're willing to do that. You're willing to do that to posture because you think it will make you look better to the American people. Go ahead and play ball. So, so with, with this specific bill, like, like if we were to take it out of the kids zone, right, and just say we're making a bill that's against the law to commit murder on a federal level, I think I might vote against it, not because I'm in favor of murder, but I would just go, this doesn't sound to me like it should be a federal law. So, like I could see in this. Is this murder? Murder is a federal law. It's a federal offense. Is it, is it handled by state authorities? No, because you could murder somebody in one state and then go to another state and get away with it. All I'm saying is I could see situations where there would be something that may not be. But why not just reinforce it? I mean, if it's what you believe, why not reinforce that by voting? Yeah, like, you know, you could, that would make sense. I don't know, I'm just, I'm just tossing out stuff of situations where like, I could like, if you were, if you were saying like, we're going to swing really hard, we're going to have like, we're now going to have a big federal program and lots of money to pay for all these things. I don't know. I want to get into the weeds. No, that's different. That's different. I think that's true. I mean, because there is, there is a risk of because everyone kind of theoretically agrees on something like this that you couldn't, you know, to show our how tough we are on it. We create a new federal program and that could be a very accurate. That's, that's a huge mistake. What, you're for the terrorists? No. I'm not for the terrorists, but that's not this case. Yeah, this case, I mean, I think, you know, look, to make it simple, sas, kept it simple and put very little in this, in this, I mean, it really is a very simple bill. And I think because there is a, I think a lot of Democrats would say this is sort of, you know, apocalyptic, but I think there is a real legitimate fear among Republicans who see person after person after person from the Democratic Party go on television and defend abortion up to the last second. And then multiple politicians and bills passing over the last couple months that say, you know what? Well, it's the choice of the doctor and the mother of whether they're going to resuscitate an infant that was actually born. I mean, again, like the choice argument to me really, I always think it's a bad argument. It's not my, it's not my issue. But I mean, even if you believe in it, all the way up to birth, like this is, this is, there's no more involvement for the mother. The child has, has already exited the body. There is, there's no connection. The cord's been cut. At that point, there should be an easy realm to defend that. And I think even, you know, again, third trimester abortion has already opposed 80 to 14 in this country. There's no reason why you can't get to this level to come across and say, hey, we see this line creeping too close to this. Let's make a definitive wall here, if you will, and say we're not going to go past this. Let's acknowledge what we should all agree upon. And the fact that we apparently don't all agree upon it is a little concerning, to say the least. I want to go ahead and move on to the national emergency. Yes. So the vote is, you know, we're in the middle of these votes for the National Emergency Act. We know I'm very much on record thinking this is a terrible idea for a million different reasons. But to just, in case, you know, you're kind of coming to this and thinking, well, well, you must be light on the border. I think the border is, I think the border is a very important issue. And I think we do need border security, and I think we do need, you know, a rule of law on the border. I do think our immigration system is very highly screwed up. But if you have the, what's going to happen now is Trump's doing the national emergency. The House can vote to overturn that emergency if the Senate agrees, which I think they likely will. It will go to Donald Trump, who will then veto, which I would, in this way, no sense. That makes sense. Right. Exactly. Now, again, this is not how it was. It was intended. Yeah. And it was not even what the people who passed the National Emergency Act intended. They wanted it just to be a simple majority that got overturned in the Supreme Court. So Trump can veto it. It'll go back to the House. I think they have a very tiny chance of overturning the veto. It's not 0%, but it's pretty darn small. I think, though, what I've kind of been interested about the last 24 hours as this has developed is the Democrats in particular, what do they actually want out of this? They keep saying they want Donald Trump. Do they want to overturn this? And I think that that, in their minds at this moment, that's true. They don't want a wall. They don't want him taking the money. They don't want him taking this control. However, the big picture is I think they love this outcome. They are salivating at the chance to be able to use it and exploit it to the maximum extent possible. Why does something already set that? Oh, my gosh. Many over and over and over again. Climate change and how fun. I'm saying it today. Climate change guns. It's healthcare. It's interesting to hear that at the same time that they're saying that they're going to try to overturn it. Right. Yes. No, I know. Well, they're saying because it's not a national emergency. Right. And that's the thing we disagree with it. Thank you. We disagree that it's a national emergency. This is exactly where I'm going. Because if they actually, it's not that they disagree with giant power out of this one figure that the President was never supposed to have, right? They just say this particular thing, we actually think it's an emergency. They're not enough people are coming in. Right? Like, I was saying this on the air earlier today. People are like, well, we get a wall and it's a permanent wall. Walls fall down. They knock them down all the time, all over the world. This is not a crazy thing. The second a Democrat gets in there, they will have a national emergency and saying, we are killing people on the border and they'll knock the whole thing down and you'll get nothing out of this. Not true. Ask the people of Berlin anyway. Well, you've seen. Beyond all of this though, if you were serious, the Democrats really oppose this. You know what they sound a lot like? They sound a lot like Mike Lee. This is what Mike Lee said about the particular emergency act. My initial assessment is that what President Trump announced is legal. Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter. Congress has been seeding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We should use this as a, this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back. This is not a one issue about the border. It's not an issue about, you know, how even the precedent that we're setting here for Democrats in the future. It's an issue about the Constitution specifically says how this is supposed to be handled. And we've decided that it's okay. We can pass enabling acts to override the Constitution. It specifically says Congress must handle trade. It specifically says they must handle the power of the purse. And just because Congress decides to vote that they want to hand that power to something else, doesn't mean they should be able to. I think that all of this stuff is unconstitutional and we should get back to the Mike Lee version of this, which is, hey, you know what? Congress needs to do the things the Constitution specifically says it should do. If we all decided to vote, we don't want, you know, we shouldn't allow ourselves to have freedom of speech, for example. Well, you can amend the Constitution and take the freedom of speech out of there, but you can't vote yourself out of a right like that. That's not the way that works. So that Mike Lee guy you're referencing wants to sort of maintain the integrity of the institution rather than use power as a football going back and forth? It's a crazy idea, Andrew. Good luck to that guy. Yeah, like, well, good luck. No, but seriously, I do want to, I'm interested to get the libertarian take on here. I feel like you'd be right on here. 100% agree with all of that. I mean, I don't, I think the basic premise of allowing the President to declare a national emergency whenever he or she doesn't like the outcome of Congress is like putting mad libs in the Constitution. That's just a horrible, horrible idea to do. Don't do that. An emergency declaration should be, and I'm not in favor of them, but it should be like the declaration of war. The President has the right, in my opinion, to say, we've got to go to war right now because we've just been attacked. But then within 30 days, he's supposed to go to Congress and say, I need you to finance this. After 30 days, without a declaration of war, we're not at war. And it should, all that money should be piped down and should be shut off. We don't do that anymore. That's the same thing with a national emergency. If he needs to act quickly, act quickly. But the Congress is the one that has the purse strings. And it's not the Senate. It was important to the founders that it has Congress because they are the ones supposedly closest to the people and the easiest to unseat. They're the reason why they have the checkbook. All right, back in a minute. I'm making it. My children want to do it. I'm trying to get the first one to do it. I'm trying to get the first one to do it. All right, before we get back into it, we want to thank our sponsor, Relief Factor. So I know Glenn used to just live in constant pain. And when you live in constant pain, you just want to, like, jump off a bridge all the time. Yeah, you do. It affects every part of your life. Yeah, you're grumpy all the time and you're not. You just don't want to do anything. And you just get to the point of, like, oh, this isn't worth living like this. I can't live this way anymore. And I was like that about a year and a half ago. And I've been dealing with it for almost eight years now, nine years. And I just, it was just done. And my wife said, before you do anything stupid, like quit your job or something, just take this, try this. We're this close. Oh, geez. Lamb, tanya. Lamb, tanya. So we tried Relief Factor. And I told her, I said, it's not going to work. It's all natural and that crap never works. Yeah, why don't we try some natural oil for scopes? Yeah, all right. But this did. And I have a problem, and we all do, if you have pain, inflammation, this helps reduce inflammation. And they found that about, it works about 70% of the time for people. So if you try it for three weeks and it doesn't work for you, if it's not out of pain, it's not going to work for you. If it does, you should order more. And that's why 70% of the people do. They go on to order more month after month, like I have. Yeah. All right. So go to ReliefFactor.com. The three week quick start pack is only 1995. So like Glenn said, 70% of the people keep going on to order more. That's worth 20 bucks to find out if it can work for you. Andrew, you had a question for Glenn. A question for Glenn. A question for Glenn at the beginning of the program. So today's a segment of the Blaze Y. Oh, right. Yes, today our question will come from what Mighty Heaton. Mighty Heaton. Mighty Heaton. Mighty Heaton. Follow me on Twitter. Made some comment about a German rat earlier. I used Twitter for what it's designed for. What I want to ask you, Glenn, was at the beginning of the program we were talking about the anti-infanticide legislation. And you used a turn of phrase that I thought was interesting. You said that you thought divine providence might be retracted or taken away. So I was curious as to, you know, yeah. So there's a couple of things on this. I believe we are a country. Well, I know for a fact that George Washington made a covenant with God. For our kneel in prayer with everyone who attended the first inauguration, a covenant in the little church that was across the street from the World Trade Center, the one that had never been, had the windows shattered or anything. It survived somehow. That is where he knelt in prayer for four solid hours and made a covenant. We will be your people. You will be our God. And that guided us and I think protected us. And many presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, felt that that covenant was in effect. And in his second inaugural address, he said, it's God's will. We have done these things and we are going to pay a price for this. And if it's God's will that he washes us clean, you know, with all the blood and all of our treasure, then so be it. I believe we have had this protection for a long time. And we have strayed further and further and further and further. I think when we get to the point to where we are a nation that can't say, yeah, we shouldn't kill our own children. I think that covenant is over. I think we've broken that covenant. And that doesn't mean that God's going to punish us. It means you're on your own, guys. You're on your own. You know, England does this. France does this. They don't have a pact with God like we did. One more example. Around the same time that we were making this covenant with God, Haiti did exactly the opposite. And Haiti made a covenant with Satan. They wanted to stop slaves, the slave trade, and they couldn't kill the French. And they couldn't stop it. And so the slaves got together, all the witch, you know, the voodoo stuff. And they made a pact. Same time. Now look at the two paths. Slavery stopped. They chased the French to where? New Orleans. New Orleans with all of its dark magic and everything else. That city is kind of screwed up. But that came from Haiti. Haiti has been a country that has never had a break ever. I've talked to the people around the president of Haiti. He knows it. The people in his administration know it. We're talking about going down and bringing a bunch of real preachers, not, you know, not fakie preachers, real people of God. The president of Haiti wants to get down on his knees and do exactly what George Washington did and break that contract with darkness and make a new covenant with God. And I think when you do that, I think that country will turn around. Andrew? At Acosta, like with like the Byzantine Empire or the Roman Empire, like is it always a covenant that's broken where the covenant's not formed? No. No. We made a specific covenant. The only other country that's had a covenant like this is Israel. The ancient Israel had a covenant and they broke the covenant. We are a covenant nation. There's only been two in the history of the world, us and Israel. I mean, I just, I feel like most, most European nations for, you know, the last thousand years up until 1700 would do themselves as explicitly Christian and far from the perspective of us. There's a difference between saying we're a Christian nation and dedicating this nation and dedicating it in the proper way with a covenant and saying we are forming this nation to serve you. They, they honestly, and some of the biggest scholars on our founders, they rejected this notion when I first expressed it. One of them came back a year later, a year and a half later with a book saying, yeah, it is true. I think you're right, that our founders believed that one of the reasons why we were supposed to be formed is we were going to be instrumental in the re-establishment of ancient Israel. And so they made that covenant to do his will and to bring a, bring about what he wanted and to re-establish the ancient, ancient Israel. And they believed that we were actually the new Israelites. They believed that the pilgrims were actually a continuation of the Exodus from Egypt away from the Pharaoh. And now the Pharaoh was in England and they came here and this was the Promised Land. So it's a, it takes on a whole different view because it's not just Christian, it is the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is Israel and the Promised Land and the Jewish people all rolled up into one. Stu, I feel like you and I need, like we need a popcorn. Yeah. I watch this back and forth. So just, this is fascinating. For those of us that aren't a part of that, like are we, are we dragging you guys down? Yes. That's what we've been saying. We didn't want to tell you, but yeah. No, no, no, no. It's not, no, no, no. It's not that, it's not that we have to be, the founders fought for everybody's right. They fought for everyone's right even to be atheist. It doesn't matter. Are you a good person? However, the nation must have a good morals foundation to it. When we start killing children, there's no one that can look you in the eye with a straight face and say, oh, we're doing, we're doing the good thing. Not even God's will. We're doing the right thing by killing children. No one can say that. You've stepped over a line that no covenant could exist with that. All right. Got to take a break. We'll be back. If you know New Orleans, they've seen the playoffs the last two years, you know they are cursed. That is absolutely true. Notice I had a target that's in jail. So.

Andrew, I'm really excited, I think, Sue as well, that you have come to the table to talk about the NFL draft. That's right. I think that they are really on top of things. Wow. Justin Schneider is going to do great for the school that he went to TU. TU. Good one. Yeah. There you go. That was good analysis. He's all over Schneider, everybody. Bet Schneider. Okay, no, the draft. Yes, the draft. So the draft, which you and I probably signed up for, at least for the Selective Service thing, that has been deemed unconstitutional in a federal court. So this is at the district level, which is to say that it'll probably be appealed by somebody and it may very well go up to the Supreme Court. I hope it does and I hope it remains unconstitutional because I think it should be and is. The way it worked is this was attempted a few years back and I think the 70s, it was like Rosker versus somebody else. And at the time the argument was, hey, this is an unfair draft based on the fact that it only applies to men. So past equal rights, if we're only going to do this for one gender or not for the other, it is therefore unconstitutional. The court at that time, because again, this is the 70s, the court went, we don't have women in the military that doesn't really matter. This is not a germane topic. However, now post 2014, post 2015, we have women in combat and in virtually every role in the military. So it is more of an issue. So the court in southern Texas ruled that yes in fact this does violate the equality clause and therefore violate the concept of equality and therefore we're not going to have the draft be constitutional anymore. So a couple of caveats to this. The draft is an in effect and has not been since the 70s either. So if you're at home and you're 16 and a half, you probably don't need to worry about this. This is more of a philosophical bent than it is a particular worry. But I think it's an important one and I'll tell you why. I would, if we're going to have a draft, I want it to be gender equitable. I would either write all the genders to be drafted or not have it. I prefer that. I would not actually prefer that. I would just like to say it for the record. I'm good with you guys being the big strong tough guy. This is where I come in is I don't think we should have a draft at all. And it's not because of a gender issue. It's because you were the land of the free and the home of the brave. I am not worried about the United States being able to yield up sufficient soldiers to defend the homeland. I trust 100% and the veracity of the American people to rise to every challenge that we're given. We don't need some guy to come to our house with a gun and then order us to go kill somebody we don't like with a gun. That is not necessary. And I think that it's frankly morally heinous. I think having a draft is comparable to slave soldiers and we should get rid of that entirely. I certainly agree with that. I think the, you know, I was comparing about TSA agents. I actually want to be drafted. What's this? Yes. Well, yeah. First of all, I don't want to be drafted because I'm a wuss. My dad was a bivourer. I just want to do it on my time. You know, I was saying the same thing about the TSA agents being called back into work during the government shutdown. I'm like, you can't force people. That is we did have a 14th amendment because of an issue. We didn't want to force people to do jobs. They didn't want to do. That was like a real thing. We went through in this. We went through it. A little bit controversial at times. Yeah. And I honestly don't, it's interesting to bring this up. In my head, like that's just blatantly unconstitutional. I can't be forced people to go into military service. Though the constitution really does allow for a lot of wartime exceptions. For example, the third amendment, which stops you from having soldiers cornered in your home, which is a, you know, it's like, oh, like if the second amendment, the first one, they really got that one first, second, fourth, fifth. We talk about them all the time. The third one's like, wait, which one is that? But it also has an exception. It's in peacetime. So in theory, if we are at war, yes, they can come and sleep at your house. Same thing with the 14th amendment has, you know, when it comes down to slavery is illegal. But not if you do something wrong. If you do something or something, it could be like a crime or like there's lots of exceptions for those things. And I honestly don't know. I can't remember honestly studying at all the draft specifically. It feels like it should be unconstitutional. Is it? That's fair. And I don't know. I would need to read the constitution again. And I would say if that's the case, then I would relent because I would rather, much as I despise the idea of slave soldiers, I also, so far as the constitution goes, I don't want people making up elements of the constitution that are there because rule of law is also very important. That said though, the underlying philosophical construct is going to say I'm very much against. And if someone wanted to write a constitutional amendment prohibiting the draft, I'd be very much in favor of it. Yeah, I would agree. And I also would say just pragmatically, like I don't want a bunch of people fighting next to me. They don't want to be there. I like, it's just like not a good rational way to build. If you're going to win more, you have to have enough people to be able to fill your army and win them. And if you can't, maybe that particular war is not a very good, like if we're having that much trouble going to Vietnam, maybe Vietnam is not a real good war to be in. Right. I mean, I think that's a pre-logical end point. And again, you don't want to be, there's no reason. We've created a lot of people who went to war and went through things they didn't want to go through and something they didn't believe. That's not the right way to do this. I think there's a, we've had a, we've been on the right side of a lot of these things. They're not perfect as a country, but I think we've done pretty well as compared to what you would compare this to other nations and what they've done in their past. So I think we've, generally speaking, have a, we've been on the right path overall, though at times we crossed that line. And I feel like the draft is a good, like just a, you know, rule of thumb, you know, maybe not crossed that line. That doesn't, doesn't seem good for the soldiers. Doesn't seem good for the people who don't want to be there. And it certainly doesn't seem good for the country as a whole. Well, I agree with what you guys are saying just to play devil's advocate on one thing that you guys said, Andrew, or that you said, Andrew, is that you think that Americans would rise to the occasion in the event of wartime. Yeah. That's a solid amount of optimism that you have in the American people because I don't know that I could say, yes, I think that Americans would be really ready to go out and put themselves out there. I mean, we live in a pretty selfish, entitled country. We, you know, selfishness is doing pretty well. However, when you look at historically, like, you know, World War I, World War II, we had, like the World War II, we had people that were going and joining Canada so that they could go fight the Germans ahead of time. There were some. Yeah, but that was a totally different time, totally different society. Morals were totally different. I mean, this day and age, I just don't feel like anyone would want to do something like that and put this stuff. I'm going to, I'm going to meet your pessimism with other pessimism, which is that though people are selfish, people are also inherently tribalistic. That's not going to go away. And if the tribe is ever threatened by another tribe, you can count on human beings to want to go kill that tribe. So I think 9-11. Right. I mean, I think you saw people leaving the NFL to go and fight overseas. And I think, you know, we didn't have, we didn't need a draft there despite, I have two wars at the same time. You know, like, I think we've also wars come a long way, you know, I mean, we're not talking now anymore about, you know, tens in 20, 20, 30,000 people dying in one battle on a specific day. You know, we are, we've seen, you know, if you read Pinkers' book, you know, Better Angels of our Nature, you'll see that this has really improved over time. You know, a lot of people complain and I, you probably would have, you know, a lot of libertarians have the same complaint that they're like, this is our longest war, for example, in Afghanistan. Well, I always push back a little bit on that. It's like, why would you measure war by time? To me, war should be measured by how many people it kills. And the fact that this is in, among that measure, in every way is much preferable, far more preferable than any war that lasted a short period of time and a million people died. I mean, the libertarian in me will point out it also costs a lot of money. It does cost a lot of money. It's a lot of treasure that's got it, but if not, believe me, I'm not advocating for, hey, let's have some more wars. I'm not, that's not where I am. But I mean, I do think that like, there's some element of, you know, people didn't want to go to Vietnam because they, that experience for people in large part was, you know, you know, it wasn't just that they, they weren't like for communism necessarily. It was that they were, you know, they were in swamps and it was tough and it was brutal life and they go back to World War II, the same thing. These were immense sacrifices that people made and certainly our soldiers of today as well, but the chances of dying are lower. We are much better at doing these things than we used to be. You know, it's not like now there's mass bombs everywhere and firefights everywhere. These, you know, there are, our special forces have to go through a lot of that on smaller scales, but it, you know, wars changed quite a bit. And I think largely speaking, oddly for the better. I mean, the fact that we're not just carpet bombing cities anymore is a real positive. I just think, I would like to have none of these and no wars at all. That would be great, but when these things do happen, they, they do tend to be more controlled. It doesn't mean everyone's going to be for the future. Obviously, there's the possibility of nuclear war and all these other things, but we won't need to draft for it. Oh, wait, that's right. Just beep, beep, beep. We'll all die. That would be great. Oh, good. Yeah. Unless the spies like us lasers reel, if that's real, we can knock them out of the sky. So just consider that. Really quickly, Stu, I heard Stephen Crowder on with you guys on radio this morning. Yeah. And I encourage everyone to go back and listen to, who was hour one. Yes, he was right off the beginning of the show. Yeah, of your radio program. Tell us a little bit about what happened with that because I know that he was doing it a bit on the Oscars, watching the Oscars, so we didn't have to. Yes. And he got booted from YouTube. Yeah, they did an Oscars commentary sort of party and, you know, they dressed up in characters and they made fun of, made fun of the Oscars. And they had done this in previous years. And for whatever reason, this time, ABC decided they were going to get him booted off of YouTube for a copyright complaint. Now he said that they mentioned that they showed a brief piece of the video, maybe on the TV in the background. And I think he's definitely arguing like, this is fair use. We're using it in a transformative way. And Stephen has been successful in fighting people cracking down on these sorts of things before. He's not afraid of jumping in that legal battle with big-time attorneys and fighting it out. And he's won several times. You know, Oscars are notoriously horrible when it comes to copyright stuff. I mean, when you want to talk about the Oscars the next day, you have like enough room to run one, like, 22nd clip. If you run more than that, they will come after you. They are as hot. They are as bad as they can be for anybody. But when it comes to a conservative, you know, the creditors saying, like, look, this is ridiculous. I mean, they're coming after us because we're making fun of them. And that is the issue here, not the other way around. And his point, which I think is really valid, is, you know, if we don't step up and fight back against these things when they come around and we just fold every single time, you know, they are going to continue to come after conservatives and just pick them off one by one. I know Glenn's afraid of this. We talked to Peter Schweitzer, who's on the podcast. I don't know if it was this week or last week, Glenn's interview podcast where he did a whole thing about Google and Facebook and YouTube. He's a documentary out about it and about the way that they have specifically targeted conservatives. You know, sometimes I think conservatives get in this sort of like conspiracy theory world where every time one of our videos get pulled down, we're like, oh gosh, this is Zuckerberg and he's just liberal. But there is, you know, Schweitzer goes through real evidence of, you know, of the way that the algorithms prioritize content that is targeted more to the left and push down in the results conservative content. This is like a real battle because you're in this world where there's a temptation to just pull yourself back, right, and just not put your stuff out there and not engage you. Why are we going to let them have access to our content? We're making this original content. Why are we going to give it to Facebook and YouTube so that they can make money off of it when they're targeting us? On the other hand, like that's we have to be in that, you know, the battlefield of ideas and people need to see conservative content and libertarian content because they won't get it from the mainstream media. So it's a really tough line to walk and Stephen's right in the middle of that battle and, you know, I think that's one of the important reasons why something like Belize TV exists. It's like there's a little bit of a pocket, a little safe space to make content that's not going to, you know, get targeted in that way for now. I think, I'll also point out, while I'm not an attorney, I kind of look like one. We do. And thank you. I don't know that I would pay you a retainer for you. I could be a barrister. I think I could like show up in Canadian, you know, but like I don't know that like working in entertainment, I've had to deal with fair use law a lot and that what he's doing seems fine. Like the point of fair use law is to keep me from taking your product and then just selling it, right? Yeah. Like that's the point of fair use law. If you're making a new work, which he is, particularly if he's just talking about it, like there's there would be no grounds whatsoever unless he showed something. But even then if it's like a quarter of the screen and it's him discussing it, that's clearly a separate act. Like there's no, you would need a very, very good high powered legal team to basically snuff out the actual argument against that. So yeah, I mean, it's tough. The Oscars, a lot of this is, you know, people enforcing their copyrights and going after everything that they want to. And you know, some organizations are tougher than others. I know in sports, for example, there's been a lot of people in sports radio over the years who have tried to do, hey, there's a big game on TV. I'm going to do a show talking about what's going on in the game. And at times the leagues crack down on them and they say, you can't do play by play. We license that right. You cannot do play by play of our games. That is our material and you can't do it. You could talk about it in general, but you can't give a play by play account because that is essentially what we license for millions and millions and billions in some cases of dollars. Not allowed to flip off the camera, am I? Because I think that's nonsense. So like you could- I'd prefer it if you didn't. So if I don't even have the- if it's just me talking about the big game, I could not do that because- They will come after you for sure for that. Some thug has decided he's got a monopoly over what I can say on air. Yeah. I mean, look, they sell play by play rights to broadcast networks. I mean, ESPN paid what? $3 billion for the NBA. Now of course that could be pictures and accounts, right? That's what it covers. So someone else is just doing a radio broadcast. How can they sell the radio broadcast to the station that's licensed it? I understand the argument there. Yeah, freedom of speech is real tough. I'm sorry that that's going to abrogate your profit mark. But like, yeah, we still are going to have freedom of speech. NFL. Wow. See this? I got you to talk about sports today. I know. Yes. We're really proud to have you. Yeah, apparently I don't like it. All right. Yesterday's poll question. Do you think Trump's declaration of a national emergency over border security is constitutional? 81% of you said yes. Of course. Hey, but I got 19. I feel like that's pretty good. Well, 11% said no and 8%. I'm sure. I'll take it. I'll take it. I feel pretty good. I mean, at least I got a few insurers too. I mean, I really thought we could be in the 90s on that one. So I feel pretty accomplished. It's a good day. Well, but I mean, you know, Mike Lee even said it may be. It may be. I don't think it actually is constitutional. I mean, Mike is the smartest guy on this stuff. I think what he's saying is it's legal. So like there's a line there, right? Like it, I think he is executing the law as written. I don't think the law as written is actually constitutional. And I think the courts will agree with that. And I think they will overturn it. And that's the worst part about this. We're giving up this giant precedent for something like this. And it may not even get us anywhere. If it, however, I will say, if it does get overturned, maybe the precedent goes away. And maybe that's the best of both worlds. Yeah. Today's poll question. Are you surprised the Born Alive Act that we've talked about? It would require medical professionals to provide medical care to infants who survive at failed abortions. Are you surprised that that was blocked by the Senate yesterday? Let us know at the Blaise's Twitter. I'm surprised because I guess when we were talking about it, we didn't talk about the fact that they would need to have the two-thirds majority, the 60 votes to even vote on it. Yeah, because it was this dumb procedural thing. Really dumb. Yeah. It's super confusing. And I swear 95% of the reporters who write about it do not know what the procedure is either. No. They just use really vague terms. I wanted to see if we'd have any Republicans saying no to this and how many Democrats would come along. And the fact that you got three was something. You know, a couple of Republicans. That's it? I mean, it's better than zero, I feel like. And by the way, there was two Republicans who did not, or three Republicans total who did not vote on this. Murkowski, whose pro-choice, and I think probably may have very well voted with the Democrats. However, Kramer and Scott did not vote on it as well. They had flight delays. Yeah. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think you could say this is dumb. Why am I doing this? The way I think fantasize it's already illegal. I think that's an okay position to say, come on, guys. This isn't really going to happen. That's still associated with a yes vote on this one. I agree. All right. That is it from us. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow and it will track. Yeah. I hope the ceiling is good. Let's do it. Kevin Graham. Good to be here. Boy, would that be a sit.
