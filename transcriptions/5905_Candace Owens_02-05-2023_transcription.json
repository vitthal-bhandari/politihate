    "text": " All right, happy Tuesday, everybody. Question of the day, what does it take to be a cover girl or cover guy? What do you actually think the attributes of somebody who is put forth on the cover of a magazine should be? Should there be any attributes? Are we just randomly picking people to be on the cover of magazines? Let's talk about that. Plus, a white councilman in Diana sparks outrage after proclaiming that he himself is actually a lesbian woman of color who is living as his true self. And I love that. I love that for him because why not? I don't know. I'll just pick our whatever's. Let's just pick our whatever's all that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. Maybe it's me. Maybe I have got something wrong because growing up when I would think of stars and the people that they would put on the cover, I would think of people that were tremendously talented, people that were perhaps multitasking in some amazing capacity. She's the star of films. She's also an amazing mother and she's taking a stance on this issue. I think of them as you would think of homecoming queens or homecoming kings, people that are worthy of celebration. Everybody votes for this person because they're so wonderful and the beauty is just one component of it. They also do a lot of charity. I don't know. I'm making this up as I go along. Maybe I think of cover stars in the capacity of a class president. Vote for me. Why would we vote for this person that we are seeing on the cover of Vogue or a lore magazine or cause of politics magazine? What is about this person that we gravitate toward? Surely some aspect of goodness writes. Maybe you think of them as you would the valedictorian. Like I said, that tremendous multitasker who did everything. They took extra classes and they were in extra curricular activities. They were the head of the math leads team and also the captain of the cheerleading team. They're definitely going to Harvard because they're so great and they're so amazing. I don't know if I was just completely deluded in the past and wasn't paying attention or if things really have shifted culturally. I'm starting to recognize that the people that they are starting to put on the cover of magazines are anything but the descriptions that I have just provided. These are the people that would have been suspended 32,000 times from school. People that would have been arrested perhaps when you were at school and when they could you imagine those individuals in school with that always got in trouble and then when they came back to school after maybe I don't know their third two week suspension, somebody saying to them, we're going to make you the class president. You can't imagine that because you understood that there was something wrong with this individual. They were getting something wrong in life and that they were not aspirational but this seems to be the circumstance in Hollywood today. I talk often about the perversity in Hollywood but I don't think that I do enough to impress upon my listeners how demonic it's becoming where if they see a brokenness within someone, they want to glorify it. They want to spotlight it. They want this person to have more followers. They want to put it on the cover because they know people on the outside think of this as glamour, as glitz and glamour. When you see something and they are struggling, you see a person and they are struggling and they are perverse and then as a reward for that struggle and that perversity, they are given a spotlight in a magazine. Well, I think they're hoping that you will aspire to be as perverse as though individuals. I'll give you some examples. We spoke at length a few weeks ago about carodelamine. I found it was very strange but I had just seen footage of carodelamine essentially tweaking. She actually looked like she was coming down from methamphetamine at a private airport, Van Nuys airport in Los Angeles so much so that they had the stage in intervention for her, so much drug use and so much drinking and yet just a few short months after this video was circulated widely, they put her on the cover of Vogue. Now, I don't have an issue with carodelamine. I think it's great that she is beginning her recovery but I do know that somebody that is beginning their recovery shouldn't be rewarded a cover because they know that she's not better yet. How could she better? We've watched her for years, party, we've watched her for years, behave like that and that's the real reason they want her on. They're glorifying what she was, not the idea that she might be better in the future. In fact, I would argue that if carodelamine actually got clean, they wouldn't be calling for her to be on the cover of magazines anymore. They wouldn't be inviting her to those same parties. They loved her as somebody that abused alcoholism and abused drugs and was a lesbian and was shaving her head. They loved that about carodelamine. Remember all of the footage of her that we would see, oh, she's a friend, everybody wants everybody wants to be like carodelamine. And she tells us in this article at Vogue that she's basically been drinking since she was seven. Nobody cares. It didn't stop her from finding fame. In fact, it probably furthered her fame. Similarly, I saw and this shocked me, Hayden Pena Tier on the cover of Women's Health magazine. Now, Women's Health, if the cover here was implied, if they actually meant what they were saying, she would be the antithesis of that. She has been very open about her abuse of drugs in the past and about her addiction issues in the past. She is someone that my heart was out to. She was a child star. Remember the Titans? I remember the Titans and she was great in that. But like many of these child stars come up in Hollywood, her life didn't end well. Or I guess I would say her life hasn't been going well. It's a very rare thing when a mother loses custody of her own child. She did. She custody of her child was given to her ex, Vladimir Kliczko, who lives out in Ukraine. She again has documented her struggles. Now this isn't to say that her struggles are of the past because just last year, again, footage that I've recently seen of Hayden Pena Tier and her current or maybe perhaps ex on and off boyfriend Brian Hickerson engaged in a massive brawl outside of a restaurant. Take a look at this. You're going to hear nothing but peace because they're swearing and they're in the middle of a brawl. Again, if you are listening to the audio and not watching it, there's essentially a gang of people outside of this restaurant. And Hayden Pena Tier is in the middle of this group of people. She's fully on the ground. She's holding somebody. Somebody has just picked her up. Her hair is an absolute mess. There seems to be some sort of a liquid spilled on her pants. I'm not sure if she's perhaps lost her bladder in the madness of all of this. But this isn't exactly what you would refer to as becoming behavior. Wait a minute. She starts to warn him. She says Brian jail, Brian jail because her boyfriend is on probation. And yet here he is in the middle of a massive pile up along with her. So how does a girl like Hayden Pena Tier go from being in the middle of a street brawl to the cover of women's health? I'm just trying to understand who made the call, who said let's definitely get Hayden Pena Tier because nothing screams health to me like giving up rights to your daughter and then getting into a street brawl within the same couple within the same few years. Within just a few short amount of time, all of these things has happened to her and yet it has not at all ruined her career. Why is this allowed? Again, I want to take you back to the concept of imagine that happening in high school, someone getting into this fight and then that person getting back and becoming rewarded and being told that they're the specialist. Your student of the month actually just got into a brawl. This is what we see happening over and over again. Of course, there's the incident of Dylan Mulvaney and his spread in a lore magazine spilling the tea with Dylan Mulvaney. Dylan Mulvaney dress. What is alluring about a man that identifies as a little girl and dresses up in little skirts? I don't know. You'd have to ask the people that phone calls him a phone call and asked him to be featured in this. What is luring about it? Which brings me lastly to this cover because it's just so shocking. The audacity of this is what's so shocking. The cover of Brides Magazine, I assume the person that we were going to see would be a bride. I assume the person you're going to see would be a woman instead. Brides of India is featuring a lock vade menin in his full beer and wearing a sorry dress. It says he's a gender non-conforming author and activist, jacked out in traditional Indian women's wear, heavy makeup, various saris and decadent jewelry. Vade uses they, them pronouns and goes by their first name. Obviously, this is a grown man. We should be saying he. What is the reason that they decided to put him on the cover of Brides Magazine? Well, it says that he told the magazine about spending his entire life as a victim and bullying for choosing to live as his authentic self and embracing a de-gendered style, which they describe as a no guidelines form of storytelling. So again, I will ask the question, what is guiding these sorts of decisions? Why is it that when the people behind these magazines see mental illness, see internal hurt and struggle, they pursue it and they glamorize it and they put it on the cover of a magazine for young people to consume? What is the thought process behind it? I think it's really important to talk about culture in this way and for me to not just talk about it as being pervasive and perverse, but also as being demonic because it is. We have to have the courage to use those terms demonic and satanic. I know people a lot of times in today's world cringe when they hear spiritual terms, but realize that if you are afraid to talk about spirituality, you are in a very mild manner assisting the left because they aren't afraid to talk about a spirituality. They aren't afraid to do things that are devilish and are demonic. And I will end this by letting you guys listen to the venerable Bolton Sheen discuss this phenomenon very briefly. Take a listen. We have almost forgotten that we are in a great mortal combat. The battle of the forces of good and the forces of evil. Today we are beginning either to domesticate the devil or else to deny you. God's definition of himself is I am who am. The devil's definition of himself is I am who am not. He is most powerful when he is denied. So there you have it. When you deny the devil and when you deny something that is demonic, you actually in turn give it power, which is why it's so important for me to acknowledge these things that are happening in the society and the hopes that we can actually turn it around. And that's all I'm going to say about that. The shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank was the country's second biggest banking failure. You've heard my take on this. If your initiative as a company is not focused on profits or returns and is instead focused on equity, diversity and inclusion, your business will not survive. Silicon Valley Bank cared more about organizing month long pride campaigns implementing safe spaces for their staff and ultimately presenting themselves as woke. And they did about actually doing the right thing by those who are banking with them. Unfortunately, the collapse of SVV is just the start signature bank collapse days later and economists are now predicting a mild recession in the second half of this year. To protect your savings, you need to take action now. Consider diversifying at least some of your portfolio into precious metals. I recommend birch gold to help you get the job done. During times of economic uncertainty and market volatility, gold will outperform other investments like stocks or bonds. Gold can help you hedge against inflation because its value tends to rise when the cost of living increases. Unlike other assets such as paper currency, the supply of gold is limited, which can help to maintain its value over time. If you're looking for a smart and safe investment opportunity, get in touch with my friends over at birch gold. They can help you convert your IRA or your 401k into a tax sheltered IRA and precious metals. So text Candace to 989898 to claim you're free in FOKIT. With an A plus rating with a better business bureau, thousands of happy customers and countless five star reviews, I trust birch gold to protect my future and you can too. That's Candace to 989898. Okay, now it's time for some topics to do. So, Chrissy Teigen went to the White House Correspondent's dinner and she has been blasted because she had servants carrying her dress as she walked through the streets of Washington, D.C. I don't really see why people are upset, but let's at first take a look at her walking and having her dress held. So if you're listening to the audio here and you are not watching this, she's walking through the streets, very high slit dress. Her husband John Legend is accompanying her. He is the musician and composer. They're holding hands and they have looks to be three young women that look tired and not as glamorous and they are holding her train, which is something that is making people upset because it's giving them the vibes of peasants holding her dress. Now I'm going to defend Chrissy Teigen. Here's why. Chrissy Teigen outwardly told everybody how much of a jerk and how horrible of a person she is. She's been very clear about who she is. She outwardly told teenagers to commit suicide. She slid into the DMs of teenagers and told them that they should die and commit suicide. Not only did she do this, but when she got caught doing this, she never apologized. She issued some statement that she was going to do some soul searching and she was going to begin the process of reaching out to these people. It was a favor Abraham, Lindsay Lohan. I forgot the third person was and she never did it because Chrissy Teigen knows that she's an elitist. Chrissy Teigen said to you, I am so far in the category of elites that I can quite literally in the age where everybody gets canceled, I can tell teenagers to die and to kill themselves and there will be no consequences. When I say no consequences, I mean the President of the United States will invite me to the White House Correspondent Center. The same President that sits around and says, oh, we need to be more accepting. Oh, hate speech must be condemned. Oh, the maga people, the maga Republicans, they're so awful and they're so hateful. Yeah, that guy, he invited Chrissy Teigen who failed to apologize for telling teenagers to die, commit suicide, die. Your life is not worth living. I'm paraphrasing here without consequence, without even having to apologize. She sat there and pretended she was sad. Then she said people will forget about it because I'm Chrissy Teigen and I'm an elitist. So when people see her walking in the streets like an elitist and having three girls hold her gown behind her and they pretend to be outraged or surprised, it just completely misses me. Like I said, she's been a dirtbag. She's openly been a dirtbag and there have been no consequences for her. So I'm going to defend her continued right to be a rotten human being because at least she's not hiding it. And that's the best I can say about Chrissy Teigen. Moving on, you guys, I love this guy. I love him so much. I'm just going to read you the headline here. White Councilman in Indiana sparks outrage after proclaiming himself to be a lesbian woman of color who is, quote, living life as his true self, but angry trans local is calling for him to resign, which is shocking to me. Shocking to me. I'm not waiting to defend this Delaware County Councilman Ryan Webb. I'm going to do it on my show. I'm going to do it publicly. I'm going to do it on Twitter because my goodness, if there is one thing I have learned from the left, it is that if you think it, it's true. If you feel it, therefore it is. There is no such thing as objective reality. So some might say, oh, here is Ryan Webb, a white man. He couldn't possibly be a black lesbian. But to those people, I would say, why do you hate so much? Why are you so bigoted? Why can't you see that love is love and loving yourself for being a black lesbian when you're clearly not is also love? Let's take a listen to some newscasters reporting on this remarkable story. The Councilman is coming out as a transgender, best transgender and a woman of color. Delaware County Councilman Ryan Webb announced that he now identifies as an Indian American woman. With that announcement, he's received some support, but a lot of backlash, many calling him childish, despicable, even calling for things like execution. In a statement, Webb gave to ITM8, he says, quote, It is unfortunate that I cannot simply be given the same space and respect to explore my identity that so many of those targeting me demand for themselves. It's possible I may change my mind down the road. The process of identity exploration is complex and oftentimes at the end of our personal journey, we end right back where we started. Webb goes on to tell ITM8, this is just his true authentic self. It is so obvious that this is his true authentic self and that there are people out there trans activists that are calling him childish and despicable. I mean, I have no words. I have no words for that sort of hatred and bigotry. And it is in particular one transgender resident from his town named Charlize Jamieson who said, quote, his words not only embarrass himself, but you, the county council. This is shocking, Charlize, especially you as a transgender resident, you know, burn it than anybody, that if you feel it, therefore it is. So maybe Charlize, you're thinking you were born a man, but you feel like a woman or maybe it's the opposite. Maybe you're born a woman and you feel like a man. Well, my dear Ryan Webb here was born a white male, but he feels, he feels that his soul, what he identifies with is a black lesbian, sorry, an Indian American lesbian, a person of color and a lesbian. And it's shocking that you find that to be embarrassing. It almost feels like perhaps your existence is embarrassing. And that's why you don't like the fact that Ryan Webb is holding up a mirror to your very own ideas. Either everybody can identify with what they want to identify it with, no matter how ridiculous it sounds to you, if they feel it, therefore it is, or it's all a farce and there is such a thing as objective reality. And you should identify with what your actual biological parts are because that's all you're ever going to be. I'm not sure, I'm not sure, but I'm certainly glad that Ryan Webb exists. And for those of you that are wondering, yes, he is joking. I'm assuming he is joking because he has thanked the Daily Wire and he has thanked Matt Walsh for his support and he has also said that every person should watch What Is A Woman? By Matt Walsh and the Daily Wire. And I tend to agree with that statement. All right, guys, moving on to some good news, shocking news though, because I don't know. He's the kiss co-founder Paul Stanley. He's 71 years old and it's shocking that there is actually someone from Hollywood that is standing up to things that are horribly backwards. And he has done so on his Instagram page. He slammed parents who are confusing their children about gender identity and I'm going to read you that post in its entirety again. This is the co-founder of Kiss. So not exactly someone that you would think is going to preach people about morality, but he has found this line where he is just like, guys, what are we doing? That might be a performer. What we're doing here in society and the focus on children is very dangerous. So he entitled the post, My Thoughts on What I'm Seeing. There is a big difference between teaching acceptance and normalizing and even encouraging participation in a lifestyle that confuses young children into questioning their sexual identification as though some sort of game. And then parents in some cases allow it. There are individuals who as adults may decide reassignment is their needed choice. But turning this into a game or parents normalizing it as some sort of natural alternative or believing that because a little boy likes to play dress up in his sister's clothes or a girl and her brothers, we should lead them to steps further down a path that's far from the innocence of what they are doing. With many children who have no real sense of sexuality or sexual experiences caught up in the quote unquote fun of using pronouns and saying what they identify as, some adults mistakenly confuse teaching acceptance with normalizing and encouraging a situation that has been a struggle for those truly affected and have turned it into a sad and dangerous bad. The most mature words ever spoken is exactly a fad. It's something that's reminiscent. It's almost as if kids, you know, growing up, you always want to do the thing that you're not allowed to do, right? This is why 13 year olds when I was in middle school were smoking cigarettes, right? You want to try the cigarette. You want to cut class. You want to see how you can break the rules because you're trying to stand out and you're not a fully formed individual. So this is just one way that you can experiment with who you are. Well, if cigarettes were on the table, when I was growing up, it's something that you could try today. Gender is on the table. And what's problematic is that rather than recognizing this as a growing pain or a random expression or a child, a cry for help or wanting to fit in or wanting to stand out, parents are saying, this is real, taking them to doctors and starting them on a path that is in fact irreversible. So I'm just going to have to say kudos to him for taking a stance. And I guess it's easier. We're seeing a lot of this actually, Paul Stanley, 71 years old, as I mentioned before, but we're seeing a lot of this in the older generation of Hollywood and maybe it's because they have less to lose and they already have their careers established. It's the younger people in Hollywood that seem to be embracing this demonic, these demonic trends. And it's because they think that it will buy them a seat at the table, which is unfortunate. Obviously, people in the comments, hold them, you don't understand the difference between gender and sexuality and you're conflating it. No, he's not. He knows what child abuse is. And it is child abuse to force children down a path that they do not even understand the full ram, full ramfications for. And those are my final thoughts on that. All right, guys, let's play a game who said this sentence. It's not going to be hard for you to guess. I'm going to give you the sentence and you think of three names of who could have possibly said this. Ready? Quote, you cannot sell black folks, big Macs, and give us little justice. Let me give you that quote again. You cannot sell black folks, big Macs, and give us little justice. I'm saying big Macs and little Justin. You're not going to get who said this, guys, who could have said something? I saw this and I started laughing out loud. You cannot sell black folks, big Macs, and give us little justice. You're warming up. I hear your, I hear your guesses. You guys are shot in all sorts of things at me. You're like, oh, is it Patrice colors? You're close. You're close. Give it to me. Ben Crump. Oh my gosh, you're warming up your hot, but the person who does it better than all of them will forever be Al Sharpton. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he actually uttered that phrase. It's amazing. He's old. He's old man, but he is still shaking down corporations. He knows where his bread is buttered, and now he is threatening to protest McDonald's over racial discrimination. He has put the fast food chain on notice, ladies and gentlemen, because you know what? I was thinking the same thing this morning. You cannot sell us black folk, big Macs, with little justice. He's really fired up, guys. Okay. He's really fired up. He even sent the letter to the McDonald's CEO. Chris Kemp-Sinski on Thursday, urging the company to acknowledge complaints of racism in its employment, advertising, and franchising practices. He says, we find it appalling and inexcusable that McDonald's corporation has not satisfied its differences with the black community. There are lawsuits that have been brought by black franchises. Another brought by a black former executive of racial discrimination from the highest level. Oh, guys, it's bad. He's very upset. I don't know what about really because it never really makes sense. He just keeps saying racist, racist, racist. He demands that they acknowledge and address the issues because, I mean, I don't know how many times I can tell you guys, you just, you can't keep doing this. You can't keep selling us black folks, these big Macs, with little justice. It ain't going to work. I think I'm team Al Sharpton on this. I don't know. I don't know, guys, but he's upset again. All right, guys. We have a little time left, so let's get to some of your comments. Last week I covered the conjoined twins. I told you about my bizarre fascination with twins. And you guys had a lot of comments. You were similarly, I was just mind blown by the story because one of the conjoined twins was in a committed relationship and the other one wasn't. They spoke about how they had this alone time. So I don't know the whole story. I'm just mind blown. MD writes that twin communication thing is real. My mom has a twin sister and their bond is special. My mom once fell on her arm and it broke. And literally the next day my aunt, her twin broke the same side. And she said, oh, it was so weird. It is. Twins are totally very interesting. I don't want to call them weird because it feels derogatory to say weird, but they have a connection that obviously regular siblings do not experience that connection. And you hear all sorts of these really odd stories, odd even sounds derogatory. But I would say special. Like they're special stories that they have this special connection. And it's super interesting. Ricky writes twins. I actually have some familiarity with a particular case where a pair of identical female twins got a job with a manufacturing business as a secretary. But what happened is one of the twins got hired, but both of them covered the job. They pretended to be one person and they pulled it off. Nobody realized it at all until they were tired and both of them showed up to the retirement bash. They really both wanted part time jobs, but couldn't get one that paid as well. It was a huge shock to the people that have worked with them who I worked with and for. I don't know how they sorted out the details and how they dealt with the obvious issues. But super interesting. I know if I was a twin, I would definitely do stuff like this. Like I would like send my twin to class. See if anybody, how could you not come on? It's like basic fun. Obviously, if you have an identical twin, you're going to have to experiment with actually playing the part of your twin in various circumstances. You should send them with your friends. You should definitely send them to your class, make them take a test for you. I'm totally okay with that. And by the way, I'm sure there's going to be tons of parents twins that are saying can't just don't give this bad advice to my children. But I think I have to. I'm sorry. This is how I feel. I think twins should have fun once in a blue moon. So, Halo writes, I've dated an identical twin before and they looked extremely alike. But I could easily tell them apart but broke up with him because it started to freak me out a bit. The concept of twins is really an insane phenomena of our human existence. Also clouds put me in a state of all like I can't believe we act normal with something so incredibly beautiful above us. I digress. It's interesting. Yeah, there are also such things that are a phenomena. And when you actually spend time to think about twins, you do kind of get freaked out because that's an interesting one. You're dating someone and they have an identical twin and you're in love with this person. And then you go and you're like, oh my God, this is his identical twin brother. Are you not in love with him? Why aren't you in love with him? You don't love the other half of your husband? Horrible. Oh, you do love him? Oh, that's weird. Oh, you love his brother. There's no way to win. So I get it. It's weird. It's just totally bizarre. Also, by the way, one of you guys had mentioned the fact that the twins talks about their alone time and how they went on their devices. And you said that it was really kind of a sad commentary on society that even people that share a body are able to ignore each other because of their devices. And I thought that was a really deep way of looking at it, that we do have a problem in our society. I mean, I'm glad that they're able to get their alone time, but it just showed you how distracting technology is and how we're able to even completely ignore somebody when we share the same body as them, as was a circumstance with those two individuals. All right, guys, that is all the time that we have for today. I have lots of exclusive content coming up on Daily Wire Plus.
