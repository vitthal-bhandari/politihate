Great to have you with me much to discuss on this Columbus day or as the left is desperately trying to rename it Indigenous Peoples Day. But no, no, it is. It is Columbus Day. That's why we have this holiday. You got Fauci giving the green light to going Halloween trick or treating. Oh, thank you, Fauci. You've got thousands of flights canceled notably by Southwest Airlines and they're trying to tell you that it's because of the weather, not the vaccine sickouts that are going on. People are saying they're not showing up almost like they're lying to you about what's causing these display disruptions and delays. And why is there so much more shoplifting now than ever before? What's going on in places? Gavin Newsom's wokeness frenzy in California. We got that and more coming up for you here a racked and stacked show on the bucks accident show.

Got to go check them out. I'm telling you and love it. Make sure you use that promo code bucks so people know where they heard about this or where the my pillows are coming from so to speak. So today we have Columbus Day. I'll get into that in a moment. But first, something very strange happened over the weekend, something that I think would be very unsettling for a lot of folks. We saw in real time how all of a sudden the government will decide or different corporations will decide that they don't need to tell you the truth. They'll just lie to you. And that's no big deal. They'll just lie to you and you say, why would they do that? Well, because of the narrative because of their need to protect certain things. And this is what's going on Southwest Airlines canceled 28% of its scheduled flights of the weekend, blaming the woes on air traffic control issues and weather. And I've got to say, this is not true because people have access. Thanks to the internet. People have access to the weather. And they can see that there wasn't actually a problem in Florida. A lot of these other areas where there were huge flight, not just delays, but cancellations. And this is what you take away from it. Lying to the American people about the cause of a major worker strike that has crippled an airline seems very Soviet, doesn't it? It certainly seems like this is something that you would have expected in Proveda. And in fact, Proveda would probably be proud of this level of propaganda. So what's really happening here? Well, you have the airlines that are now deciding to institute these vaccine mandates. You get the shot or you get fired. You get the shot or you're gone. Now, for some people, this is a career they've had for decades, right? Pilots trained for a long time, been flying for many, many years. They're going to lose everything because, remember, there's no, there's no proof of antibodies or what you must get the shot or else. The shot that only lasts six months, by the way, before it's effectively just like a flu shot, which is kind of a take it if you want it. But who cares? That's the reality that they don't want to talk about that. They don't talk to you about that right now because that would undermine the narrative. But you have the first really meaningful pushback going on here. The first time that I can think of where people got together and said, we are willing to take direct action to borrow a term from the left against this tyranny. And this is going to really bite at the economy over time. This is going to cause major problems if this continues. And I got to say, I'm all for it. Finally, it seems finally, we're in a moment in time here, where they, the left have gone too far. And now enough Americans are realizing it that they're starting to worry. The left is starting to worry about their next steps. How much further can they go? What else can they get away with? Because remember, up until this point, they've gotten away with everything up until this point, there's nothing they have not been able to do that they've wanted to do. It's just a question of how quickly they rolled it out. They do not hold back. They do not stop themselves because of concern that they may actually get pushback that will really rock their worlds. No, well, that may be changing. So we shall see if these pilots, airline attendants, airline crews, or, you know, people that work on the engineers and maintenance crews and the rest of it, if they all decide they're going to keep doing this, because they can bring the airlines to their knees, they can. That's what's possible here. And remember the ultimate sanction that is expected or the ultimate option, I should say, that's expected to get everyone to get the shot is to mandate it for people to be able to fly. I mean, Dr. Wen on CNN is always talking about it. Fauci has mentioned it. That's what they're hoping to do. And I want to tell you this now, I want to go on the record about this as well. Because I think it is important that we can show how well we can tell where they're going to be going. If breakthrough cases become too common and possibly too severe to hide or obscure in the data this winter, I can tell you right now, the Fauciite fallback will be that boosters were needed that they must therefore be mandatory. And also not enough people listen to Fauci when it came to masks. Remember, the Fauciites are delusional, but predictable. They are very predictable. And you get Dr. Fauci, for example, talking here with CNN is his favorite news Alec, because he's a lib and he wants the lib elites and the power class of the Democrats to be big fans of his. And he wants to be one of them and among them and a useful tool for them, he's on CNN and he's asked, Hey, when can we get rid of masks indoors? Here's what he says. How long do you think it will be until it's safe for vaccinated people to once again be indoors with that a mask? It's always tough to predict that. I think if we continue to go down in the cases that we're seeing right now and more and more people get vaccinated as the dynamics of the outbreak, namely the amount of virus circulating in the community goes down. I hope we'll be able to pull back on some of those restrictions to get closer to what we really feel is normal in the community. I hope that's soon, but I can't give a prediction of a date on that. I hope it's soon, but I can't predict, but maybe it will, but maybe it won't. But who knows? Yes, no, maybe so. The fact that anybody thinks they should still be wearing masks indoors just goes to show you the level of control and the effectiveness of the propaganda that has been out there for the Fauciettes all along. This is complete madness. I mean, this is, this is crazy. What's going on here really is. He's saying maybe at some point, when cases come down, at some point, I'm not wearing masks indoors. Why would I do that? This is crazy. You know, at some point, it's just too absurd even for your halfway Fauciettes. The people that aren't the true believers, but you know, they're Fauciites on Christmas and Easter. You know, they only go a couple of times a year. You know what I mean? Those folks are starting to see this and say, mmm, something's going on here with this guy. We're going to go through another winter of masking. Why masks? It doesn't work, folks. It doesn't work. I mean, I know we're not allowed to say this, but they'll say, Oh, but yes, it does. And the point is some study with a 2% reduction in cases that has all kinds of flaws, all kinds of variables that aren't accounted for in the study that could have resulted in either just the statistical difference or would have been involved in actually determining the transmission level, but they don't even account for it. But this is now the this is now where we are. It was, Oh, it'll reduce cases 80%, 60%, something like that's, that's all crazy. It's just not true. We all see that. But Fauci's not going to give it up. He's not going to let it go. But I've got the good news for you. Because I like to bring you good news as often as I can here that not only do you have the Southwest Airlines pushback really gaining steam and people are starting to recognize who want to just continue with the control, the control forcing things on you, forcing things in you. I mean, I just had a conversation with a family member of the weekend who's at that age where he should, I was talking to my own dad about whether he should get the booster. I said, well, I was a huge proponent of him getting vaccinated. And I think that he should probably get the booster as well. He's 73 years old. He's got some, he's in good health, but you know, he's he's got some additional risk factors. And so of course, I'm not I'm on anti vaccine, never been anti vaccine. And in as a general proposition, I've been vaccinated probably more than 99% of the people that are listening to this right now, because when I was in the CIA, they sent me to sub Saharan Africa, and they sent me to really nasty spots in the Middle East, and they sent me to places where I had to get all kinds of shots and vaccinations. And I didn't question it. I said, okay, I gotta, I gotta go serve my country. And if that means I'm going to a place where I have to be worried about yellow fever or some kind of encephalitis or whatever, like I'll give me the shot. I don't want to die. Right. So I've been vaccinated a ton. I was a pin cushion, the CIA for a number of years. So I'm not anti vaccine at all, but I am anti mandate very strongly. And I'm worried about how aggressive and how insane these losers are out there who are the good if we don't even know if we do this. No, they're just wrong. You're wrong. You couldn't stop the virus. Now society has to keep functioning. People have to go about their lives. Basically, everybody's going to come into contact with this virus at some point. Just a question I have. They should have told us out at the beginning, but no, oh, if we cover your mouth and if you use the Lysol and if you did, no, it's not true. It's not true. But you see the state and the people in charge of the big estate don't want to admit their uselessness because that also affects their power. They want to continue to be in charge. They don't want to tell you, Oh, well, we're not able to help you. So every man for himself, absolutely not. Instead, they say, just listen to us and we'll make everything so much better. We will fix everything if you just give us all the control that we demand over your life. Come back in a second into the Columbus Day situation here. When running a business, HR issues can kill you.

So they have a Biden administration, the first ever official press release or whatever they're calling it, the first president to issue a proclamation, a presidential proclamation for Indigenous Peoples Day. Here's what it says, for generations, federal policies systematically saw to assimilate and displace native peoples and eradicate native cultures. Today, we recognize Indigenous Peoples resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact they have made on every aspect of American society. In a separate proclamation on Columbus Day, Biden praised the role of Italian Americans, the US society, but also referenced the violence at harm Columbus and other explorers of the age brought about on America. Today, we also acknowledge he writes the order his staff does. The painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and Indigenous communities is a measure of our great blah blah blah. Okay, so Biden wants to have it both ways. He wants to do this thing where they play Kate and they pander to the left by acting like it's not a bizarre thing to try to transform Columbus Day into Indigenous Peoples Day. Why not have its own holiday? Well, because you'd be sitting there saying, all right, well, what are we celebrating the contributions of Indigenous people today in America and American society? Because great, that's great, fine. Celebrate that. Let's talk about it. Have some tribal ceremonies or whatever. That's great. We're celebrating the accomplishments of Indigenous Peoples 500 years ago. Okay, like what? I'm just wondering, what are we celebrating? They seem to lack specifics. Are we memorializing the the genocide? Is that what's going on here? Well, why are we doing that on Columbus? That you can't have it both ways, folks. Democrats try Biden tries because Biden is ultimately a tool of the left and his whole purpose is to provide a familiar. Oh gosh, he's from Delaware. He's from Scranton in Pennsylvania. You could trust Joe Biden. All that stuff. You know that he'll do what the left wants him to do. So he is really just a transition figure further and further away from a traditional unified America into a leftist socialist increasingly communist. There's a communist vibe among a lot of Democrats these days, a totalitarian authoritarian vibe that's coming out of their proclamations on COVID and a whole bunch of things. The way they talk about climate change, this extreme obsession with equity. I mean, they used to say they just want an equal opportunity. And then of course they went beyond that. It's never enough. What they say they want is never what they really want. They always want the next thing. The next thing, the next thing, they can never just allow things to be. They can allow things to play out, whether it's the free market or it's about equal access to colleges or whatever it may be. Once they get equality under the law, then they want inequality under the law favoring certain groups. They actually want unequal, don't you see? Because if you are treated differently than somebody else and you are more skilled, you are more intelligent, you are harder working, you have a better resume, you have, you know, whatever, maybe you run faster if we're talking about sports or you jump higher. If you are treated worse than someone else in a competitive field because of that person's ethnicity or gender or whatever, that is actually inequality. That is inequality under the law. So what do they change to? Equity. Equity meaning they want the same ends for people. We are all, there's a radical equality that doesn't force. It's just not true though. It's not real. It's not representative of actual human beings and the world we live in. And in fact, if anything, what you see is the people that demand equality always want themselves to be treated as more equal than always want to be in a position of power and authority where they don't have to live by the rules that they demand for everybody else. So this is something that plays out in every aspect of our society these days with the left, but it's also one that you see here where, okay, what are we celebrating with Indigenous people's day exactly? I mean, we would know more about what we might be celebrating 500 years ago if Indigenous peoples in this country in general had written language, but they didn't. I'm sure they'll find those. Oh, they're, but what about this? Okay, there are a couple of exceptions of some form of, but in general, there was no written language. And for anybody who challenges that, okay, give me Shakespeare's writing plays in the 16th century in the in England. Okay, so where where are the great Native American? Where's the, where's the Native American? Iliad? Where's the Native American Odyssey? Where's the Native American? Beowulf? I mean, you know, just give me some of this stuff. I'm happy to celebrate. Great. So let's talk about it. And I'm sure that it's all, but somebody has a story or something and by the way, I'm not even saying something doesn't exist. I'm just saying, okay, well, let's let's be specific about it. It's tough to celebrate something when you're not even really clear on what you're celebrating. What are we celebrating with Columbus? Well, he's pretty straightforward guy connected Europe to the new world, which was in enormously consequential moment in history. It was a brave thing to do. It was, it ushered in a whole new era for the entire world, really. So it's a pretty big deal. I think we all understand that. It's a pretty big deal. And people say, Oh, but it was already discovered by the native people's. Well, you know, the native peoples had gotten on a ship and gotten to Europe. We'd be celebrating that voyage, but they didn't see. But this is where we also get into the notion of radical equality or equity always in at all points in time means that it feels to some like we celebrate, say the achievements of Columbus and Western Europeans in this period in a way that, you know, that tremendously outshines the celebration of native peoples in America in the 15th and 16th century. Let's just say, and to that, I'll just say, okay, what do you want to celebrate? Let's talk about it. What is the great achievement? What is the great scientific or literature or whatever the achievement is? I'm, by the way, I'm entirely open. I just want to hear what it is. Let's get into specifics. I mean, I'll wait. I'm sure, oh, I'm sure there's some, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the Euro coordination had had the many tribes and whatever. Okay, well, let's, but let's talk about that then. Instead, though, they keep it very vague because you all understand what's actually going on here. You understand the situation of the radical equity obsession that they have. So that's how I feel about Columbus Day. There's a ton of shoplifting that's going on, and people are starting to realize the realities of this in their own community. I mean, I have a, a drugstore that is on my corner, and basically every product you want to buy, you have in a plastic locked case and you have to press the little button and then a very, you know, tired, annoyed. By the way, I agree, they should be annoying because it's annoying. They come down, they say, is this what you want? You say, no, no, the one below that and they goes, this what you want. You go, no, it's kind of behind that in the case. You have the whole thing. We all go through this. And if you ask them to say, it's because they're being stolen from constantly, constantly. And it's because prosecutors have made a decision in major cities like Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, and bail reforms have gone into effect in places like New York, where you steal something. You're out the same day. It doesn't even matter if you steal a pretty, you know, valuable or large amount of stuff. You're out the same day and you're not going to get prosecuted. Well, how many times can you steal before you actually get caught? I mean, how many thousands of dollars of stuff can you manage to take from a business where business is before you finally get caught? You're only remember, the shop lifter is only going to be assessed for what they have in that one instance of the stealing. And so if they get away with it, if there's no charges brought there, if they're not even held, there's not an appearance before a judge, they're just let go right away, which is what happens. It's pretty easy calculation, isn't it? It's pretty straightforward. So that's a major, a major problem. It's playing. It's a decision that's been made. It is a decision that has been been made by people who are social justice warriors, that they think that it's unfair. The people being arrested for shoplifting in a lot of cities, it's unfair that they're being arrested, even though they're stealing, but they still think of it as unfair the social justice warriors. That's the reality of this. And so they won't enforce the law. They want to enforce the law very strictly against you. They want to unleash the IRS on you to take more money from you and more stuff from you, but they don't want the law to be enforced when it comes to shoplifting. You got to ask yourself, what the heck's going on here? I said all that. And then there's Gavin Newsom. I got to say, out in California, it's amazing to see what this guy they've banned leaf blowers that and lawnmowers that run on gas, all kinds of woke, woke stuff going on out there. They've banned, what else? Oh, there needs to be a gender neutral aisle now. So you've got gender neutral toys in these big box stores because they don't want people to be upset, whatever. It's so stupid. It's so ridiculous. But California, the wokeness, it just makes people's lives more annoying, more expensive, all because of there's just an obsession with virtue signaling. I mean, a lot of this comes from the rejection of God and the embrace of a truly toxic narcissism, which is so common among leftists. They just love themselves. It's all about them. How do I look? What does this look like for me on social media? And they think they're doing it for the benefit of society. That's, of course, where the virtue signaling comes in. But, and this is the, this is some of the dumbest stuff I've ever seen. I mean, you can have pink and traditional blue and pink toys and toothbrushes are now banned in California stores because they want to believe that gender is a construct that is reinforced. They don't want to accept that gender is a real thing. In fact, if you spend some time as I have reading about the research that has been done in recent years, really in recent decades on biochemistry and the role that it has in people's decision making in their lives, there is an active woke effort to pretend that testosterone, which is the single most important biochemical mark or difference between men and women testosterone levels. Men have some message and women have some testosterone. We have about, I'm not a few or a host at CNN, but we have about 10 times the testosterone of women. I mean, Brian Seltzer does not, but a lot of people generally males will have 10 to even 20 times the testosterone of women. It makes enormous differences in behavior in muscles and muscle in size and all these different factors. And yet they pretend that it's no, it's all just because of social stereotypes and what's reinforced by the environment. That's not true. But even scientists, I'm telling you are pressured to try to reject this stuff. They're insane. And they're social justice warriors and labcoats pretending that what they're doing is rooted in the actual scientific method. That's going to be our Columbus Day show everybody Columbus Day. That's right. Please go out, celebrate, celebrate by reading a little bit about the incredible voyage, learning about this period, the great European explorers. It was fascinating time in our history. I'm going to leave it there for right now back with you tomorrow. Shield tie. Okay, round two. Name something that's not boring. Laundry? Oh, a book club.

We'll talk to the biggest names and politics news entertainment and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton podcast network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeartRadio app, podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Are you concerned about equality and fair treatment for African Americans? Do you believe in a future where our communities are safe from both crime and over policing? President Biden's administration is making major decisions and we need your voice to be heard. The proposed ban on menthol cigarettes is in its final stages of approval and black and brown law enforcement executives have said it could have dire unintended consequences for African Americans. The clock is ticking. Call President Biden at 202-456-1414 and ask him to stop this proposed menthol rule. The ban on menthol could lead to an illicit market and increase crime in our communities. Call President Biden and demand that he halt the ban on menthol until there's a review of the investigative findings. Let's make sure that over policing and racial profiling come to an end. Call President Biden at 202-456-1414. Tell him to stop targeting African Americans with a menthol ban. Time is running out. This message is paid for by lines for fair and equitable policy."
