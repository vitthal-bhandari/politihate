    "text": " Our next guest is former Special Envoy to the Middle East under President Trump in his new book, Jason Greenblatt takes readers inside the White House for some of the Trump administration's biggest diplomacy triumphs, including the signing of the Abraham Accords, author of the Path of Abraham, how Donald Trump made peace in the Middle East, and how to stop Joe Biden from unmaking it, Jason Greenblatt joins us now. Welcome to Rising. Pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. Yeah, we're so happy to have you talk to us about the book and how important it was, you know, from your perspective for this agreement, the Abraham agreement, to be reached. Well, the book was intended to sort of shatter the myths about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and try to give the Biden administration some advice, in particular about the Iran deal, which they don't seem to be heating if news reports are accurate. So I think it's a particularly timely book right now, and it does take people into the behind the scenes without any kind of gossip or backstabbing, but the road that led to the Abraham Accords, which is only continuing to help stabilize the Middle East. And what do you think Biden is doing wrong right now? The kind of subtitle of the book suggests that the Biden administration is threatening or putting in jeopardy what the Trump administration achieved. Can you tell us more about that? Yeah, I mean, he's basically making well of our allies once again, as they did with the Obama administration, very, very uncomfortable, very nervous. They're now trying to figure out how to ally themselves with others, including China, and even Iran, you see ambassadors being given again back to Iran and from Iran to the region. So the region is extraordinarily nervous right now. Nobody knows what to expect when people believe that the Biden administration is abandoning the region by signing the deal with Iran, or potentially signing the deal with Iran. Jason, when I remember hearing about the Abraham Accords, it was very bittersweet on the one hand. It seemed like such an incredible achievement. On the other hand, talking to dear friends, Palestinians living in the West Bank, living in Gaza, it was there was something about it that signaled that they were now no longer sort of on the table in the same way as a barrier to peace between Israel and these other countries. Talk to me about that from your point of view. I know that you too have done a lot of advocacy and a lot of diplomacy in those communities as well. Talk to me about what you would say to Palestinians looking at the Abraham Accords as something that sort of puts them on the back burner. Well, I wish they weren't on the back burner. They should be on the front burner. What the Abraham Accords did was remove a veto card. The Palestinian leadership, and let's remember this too, is leadership in Ramallah and they are terrorist leaders in Gaza. They are not willing to negotiate in any way, shape, or form in good faith in a realistic manner with Israel. So they took themselves off the table, if you will. And I wish that weren't the case. But what the Abraham Accords did do was prevent them from allowing Israel to make peace with its Arab neighbors. They did make peace twice before. Now they make peace several more times. But the people who could gain the most from the Abraham Accords are actually the Palestinians if they'd only come to the table in good faith. We pulled out of the Iran deal. I would argue that itself being a destabilizing move that makes some kind of conflict more likely. And we did that, not Iran, the Biden administration trying to get back to some kind of understanding with Iran. Do you disagree with that perspective? Why should we have gotten out of the Iran deal? What was the reason for doing so? Sure, I do disagree with the perspective. Because what the original Iran deal did was give Iran a fortune of money, which they then used rather than help their people to foment terrorism, to throw missiles and rockets at the UAE, at Saudi Arabia, Israel, all sorts of mischief and bad acts and murder-aschings. In terms of the nuclear part of it, which of course is the most existential threat to the region, and even potentially to the United States, it didn't stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It simply held off for a creative time. Once that deal expired, Iran was actually free to develop nuclear weapons. So the new deal apparently will do the same. Many argue that it's even weaker and shorter. I don't know because none of us really know what's in there. But what it does is it puts our head in the sand, pretends the problem isn't there, and hope for the best. And then we have to tell our kids when there is a problem, well, we did our best to delay things, but now it's your problem. But didn't pulling out of the deal, there's no delaying that they can go back to. Because we did that. If the concern is they might in the future be able to or decide to develop nuclear weapons anyway, I mean, we took that out of the future and we just made it potentially now. Well, what we do need is a plan B. Nobody seems to have come up with a plan B. It's a fair point. But signing up for a deal that makes no sense is not an excuse for taking a United Stand against a regime that wants to murder people around it, destroy Israel, take over Saturn, maybe the UAE and others. So you're right, it's not a perfect situation. But at the same time, we don't have unity of opinion on this. And that makes it harder to put pressure on the Iranian regime. Do you see the Abraham Accords as a cause or a symptom of this kind of realignment that we're now seeing in the Middle East? And where do you see America's role in that going forward? I see it as both a cause and a symptom. And I think America can play a tremendous role if it stood by our allies, if it didn't disrespect Saudi Arabia, although I think President Biden has started to turn the corner on that. I hope he continues to turn in a big way. But I think America could play a very strong role encouraging our friends and allies to work together against terrorism, against the Iranian regime. At the same time, I think that the region could actually join together even without American leadership. I don't think that they need America now that the train has left the station in terms of the Iran deal. Sorry. Isn't Saudi Arabia a sponsor of terrorism and violence and all sorts of things just as like Iran is? So I find it interesting that you say we should have a kind of more confrontational relationship with Iran, but not with Saudi Arabia. It seems like both are up to no good in a lot of ways. Well, Saudi Arabia is not threatening any of its neighbors. Saudi Arabia is not a terror sponsor state. Saudi Arabia is actually making tremendous strides. I mean, we could talk about the past or we could talk about the future. The future of Saudi Arabia, I think, is extraordinarily bright. You know, President Trump very, very well, you've worked with him for 23 years, I believe, is the number. You know, in so many ways, he sort of took an axe to the status quo, to the kind of understanding, you know, of the expert class about so many foreign policy issues. Where did that come from? Where did his view of what was possible in terms of foreign relations come from? So he took a view. I mean, a business like you. If we can make progress, we're going to make progress. So we can't make progress. We're not going to waste time simply speaking diplomatic speak. And that's the view and the approach that we took. We were respectful. We were diplomatic. But we were also pragmatic. And we said, whether it was to the Palestinians or Israel or Arab neighbors, Israel's Arab neighbors and our allies, look, we're here to make progress. Either you're going to help us make progress. So we have lots of other things to do around the world. And we're going to move on to the other things to do. So help us make progress or not. It's your choice. That's the approach of Trump. He's a very pragmatic business person. He knows he had a limited amount of time in the White House, whether it was four years or eight years. And he wanted to make progress. So on the topic of President Trump, I wonder if we can ask you, we're sort of a few days out from the affidavit, the heavily redacted affidavit that justified the raid on Mar-a-Lago being released. I wonder if you can tell us anything, if you're comfortable telling us anything about Trump's character that would shed light on, you know, how big of a security risk this pose, what the likelihood is that he took things that would have endangered America's security home with him tomorrow. Logo, is there any light you can shed on this from your experience knowing him so well? Sure. So we still don't know a lot of facts. It was heavily redacted, as you say. The Donald Trump that I know that I worked for for 23 years is a smart guy. I don't think he would have taken anything that would have endangered people, at least not knowingly. So I'm still sitting back trying to see, you know, I'm reading everything, trying to understand what we're talking about. But until we get more facts, I really don't know, and it's hard to take any kind of opinion. But no, I don't think he would have taken anything intentionally that would have, I guess, the two accusations are that would have harmed Americans or spies or informants across the world. And some are even accusing him of taking it in order to enrich himself to those sound, not like the Donald Trump that I know. I want to push back one more time on the Saudi Arabia thing, just because I think it's an important difference between our perspective. You know, there's the Jamal Khashoggi, there's the airstrikes in Yemen, it killed thousands of people, alleged to be noncombatant civilian targets, hospitals, etc. I mean, that looks to me like a relationship with a country that is involved in a lot of violence and a lot of bad stuff. So again, I don't know why it's, it should be, it seems hypocritical to be like letting them off the hook as Biden now is doing, he's, you know, wants to beg Saudi Arabia for the oil, I guess we're not producing here. But to excuse what Saudi Arabia is doing and then to be, but I draw a hard line against Iran, again, doesn't make a lot of sense from where I'm sitting. Yeah, well, I agree with your characterization that he's begging Saudi Arabia for the oil that maybe I would say should be producing here. But the two examples, you know, Yemen, Yemen, the Houthi rebels were really their terrorists have been attacking Saudi Arabia. So, Saudi Arabia is defending itself, it's defending its citizens. It's the obligation of any country to defend itself and its citizens. No different than when Hamas terrorizes Israel. As far as Jamal Khashoggi, you know, it's hot. Yes, he took responsibility for what was a heinous act. It was a really just absolutely horrific act. We don't know with certainty. We know what the CIA says that there's a high degree of likelihood that he ordered it. He said it happened under his watch and we could forever judge Saudi Arabia by that event, or we could also see where Saudi Arabia is going, the direction that it's going, and recognize that it's a very, very important strategic ally in the region. I don't think it's fair to continue to judge a country through the Jamal Khashoggi lens forever. Well, so just continuing this point, one more for just another minute. Why is it that if Iran is saying it wants that same dealmaker treatment that President Trump was able to bring to so many of these other conflicts with such success, why not extend that to them? Why should there be a hard line there as opposed to other places? Because the deal that Iran is proposing, and again, we don't know similar to what's happening with the Mar-Laga rate. We don't really know what's going on behind closed doors, but by all accounts, what the deal would be would simply allow Iran to create a nuclear weapon in several years. That's not really a smart deal. The deals that Trump was interested in making were smart deals, long-term deals, deals that made sense for everybody involved. The deal that Iran seemingly is proposing is something that makes sense for it. And yes, to Robbie's point, it makes sense for us for a short period of time, and I'll rather than say a short period of time. It makes sense today, but it won't make sense in several years from now. It certainly won't make sense when more missiles are flying, whether from Lebanon to Israel, Gaza to Israel, Yemen to Saudi Arabia, Yemen to the UAE or the UN. Well, Jason Greenblatt, we so appreciate you joining us. Again, the book is in the path of Abraham, how Donald Trump made peace in the Middle East, and how to stop Joe Biden from unmaking it. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you for having me. And we'll be back with more rising right after this. The US is currently in a friendship recession. That's sad, with men being the focus. According to a study from the Survey Center on American Life, the percentage of men with at least six close friends fell by half between 1990 and 2021. Reasons for this phenomenon include 52% of American men ages 18 to 29, still living at home with their parents, working longer hours, switching jobs more frequently, and individuals are going into a physical office less than before. According to our next guest, Aubrey Hirsch. A further study by the Survey Center on American Life noted that men are 79% less likely to receive emotional support, with studies showing a specific link between suicide and loneliness in men and a greater fear of intimacy. Here to speak with us on the subject is writer, illustrator, and author Aubrey Hirsch. Welcome Aubrey. Thanks for having me. All right. So what do you attribute this to? There's been a lot of conversation about COVID and lockdowns and the ways that that's changed our society, but it seems like this phenomenon has predated all of that. Yeah, there's definitely been a line trending downward for the last like 30 years in terms of, um, men's ability to make and maintain close friendships. When you hit on a couple of the reasons in your introduction, you know, people are working longer hours. They're switching jobs more often, um, and going into the office less and all of those things make it more challenging to create friendships and also to have time for friendships outside of work. Also, people are living with their parents longer, uh, which offers them emotional support in in the form of their parents. So they're less likely to go out and find it with their peers. And also it makes the less room and space to, you know, have parties, have friends over, have just your own private life, things like that. People are also getting married later, but I also found in my research, I think a lot of this has to do with the way that we socialize boys into men. Um, we teach men that their vulnerabilities are a bad thing, that they should hide or request their emotions. You know, we don't celebrate their connections. We celebrate their fortitude or, you know, what looks like strength from the outside. Instead of focusing on those things that, you know, vulnerability is really the most important thing when you're building connections and building relationships with people. So I think we're also doing men in disservice when we bring them up and it makes it harder for them to connect when they're older. But isn't that, uh, I know exactly what you're talking about, but isn't that kind of tendency weakening a little bit over time? It seemed like I don't know, men of my generation and certainly the next generation more feel far more, you know, liberated to openly discuss feelings or emotional connections or all that. Like that really had, I mean, not just men, women, everyone has gotten more open about talking about their mental well-being, etc. You know, seeking therapy, all those things, which I would think might foster, um, greater on a, maybe not great, but greater than previously connections between men. So I'm a little bit surprised that if the trajectory seems to be away from close male friendships. Yeah, I was surprised too, because that that's also sort of my impression, but it's possible some of that is just our own experience or the people that we prefer to surround ourselves with, you know, maybe don't necessarily have these ideas of traditional masculinity. Oh, also, sorry, there's also some really interesting thinking out there that men's idea of an ideal woman has shifted really dramatically in the last 30 years. Like it's no longer everybody's looking for a kind of like quiet, compliant, you know, homemaker. People are interested in women in leadership positions, you know, they accept women at colleges and universities, women in power. But the idea of what an ideal man looks like has not really shifted as much in that time. You know, we still look at men as kind of the same way. I have some thoughts and feelings. Well, speaking of kind of, um, dating expectations and the effect that are kind of, um, intimate relationship expectations of on genders are men and women are affecting this, I'm curious about the effect of online dating, generally speaking, because I definitely have observed people kind of relying on the ease with which you can access kind of short-term partners and relationships online. Um, as a substitute for keeping in touch with friends who are often now further away than they used to, people are very mobile for their careers. The friends that you met in college might not end up in the same state as you. You don't end up in the same state as your parents. And there is a way that if you want to be occupied on a weekend, you can hop on an app and be occupied with someone that is ultimately probably going to be a much shorter term presence in your life than a friend. What do you make of that? Yeah, that's really interesting. I didn't look at any research that talked about the effect of online dating on this phenomenon specifically, but I definitely did look at a fair amount of research that talked about, uh, women as tending to do things together kind of face to face or like, you know, interfacing together, talking to each other, even if it's on the phone or via Zoom. Whereas men tend to do things shoulder to shoulder, you know, sitting together and watching sports together, going on hikes, you know, doing kind of physical things. So I mean, that would certainly kind of go along with what you're saying about how if someone's not physically there, it's maybe more challenging for men to make those connections. But a significant way that men interact with each other now in a social, uh, manner is video games are a much, much larger point, uh, part of the male experience than they have been historically video games have gotten really good, really compelling, very narrative, very statistically, very technologically sophisticated. I play a lot of video games. I don't play a lot of video games that are, you know, interactive that are online with other people, but a lot of guys I know do and they're collaborative and social and, you know, friendly competition usually, not always, but, uh, that would be a dynamic I would point to as a friendship building thing. But maybe I guess maybe dudes don't, don't, wouldn't, don't, uh, label their video game buddies as like close friends, even though what they have is kind of a close friendship. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, that's certainly possible. I think again, that's a great example of that kind of shoulder to shoulder activity that, you know, men are doing together. But it doesn't necessarily lend itself to some of the things that popped up in my research, like talking about a personal problem or offering or receiving emotional support, you know, telling a friend that you love them. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. You would have to tell me, but how much is happening during the video game play about it. Love you, man. I love you, pwned. It is, it is difficult to maintain relationships, I think, for everyone. And you point to the fact that this is a broader trend that's not exclusive to men. And I think that, you know, there is a kind of an unspoken amount of labor that goes into coordinating times to get together, scheduling times for phone calls, doing all of that, especially if people get older and families and kids come into the mix. And I wonder, you know, what, if anything, people have thought about it in terms of trying to improve upon this issue, if we do think it's an issue that's, um, leading to, you know, suicidal deviation and unhappiness more broadly, what's there to be done? Yeah. Well, you know, the sort of secret sauce to making lasting friendships is vulnerability. So it's kind of being able to get in touch with yourself to question what you've been told is important, you know, to question what values you've been told are important for you to have. And then think about which ones are serving you and which ones aren't. And if there's things that are keeping you from building these friendships, because you feel like you need to, you know, stoic or show emotional fortitude, you can make a choice to get rid of that. You can just remove that ideal from your brain. And instead you can choose to be vulnerable and make connections, you know, reach out to your friends, make it a priority in your life. Um, you know, all of those things are important. Mm. Robert, do you think that that's, that's what's coming between to the sense that there's any issue and keeping friends over the years? Do you think it's, it's your lack of vulnerability among men? That's the issue. I mean, it's, I guess my experience is just very different. I mean, I live in a city. I live in a liberal city. I do actually go to the most of my friends are I'm very close with my coworkers at both of my offices. I'm married. So my wife and I have a lot of couple friends. So I guess I'm just not in the life situation that this increasing pool of young men find themselves. Like I, if you have six friends, name them right now. I don't know if they picked up. No, I'm in a group thread of guys who I, but I guess we don't, do we talk about emotionally vulnerable stuff? This is getting very personal. I have a healthy number of friends, but again, I, I go into the office. I'm in a city. I see people a lot. If you just live at home, if you're not married or in a long-term relationship, if you live with your parents, if you're not going out because of the pandemic, sure, I could see how, how you find yourself in a situation where you have, where you would describe yourself as having few close male friends, which is a, which is a bad thing. Yeah. And I do think not to gender stereotype, but I have some executive functioning issues where I find it to be very stressful, the administration of getting people together. And, you know, there are studies that show that men tend to do less of that kind of administrative social work, whether it's, you know, housework or making doctors appointments for kids and things like that. And I do wonder if the bar, if the bar for men, a threshold for men of engaging in those kind of activities that are required to maintain relationships is so much higher. If that's just the first thing that's going to fall on the wayside when you get overwhelmed, which again, I think is very understandable, but might be about kind of the difficulty of getting together and finding time and increasingly packed lives more than kind of the emotional failures of the less fair. Do men have more, more feme? I probably not, right? More female friends? That's why they have fewer male friends. I mean, it's, I, again, in my situation, right, we have a lot of couple friends, a lot of our social activities, our mixed gender social activities. Yeah, the women are, the women are doing some planning, sounds like. Yeah, and men who have female friends were more likely to have received emotional support from a friend in the last week and also more likely to have had a friend tell them that they love them. Then men who have only male friends. Well, look, you've given us a lot to talk about and think about Aubrey. I'm sure we're going to keep this conversation going after this segment wrap. So we appreciate you spending this time with us today. I want to see the group chat. No, you do not. All right, we'll have more rising after that. We went to Brianna. We'll have more rising right after this. The state of Rhode Island is tackling the rent crisis through a new $10 million private program that will use COVID-19 stimulus money to build mixed income public housing. As reported by Ricardo Gomez and the lever, the pilot program is just one part of the state's Create Homes Act, which would use $300 million of American Rescue Plan Act funds to create a new state housing department, realigning public spending with the public good. Joining us now to expand on that is fellow at the lever Ricardo Gomez. Welcome to rising. Hi, thank you for having me. Ricardo, help us understand what the experience of the housing crisis is right now. More broadly, specifically in Rhode Island. What are renters up against? Well, the situation in Rhode Island is much like many places. Rents are on the rise and there's not a whole lot of relief. This is for a number of reasons, which is A, that any new housing units that are being built are being built at market rate. Landlords are increasing prices without consultation. Responses, there's been a rise in tenant rights organizing, tenant unionization, but at the same time, landlords in Rhode Island have also been forming basically lobbying groups to combat those efforts. Yeah, this is, I don't know, I think I would say that this is a very similar experience that people are facing in a lot of different places. All right, well, how does creating a new housing department help alleviate this problem? Well, so over the last couple of decades, the primary program for building affordable housing has been the low income housing tax credit program, which largely is private developers tax tax credits. So it incentivizes housing developers who are seeking profits to build housing. What the public developer program would do is equip the state to take over land planning, land acquisition, and the actual building of housing units. This would mean that the way that we're organizing collectively to build housing is not motivated by profits or by private developers seeking to get public resources. But instead, it's for the goal of simply creating housing. So creating this public developer program, getting it off the ground through the pilot program is a step of creating like one coordinated system of creating housing for the public that isn't motivated or driven by profits, but for addressing a very basic need, which is the need for housing. Well, can you help me understand why it is the federal housing program, the LIHC, the low income housing tax credit program is so susceptible to these private developer interests, but the state level program won't be? Yeah, well, I would say with the LIHTCs, there's a fundamental misalignment of public spending and public good. I mentioned that in my piece. Basically, there's very little oversight of these actors. The housing that they do build, which is supposed to be affordable, has expires like over 30 years. Any affordable housing that they build will basically convert back into market housing. The difference is that under a public developer model, the housing won't have expirability. Affordability will be, you know, there will be more oversight about what is actually considered affordable would be geared towards workforce housing. By definition, like the LIHC program is set out to incentivize people who are looking for profits, right? The public developer program is sort of made more democratic by allowing a public entity, which, you know, is subject to the interests of people to oversee the building of the housing, rather than letting private actors regulate things and drive things. It seems kind of wild that this federal program would have these obvious flaws in it. If expirability is the issue, why is that the case? If there are not the right incentives and conditions put on building that are actually motivating more low-income housing to be built as opposed to the for-profit higher income or profitable housing, why is that not built in the federal program? You know, is it lobbying interest? Is it, you know, what has there not been a lot of public scrutiny about the LIHC model? Yeah, maybe. I mean, definitely public scrutiny, but also there are a lot of money. There are a lot of people getting a lot of money from this program. You know, there were investigations done recently that saw that the program is rife with corruption. People take money that is supposedly going to be going to developing housing and will spend it on on dinners with clients. The whole program, when you have a program that is oriented around letting private actors who are seeking profits determine something as basic as housing, like there are just some fundamental problems there. And, you know, this goes back to in the 30s and 40s when the federal government was initially expanding things like the like HUD building public housing that shifted in the 70s and the neoliberal period to giving more control over housing to these private actors building the housing. So, I don't know, that shift is really important. The lack of oversight is really important, but also just like the fundamental alignment of interest, which is they're seeking profits, not housing. I don't know that that. I don't know about the situation in Rhode Island specifically, but in other places where there is not enough housing, a large or affordable housing, a large contributor to that problem is just that there's not enough housing in general, often because of zoning, local actors who oppose new development, regardless of, you know, what if it's going to be affordable or not. An expansion of the housing supply would drive down prices even if the new developments aren't specifically designated for affordable housing. Sometimes some aspect of them are affordable. Is there any, is there, Rhode Island is a very small set at the local level, are there, are there, you know, zoning actors and historical preservation boards, that kind of thing standing in the way of having more housing? Well, something to respond to this, I think an important part of breaking down the public developer model is that it would, it would let the state or at the municipal level to sort of coordinate the zoning laws that you're talking about. There are a lot of, like the developers have a lot of interest in making sure that those zoning laws aren't designated to actually building affordable housing. In Rhode Island in particular, as people have been, have tenants have been organizing against rents, bikes, against evictions, as I was saying earlier, different groups from mom and pop landlords to bigger developers also coordinate their lobbying interests to sort of prevent the changing of these zoning laws. I guess I would focus on talking about how the public developer program allows all of these sorts of rules to be brought under the purview of one public entity. So under the public developer, there would be tools for the state to review, for example, zoning and save vacancies of properties and either require places to provide a plan for the usage of this land or to put the land up for sale to the state of Rhode Island. So there's a sort of mechanism there or tools to sort of address this question that you're bringing up about zoning or about where affordable housing can be built. And it sort of all folded in into what the public developer program would do, which is to sort of efficiently build housing and taking control or at least having more say in the matter of zoning is a big step to that. In addition, having a public developer, having the government step in would mean that the government wouldn't necessarily be held hostage to public developers who are refraining from investing and building housing. They can step in and sort of drive that process. I'm seeing the claim that Rhode Island has produced the least new housing supply per capita of any state in the country. Seems like a substantial part of the problem. Ricardo Gomez, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. We'll have more rising right after this. Well, Chicago billionaire gave the largest known political donation to a political advocacy group in history worth $1.6 billion. According to new reporting from the lever, 90 year old Barr A. Side gave the massive sum to a nonprofit run by Leonard Leo, who co-chairs the conservative legal group, the Federalist Society. Andrew Perez joins us now to discuss further. Andrew, welcome to rising. Thank you. Thanks for having me. So Leonard Leo gave this don't. Leonard Leo's group actually put out a release, I think is the case of announcing this donation. We're not just relying on reports. This is publicly. We know that the sum is $1.6 billion. It's not straight to FedSock. It's to another group that Leo started, right? Yeah, yeah. So the $1.6 billion is reflected in the first tax return released by this new group from Leonard Leo called the Marble Freedom Trust. We've been working on this story, the lever team in ProPublica for quite a while, looking at some documents that we were given showing the transaction detailing how this money went from this Chicago billionaire Berry Side to the Marble Freedom Trust and how they sort of gamed the tax code to maximize the the most amount of money here. So Berry Side actually donated his entire company, this company called Triplet, this electronics and surge protector manufacturer. He donated the entire company, put it into this trust, which then sold the company for $1.6 billion. And by handling it that way, it helped him avoid probably up to $400 million in taxes and it maximized the amount of money that's now at the disposal of Leonard Leo. And so I want to get to the substance of all this in a second, but I'm fascinated by the reporting process as well. Did they hear footsteps? Did they know that you were about to publish? Did you go to them for comment? And then all of a sudden, they announced it publicly? Or how did all this unfold? We honestly do not know what happened. We just know the New York Times had a story. It sounded like they had heard from some people in the Leo orbit. So yeah, we woke up to that Monday and we decided it was time to also race our story out as well. So the federal society is probably the most well known of the groups that Leo operates and there's Sheldon Whitehouse likes to get out his board and do the sort of Charlie Day, you know, the conspiracy theory thing, the Pepe Silva thing. But what do we know about Marble Freedom Trust? Now that it has $1.6 billion, that's an incredible sum of money. And what do we know about what Leo's plans for that particular group are? Are they to provide grants to other different organizations? Are they going to be doing their own types of initiatives? What's Marble Freedom Trust up to? Yeah, yeah. So I think, you know, what we've seen from the tax return is it's helping finance Leo's kind of existing network already. And so I would expect the money to be passed around both within his network and outside it. You know, they now kind of have the money to really expand his conservative vision here. You know, so obviously, I guess I should say that Leo was Trump's judicial advisor, played a key role in selecting and making or determining the current makeup of the Supreme Court, you know, and designing it to overturn abortion rights. I believe that this is sort of an effort to expand their reach. And you know, the thing about this kind of money is, you know, you can spend it over time if they're smart with it, they can really just kind of spend it over time and, you know, maybe not even tap into the kind of original principle if they invest right. And Emily, I want to ask you more of this because, like, who's Leonard Leo? And like, what are they going to do with this money? Like, and were you surprised? You're like, wow, this is a lot of money. Yeah. And this can transform what they do. Or you're like, well, they already have a ton of money. And this will just make them a little bit more supercharged. This is a truly incredible sum of money. And I'm sure Andrew can speak to that too, covering this sort of thing. I mean, I sort of work in the conservative movement, I work for conservative movement group part time. Similarly named, but not connected. Oh, the federalist. Yeah, I also work for Young Americans Foundation's National Journalism Center part time. And Leonard Leo is a really well respected man in the conservative movement, been around for years. And on the heels of the Trump administration, getting three justices confirmed, it's not entirely surprising that he's where a huge sum of money is going because that, you know, if you're in the conservative sort of donor circles, I imagine is a huge selling point. Look at what I can do with the funding. Right. Yeah. So, but, but 1.6 billion. And Andrew, we can toss this one to you. What you like just talked to us about where that some stands in sort of average political donations or not political like donations to groups like this, which I imagine is a C3 or C4 on both the right and the left, because it's true. There are huge funders of particular causes on the left as well. Absolutely no question about it, even to dark money groups. But 1.6 billion is a pretty unbelievable sum. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so as best we can tell to date, Leo's kind of existing network, not counting the federalist society, had raised about $460 million since 2005, which is again, not a small sum, but you know, this is nearly four times that. And then, you know, how it compares kind of within the within the kind of liberal and conservative movements, the closest comparisons would be, you know, there was like this 1.5 billion dollar donation to a George Soros group called the Fund for Policy Reform. More recently, there was a 1.2 billion dollar donation to a nonprofit that's run by Chase Koch, who's Charles Koch's son. And you know, so this, you know, exceeds those. Clearly, Barry Sy didn't have that level of money, but he did manage the package's entire company into, you know, the biggest one time donation that we've ever seen. Yeah. It's a windfall just a staggering amount of money. And, and maybe Emily would be able to answer this too. But so once he's successfully overturned Roe v Wade and then he's taking abortion rights back to the states where it will be fought over there, is this money then going to flood into state legislative races somehow? So that Republicans can then pick up state legislatures and then they can ban abortion, you know, in places that haven't banned it yet. Is that, is that the vision or what, what's your sense of where this is headed? Well, so, you know, the LEO network has been the biggest kind of long term financier of the Republican Attorney's General Association. I would assume that you would see some of this flood into those races. You know, they've also been active in state Supreme Court races in the past. They have funded the Republican Governor's Association a bit. They have donated some to the Republican State Leadership Committee. I do think you're going to see more some state level spending from LEO affiliated groups. I mean, you know, we saw some of that in the Kansas abortion fight. One of those groups that was attempting to overturn Kansan's sort of constitutional right to an abortion is this group called Catholic vote. They've they've long been, you know, tied to the LEO network. They haven't gotten a ton of money from them in the past, but you know, they did drop $500,000 into this super PAC run by former Kansas Congressman Tim Hule-Scamp that they're they're the group that actually sent those text messages to every single Kansan. So like these really misleading text messages trying to get out the get out the vote there around the abortion measure. It's interesting because when Dobbs came to the court and there's that waiting period, a lot of people on the right were actually very anxious that the sort of Fed Sock approved judges were not going to be the right people to overturn Roe and that they would flake basically. And so there was some sort of skepticism. I think of the Federalist Society crowd at that point and Leonard LEO at that point, obviously those peers turned out to not be entirely well placed on the right, but all that is to say, Andrew, another element of this, perfectly legal, but you can probably explain how this donation was structured in a way to minimize any taxes that would be owed. From my understanding, everything that was done was just within the tax code, but within the tax code when you have lawyers who can help you stay within the tax code. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the transaction here is pretty incredible. So by putting this company into a nonprofit, SIDE was able to avoid 400 million in taxes, we believe up to that amount. That money then got to because this is a tax exempt group, it all just stayed with the nonprofit. There was no tax on the sale here. And you know that for a fact too, because the company was sold for $1.6 billion, and that's how much money went into the Marble Freedom Trust. Great. $400 million subsidy for the Federalist Society, basically. Wonderful. Well, a lot more than that. Yeah. I mean, these groups are, it's a very multifaceted kind of network. There's a lot of groups doing different things. We're spreading the tax dollars around. We're spreading a lot all over the right wing network. Wonderful. It's so nice about how generous of the American people. Give some to the vast left wing conspiracy next time, Barry. Andrew, thank you so much for your time and for your reporting. Thank you. Appreciate it. We'll be back with more rising right after this. A CNN seeks to reinvent itself amidst flatlining ratings. Viewers unhappy with the network's rebrand voiced their dissatisfaction this week, causing the hashtag boycott CNN to trend on Twitter. One jaded CNN viewer tweeted, quote, good morning to everyone who agrees that if CNN has consciously decided to push Republican positions, it's time to boycott CNN. I'm watching MSNBC exclusively now. Joining us now, away in on the networks growing pains is host of the Katie Helper Show and co-host of Usual Idiots podcast, Katie Helper. Welcome. Hi, welcome. And that of course was Brooklyn dad defiant who is a paid the compensated. What's the what's the non offensive term for troll? Chill bot. Chill. That was Russian commentator. Were you here directly from Russia itself there? To tell me that. As the Russia show? Yes. Yeah. But what what do he work for some DNC affiliated organization? That was an interesting so that's an interesting one to he's a prolific tweeter. And that's part of what makes a posture of this. So all of us the Brooklyn dad. I have seen this one. It's yeah, aggressively, resistency. Yes. Anti- so cringe like it's enjoyable and entertaining. Yeah, major major left punching. Not really good of a chick paying child support either. Okay. Well, look, this is the first flag in his Twitter bio, the Ukraine flag. Not surprised. To a table. Okay. This is so interesting for people who see the left as a monolith to understand the posture here because in some ways CNN is being pushed to the left by people who are only maybe marginally to the left of the coverage that's being offered there from our perspective. People who think of MSNBC as the height of what should be progressive coverage, you know, working class coverage in the United States of America. You know, so how should people who are, I think, more sincerely invested in having more representative coverage? How should we approach this? Is this a boon for the left or ultimately just a call for CNN to go back into the same silo that MSNBC is in? Yeah, I mean, I think it's an interesting example of how once again, the terms left and right can be kind of limiting and what does the left mean. But just for context, in terms of what happened specifically here, so CNN was bought out by Discovery, which is now Warner Brothers Discovery and Discovery's leading individual shareholder and board member is John Malone, who's a libertarian. He is a Trump donor. He is a Fox News fan. And he actually said, in an interview, he said, I would like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing. Fox News, in my opinion, has followed an interesting trajectory of trying to have news news. I mean, some actual journalism embedded in a program schedule of all opinions. So that's the new ownership, basically, right now. Discovery CEO is David Zasloff. And he has said that he wants CNN to be different from quote unquote advocacy networks. Now CNN's new president, Chris Licht, told the staff, his staff to stop using the term the big lie to describe Trump's lie that the election was stolen. And the New York Times reported that Licht told staff he wanted to book more Republicans and conservatives on political shows to offer a wider range of viewpoints. Note, by the way, it's not that he wants to actually book any actual progressives, but that's another point. The AP reported that Licht made it known internally. He's not interested in conflict between CNN and Fox News on the network. And the CNN New Day anchor, Breonic Taylor, had attracted attention for detailed critical pieces on Fox, but they have stopped since Licht took over. So this all kind of came to a head for a couple of reasons. But one of the big things that happened is that Brian Stelter and his show Reliable Sources was canceled. And then the ratings weren't that great, but they were actually better than other shows on the network. So it probably was not about the ratings. And this is something that there's a good op-ed in the Guardian by Robert Reich, which says some stuff that I don't agree with all of it, but I agree with some of it. And he points out that this wasn't a commercial decision. And Stelter was, to be fair, he was frequently critical of Fox. He also was critical of CNN. He did really, and there moved to out Zucker, who was the president before Licht. And he really glowed, raved about Zucker. It was a little weird, talked about how Zucker would like go to war for people and had it with a big heat shield. But anyway, he wrote in his newsletter that Malone's comments about Fox, quote, stoked fears that discovery might stifle CNN journalists and sear away from calling out indecency and injustice. And he said, the people who say that the Zucker era CNN was lacking in real journalism clearly were not watching CNN directly. My best guess is that they were watching talking heads and reading columnists complaining, columnists complained about CNN. And yes, I'm including John Malone in this. So he was, you know, I mean, that was a little risky. And I admire that he said that and that he was critical of the people who were basically the new bosses of the network. And he was critical of Trump. And he was critical of CNN. But he also, we should be clear, was not a very critical and general voice. He was, you know, he pushed Russia gate, he was pro war. He was, you know, very much supportive of the Biden administration. Now, I do think that this new leadership of CNN is means that the network is moving even more to the right. But we should also acknowledge that CNN has a pretty disgraceful recent history. Ironically, they played a huge role in promoting Trump with tons of free airtime. There are these famous examples of pathetic examples of CNN cutting from a Bernie speech to be fair. So do other networks, but they cut from a Bernie speech to go to Trump's open empty podium. He wasn't there, but they want to make sure they were there before he got there, I guess. They also, instead of CNN, instead of broadcasting a Hillary Clinton speech on unions, they were at Trump's empty podium. And Trump himself said, I get better press from CNN than I do Fox. Now, there are other examples of CNN being egregiously unethical, as we probably know. Donna Brazil, who worked at CNN regular, gave the Clinton campaign debate questions ahead of time. They was very bad anti-Bernie bias. There was even a protest called Occupy CNN because it was so terrible. And so now we have this boycott, CNN hashtag that's gone kind of viral. But what's interesting is that a lot of people are pledging their like undying loyalty to MSNBC. And MSNBC, ironically, for people who came to be left, MSNBC has basically created an RNC to MSNBC pipeline, right? So who do you have at MSNBC? You have Joe Scarborough, who is a host who is a Republican congressman. You have Nicole Wallace, who is the White House Communications Director for George W. Bush. She was also an advisor for the John McCain campaign. Regular guests include Iraq War architects like Bill Wright, Crystal David from McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt is on regular Jennifer Rubin, who is like a reactionary Islamophobe, whose column at the post is called, Right Turn. So what these people have in common with these are some these are some not terrific, sort of people. Yeah, Jennifer Rubin is the most widely mocked opinion writer on planet Earth. Right. The Washington Washington Post conservative, but her stuff, like she is more effusively praising of the Biden administration than like, like the Biden press secretary. It's just every one of her column says, another beautiful brilliant move by our perfect president. It's it's truly, it's truly incredible stuff. And obviously, and then Steve Schmidt, you know, compromised by the the Lincoln project grift all that something serially rewarded on on MSNBC primarily. I think they're more on MSNBC anywhere else. And what this speaks to is that this isn't about left, right, it's about how much you actually and actively hate Trump. I mean, that's a metric that's relevant, but it's not the only metric. And this is the thing that like, growing all these people together. And you know, Jennifer Rubin is someone who called like Obama racist, you know, very was very anti abortion, and a very vitriolic, very vitriolic in her in her descriptions of Barack Obama. So it's interesting. But basically, what this comes down to is that MSNBC likes CNN. All of these places, they suffer from a really pro war bias and a really corporate bias and MSNBC fired Phil Donahue because he was critical of the Iraq war, even though he was doing great in ratings. They told Jesse Ventura, who they were going to have a show with that he couldn't criticize the Iraq war. So he didn't do the show. They fired Ed Schultz, who is one of the people who actually talked to Bernie Sanders. They were notorious in their anti-Bernie bias. And this boycott, what this does is it kind of white washes, I think, the rest of corporate media, because I don't think, I think it's right to point out the kind of creeping right wing as them of CNN. But it's also important to say that this attempt to be fair and balanced and centered, the center is not the center of the country. It's the center of the beltway, right? Or it's the center of Wall Street. And it's a center, I think there's a center sometimes on balance, but there's different, like there's a social and kind of cultural left or progressive viewpoint that is very well, you know, very well represented on MSNBC and to some extent, CNN, because of the kind of cultural circles of the people who are on it, which is not at all the same as an economic left or a foreign policy left. Right, exactly. I understand that these are different things, because I've been in conversation with you guys all the time, but that's something that others on the right kind of may think, oh yeah, it's so far left. It's a well, it's left in an Elizabeth Warren Center, but it's left in a cultural center. It's not left at all on foreign policy, and it's not actually left in the way that a lot of working class people care about. Right, it's not economically left. It's not economically even centrist, I would say, and it's not foreign policy left. It's not foreign policy centrist. And that is the danger of this thing, is that making it look like CNN is exceptionally right wing really obfuscates the way that the alleged center is distorted, and we can't have the center be a place where you have like, you know, Joe Scarborough yucking it up with Mayor Eric Adams. And I think this actually, this out of touchness and this kind of overall socially progressive and on cultural issues, which I think is good, but while totally being blind to the way that Americans are suffering, and people in other countries are suffering because of our farm policy, people are suffering here and abroad because of our farm policy and economic policies, that kind of out of touchness and that kind of like chummy cocktail circleness is really a beltway insider approach to the news and corporate media that is so alien to people, I think makes the conditions for another Trump. I actually, even though I obviously support, you know, most of the kind of cultural social agenda on those kinds of shows, I do think that really emphasizing those kinds of things at the same time that you demonstrate a real indifference to populist economic issues, to anti interventionism, to a lot of these, I think bedrock left issues causes people to think you're uncredible and then resent the interest that are being represented by the cultural, the cultural conversation and feeling like, well, it's a zero sub game, obviously you couldn't possibly care about my issues of all you want to do is talk about, you know, black people or gay people or whatever it is and it ends up actually hurting the interest of historically marginalized groups, but that's a whole other thing. Because they're presenting those things as mutually exclusive as opposed to the same struggle and instead of presenting like really what we're seeing is not identity politics, it's the weaponization of identity politics and these people pretend that things like economic justice are not racial justice issues, obviously they are and they are, as you're saying, they're creating a false dichotomy and this is really dangerous because it alienates people and we are creating more potential Trump supporters. So that's my, but CNN, if you want to make your show better and less right wing or you want to have more diversity, they're people you could hire. I mean, I'm, I have my own shows, but I'm also willing to take on more. I'm located, I'm located in New York City, you don't have to pay to put me up or any travel or anything. So yeah, Katie Helper is available CNN. Everybody co-op the hashtag and say hi, Katie Helper. Katie, thank you guys always for joining us here on the Hill. Thanks for having me. And we'll have more rising for you after this. In late 2020 and early 2021 at what was then the height of the pandemic, friend of the show Maximilian Alvarez conducted a series of intimate interviews with workers of all stripes from all around the United States. Those conversations documented in Max's new book, The Work of Living, Working People Talk About Their Lives in the Year The World Broke painted deeply human history of one of the defining events of the 21st century told by the people who lived it. Friend of the show and editor in chief of the Real News Network, Max Alvarez joins us now to discuss. Welcome back to Rising. Thanks so much for having me guys. Yeah, we're happy to have you. And Ryan and I were co-hosting the show. We talked to you a little bit about this book, but we only got just this deep into it. So let's pick up that conversation. The audience can definitely go check out the first video. Tell us another story of the kind of person you interviewed for this book. Yeah, I mean, again, thank you so much for having me on to talk about it the first time and this time. And I apologize to everyone that that first time that we talked about it, I gave a lot of like discussion about the motivation of the book, but I didn't get to focus on the meat of the book, which is the workers, right? The workers stories. I'm like a broken record every time I'm on this show or another show. I always say, don't listen to me, listen to the workers, right? So if you buy this book, which I hope that you do, I hope that people read it, you will find interviews with 10 different workers from around the country working in different types of industries coming from different walks of life and all of whom experience in different ways, the onset of COVID-19. And I really wanted to try to have these interviews like the ones that I do on my podcast, Working People, right? And the focus of that has always been on the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of our fellow workers. And because I want people to understand that there's so much more to working people than just a name tag or a job title, right? There's so much history and heart there. And you see that in these interviews. I speak to Nick, a grave digger in New Jersey who talks about his experience burying people in the first months of COVID-19 and how the number of burials exploded by like a factor of three. And he describes what it was like to work in that environment, what it was like to navigate the grief of other families, the fear that he had of contracting this virus. But also, you know, he's a human being, he talks about the skepticism that he had about the media. And you know, it's reporting on COVID-19. I wanted all of that raw human stuff to make it in the book. And I think that if you read these stories, you see first, you know, again, just just how deep and complex and beautiful and valuable every single human life is. But on top of that, you realize how much hard work it took to keep society afloat during COVID-19 pandemic when, you know, the other systems that we had entrusted to take care of us were in fact, failing us, whether that was the unemployment system that had been hollowed out and crut and like buckled in the early days of COVID-19, whether that was, you know, a PPP program that just basically ended up being bosses, stealing a bunch of money from taxpayers and not paying, you know, workers to stay on the payroll like they were supposed to, whether that be companies like Amazon, making a marketing ploy out of calling their workers heroes and granting them hero pay and then suddenly ripping that away just weeks later, even though workers continued to work and die in those warehouses, right? You really get, I think, a ground level sense of what working people went through during this horrific time. But you also see just how heroic people are on an everyday level, how much love and care it took from our neighbors and our coworkers and family members to keep this from being worse than it actually was. People brought food to each other. People found ways to be in connection with each other even if it was virtually, right? We found so many ways to take care of each other because ultimately we are all we have and I think that that really comes through in the book. You see, like I said, all of the essential labor that people do on a day-to-day basis to keep society afloat and I just want people to always remember that and to carry that lesson forward into the future. Yeah Max, it's been a really interesting week because there's been a discussion about working people in some ways whether or not they benefit from this newest policy from Joe Biden and the student debt cancellation. And there's a lot of jockeying as there is many political contexts to speak for working people and I think all of us, myself included, could do a lot better to have people from different kinds of economic backgrounds in particular, interviewed directly on these kinds of shows. I know that I personally am so grateful for having a call-in show where I do get to talk to people outside of my own bubble on a at least bi-weekly basis. But I wonder what you make of some of the tenor of the conversations that you've had where a lot of people, all of us who are, many of us who are in this situation where we're able to be newscasters and journalists and speak for others and write about others aren't necessarily from the milia that we are representing. And I wonder when you're talking to people and they're telling you in an apolitical way about their experiences and what they want without the the gloss that comes with news coverage, how do you reconcile how they're being presented in the media and how they're seeing themselves and to what extent do the kind of typical political frames that we all work with end up emerging as you're trying to elicit these stories. It's a great question and you know it is a difficult task right and I guess I would just say up front that you know like you know media personalities and journalists are not inherently bad. We need you know journalists doing this work. We need folks like... I'm gonna stop you there Max. I was about to pay you both a compliment. Like we all have a role to play. Some of the workers that I interviewed watch this show and they told me that they read like when I reached out to them they were like oh I know you I watch rising right so there is you know important stuff there but I would say for all of us as I've been beating this drum you know for years now you know it is not our place to ventriloquize working people it is our responsibility to lift up the voices and struggles of working people by letting them speak for themselves. I said this on your show Brie and I was very grateful to have the opportunity to do so. My editorial strategy whether it was when I was an editor at the Chronicle of Higher Education now editor in chief at the Real News Network or host of my podcast Working People or now author of this book. My editorial strategy and my editorial duty is let the rabble in let people speak for themselves give people the opportunity to hear directly from their fellow workers about what they're going through how they're making sense of the world around them and I think that you know a lot of people in the media don't want to do that because they know in fact that like their own agenda might be upended if working people are actually let in the room and given the opportunity to refute their BS talking points and I think that one of the things that I'm really proud of in this book is that I do give people the space to say their piece right. I don't try to steer people you know like into a political territory that I think that they need to be in there a lot of views expressed by the workers I talked to that I don't personally agree with but that wasn't the point of the book the point of the book was to capture them and their lives and their impressions and so you know I am gonna constantly be on this crusade to get outlets to have working people right op-eds interview working people for longer than just a two-minute sound bite because again there is so much more to us and I will also doggedly pursue and berate other pundits who feel that they have been deputized to speak for working people without actually giving working people the chance to speak for themselves and like you said Brie that was very apparent as we were discussing the student debt cancellation thing I think a lot of pundits were telling on themselves and showing that in fact they don't know a whole lot of workers because they were saying oh no working person has student debt it's all elites who go to like ivy covered campuses man I worked at you know as a temp in a warehouse 10 years ago in southern california I had a lot of student debt from one of those ivy covered campuses the university of chicago as a first generation uh a student to to attend that along with my siblings and when I was at that warehouse I didn't want to talk about my debt because I thought that that was the case that I was the only one who had it then over smoke breaks I realized that I was working alongside a lot of people who had also accrued a lot of debt because they'd been taken advantage of by predatory programs at devry, itt tech and all of these for-profit kind of programs that that have screwed people it it just again if you if you were out there honestly saying that you know we shouldn't cancel debt because it actually doesn't you know working people don't hold that debt yes they do and you would know that if you actually just talk to people all right well thank you max I really always very sincerely appreciate your insights wherever you give them and I look forward to reading your new book thanks guys here it is the work of living

gals thanks max thank you social media users are reporting that ebay is locking the accounts of users who sell over six hundred dollars worth of products until they submit their social security number for irs reporting the notice on ebay reads as of january 1st 2022 the irs now requires us to file and send a 1099k form to everyone who sells six hundred dollars or more please update your information so we can start sending your payouts and avoid other account restrictions according to the new york post only four percent of the agency's 80 billion dollars in new funding will go to customer service despite their pledge to use the cash to quote help taxpayers according to the washington post the bigger scandal is that right wing threats against agents have been mounting the post reports that the irs has launched a full security review post reporter jacob bo boge writes quote the attacks on the irs other agencies and federal employees make sense if delegitimizing government is the point meanwhile post columnist dana millbank for the opinion section says questioning the agency is part of the rights fascism problem quote violent anti-government rhetoric from party leaders targets the fbi the justice department and the s irs as a systemic campaign of disinformation makes their supporters feel victimized by shadowy elites it's a very bad and lazy column um yeah for targeting how dare we criticize the fbi the justice department the irs we were criticized we were criticizing the fbi in our a block today because there's a lot of sketchy stuff regarding how they handled the hundred biting pro let's be a little bit specific though because i do think that obviously all of these organizations any government organization otherwise has a mixed record and is subject to critique i think part of the concern that people have and i want to know what you think about this is about the kind of rhetoric that's come out of the right that really emphasizes the minority of irs agents that carry firearms and really uh implies that there are going to be raids kind of fbi style raids on the homes of american citizens and that american citizens should in effect arm up and start targeting fbi agents the way we've already seen fbi our agents targets since the marlago incident fine i i didn't think the right there was some suggestion that they're going to be armed irs agents to me that was not the concerning thing about the new news i i generally don't freak out when people have guns i like people should be allowed to have guns i'm i'm not a gun control supporter as we talked about and other context so that didn't trigger me the way it triggered some people i i take your point on that the right the scary thing about the iris is not that they're going to shoot you they're they're going to make your life more difficult by tying you up in more procedures or they're going to make it harder for people who who earn a living doing a kate you know not i just work a nine to five job but i make my income maybe i i do ride share sometimes maybe i make soft and sell it on e-b maybe i do all these various things and the concern is the iris is adding a lot of muscle it's saying it's adding muscle so can really get those rich sons of sons of a gun who can you know screw people who don't pay their fair share of the taxes but as we've seen previously so much easier for the iris to go after you to make it your life more difficult that's complicated robbie like i know it's a chicken and egg problem sympathetic to that argument i and then when we first started talking about it on the show you know you can go back and listen i was very sympathetic to that but i also think we have to reckon with the the numbers that we have and the statistics that we have which are the best thing that i think we can do to predict what's going to happen with the uh increased funding and the funding increases that are being proposed or that have been passed in the uh inflation reduction act are literally returning the iris to the numbers that it had 10 years ago and when you look back to what the iris did 10 years ago it did much much more i forget that the actual percentage number but overwhelmingly more enforcement among elites and holding them accountable for their taxes and they do now and part of the argument that's being made by the iris now is that they focus on lower income cases because those are easier cases rich people have lawyers it's protracted litigation they have accountants they know how to hide their money and cover their tracks and it requires more resources to do so i mean what do you make of that so there's two arguments i want to toss you away see what you make of them so one one thing i've heard all right that i've heard of the libertarian people make is that regardless of how much iris enforcement you have or what you or how you tinker change the whatever you're doing the government basically collects about 19 percent of gdp in taxes no matter what we do and and that's basically all they can they can that's all the money they can ring out of people how can you say no matter what we do and we've seen well historically there's not been a massive swing and how much money there has been a meaningful change and what the iris has been able to collect especially from rich people over the just the last 10 years depending on how much how well they're funded the other thing would be so my argument would be we need to we clearly need to make the tax code simpler i had your because it is so confusing and it's more confusing the the fact that it's confusing rather impacts that people with less financial means more because wealthy people can afford tax attorneys to to legally not pay their time i mean there it's yes it's not they're not all committing crime they're doing things that are perfectly legal yeah and they spend their money to lobby to make sure that we don't simplify the tax with the government knows how much you owe every month that's how they do every every year i can't they just tell us they can just tell us but they very rich people spend a lot of money to make sure that that doesn't happen and all of the banks and tax preparers also spend a lot of money lobbying to make sure that their services don't become obsolete yeah so this this is the problem it is a huge problem i mean i'm a privileged person you're probably like this too though if you have freelance income if you have a variety of income sources which a lot of you know journalists and media figures do it starts to get darn complicated this is the first year that i'm going to really have to be dealing with that i'm not looking forward to it it's an absolute mess right so i think we're an agreement on that that there there are some tinkering happening here around the edges that is uh you know eluding the bigger problem here and that i think that it leads in both parties don't really want to reckon with that i do think we have to take a little bit of a wait and see approach to see what happens with the staffing up of iris agents if it is true that they come after little people like folks spending 600 on ebay and don't go after the big dogs i will be right there with you objecting and we should keep an eye on this and it happened accountability but i also think we have to deal with this this is from um representative andrew clide um from georgia this month on the house floor he says think about it if the left will weaponize the fbi to raid president trump's personal residence they will surely weaponize the irs's new 87 000 agents many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force to go after any american citizen you know uh rick scott uh chairman of the national senatorial committee uh says um iris hires will need to be ready to uh uh uh uh sorry the irs's words sorry the irs needs to be ready to ought to investigate your fellow hardworking americans your neighbors and your friend you need to be ready and to use the irs words willing to kill them i mean this is the kind of rhetoric that the the article is pushing back on and whatever i think about how the irs could be weaponized against poor people is this an issue that we have representatives talking in these violent terms about members of american citizens and and people who work for the government okay yes the right wing rhetoric from a lot of republicans has gotten totally out of control i find it i find it off putting in weird i don't even think it's tactically smart because it clearly turns people off um the kinds of you know i did that radar on the rhino hunting ad from that deranged mazuri failed candidate yes it's uh it's very bad in in uh right wing political spheres that there's a reward from a certain part of the base so there's a there's a dopamine hit on social media from activating your like craziest followers there's just not representative of how most people feel about it and it has it has encouraged a lot of people to go way too far in how they talk about this things these things that that said and that aside i don't i don't think it is not wrong to cast it is to cast dispersions on law enforcement i mean that's something that left us that's something left us all the time and i'm right there with them saying uh that police have too much power and abuse that power and and harm citizens sometimes in a in a racially insensitive or racially discriminatory way and like i agree with all that and if i Anna Presley gets on tv and says the the cops the pigs are coming for you you gotta arm up and be willing to kill them what would the response be from the right response would be as she said she shouldn't she said literally that that would be pretty bad i should not say that this this is this is the i was gonna say the subtext but it's pretty much the text text and what's being said by not all but some conservatives and i i do think there is some legitimacy in asking whether and author are going to be bad downstream downstream effects from that kind of rhetoric yes but okay but there is bad downstream we can't there are bad there's bad downstream effects of it's it's hard to the other side does that a lot too they honestly do i mean there's there's extreme rhetoric on both sides and i think it's often very lazy to draw like well this is why there's more violence because people say those things but when i say they should not say it because it's not appropriate period when when a sitting progressive or moderate democrats or is talking about people arming up to shoot and be willing to kill federal employees i think we'll be in a similar tip or tack case but this does feel like an escalation of the likes of which we haven't seen from our sitting congressional representatives that's that's all i'm saying the auger lying concerns about the irs i'm perfectly willing to entertain but i do think that this represents you know this ongoing rhetoric has always been pretty there was maybe a period of time when we were much younger where there was a lot less i i guess anger in our political system but the things that can't hug 100 or 200 years ago right it was all trying to human somebody beat somebody with a cane on those steps of the capital not not in town in 2020 not in 2020 but in uh but in 1863 or whatever so i'm just saying well all right i guess i guess we have to make sure people are well caned on the house floor if you should we should cane our representatives philosophically not using actual violence they should be cained at the polls by the voters rhetorically rhetorically to be clear team rising joins us next stay with us all right well a new article from bloomberg in the headline says women who stay single and don't have kids are getting richer uh ryan shocked i am shocked the subheading forging marriage in parenthood has a bigger payoff for american women than men according to new research i mean of course because women typically take more time off when they have children um and are more likely to work part-time not because of the patriarchy actually most women who have children say they prefer some form of part-time work to full-time work you can't disentangle that from the patriarchy those that's the wills are a product of our culture and our superstructure right i i actually think it's the opposite i think if anything it's the patriarchy that continues to insist women become cogs in the corporate machine instead of doing what they would prefer and women have been conditioned since bready beddy fredan to believe that there's no value in work that is sort of an aingling attractive bloomberg's begging the opposite here yes um and so women who stay single don't have kids are getting richer now ryan as a parent this has to be the least surprising news ever kids are extremely expensive yes and that that's one reason that i thought the the child tax credit was such an important policy because okay congratulations to these the the woman who's not who's getting rich and or the man who's getting rich because he's not uh having kids and they tell the article talks about how they get to travel a lot more they get to a second home in new jersey you get to they get to take vacations all of the people that produce the economic growth that enables that luxurious lifestyle all the people who are working on the the airlines that fly you to your island vacation the people serving you your drinks the people cleaning your rooms all those people were raised by somebody yeah we're all doing that we're doing that work for you so that there are people out there to take care of you in your luxurious time so that's that's why i thought the child tax credit was at least a little little recognition of of that fact yes congratulations that you know that you're not part of that and as a result your your bank account looks looks much fatter but yes kid like the the quickest route to poverty is uh having children like that's that's that's the that's the tragedy in our country well and actually where i think it gets even more tragic and gets to the point we were kind of debating a little bit earlier in the segment is that limon stone at the institute for family studies has found american women actually are having less children than they say they want which is extremely sad and it's extremely sad when you consider i think this was uh Mindy kaolin in what was she was in one of the glossy magazines recently talking about how uh parents as a gift for their young daughters who i think it was either graduating high school or college should be given egg freezing so that they can focus on their careers in their twenties which from your perspective i imagine is a very sad statement on uh the the sort of impossibility of workplaces that make it easier for women to have uh you know for for women to work and and have uh fulfilling personal lives in ways that they might want to and from my perspective i would say that's incredibly dehumanizing in treating women again like cogs and or corporate machine whose purpose in life is best fulfilled by work and i can i've been reading a lot of marks lately actually ryan t um but you know you can go back to a lot of different uh thinkers and and how especially during the industrial revolution they were reacting to uh train changes in work but what's your perspective since i put words in your mouth well i mean and which marks marks as gender analysis was not very fleshed out it was interesting it was i'd recommend canes more when it comes to because i think you'd appreciate his you know the way that canes tries to think about the economy in terms of the way that it can serve a a robust and and healthy society but in something like the twenties or thirties he was he was talking about how once you have enough uh automation and economic growth people could be working about 15 hours a week and there's some interesting studies that say that yeah if you combine life expectancy the growth in life expectancy which has since recently reversed uh with the extra amount of retirement that people have coupled with the kind of extended adolescence you know in 150 years ago people started hitting the factories by the time they're 10 and 11 12 yeah now often you're pushing that deep into your 20s and so if you combine the that let's call it leisure with the retirement leisure and add it all together actually a lot of people are working an average of say 15 20 hours we over their entire lifetimes but the mistake that we make is then we we jam it all onto people when they're also you know uh in a place where they're starting to create families and it's and they're completely sleep deprived no it's interesting because actually i wasn't even referring to marx's work on gender or sex but more his work on alienation and labor in general in the way we're conditioned to work post-industrial revolution and in post-industrial world that happened really quickly and in the United States i mean listen i'm here i'm happy to be here i think it's great that women have those those freedoms and there are a lot of people who i wouldn't agree with who i absolutely owe a debt of gratitude to for fighting for that there's no question about it that doesn't mean that uh you know i think every part of it was good or that we we fully thought through all of the ways women might be fulfilled differently right his his point is profound and correct that when that when you are exploited for your labor yeah that that your whole your soul is alienated by that and and and it starts to rip society apart and Mindy Kaling is just asking more women than and this would be my opposition to it uh it's just prioritizing that that soul ripping exploitation over uh something that's i think very clearly much more human and much more fulfilling so uh you know these are deep issues but i'm actually glad there's more conversation about them because i think the the the rapid rapid rapid in fact advancements in technology not just in the past ten years but in the past two hundred years and you can even go further back than that um it really changed the way we live very quickly and it's it's worth pausing it's kind of thinking about things yeah yeah for sure um oh and so Zach Carter's uh Cain's biography is the place just a place to go for that one you love it yeah oh yeah like it's called the price of peace i remember we were talking about that so good it's so good all right i'll check that out well i'll check it out we'll do a rising friday's book club there you go"
