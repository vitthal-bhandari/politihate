You can expect things like bizarre unheard of diseases, strange medical mishaps, unexplainable deaths, and everything in between. Listen to Mr. Ballon's Medical Mysteries on Amazon Music or wherever you get your podcasts. From Wondery and Audible comes Class of 88, a new podcast hosted by Will Smith. For 1988, a lot of people didn't take hip hop seriously, but hip hop today touches everything from film to fashion to sports. So what changed? Follow Class of 88 wherever you get your podcasts. Hi, I'm Seth Meyers. This year has been unlike anything we've ever experienced, but if you're like me, one of the silver linings is we have more time than ever to read books. This summer on the Late Night Podcast, we're starting a new series devoted to books and authors called Late Night Lit. One of our producers, Sarah Janks-Daley, happens to be one of the biggest readers, not just on our staff, but anywhere. Which will be your guide throughout the series. Here's Sarah. Hi, everyone. It's Sarah Janks-Daley. I'm a supervising producer here at Late Night with Seth Meyers, and if you're a frequent listener of our podcast, you might have heard me conduct a few backstage interviews with our guest. Back in the day is when we produce a show from our studio at 30 Rock. Another part of my job, and I'd argue maybe the best part, is helping to curate and produce the literary content on Late Night. Seth is an avid reader, and over the last few months while we have all been working from home, he has shared books he has loved over social media. And so this summer, we decided to devote a special podcast series exclusively to authors and literature. We plan to release new Late Night Lit episodes a few times in the coming months, and on it, you'll hear interviews with novelists, booksellers, and other figures in the literary community. And we'll also feature some summer reading recommendations from a few members of our Late Night staff. So please be on the lookout and tell your friends who love books, or who love reading, or who love Seth, or who love none of those things, but desperately need something to listen to on their upcoming road trip. On this inaugural episode, I talked a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Colson Whitehead, and Danielle Mullen, the owner of semi-colon books, currently the only black woman-owned bookstore in Chicago. Here at Late Night, we have featured authors from The Jump, and it has been a particularly important to Seth to use our platform to amplify the voices of people that don't normally get the spotlight. We've worked hard to bring attention to novelists from different backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and share their stories with our audience. We felt that there was no better way to start this series than by focusing on black authors, literature, and highlighting black voices. So we were thrilled to get the opportunity to feature both Colson and Danielle. Now without further ado, here's my Zoom chat with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead. Colson, thank you so much for doing this. I should note before we start, you have actually appeared on Late Night before for the publication of The Underground Railroad, and I know Seth would like to have you on the show again, but this pandemic really did interrupt not only the way we record, but how we're booking guests. So I'll have to say that. Sure enough, a few and two years, moving back to normal. The Nickel Boys was published last year, and the Paper Daff edition came out this month. In between those two dates, you were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, which is even more impressive that this is your second Pulitzer, and I know that puts you in very rarefied air being the fourth writer to ever do so. How did you find out that you had won? Well, what was I doing? I knew that they were announcing them, but I didn't think that I was in contention because it would have been really weird for someone to get it for two books in a row. So I actually, I was in New York City, and getting an antibody test to see if I had that weird flu I had six weeks before was COVID. And I walked out of the doctor's office with my mask on, and my phone started blowing up and was my agent. So she told me, and I was sort of running down the street towards Park Avenue, screaming, and then I realized that, probably not a lot of white people like black guys screaming down the street chasing, you know, running and screaming. So I stopped and met up with my wife, and I was a star of a nice, you know, sort of a day-long celebration. I know your wife is a literary agent, so she's in the community. Is she a person that you share your work with in early stages? Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I'm right there, so she can't really say no. So she doesn't really bump me to the front of the queue when I finish something. I'm a person who can sort of, who can work in isolation, but definitely I get to the first third of the book and have to show her, show my agents, and just get some feedback, so I don't feel like I'm going crazy. And once I get that, you know, feedback on the first third I can power through to the end, usually. I read that your daughter, who is probably high school age now. She's 15. Yeah. I heard she was relatively non-plussed by some of the awards that you'd garnered, mostly for Underground Railroad, but that she was impressed by Buzzfeed, in particular. That was the one that she was. Her own context for things. And so with Underground Railroad, it was the number one bestseller, and I would tell her, and she'd say, oh, you know, great dad. And then I was like, overpicked it for her book club, you know, great dad. And I told her I was going to go into Buzzfeed for an interview. So Buzzfeed, and I brought her, and it was very nice. She got to see how the sausages made. She came to Seth Meyers when I was on, and so it's been nice to see it slowly dawn on her that she should not make fun of me as much as she does. So getting to the book, I read that after writing the Underground Railroad, you were actually hesitant in your words to write another heavy book. But there were certain circumstances that compelled you to do so. Can you explain what those were and what your process was? Sure. You know, I've written books about poker and New York City and slavery. And I generally write a more serious book and a more lighter book, someone with more jokes. And that's generally been my method so that I'm not sort of bummed out all the time and keep it varied. In this case, you know, when my schedule cleared, it was the spring of 2017. And I had two ideas for books. One was like a crime novel, which, you know, when you write a crime novel these days, you know, it's usually more ironic and it was more room for humor. And I had an idea about this reform school in Florida where a lot of terrible things happened. And it seems in that spring of 2017, a few months into Trump's election, after Trump's election, that a hard time sort of figuring out where America was going. Should I be optimistic? Should I be pessimistic? Should I believe that the country is capable of positive change or we still stay in our same terrible rut? And so the crime novel didn't make sense. Writing about a terrible reform school in the Jim Crow South with two main characters, one pessimistic, one optimistic, might be a way for me to get a handle on how I was feeling about the country. And so I broke my rule of doing sort of serious book in the lighter book, but it was sort of psychologically and emotionally necessary for me at that time. You mentioned 2017 and I think a lot of us felt very different ways about how the country was spiraling into a different place than perhaps most of us want to see it going. And here we are now 2020 with the publication of the paperback and circumstances are not similar but not dissimilar in what's happening with police brutality and the killings of black people across the country. Does it feel to you strange, I guess, that the paperback is coming out at a time where we have sort of cycled back to a similar place? Well, I mean, it makes perfect sense because this is our history and when I was writing Underground Railroad and writing about slave for trollers, we were basically the law enforcement before we had the police force. And it was their job to stop black people free or enslaved to see if they had free papers. And in reading these historical documents, I was struck how slaves would talk about being stopped by slave trollers, how similar their language was to how black people today talk about being stopped. It was the same sort of humiliation and randomness and terror. And so that part of our history is in Underground Railroad and I was talking about it for two years. The Nickel Boys I started after the protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown was killed. I felt there were a lot of stories that aren't told. We have technology in our phones now to capture police brutality. But if we capture one instance, Michael Brown, George Floyd, how many other instances are we not seeing because there's no camera there? And so actually the Nickel Boys came out of that sort of frustration and sense of powerlessness after Ferguson. And so it made sense that the conversation would start up again because we've always had these big high profile police brutality moments and then we talk about it and then the conversation trails off and we come back. And that's been my experience in my lifetime. So having another high profile police brutality case entered the news and unconsciousness and the conversation does not seem strange because it's always been that way. But in terms of the protests and how wide ranging and varied and continued, that's been surprising. The fact that for some reason, whether it was three years of Trump or just too many, too many videos that force people to say enough, this time the protests seem very different. Yes. I know that you read a story about the Dozier School, which Nickel Academy is based on in a local paper in Florida. So I do think first this speaks to the importance of local journalism. And I think at any listeners are interested in donating to local journalistic outlets right now, that is an important thing to do. So people can keep reporting on the stories. But that being said, what were your first reactions to reading that story? Was it surprise that you maybe hadn't heard about it or shock that it went on for so long or all of those things? Sure. Yeah. Folks don't know that Dozier School was a reform school in Florida operated for 111 years. And the idea was very lofty. What do we do with juvenile delinquents? Do we lock them up with adult criminals or do we send them to school and have them learn to trade and when they come out, they might be able to be reformed. But of course, as happens in most places like this, there was abuse, people were beaten, little kids locked up in solitary confinement, and some kids were actually killed. And they finally closed the school down in 2011 and found a secret graveyard where students had been buried, some of them from natural causes, but some of them from gunshot wounds. And so you're right, it was covered extensively in Florida. I came across it in the summer of 2014 because they found the graveyard and made a sort of blit in the national media and then disappeared again. And it seems the same way that if we capture one police brutality case on camera, how many others do we not see? If there's one place like Dozier, how many other places like this are we unaware of? They must be out there. And so that stayed with me. The fact that I read the news, I'm sort of up on things, but never heard of Dozier. So that was shocking. And then a lot of the people who came forward, former students who'd been abused 40, 50, 30 years ago, were telling their stories to the press and the most of them were white. But the majority of students at the school were African American. And so I started to think what story could I get out of the Black part of campus, the untold stories? I know that there is a website where some of those men who suffered and were at the school have shared their experiences. Have you heard from any of those men? Are they readers? Have they since you published the book? Yeah, I mean, I am not when I was writing because I want to have my own students populate the school. But once the book was announced, I started getting emails from people. And so far, you know, the response has been never very positive. One thing, it's the made up story. It's a novel, but I didn't want to be true to their experiences. And so I was glad that I captured at least a bit of their truth in the stories of my main characters, Elwood and Turner. And when I did reading, some of them came and I met them face to face, not just over email. And you really see how the wounds of their time at those years stayed with them, like the way their voice changes, their face changes when they talk about what happened to them 40 years before. They're still very much with them. And they've had many of them have tried very hard to make a life for themselves after they've been, you know, their lives have been put off course by their time into school. And so I'm glad that it spoke their experience. And I'm glad that in the same way that journalism brought their stories to a bigger audience. Hopefully, you know, the Nickel Boys has brought their narratives, their stories to a larger audience as well. Yeah, absolutely. Elwood, one of the main characters finds so less in comfort and even inspiration, particularly during his time at Nickel in the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and speeches he's given. Can you explain how you decided to weave that element into the story and kind of how it started? Sure. I mean, you know, the book had taken place in 1920. It could have taken place in 1940, 2011 when a school closed. I picked 1960 because the early 60s, because it's the, the Hidal civil rights movements. We haven't had the civil rights act, the voting rights act yet. But my main character, Elwood, has seen in his life things change because of the activism of Dr. King and his cohort. I knew I wanted him to be an optimistic person who does think that social change is possible. So if he's there in the 1960s, who's he woke up to Martin Luther King. And then I had to figure out what speeches and phrases and imagery of Dr. King's would resonate with Elwood, resonate with the larger themes in the book. And you know, I, I was like 40 at a time. I hadn't read Dr. King a long time, certainly had benefited from his activism, but I hadn't really read his speeches since college. So it was really invigorating to hear the words again. And if you go on YouTube, you can find somebody in the speeches that's there, you know, one click away and actually hear his voice. You know, in some ways, Elwood, my main character is sort of too good to be true. He does believe that things can change and he'll stand up and fight. And going to and hearing Dr. King, you realize that Elwood is not too good to be true. He was part of this generation that really did change things, thought change was possible and fought for it. As unlikely as it seems sometimes in the last like, you know, three years in this country. So it was great to we discover his speeches and have my new sort of adult interpretations and also see them through a teenager's eyes, you know, have to sort of impersonate these different characters on our right to book. And so trying to figure out what a 16 year old black boy in Florida in 1962 sees in Dr. King was, you know, a great experience. Yeah, speaking of children, I read that when you were younger, your tastes ranged from Marvel comics to mystery and horror. And at one point you wanted to write in that genre, I read an article where you said you grew up wanting to be a black Stephen King. Surely, yeah. When did you shift that focus away from that direction to where you are? Well, you know, I didn't like to leave the house, you know, as a kid. So reading Spiderman and watching the Twilight Zone and renting like, harm movie on VHS because it was like my idea, like a perfect afternoon. So I wasn't flying out to college and started reading, you know, Gabriela C. and Marquez and James Joyce that I found a different way of different kind of story I could tell. But I definitely still use the, you know, everything I learned from reading fantasy in my zombie apocalypse book, which is a horror novel. Underground Mill Road, there's a fantastic structure and I learned, you know, how to use a fantastic element by thinking about the horror and fantasy I read as a kid. How do you balance the real and the fake, the fantastic and the realistic. And definitely, you know, it was mentioned zone one. It was great, you know, 10 years ago, I've written a few so, you know, so-called serious books to write a zombie novel and salute George Romero and like John Carpenter, these horror filmmakers and writers that, you know, really sort of made me want to become a writer. Did you ever think that book would be coming true in a way? So it takes place in New York City after a pandemic has ravaged the town. Yeah, the first couple of weeks have locked down and I was like, I felt creeped out, but also upset about all the things that got wrong. Like I didn't realize how important the toilet paper would be. You know, you can't be right about everything. So in the book, the apocalypse is wound down and again, we do the extra zombies, the ones that are trapped in apartment buildings and subway tunnels. So I realized that when they find leftover zombies in apartments, there'd probably be like a big roller sharmon next month. All the stuff they were recording. Have you noticed I'd be interested to know if there's a resurgence in sales from that book in the last few months? I got a little bump. I got a little bump. Yeah. It's strange. I watched contagion the other day. I don't know why, but it felt like maybe- The watch can change in early on and yeah, definitely bump me out. Yeah. And to end with just this personal note of I think one of the great pleasures of this job, particularly for myself, besides getting to meet people like you has been on our show, being able to showcase authors and particularly give a platform to those who don't get the traditional spotlight. And Seth has been so interested in actively trying to bring stories of all different experiences and Black voices and LGBTQ voices and immigrant voices and female voices and all of those things maybe together. I think now people are particularly interested in hearing stories from Black authors and I would love to know if there's any authors that you recommend or books that you've read recently or are reading that our listeners could check out now. Sure. M.K. Jamison, sort of the fantasy science fiction writer, has a book called The City We Became which I just started and it's a fantasy novel set in New York City and is very much rooted in contemporary New York. But also has a really sort of fun angle on how to get a fantastic story out of it. So that's cool. Fred Bennett who wrote The Mothers a few years ago which I really enjoyed, has a new book out, the vanishing ones I think it's called. So I'm looking forward to picking that up next time again to a bookstore. Yeah, I'll tell my head. That's what I have to offer. M.K. Those are great. It was such an immense pleasure to speak to you and thank you so much for taking the time. I'm a big fan especially Seth so we're very appreciative of you sharing your day with us. Oh, it's been very fun. Thanks a lot. We'll be right back with Danielle Mullen. Hi listeners, I'm Donnie Dust and I'm here to tell you about our new podcast Rescue. Go deep into the heart of the world's most astonishing rescue stories told by the people who are there. I'll never forget his words to me. They struck me like a knife. He said Billy, nine guys are missing and we think they're trapped under your farm. Marvel at the lengths people will go to preserve the most sacred of things. Life. At any point the transmission is going to quit and we're going to crash in the water and we're going to die because once the engines quit, we probably wouldn't survive. Join me, Donnie Dust, for Rescue. Defying fate, defining heroes. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. Danielle Mullen is the owner of Semi-Colin Books, an independent bookstore in Chicago. She has a deep love of literature and a growing Instagram following and was kind enough to agree to an interview with us. Here's my Zoom chat with Danielle Mullen. Danielle, welcome to the Late Night Podcast. Thank you for inviting me. So you are the owner of Semi-Colin Books, which is an independent bookstore in Chicago and it should be noted one of two female owned but the only black female owned bookstore in the whole city. Yeah, that's crazy, right? It's crazy. I actually wanted to know when you were in the process of opening, were you aware of that fact and when you found out did that surprise you? I had no idea because I didn't do any research like I was supposed to. So when I finally opened and I see all the articles, I'm like, oh, this is the worst thing ever. I didn't want that kind of pressure. You opened about a year ago. So happy anniversary. Thank you. The space. It also functions as a gallery space. Is that right? Yes. Museum curator by trade and I wanted to put my two favorite things together, which are books and art. And we had a basement level that had nothing in it and I didn't want people browsing for books in the basement because there's no light. So what I do is I kind of allow artists to come in and take over the entire thing. They put up whatever they want. If they want to paint the ceilings, I'm perfectly happy with that and it works beautifully. Did you have community in mind when you built the space and the way you designed it was sort of to encourage people as to see it as a collective space, maybe more than just a place to get books? Yes. I wanted it to feel like a space where we could always talk. That's what we do often with BYOB. So we typically just drink and run our mouths and it's perfect. I'm always interested in the concept of naming, whether it's novels or products or even restaurants. So I'd love to hear about your process and how you ultimately chose semicolon books as the name. So a semicolon represents the part in a sentence when author could stop but decides to keep going. I was building out this huge project that was 200,000 square feet and is a bookstore hangout space concept and things kept going wrong. And then my building flooded and I remember thinking, okay. And I was literally depressed and walking by this space and saw it was for Lisa. It was like, well, I'm taking this space and I had no idea what I was doing with it. But I walked in and I was like, well, this is going to be the bookstore. And it is a much, much, much smaller scale, but it is also the thing that forced me to not end the sentence. So that's what I want with that name. I love that. Obviously, the world has changed significantly over the last few months and many small businesses have suffered during this era of social distancing. And I'm sure this was not a challenge that you anticipated facing within one year of starting a business. How has this changed your day to day since the business has probably shifted primarily to an online business? I think that it makes me think a lot more about safety. I try to think about am I keeping my employees safe enough? Am I keeping any of our patrons safe enough? We are light-salling the shelves every five minutes. There's hand sanitizer everywhere. And it is hard to socially distance in a bookstore, especially when you have a line around the corner. But we try to do that and try not to rush people. I think bookstores are just one of those things that it is difficult to COVID-proof. When you were in the throes of it before you were able to reopen, how was the shift to book sales via the internet? It was trash. What it means you have to do is take all of the thousands of books in your inventory and add them online, which is horrible. And then you have to either do it yourself or pay someone to keep an account of updated inventory based on the orders that are coming in. But it's really, really bad. And it's nothing like selling in person. And I kind of hate it so much. But that's what it is right now. I wondered if in the last few weeks you've seen an increase in sales about race, books about anti-racism literature, books by black authors. Yeah. Yeah. And it's great. It seems great that people are trying to learn, unlearn, more than learn. And I love it. I just hate that everybody is buying these same books. You know, kind of like reach out into some other things. Anybody who comes in my store, we try to lead them in other directions. But you know, everybody has a book club that's reading one of five books and whatever, however, it needs to work. As long as people are reading. As long as people are reading, I'm happy. Yes. Going off on what you just mentioned, I read an interview where you said that a way to become more anti-racist is to become more empathetic. So you said you push people in different directions. Does that mean reading perhaps fictional stories by black authors? What does that mean to you? Absolutely black fiction. I recognize that I am empathetic based upon a person's story. And I think that fiction tells our story better because it can tug at the heartstrings a little more with specific verbiage. And I think that that is the way to start as opposed to facts, figure, statistics. We know that those are awful, but to feel something for another group of people, I think that needs to happen first. Yes. Now, looking back over the last year of owning the store, even though the last four months probably seem like a year because they do to me, can you share some events or milestones that semicolon books has achieved that you're most proud of or that you were most proud of seeing come to life? Yeah, like I'm super excited. We made our first million dollars. That was part of our five year plan. That's amazing. Yeah, it's great. Like we're a bookstore. We made a million dollars with the way our margins look. That's pretty difficult for a small bookstore. Also, we have almost 60,000 followers on Instagram. I don't know how that happened. We have like 3,000. That's pretty good for a bookstore. Now we're at close to 60,000 and people are actively engaging and DMing us. We're talking to people from all over the world and it is super dope. Those are huge milestones. That is very cool. Lastly, I'd love to know if there are any books you've read lately that you would want to recommend to our readers, our listeners, our listeners, and our listeners. Any books that you'd love to share with us that you think are... I love such a fun age. Kylie Reed. It is so cool. Yes, isn't it good? Such a fun age is super dope. Banishing half. Britt Bennett. She is killing it right now because her book is so good and all people are recognizing that she is a force to be reckoned with. So those are my two loves right now. You can't ask a bookseller about books. We can talk about this all day. It's so funny because I asked Colson Whitehead the same question. He also recommended Britt Bennett the vanishing. Yeah. She's killing it. Have you read it yet? I haven't read it yet. I just started Lustre by Raven Leilani. Oh my gosh. Lustre is one of the best books that I've read in years. It's beautiful. Raven Leilani is outstanding. I love her. So I'm like her biggest man. I couldn't believe that it is her debut novel. It seems like someone who's been writing for 70 years. It's so beautiful. So good and it's so beautiful and I can't wait to have her in my store. It has been so wonderful to talk to you and I'm so appreciative of you taking the time today and I am looking forward to the day where I can come to Chicago and visit semicolon in person. Absolutely. It is. We are an experiential space. So you kind of got to be here to feel it. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hey everyone. It's Seth again as you probably know the late night staff has been working remotely from home the last few months which has provided us all a chance to catch up on some reading. A few members of our staff wanted to share what they've been into lately. Hi, I'm Karen Chi and I'm a writer at late night and I'm so excited to share this book with you. It's called How Much of These Hills Is Gold by C. Pam Zang. It just came out this year. It's really awesome. It's the story about these Chinese American siblings during the gold rush and their journey with their father throughout California. And just a heads up, it's very heartbreaking because as you can imagine being Asian in America during that time was not the most fun, but it's really beautifully written and it shows you a part of American history that I feel like most of us don't really know about. So I hope you read it and then report back to me. Thank you. I'm Yeji Chabic, the music associate producer here at late night. At the start of Shelter in Place, my goal was to try to read a book every two weeks. Given the state of the world, I wanted a book that could help transport me to another world to temporarily escape reality. I think the author Haruki Murakami is an author that helps transform the reader's world instantly. His book Dance Dance Dance sucked me into a world of whimsical chaos, full of action, crazy characters, and his absurdist sense of humor and attention to detail. The point of the book is that you've got to keep dancing because music will keep playing whether you like it or not. And if you fall behind, you'll lose the script of yourself and your life. I highly recommend this book if you're looking for a little escape from reality. My name is Sid Butler. I play bass in the HE band. The book I've been reading is by Malcolm Gladwell. It's called Talking to Strangers. The tagline in the book is what we should know about the people we don't know. And I'm really enjoying this one, especially under the current climate wherein this book, to me, seems very current and apropos. And he tells his great story as it ended out about the miscommunication between human beings through hundreds of years. The smallest word or the smallest movement or phrase, it changes the direction of those relationships. Being in the HE band, we're in a very small room. Writing these original songs every day, and sometimes the slightest gesture or mis or glance can communicate so much. So I think this book is helping me understand what I can do to be a better listener and a better communicator when my time to speak arises. And I can't recommend it enough for people that might be frustrated with your communication. This has been Late Night Lit. Our thanks to Colson Whitehead and Danielle Mullen. Our theme music was written and performed by the HE band. For Late Night with Seth Meyers, I'm Sarah Jankstaley. Thanks for listening and happy reading."
