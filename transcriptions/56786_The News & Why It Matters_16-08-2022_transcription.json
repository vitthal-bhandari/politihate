    "text": " Today, the DOJ refuses to release a key document from the Mar-a-Lago raid. Mayor Bowser dismisses concerns over her discriminatory vaccine policies, and somehow, the Catholic Rosary is now an extremist symbol. Surprise! We've got all of that and more coming up, and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez, and I am joined today by Blaise TV contributors, both Yaku Williams, host of The Bottom Line, and John Doyle, host of Heck Off Kami, or so I'm told, but I'm not sure the last time he actually put out content. I don't even want to make my little quay. Every time, you know, it's like clockwork. She takes a shot at me, I have to, like, somehow respond, and then we get into the news. Let's just get into the news. Can I just say the only reason that happens is because the first time John Doyle was on this program, you should look it up. He immediately insulted me as the host, and I was like, I'm never letting you live a little bit. Wait a minute, that's a running thing at the moment of people coming on this show insulting Sarah. I'm going to take precedent against this. You should appreciate that. Like Alex Stein. No, no, no. Get your act together, buddy. I'm not mad at you, but he is. Sarah's show. All right, so let's, all right, we'll get into the news now, John. Okay, I won't torch you anymore. I know there are those people out there who are like, hurry up and get to the news. Stop bantering. We can't help it. We're friends. Okay. The Department of Justice is moving to unseal more documents related to the raid that happened last week on President Donald Trump's home in Florida, but they are not going to unseal. They say the underlying FBI affidavit, which is what President Trump keeps asking them to unseal and release. They said that unsealing the affidavit could also cause damage to US national security. The quote is disclosure at this juncture of the affidavit supporting probable cause would, by contrast, cause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing criminal investigation. If disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps. So here's the thing with all of this. And I want to also show you Tom Fitton, who is the president over at Judicial Washoot, just doing great work. They are some of the ones who pushed to get these documents even released. The documents that have been released to push them to get released. And he has been really pushing back on all of this false narrative about how declassification works and the fact that if the president was the president at the time, he can declassify whatever the hell he wants. It's been done many, many times and will continue to be done. And it seemed a whole lot like a setup. So Tom Fitton tweeted that the court has set an in-person hearing on Judicial Watch and media requests for the release of the affidavit underlying the abusive Biden raid on Trump's home. It is set for Thursday, August 18th at 1 o'clock PM. So we will of course keep you posted on that. You know, here's the thing with this guys. And we talked about this a little bit yesterday with Chad Prather and Zuby, but it seems an awful lot like a very convenient excuse when you get to claim that someone has taken all of this top secret information. And you can't tell anyone what the top secret information is because it's top secret. So you can't say anything about it. So nobody gets to access any of the records. Nobody gets oversight. Nobody gets to understand if this is just completely, you know, a political ploy before the midterms and to try to prevent Donald Trump from running again in 2024. It just seems a little convenient that now this is unprecedented that they're doing this. And they can't tell you anything, but just trust them because they're the FBI. They couldn't possibly be compromised. They're the FBI. Does this not feel like the ladies at the tennis club? Have you heard about Sarah? Oh, it's so bad. What should you do? It's just bad. Just no, it's horrific. I can't tell you. Trust me though. Because if I tell you, a lot of people will get hurt. A lot of people will get hurt. Meanwhile, the one that we get hurt is the liar, the FBI, the one that's lying. No, in a way, you know, telling you exactly, if they truly showed America why they're at a these houses, the country would be in an opera. They would go, wait, what? That's your justification? Of course they're not going to show that. And I think they will fight like crazy to keep that concealed. We need to fight like crazy to see it. Bear it all. Look, if, and I think we said it before, if he is this crazy national threat, right? Show us. We should all then, you know, stand in with you. And by the way, I would be the first one to call him out on that if that were the case. But show us any sort of evidence to prove this. You know, meanwhile, you have President Trump. Let's think about through the years what he has accused the FBI or the deep state or whoever of doing. And everyone says he's, she's lying. He's just making that up. He's a conspiracy theorist. He's a liar. And then all of a sudden later, he was proven to be right. They were spying on him. Russia was a hoax. All of these other things. I mean, you can go down and down the list. He says it. And it ends up being true. He ends up being vindicated and proven right. Usually it's years later where nobody cares anymore and everyone has already gotten the narrative. And so nobody thinks to check back and go, Oh, actually, we were wrong about this one, including this, this whole detail about the passports. Donald Trump said they took my passports. That was not on the list of things to take. They still took them. Nora O'Donnell said, tweeted out. She's from CBS News. According to a DOJ official, the FBI is not in possession of former President Trump's passports. Trump had accused the FBI of stealing his three passports during the search. And then of course later, there was a screenshot of an email that was sent by the Justice Department explaining that they did have the passports and were arranging for someone from President Trump's team to pick them up. So John, it just feels a lot like, why would Trump be saying, release the affidavit, unseal it, release it. The American people need to see this because this absurd and this is, I mean, this is an overreach to the highest extent. Why would he be saying that if he didn't know that it was in fact true and they could just unseal it and prove him wrong if it wasn't? And that's exactly it. I mean, even in his White House, there were so many leaks from people because the nature of politics is very decentralized. And everyone is always going to have a little piece of information that if they want, they can leak. And so if he came out and we're doing the opposite, somebody could then leak that they could prove that it were correct. But he's saying, no, show us the evidence and of course they can't produce it. Whereas in cases of legitimate political corruption, they either completely ignore it because they don't want to basically bait people who might have the information to come out and leak it or they'll make a joke like, oh, wipe my server. Like what? With a cloth? I'm so funny. Things like that. They don't actually dare them to basically release the information like Trump is doing. And it's because they want it swept under the rug and Trump wants to be exonerated. And this dates back to, I mean, you know, we had the cheated on his taxes, the Russia thing, the Ukraine thing, which was pretty funny because they were mad at Russia and then mad at Ukraine. And then now that those two countries actually don't get along, they are very pro Ukraine now. And so the only like consistent principle is just that just that they are anti Trump. We tend to like look at all these things and oh, you guys are hypocrites. No, the consistent principle is just they're anti Trump by whatever means necessary. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, and I'm really asking myself lately. Are they really anti Trump or are they anti America and they're attacking the Americans champion? That's a great point. Because whoever I am almost sorry, sir, but I'm feeling like if they're just if there was another champion, yeah, right, not God, Trump's not God. Okay, but he is a champion that they would attack that champion. So I just see if it was the fantasy step in, get ready for more of the same is what I'm thinking. I don't think this goes away when Trump goes away. That's a great point. I would say that it's it started with Trump, but it has probably spiraled. And I mean, Trump, tell me if I don't have the quote exactly right, but he said something to the effect one time of it's not me thereafter, thereafter, you and I'm just standing in the way that this pretty accurate. It does seem very accurate, especially to Yaku's point. There has been a lot of talk about Ron DeSantis. You know, you see the headlines like Ron DeSantis isn't Trump. He's worse. And it's like, yeah, wow, we're really doing this again. Yeah. And so for that, I want that's what I really want. America, let's not get lost. Look, this is egregious. It's horrific. It's terrible. It's unacceptable to attack a president this way. I'd even say if they were to do this to Barack Obama at the time, I would go, this is gross over it. You don't do this. But I think we need to be able to see the forest from the trees here. This is not just a Donald Trump. This is not just orange man bad. This is anybody who loves this nation, who wants to uphold a second amendment to constitution, who wants freedom of religion, wants to serve Christ in this country. They're coming for you. And this guy is just the poster child. I'm almost certainly convinced of this. If you look at Davos, if you look at economic forum, if you look at what's happening with Macron and France and all these other guys, Lapit and Israel, they're all singing the same song. There's something very, very bad happening against Americans. And it's happening while we're watching them. And we need to realize this is not just Donald Trump. They're coming for your family. John? Yeah. Everybody, I think, has noticed, even if they can't articulate it precisely, that since the end of World War II, after the 1950s, once we got into the 60s, the country started to decline and it started to change in a really negative way. And even Ronald Reagan, I mean, Make America Great Again was more or less stolen from Ronald Reagan's campaign in the 1980s. And it's like, well, why even 40 years ago did we want to make America Great Again? Now, fast forward, we're obviously so much worse off now than we were then. And still, we want to make America Great again. And so, Yakuza is entirely correct that when they see Donald Trump, you notice that they hate him as much as they hate his supporters. You know, the rhetoric that they launch at Trump is going to be the same as the supporters in line to watch him speak, because what they see in Trump is his supporters. It is just normal, white American Christians who they hate, who they have contempt for, because it's those people who have the deepest roots in this country and therefore the greatest incentive to preserve it against what they want to do to it, which is completely transformative. Which is, I think that what you guys just said, I think kind of takes us full circle, which is the FBI, of course, is at the helm of trying to target all of the qualifiers that you just pointed out, Yakuza, if you are a, you know, conservative Christian, if you're a conservative Christian, white man, God help you because the FBI and the NSA definitely are tapping your phones, trying to find something on you. I want to bring into the conversation this particular story just to tie in here. One of the journalists covering the Whitmer kidnapping trial tweeted yesterday. According to an FBI informant, the Michigan State Police allowed armed protesters into the Capitol in Lansing on April 30th, 2020, at the specific request of the FBI, which wanted to, they say, quote, deescalate the situation. So he said he used his live wire to tell his handlers that the watchmen were discussing their desire to take violent action and storm the building. And it was his warning that convinced the FBI to ask the MSP to open the doors. Huh, I wonder if there is another place that that might have happened that was another Capitol except the Capitol of the country on January 6th. I don't know, maybe the FBI is capable of that after all. Hey, listen, I'll tell you, you can stop people from entering a building where children are being slaughtered. Then you can do a lot of different things. And we've someone on this network that said very early on after January 6, hey, sure look to me like they let people in. And that was video of it. There's video of it. Two days after the event, not a year and a half later, two days after January 8th, it's like, wait a minute, sure looks like these guys are letting these people in. Yeah, and still non-violent people who are literally the only charge against them is parading, right, parading in a restricted building. And still, some of them are being held without due process, without, you know, access to lawyers and horrible conditions because they did this. And as Yaku pointed out, doors open, let them in, also who is Ray Epps and why isn't he any of these people who have been imprisoned and all of these other questions that we have about all of the Fed boys that ended up showing up to all of these other protests that happened after. Which even my girlfriend AOC will admit was the case. Which is cheating on Alex? What? No, she's cheating on Alex. She's a beautiful young woman who produces children. We're socialists. We share the means of production. It doesn't have to be this sort of, you know, Western monogamous culture. But even, you know, she would admit that this was the case. Even she will admit that this is the case and it's because it's a great photo op, you know, like that photograph of people just standing there, you know, not to disparage our base, but like if you've been to these types of things, typically they like to kind of dress up and pretend they're founding fathers and we're going over throw the government. They just want to stand there. It is what it is. But that's what they were doing and they wanted to take that photo and show it to like upper middle class, like white women and have them be like, oh my god, this is the one thing ever. The same thing that they did with January 6th, you know, our democracy was an insurrection. It was violent. We had a man whose head was caved in with a fire extinguisher. They run that once, the headline, the photos, and then it gets ingrained into the mind and then they move on, issue the retraction, like you said, much afterwards and then it gets like none of the engagement that the original story did. Yeah. And by the way, I do, I know we have to go to break, but I do also want to point out for that particular story that happened in Michigan. I don't know if you guys recall or if you put two and two together, I did say that the date was April 30th, 2020. So I'm just saying when the government shuts you down and doesn't allow you to run your business and feed your family, there may be some sort of resentment that comes from that and who else to address but the people who did it to you, not calling for violence, but just saying maybe they kind of had the protests at least coming. All right, we've got more to come. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Moink. So I don't know if you guys realize this 60% of United States pork production actually comes from a company that's owned by the Chinese and they give their hogs.

Funnily enough, including China, but you're going to find it in your grocery aisle every single day here in America. Thanks FDA. There is a better way you got to hear about Moink.

In other news, Rudy Giuliani has been informed that he is considered a quote target of the Georgia criminal investigation probing the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election over there in that state, an attorney for Giuliani, which is always, I get why they do it, but it's always funny when the attorney has an attorney. Any wonder how far removed that goes, but an attorney for Giuliani who is an attorney received a call yesterday informing them that he is the target. And this is two days before Giuliani is going to testify before the Fulton County special grand jury who is probing the case. 16 so-called alternate electors in the state were informed that they are also considered targets of the probe. And the House Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol has said that a plan set up by the Trump campaign in multiple swing states sought to assemble groups of individuals in key battleground states and got them to call themselves electors, created phony certifications, certificates associated with these fake electors and then transmitted these certificates to Washington and to the Congress to be counted during the joint session of Congress on January 6. And the grand jury, this is a special grand jury, they cannot return an indictment, they can only make recommendations concerning criminal prosecution. But it's just, you know, I guess if I were the Democrats, I probably would want to stay stuck in 2020 as well, because if you stay stuck in this, I mean, look, everyone at this table knows there's 81 million votes, Joe Biden obviously got in the safest and most secure election of all time, most popular president ever. And who wouldn't love Joe Biden if you look at him for 10 seconds, you know, he's vibrant and vivacious and like living and stuff, right? But I would want to say stuck in 2020 as well. And you know, the idea that Republicans tried to, you know, overturn results and the idea that they are claiming that it was stolen, because then I guess you wouldn't have to talk about the inflation and the gas prices and all of the schools trying to indoctrinate your children sexually. And all of the other crazy things that are going on on the left that I guess they wouldn't want to talk about when they're trying to win the midterms in November. So instead, we stay stuck in this constant loop of things that they say happened in 2020, which in my opinion, I'd like to hear yours gentlemen, but in my opinion is just a constant projection from them on that. Yeah, all the things that you just outlined aren't like defects of the machine, they are features of it. They refuse to pivot on any one of those issues. Like if you really push a leftist, for example, even our lovely new Supreme Court justice who was pushed on the issue of like how to define biologically like a female or a male and she refused to answer because she couldn't be like, oh, you know, well, I disagree with my party's position on that. These are all features and you have to pledge allegiance to virtually every component of it. And it's not so much that you pledge allegiance as an adult. You also have to indoctrinate the children. And of course, the iron law of indoctrination is the sooner you start, the less it has to make sense. And so, you know, I had a phone call recently with a relative of mine and a young girl and she's like completely brainwashed. And it's not even enough to have like a good familial influence. Like it doesn't matter. You know, when they're on their phones, they're being brainwashed into accepting all these narratives. And I think that parents think it's enough like, well, at least they're not out, you know, smoking, at least they're safe under my roof. And it's like they're on the internet. That's the equivalent of not being under your roof in terms of what they're being exposed to. That's a great point. Yeah, absolutely. What I want Americans to know that proactively right now what's happening across the country is their headhunting. They the left, they the Biden Biden admin in the puppeteers that pull his strings, Barack Obama, Rice, etc. They are headhunting all the brilliant legal minds in our country that's conservative, all of them. We've got some here out of Texas that now has to travel to that same special commission because Texas doesn't have the special commission in Georgia where they've calling Rudy Giuliani to you. And you're going to see and this is these are lawyers that a lot of Americans haven't even heard of. So it's not just Rudy Giuliani and some of the obvious figures that you've known. I'm talking about lawyers you've never heard of that somehow touched this subject matter at arms length or intentionally and they're calling all of them. All of them are being subpoenaed because they know there's a legal storm coming in their future too. They have overstepped constitutional boundaries again with the FBI now. They know that they are crossing the legal means outside of the purview of our constitution every single day. And at some point, just like anything, the pendulum will swing. There is hope for this country. It will turn. It will turn in November and it will turn in the White House again and they know, John, when it does, oh, hellfire is going to rain. They know. And so they are trying to, they're trying to clean, clean the bench. They're trying to clear the slate. I'm telling you they're proactively going after lawyers that you've never heard of, but just know we need these lawyers. We need them in our country. I know one of them personally. So do I. I know several of them and it's not good. Well, it doesn't make you sick though when you're we're talking about all of the things that were asserted in this 2020 election and we're talking about, you know, I mean, we go through the mail in, you know, ballots that drive the drive by, you know, mailboxes and all of that. But also the they weren't requiring they didn't, they weren't matching up the signatures. Meanwhile, over in LA, they were trying to recall the LA DA, George gat. How do you say his last name? Gascon? And they they failed to qualify for the ballot because I love this. They announced that only 520,050 of the 715,000 signatures it collected were valid because they had a bunch of invalid signatures. Some were not registered. Some were duplicate. Some were different addresses. Some were mismatched signatures. Some were canceled. Some were out of county addresses. And then of course, some were other. So they made sure to go through those with a fine tooth comb. Interestingly enough, that didn't happen in the election of 2020 in multiple different places. And we were just told to shut up and deal with it. But here, when it's a leftist in charge and a radical leftist at that, all of a sudden they get very, very particular with these signatures and make sure that they actually match to an address and that's the signature actually matches. It's interesting how that conveniently happens when the right person is in charge, according to them. Yeah, and I don't even believe them now that they've actually done that work. Okay, just some arbitrary 26,000 shorts. Sorry, guys. Oops, you got close. Well, I mean, it's very easy, especially to say like, Oh, recall these. It's a mismatch signature. Exactly. Like who's verifying this? Right. Where's proof and verify? Which was the problem? Where was that? Which was the problem in the election, right? Now you guys are saying you can do that? That's fascinating. But you were not allowed to proof and verify you had to stand 100 100 feet away. We couldn't even see the color of the person's eyes. Never mind whether the actual signature, whether there was actually a real person. Couldn't do it back then. I also seem to recall the same. Verify was evil back then. Well, voter fraud is just a conspiracy theory. Voter fraud doesn't happen except that, oh, the last story that I just said and also Starbucks is now asking the federal Labor Board to suspend all mail-in ballot union elections nationwide, alleging misconduct in the voting process by the board's personnel and the union organizing the baristas. First of all, I'm just fascinated that the baristas have a union. That kind of makes me mad. A friend of mine has a friend of mine has a coffee store in Seattle. It's actually the best coffee store in Seattle. Small coffee shop and his workers try to unionize it. But this is ironic. Now Starbucks is being targeted by the unions and Starbucks is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, yeah. Come on now. Yeah. What Starbucks? You can't come unionize. We're going to mail ballots in against you. No, no, no, no. You got to stop this emailing ballot nonsense. I mean, this is this is so laughable. Yeah. You bunch of clowns. Well, this is a circus show. There, John, last word on this. Look, Starbucks, of course, there could be fraud in elections for unions, but certainly not for the president or any sort of elections nationwide. No, of course not. But I mean, they're all the same coalition. You know, just like this big grand global, liberal coalition of people and they have power in every institution is not necessarily concentrated like, you know, the tyranny of days past. But I'll tell you, watching them reap and reap and reap and reap and reap, you know, it's really demoralizing. But when they finally, or I'm sorry, when they're they're sewing, but when they finally reap, it's like heroin to just watch, you know, they're unionizing and there's chaos and they're having to shut down stores and it's just, it's so good. Well, it's also frustrating because you're like, Oh, voter fraud happens. Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because you just spent two years telling us that it didn't and we were crazy for suggesting that it did. All right, we've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, iTargetPro. So, um, look, these are really bad in the cities right now. And if you guys, the last time you went into like a city city, but I was in downtown Dallas recently and I was there to go into a government building. So I couldn't carry. Yeah.

Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come. But it turns out our movie The Blind is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. Wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. OnTheBlindToday at blazetv.com slash TheBlind. Douglas Blair, who is a reporter for The Daily Signal, just asked DC Mayor Bowser how she could justify forcing 40% of unvaccinated black students to stay home from school because that's still a thing that they're doing over in DC. She says, look, you have the numbers wrong. Let's watch that exchange. We have reporting that around 40% of black students in the district are unvaccinated and therefore under the district's current policy regarding schools, we'll be unable to attend school come at the school semester starting. So why is the district continuing with this policy when it seems to disproportionately impact that students? I don't think that that number is correct. We have a substantially fewer number of kids that we have to engage with vaccination. And I explained why it's important. It's important for the public health of our students and that we can maintain safe environments. That's why Albert Borla, the CEO of Pfizer just recently got COVID again and Joe Biden got COVID again. And who else? The guy the Department of Defense. Yeah, I said Jill. Sorry, Joe and Jill. The face shield and the mask. What is his name? Austin. Yeah. And yeah, he also got COVID again. All of them, I think probably quadruple or maybe like five times they've gotten the shots. I don't know that probably can't keep count anymore. But definitely it's in the public health's best interest. Oh, also the reporter got those numbers from the DC coronavirus response website, which shows clearly that the 12 plus age bracket has a vaccination rate of 60%, which if you can do any math, you will realize that 40% of black children are unvaccinated because that's how math works. But he must not have, he's not working with the right numbers. It's just her numbers. It's just her own numbers that he's working with. I honestly can't believe that we are still doing this. This is like this in school and school specifically, right in schools. I get it that they want to be crazy everywhere else and it's still absurd. But in the schools where we already know that children are not at risk for this, not only that, but also it doesn't freaking matter if they get the shot because it doesn't prevent you from contracting the stupid virus. And still, she's forcing 40% of unvaccinated black students to stay home from school. Guys, listen, they are coming for your children. They're in doctorate. I just flew to Israel. No vaccine, no proof of proof of vaccine, no COVID test, France in two weeks, no COVID test, no vaccine, nothing. The whole world is nothing. They're dropping their requirements. No, there's nothing. France, I'm going to France. There's nothing anywhere, but we're going to let kids stay at home in Washington, D.C. Black kids, albeit, because it's just for their health. It's for their health. You need to believe us, right? Isn't it funny? It feels like what's the movie day after tomorrow? Now, would you just repeat like, Roundhog Day? I feel like we're here. Really read from the CDC's website information at this table, right? That they had to pivot on and say, well, no, that's not really what we meant. You really should wear the mask. Well, you shouldn't wear the mask. It's it. Well, another saying don't even treat unvaccinated or vaccinated patients differently when they contract the virus or otherwise. And also, you don't even have to isolate. Because let me say this, you're not doing an network. And I'm sorry, I hope we're not getting it kicked off. But they're dropping like flies. The triple quadruple vaccinated are dropping. And so yes, they're now saying, look, there's no disparishment internationally anymore with the most liberal countries. They're not even frowning upon. They don't even ask, hey, can you just give us a test before you come into the country? No. But in Washington, DC, children can't go to school. It's it's absurd. I mean, it's a sickness at this point. And I don't mean COVID. Human dropping, by the way, in praise and thanks for developing such an effective and safe or excuse me, safe and effective trademark vaccine. But the argument that you laid out was perfect. And I was so happy to hear it because that's the correct argument. Like you want us to get these vaccines. Okay. Well, you know, then the numbers and things like that. What that reporter seemed to be echoing was this argument that was going around for a while where I got a call from my dad. Great guy, but you know, he calls me. You see that article on Breitbart? And I'm like, no, dad. Well, you know, the demographic that's most likely to not take the vaccine is black people. And like, yeah. Just so in a way, it's actually racist against black people for these vaccine. Unlike like dad, we have to have an argument that's better than buying into their framework than anything black people do is like fantastic. If we're going to like not take this, you know, we can't just play into their framework and think that we're going to beat them at their own game by having our strongest argument be well, you know, forcing vaccines is actually racist against black people. The same way our strongest argument against affirmative action is that it actually is not very fair to Asian people. And it's like, come on, man. My strongest argument against affirmative action is Korean John Pierre. Mine is the whole country. And Kamala Harris. That's all you need to know for an argument against affirmative action. No, but I mean, it's just I don't disagree with your point, but I do wonder if I mean, you know, they have they have taught the black leftist voters. They've taught them to expect all of these things and to say anything if anything inconveniences them that it must be racist. So you do have to wonder if those people do take it as racist because they've been taught to internalize that anything that they find offensive must in turn be racist. But then I don't know if they would if they would feel that way about like their own kind, which I mean the left, okay, before anyone accuses me of saying something racist. Yeah, look, John, I hear you, but buddy, at some point here, we got to get truth back. You we have to they are changing language. You can laugh when you want. No, no, this country is going to hell. Literally, if we don't get truth back, we need to bring truth back and say, this is the definition of racism when you profile because of race. They're the ones who profile because of race. They can't have an argument without bringing up race. And this is this is generational cleansing and genocide. This is a eugenics program that they just launched. Historically, we have to get back to truth. I hear you, but I say fight them with every weapon you've got at this moment. Fight them with their own narrative, fight them with new weapons, just fight, stand up and draw a line in the sense. So let me so let me then just bring this up really quickly. You're talking about the definition of racism. Do you think perhaps this would include the Minneapolis Teachers Union, who now then their new contract stipulates that white teachers will be laid off or reassigned before quote educators of color, end quote, in the event that they do need to reduce staff? Would that would that happen to be the racism that you're that you're talking about? Exactly what I'm talking about. And it's ranked through this country. Yeah, that's that's true. That's my I have to clarify. The reason I was laughing is because you said truth, which made it sound like everything I said was just totally wrong. And you were trying to be really polite about that. No, I think you're wrong. I'll tell you, I think you're know what I mean is I know you're saying we can't take him with their narrative and their anger because they won't listen, but we got to fire every area you've got. Then I wasn't saying you're not being truthful. What I would tell you, there's I don't think your dad sounds like that. I think he's cooler than I felt bad when you that was a pretty mean and pressure. Yeah, you're actually like, he's watching way cooler than that. He's watching he is. He's way cooler than that. Sir, I will correct your son on national television. Any day of the week, that was not fair. All right. But it's he's your dad. So you got to give him a little bit of a hard time. That's just kind of the rules. So I got it. All right. We got to take another break. First, we want to think our sponsor, Patriot Mobile.

We pay our phone bills. And what you don't realize is that Patriot Mobile is taking some of that money and they're donating it to all of these causes that you're working for. The other mobile companies, big mobile companies, are actually taking a portion of your money that you're working very hard for and donating it to places like Planned Parenthood and places who want to take your guns.

I know this is probably pretty shocking at least to one of my panelists who happens to be Catholic. So I feel like you'll be the expert here in this matter. Do you have your Rosary? Of course I have my Rosary. As the resident Catholic, I will say, you know, there's a very powerful thing I have here as evidence by even the article. The reason why I don't like to have radical symbols on my show, are you really going to you're going to put? Oh my gosh, she's possessed by a demon. Oh my gosh, he pulled it out. The reason they don't like it is because it's real. And it's true. I mean, anytime the media goes after Christianity, typically they're going after the Catholic church, or even, you know, the way it's depicted in films. I mean, typically, when you see Christianity, it's within the context of the Catholic church. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is a great example of this. And the reason they don't like the Rosary is because we are taught as Catholics that when you recite the Rosary, you pray the Rosary, it literally sends like shockwaves through hell. And so when we were at the drag bar in Dallas, there was a gay bar in Dallas where they were bringing children for one of these drag shows, we were standing outside and we were praying a Rosary. Now, if we were standing outside and we were saying, you know, oh, the statistics from this UCLA study say that what you're doing is going to have a 7% increase in blood. It would have been like, okay, who cares? But we're praying. And for some reason, that made the people who would, if you agree that we're in a spiritual war, be the most likely to be possessed by or influenced by demons, screech like you've shined sunlight on a vampire. I think there's something to be said about that. So that's why they're attacked. No, and let's say a little more about that. We are in a spiritual battle. It's not a battle of flesh and blood. And the spiritual portals that are open, the demonic realm is open. It's wild because it's allowed to be. And what you're talking about, John, and they're actually accurate. There's power in prayer. Whether it's a Rosary and if you're not a Catholic, you're a Southern Baptist, you know, Protestant, non-denominational, the power of prayer to Christ, not Allah, Buddha, or whoever else, right, is powerful. And it is a stench in the nostrils of the demonic forces. That's a promise. And so, may we operate more in that place as a country, actually doing spiritual battle. So pull that Rosary out, fly it high, pray like crazy. What is Mark Walberg saying now, every day, be prayed up? Does he really? Every day. You know, I mean, just the title in itself is just absurd on its face. But when you get into the what this guy, what is his name, Daniel Panettin actually said, it just gets even more absurd. He said, just as the AR-15 rifle has become a sacred object for Christian nationalists in general, the Rosary has acquired a militaristic meaning for radical traditional or rad-trad Catholics. And he said, on this extremist fringe, Rosary beeth have been woven into a conspiratorial politics and absolutist gun culture. These armed radical traditionalists have taken up a spiritual notion that the Rosary can be a weapon in the fight against evil and turned it into something dangerously literal. That's like literally, see, they're just now picking up on what we've been saying for hundreds and hundreds of years about like this is a literal weapon. You know, it's only now in the last few hundred years, our perception in the West of Christianity, and this was Nietzsche's criticism of it, is this very effeminate sort of religion where it almost rationalizes cowardice to be a virtue and turn the other cheek. The history of Christianity is very violent and militaristic and very, I guess, convicted and it's very sort of binary understanding of right and wrong, which is like, it's really silly. You don't have to worry. I mean, when we pray the Rosary saying, you know, St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, if you're not a demon, you're going to be fine. You have nothing to work with. You're going to be good. But if you're working for Satan, you know, the sort of St. Michael, it's going to be fantastic. I'd rather get that. The problem. A lot of agents have satan loose at this moment. Well, it just fascinates me that they're tying it to gun culture. Right. Well, they have to, right? They've got, it's the scare tactics and it's like, you know, it's like better trying to convince everybody the AR-15 was designed for the Vietnam war, right? And like, Brody, you have your, you have your eras wrong here. Did you want to, did you see the show yesterday? No. I had the, the, the guy who laughed at, oh, you referenced a work saying that the AR-15 was designed for Vietnam. It was designed to go through the helmets of the soldiers and all of that. And the guy laughed. And of course, a war called him an MF or, and I had that guy on yesterday to talk about it. Oh, really? Because yeah, he was like, yeah, he's a veteran. He's a gun store owner. And he, of course, was laughing at the absurdity of what a work was saying, not, of course, laughing at anything that happened in Uvaldi, which is, of course, you can tell because that wasn't what he was saying when the gentleman laughed. But of course, they want to take it and spend it and say, you're crazy. Of course, and exploiting Uvaldi was made of war. That's right. Right. He exploited Uvaldi. Right. Right. Well, he exploits everything. Okay. So let's just get it right. Yeah. Horrible person. Did I mention that he's a horrible person? Who? Robert Francis O'Rourke. Oh, he's a horrible person. He's a horrible person. Okay. Like, but when I say horrible, I mean, like garbage person. So not, not the otherwise. Okay. Hold on. I promise you all they're really great people. Don't stoop. Don't stay up here. Oh, no, no, no. No, he actually is a really bad person. No, I know. I know. I'm not, I'm not being facetious. He just really is because I've seen him in action. So just, I'm just going to say that. I'm going to leave that right there. All right. We got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Did he attack you or something? Now he's a people. She's in the lawsuit. He stood, he stood by all this staffer. Oh yeah. He stood by well, staffer. Let's also be a friend of taking my phone. University of Alabama student Grant Sykes stated that he attempted to join multiple sororities, but sadly enough, he was unanimously rejected. I can't imagine why. Perhaps it was the penis. He posted his quest on TikTok, which accrued several million views, but the sororities dismissed the idea of a man with a penis joining their female groups. Watch. Oh, O.T.D. Bama Rush day one, a convocation in open houses today. And this is what I'm wearing. So this skirt is from Lulu. It's the new pink edition. My shoes are Air Force. Of course, my shirt is from Sheen. It's the really, really cute one that's like, everything's going to be okay. And my jewelry is from all over the place. And yeah, and my hair and makeup is done by yours truly. So wish me luck. No, I won't. I won't. I won't. And in fact, I'm glad that they rejected it. Well, Tied. So he said, unfortunately, this chapter is closed. This recruitment journey is over for me being dropped from my last house this morning during primary recruitment at the University of Alabama. It doesn't come as a surprise considering out of the almost 20 chapters I was dropped by every single one, except two before day one, he said, I'm hopeful of a future where everyone is welcomed for just being themselves everywhere. Yeah, not going to happen. Well, I mean, you want to be welcomed for yourself somewhere. You could consider joining a fraternity where you belong. Exactly. I don't know. The frat boys probably wouldn't take too kindly to that. I would hope that they would, but I'm just saying that would be where you would be welcomed. It's not going to make it into the frat house. It's not going to make it into the sorority. Maybe you need to make it into the psych house. Yeah, he's just not going to make it just periods. It's just not going to make it. It's really unsettling when things like this happen in places like Alabama, which I mean, you would think I was being- I think that was by design, because he knew we'd get attention, he'd get a million views. He knew no-bama sorority. Yes, he- It's almost like- It's almost like I think it's a word. It's almost like he does things for attention because he just wants the attention. See? Because he's- Huh. Like acting like a woman. See? Women like attention. Whoa! You had to throw that in there at the end. All right, bye. I'm much more homophobic than I am sexish. I promise you that. No comment. All right, we have to go now. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
