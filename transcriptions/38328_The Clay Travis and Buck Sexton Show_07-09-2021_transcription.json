Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome to our three of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. I am going to be talking to you with Clay here in a few moments about the Texas voting law. We've got updates for this hour, I should say. We'll be talking to you about that signed into law. Governor Abbott now has this voting law that is really well, we'll break down the details of the voting SB one ended up happening. But we've got updates on Afghanistan too. How are we getting people out? Who's getting out is a Biden administration standing in the way. First, as promised, we have here in studio our friend, Zuby, who is a podcaster, rapper, author, public intellectual and general life and fitness guru, Zuby. Welcome man. I know you've been making making the rounds across the states. How's it going? I'm doing great man. Happy to be here. So you are from the UK originally spent a lot of time there. You've been a critic of lockdown or ism or we call it Fauciism here. Fauci doesn't matter as much to you guys as you know, across the across the ocean as it does to us here. Unfortunately for us, but how's the US doing compared to what you've seen in in Europe when it comes to the lockdown madness? Yeah, it's interesting. I've been opposed to all of this since day one, you know, March 2020. I think it's man with a lot of things. It's kind of difficult to compare the UK with the USA because this place is so much bigger. The USA is like a continent. So as I've seen already from my travels here in the US and from what I was seeing from afar, depending on what state and even what city you're in within a state, you can see a big range of different responses from outdoor mask mandates and lockdowns and certain places to it basically seeming like COVID doesn't even exist in other places. 100% normal people living normally, no restrictions, no mandates. Everybody's just going around their business as usual and not dropping down dead. So it's kind of weird. I mean, in the UK, I left about six weeks ago now. So before I left, there were still some restrictions in place. And as it stands, I believe everything has been has been dropped now. But they're still threatening to bring in the so-called vaccine passports. They're threatening to potentially go into another lockdown in a couple of months. So I think the UK is in a little bit of a precarious position, just like I think some of the blue states and cities in particular here are as well. To be, I appreciate you joining us. The first time I became aware of you was when you did, because you're a comedian as well, some hysterical videos breaking all of the women's lifting records. You're a pretty strong dude. And I'm a sports guy originally. So this idea that men and women should be competing against each other or that transgender athletes should be competing against each other. You know, we just had the Olympics where we had a male who decided to become a woman competing to try to win weightlifting championships. It's a pretty significant biological difference between the two. Every, I think that every state champion, for instance, in Texas over the last 20 years for high school is faster than the male is faster than the fastest woman of all time. When did you come up with the idea to do these weightlifting challenges? And what were the responses to you becoming the strongest woman in the history of the world? Well, it's an issue that I've been observing for a couple of years. And I was telling people that this was going to happen. It was the inevitable logical conclusion of the ideology that was being pushed, right? Saying that anybody who, anybody can be whatever gender they identify at any given moment. You don't even need to be consistent because you can be gender fluid as well. So actually, when I posted that just that morning, I'd seen a few stories coming out of the USA, in fact, which were about biological males dominating women in their sports. So out of curiosity, I just thought, man, I've got a really strong deadlift. I wonder what I wonder whether British women's deadlift record is in my weight class. So I looked it up and I saw that it was about 50 or 60 kilograms below my maximum. And I was just like, Oh, hey, I had that video on my phone. I posted that nine second video thinking, uh, okay, if I find this funny, a few other people will find it funny. And lo and behold, it was seen by millions upon millions of people, put me on tons of people's radar. And it was really the catalyst for a lot of people to discover all of the other things that I do. In terms of pushback, it was, you know, maybe like 0.5%, maybe for every 200 messages of support I got. I got one attempting to criticize me, but really it was a checkmate position. Because if someone believes in this ideology, they either need to accept me as the British women's deadlift record holder, or they have to say that I'm not actually a woman, which according to their own logic is transphobic. So they need to pick one. Yeah. And explain why, right? One of the big questions that comes up, and I know this is now, it's really in the West in general. It's in the US, Canada, and Western Europe too. What is, what is a woman is something that conservatives like to ask the question of because they won't give you a clear answer on it. And that affects things like the sports competitions that we're talking about here. Yeah. I mean, a woman is an adult human female. We've known this for a very long period of time. This audience knows this. I think everybody knows it. I don't believe that anybody truly, truly in their heart deep down believes in the nonsense that they're saying with this. I don't believe anybody believes it. It sounds like you also, though, experience that there's a very small, but incredibly loud, influential and vicious minority of opinion makers, really opinion police about issues like this that will come and on the transgender rights issue, a lot of conservative conservatives. I know I've said they've experienced more hatred, perhaps for standing against that madness when it comes to things like the sports competitions than anything else. Yep. Same goes for women as well. You know, there's a lot of groups of even feminists are very split on this issue. Yeah. I'm curious here. We get this question a lot. And I wonder what you would say. How do you win these debates, right? I mean, how do we get to the point where the idea of men competing against women? I think for almost anyone out there is fundamentally ludicrous. That goes to the direct heart of sports. It's why we separated men and women's sports forever, because as you demonstrated in becoming, congratulations, the strongest women's deadlifter in the history of Britain, if men are competing against women, then women never win. And effectively women's athletics cease to exist. That's the logical extension of where this leads. How do we end up winning this debate? Well, you can't get someone out of a position using logic if they reach that position without logic. If someone's come into a conclusion purely based off of emotion or raw ideology, then trying to logic your way out of it directly won't help. It'll just fall on deaf ears. I actually think the right way to do it is to do an extension of what I did and take take the notion and run with it, right? Run with it. Get a whole bunch of male athletes to claim that they are women in all sorts of sports and start infiltrating the women's leagues. And this thing will end within a week. Zuby, well, I'm just forever listening. We're joined by Zuby, who is a podcaster, author, global champion female deadlifter by his own admission slash, also a guy who has a lot of thoughts on on COVID and a range of issues right now. Just what's it like for a guy who is black and British and stepping on the public stage on some of these very contentious issues and is being embraced by conservatives in America? How does that feel? Are you surprised by it at all? Um, not really. I mean, it's, it's great. I've been, I've been to seven cities over the past five or six weeks from Istanbul to New York to Dallas, Texas. And I've been stopped in the street in every single city, even on my way here to the station by people telling me that they appreciate what I do and that they're happy to know that there's other sane people out there, people willing to speak the truth, people willing to have these conversations and to jump on some of these landmines. And, um, I don't think it's necessarily about being conservative. I think it's about being sane at this stage. Zuby, I think what's fascinating is in America, and I know this is spread to Europe as well, but identity politics are the foundation now of the Democratic party. And also I would say identity politics twinned with canceled culture as a comedian. Uh, and a lot of what you do is cut through the illogical nature of many of the arguments out there using humor. To me, comedians need to be a massive part of punching back against identity politics and cancel culture. And they can do it in a way that illuminates, which is rare, I think, for the conservative space, the absurdity of left wing politics. And we're seeing it from guys like Bill Maher, for instance, who now are recognizing that the humor here of Democratic positions lends them very much to satire. And obviously with your weightlifting challenge, that's a big part of it. But it's a big part of intellectual freedom in general. Comedians can't make jokes unless they have a wide expanse of range. When you talk with other comedians, how much of a topic is canceled culture and the identity politics universe and what can and can't be said? Well, I'm not, I mean, I'm not a comedian. I'm just a guy who, uh, you know, I'm an artist. I do know some comedians. Um, when I've had those conversations with a handful of comedians that I do know, though, I mean, they do a lot of self policing, just like everybody else does. The majority of the censorship that's going on right now in the Western world is self inflicted. Um, if you're in a country like the UK or Canada, then yes, there are governmental infringements on freedom of speech. And I know people who have been investigated and even prosecuted for things that they've posted online on Twitter or on YouTube. But primarily what it is is just every American, every British person, every Canadian, the vast majority of people choosing to massively over self censor themselves and self police there themselves just from basic opinions like, Hey, I voted for Brexit. I voted for Trump. You know, this is my position on this. That's my position on that. I think there's a pandemic of cowardice that's going on. And I think that if everybody could simply be 10 to 20% more bold and a little bit more courageous, especially when you're dealing with stuff that's absurd, then I think we'd get through a lot of this. Zubi, where can people go to appreciate your work, including a rapper and podcaster, right? So is it all all in one place or where should folks go? The one I hear what you're up to? Sure.

My mental health meds were helping, but they led to uncontrolled movements called TD Tardive dyskinesia. It felt like my movements were in the spotlight.

Follow us along, whether it's Instagram, whether it's Twitter, whether it's Facebook, we are there for you until those big tech companies decide to ban us. And speaking of the banning that is going on, do you remember when all the members of the Texas State House were heroes and how everybody was saying, oh, man, look at the stand that they're taking. They're on the Capitol steps. They're doing such an incredible job fighting back in favor of voting rights. And this is going to be a tremendous accomplishment. And they all were hanging out in their hotel rooms and they were getting on MSNBC and CNN. This story just kind of started to fade. Because people didn't really care that much. And the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott said, hey, you know what? I'm just going to keep calling special sessions. And eventually they're going to have to come back to the state. And eventually we're going to pass the legislation that they're trying to avoid passing. Yeah, it passed. Let's listen to cut 29 right now. The Texas law, it does make it easier than ever before for anybody to go cast a ballot. It does also have where, however, make sure that it is harder for people to cheat at the ballot box in Texas. It's now a fate accomplice, so to speak, Buck Sexton. There's no ability to stop this from becoming law. And it's amazing how this story has sort of disappeared. Now, partly that might be because now everybody's suddenly pivoted to abortion. The abortion law out of Texas. But the voting rights bill is effectively done. Democrats accomplish nothing. Governor Abbott also has got a challenge. She got a couple challenges right now from from the right for his governor's chair, including Alan West, among others. So he knows he's got a he's got to step it up a little bit as governor. So the if he wants to maybe Matthew McConaughey, if he wants the people at well, that's on the Democrat side. But if you want to have it still, it's got a crazy. But here's some of the things that it does. Bands 24 hour and drive through voting. New vote by mail ID mandates, bans officials from mailing unsolicited mail in ballot applications, empowers poll watchers. By the way, this is the CNN version of it. Monthly voter roll checks, new requirements for assisting voters. All this sounds great. I mean, it's funny. I'm reading this. The ACLU was already this is the most tyrannical thing in the history of tyranny. We're going to sue I mean, of all these lives who are, oh, this is Jim Crow 2.0. Oh, this is voter suppression. Clay, it expands voting access from where it was before in the state of Texas. It has much more expansive voting access than New York state or Delaware, some of these very deep blue states. But they're just going to lie about it to people and say that it's a voter suppression bill. You know what I think is interesting, Buck is I think the Democrats have so wildly overplayed their hand here. And I think the wild overplay was when Joe Biden got up and said, Hey, this is like the Civil War. This is the most dangerous moment in our country's history. And even when they pulled the Major League Baseball game out of Georgia, remember when all that, all that debate was going on. And then you started looking. I mean, all these states that are supposedly suppressing the vote are actually have way more liberal voting policies than Joe Biden's home state of Delaware. In the state of Texas, for example, voter ID, including for mail-in ballots has a support in the range of 80% of all races of, by the way, of all, yeah, all Texans across the border, but 80% say, yeah, voter ID. So yeah, if you're like a hardcore leftist or you don't understand what the question is, maybe you oppose voter ID. Short of that, any Texan would want voter ID provisions, but the media just ignores, you always talk about the data clay, ignore the actual data and run with the narrative. I mean, to what you're saying with the overreach, for a reasonable person, of course, what you're saying is true. But I feel like Democrats, they fundraise off this, they play to the lunatic MSNBC watching base. I don't know if they if they pay a price for this. Otherwise, why would they keep doing it? Why keep lying about it if it hurts them? I think what they're doing is setting up when they lose in 2022. Oh, yeah. They're going to argue in 2024, we've got to fight back against racism and Jim Crow 2.0, because the entire democratic campaign basically boils down to, as you know, bucks, ex, then everything is racist. That's their entire campaign. You know, this is an incredibly important week to remember those who have fought for our freedoms. An important week to remember those who raced to the Twin Towers in Manhattan and the Pentagon, when the nation was attacked, an important week to remember the selfless people on United Flight 93, tunnel the towers foundation doing their part to honor heroes, 200 mortgage free homes for gold star and fallen first responder families with young kids and for veterans and first responders with serious life altering injuries. The homes bring hope and improve lives help tunnel the towers support even more heroes and families in need by donating $11 a month at t2t.org.

My military estimate is that the conditions are likely to develop of a civil war and that will then in turn lead to conditions that could in fact lead to a reconstitution of al-Qaeda or a growth of ISIS or other myriad of terrorist groups. You could see a resurgence of terrorism coming out of that general region within 12 24 36 months 12 months 36 months five years 10 years who knows that was the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Millie welcome back to clay traveston bucks acts and show this is boc that was General Millie he still has his job which makes it very hard for anyone to think or believe that there's accountability for a clear screw up with the withdrawal I mean that's putting it mildly but you know because of the FCC there's only certain words I can use here it's very obvious that there were senior level decisions made on the military side that should require resignations it didn't really happen in fact in response to what General Millie just said there on on Fox former acting DNI Rick Grinnell great guy no Rick smart guy here's uh here's what he said about Millie's we could see a resurgence of terrorism but I know General Millie and I've been highly disappointed that he's being very political that is an answer to cover yourself for later now that those warnings are happening I've also heard him say that General Miller who was in charge of Bagram gave advice to shut down Bagram now I can tell you that that's not true I know that very first-hand information I know that General Miller made those stark warnings to Jake Sullivan and said do not close Bagram and Bagram was closed our troops were removed we left 10% of the Americans behind look the Joe Biden doctrine the Biden doctrine for the rest of history will be 90% is good enough and I think that that's shameful and the American people should not feel safer when they have a president of the United States willing to take 10% of us and leave us you know Clay he's obviously talking about his version there the the former DNI Rick or no saying what he views the Biden doctrine as there was a piece in New York Times News Analysis not even editorial over the weekend on the Biden doctrine and it's amazing to watch them try to clean up on aisle five here of oh it's Biden is trying to balance strategic priorities with the the Biden doctrine is you're screwing up stop stop screwing up I mean there's actually no framework here there's there's no way to look at this other than to say this guy Biden has been wrong for a long time and a lot of things when it comes to foreign policy and here he's right that's the Biden doctrine I just keep looking at Joe Biden every time he speaks buck whether it's on Afghanistan which a disaster whether it's on the border whether it's on the murder rate whether it's on his new 3.5 trillion dollar budget bill which I know we haven't really talked about a great deal I think we'll probably touch on some this week in in more substance but obviously that's struggling because you've had Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kirsten cinema of Arizona come out and say even as Democrats they're not going to be willing to support it I don't we've been asking how covet ends buck I don't I'm genuinely afraid of how this Biden administration ends because every single week and every single month it seems to me that Joe Biden is further in the grips of deteriorating mental condition I think I think they think they're past this already Clay I think that they believe that this is the Afghanistan thing yeah they're no big deal the american some will get out some won't yeah there's some delays but they got the media in their back pocket I mean do you do you think there's still yeah they're worried about his poll numbers no question and I think you're talking about his mental faculties yeah whole whole other thing but in Afghanistan I think they're all I mean they're already rolling out the narrative of Joe Biden got it done sure it was messy but it was always going to be messy and they're rewriting the history of the last 30 days in process right now I think that's their hope I think their hope is just that Americans have the memories of goldfish and that whatever occurs next is going to make people forget the problem that I think the Biden administration has here is when every story ends with you being incompetent and a failure there's a pretty good theme that's going on so to me Afghanistan sticks in the mind of the american public because it further confirms the failure of the Biden administration and what they need buck is something that is significant of a story enough that takes away the attention from all the things that they're failing on I don't know what that is and I'm sure they're sitting down right now as they enter into the fall trying to scramble because think about it but just I mean if you weren't trying to make an argument pretend that you are the advocate for Joe Biden covid you've totally failed on I think we need to keep hammering this there are twice as many people in the hospital right now with covid as we're in the hospital last labor day okay he's failed on covid he's failed on the border he's failed on crime all over this country he has failed on Afghanistan he's failed on everything that he has touched I think they're going to try to argue infrastructure and I think they're going to try to argue the budget I'm not sure either of those get through and then we're going to be into 2022 so I just to me this is a White House without ideas and without the functional ability to advocate an effective way on behalf of the American public I just I think it's going to keep getting worse your your report card though is all rooted in reality and in results and what's actually happened you know how the democrats how they get Joe Biden elected I mean there were a lot of things that would end up changing the laws in states breaking the constitution in certain states covid was obviously a huge part of it but they told us this lie that one Joe Biden was a guy who would you know bring together the country and he wouldn't be just some part of the left but also beyond that that they they never thought that he was competent clay the people that really pay attention to politics and know Joe Biden understood that he was deteriorating understood that it was obvious that it was reckless to put this guy in the commander in chief role but it was in their minds fully the lies they told are still fully justified in their minds because it's not trump for four more years and we haven't even talked about so yeah you're right I mean I obviously agree we talk about the failures all over the place but you know in the next year the narrative is going to shift to racism the insurrection the war on women all these distractions and the media apparatus you know only a small percentage of the country is going to be the difference in the midterms really when you look at it the media apparatus is still 90 95 percent in the tank for the democrats we have a lot to overcome even with your report card of reality that reflects as poorly as it does on the actual by administration policies I think the challenge for them is even with all that in the tank when you control the entire government it's hard to argue that somebody else is responsible for your failures now here's what I think they'll do in response to that you own the house you own the senate you own the presidency and I kind of own the senate right like a tiny bit they're going to try to shift the attention of the Supreme Court that's what I think their pivot is going to be I think if you look forward they're going to argue that the Supreme Court is blocking is blocking the full fruition of the Biden White House and the by and the and the House for Nancy Pelosi and everything and they're going to make the Supreme Court the foil in 2022 and probably in 2024 there's also that there's the Biden court packing commission they call it something they call it the you know judicial fairness investing whatever it's it's the Biden court packing commission and and that's look that's you're right that's going to be a part of the narrative especially with this whole war on women abortion thing that's you know the state of Texas has this really interesting law on the way that they've instituted I think you're going to see other states go along with this too one thing that I don't think has got enough attention with all that clay as well and we can come back into this although we never I know you we never have enough time clena we could do a six hour show it's literally we could do a six hour show every day don't worry we're not going to but we could do a six hour show every day but it is I think it is it is a statement almost a fact I mean you could say it's it's an assessment but I think it's an assessment for which it's very hard to find a strong counter argument that as we see this playing out right now in Texas and heading to supreme court over the abortion issue Donald Trump's election win in 2016 and Donald Trump as a president was the most pro-life most consequential pro-life president since Roe v. Wade was adopted Donald Trump will have done more for the cause of life as president based on just the supreme court picks that he's made than anyone who can be formed that's pretty remarkable especially when I'm sure you see not a Trump world they're saying he smells weakness with Biden it's looking more and more like he may do it but oh he's I would be stunned at this point if he doesn't run and he almost was it two weeks ago that we had him on the last everything runs together I can we're gonna get him to do it we're gonna get him to do it we're gonna do it during the Murr Lago show announced on our show we're gonna go to Mar-a-Lago and give him three hours to hang out with us at some point in the meantime if we've learned anything since 2020 nothing quite as important as a powerful immune system over 20 years ago dr.

american way welcome back in play Travis buck sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us on this tuesday good to be back with my man buck i was out friday buck was out monday we're back together now after a nice labor day break and i was just playing during the commercial break for you buck a lot of the crowds college football we heard earlier dr fauci saying that he didn't like the fact that all these masked millions of people were willing to go to college football games and stadiums that were packed all over the country but you are hearing and i heard it in person so many college kids out there with anti-jobeiden chance that are breaking out inside of stadiums i've never seen anything like are they yelling fauci joe biden because it's something like that there is there's an f-word in front of joe biden and i i mean i've been going to college football games my entire life and i have never heard a group of college kids chanting anti american president uh chance like this and look when joe biden's got a 43 percent approval rating from npr polls buck when the new york times is writing uh articles on their editorial page why is joe biden so unpopular we were just talking in the last segment if i i always like to think about uh politics from the perspective of okay let's try to figure out what both sides can do to maximize their uh their perspective as we come into the fall i think it's fair to say that joe biden has had one of the most disastrous opening years in modern american history as the president i think that's fair to say whether you're a democrat or a republican in terms of approval rating in terms of actual substantive accomplishments in terms of being able to point to anything that is that is impressive is accomplished okay so what do they do now so it but what's fascinating is that if they had a vice president that they really believed in yes i think you would see it think it would be much more likely that there would be right now a ground swell among democrats for not that joe biden's not gonna resign he's not gonna step down that's never gonna happen okay that's actually not going to happen but there's a there would be a ground swell for and he said this himself people forget this now one term only pass the torch of the vp and you would start to hear that realistically after the midterms you still could see something like that there may still be some democrats who say that were a year out we'll have to see but in the meantime what's very clear is that even democrats recognize comala is not gonna get it done comala you know running they can't hand the presidency to comala harris she would have to she would have to run you know joe biden was stepped down she'd run as the i guess as the incumbent um and well it depends on how they did it but anyway the point being she would have to actually become the head of the democrat party in clay i think that even democrats recognize that that's not going to work so then maybe you get to they run joe biden you always said the weekend at bernie's presidency yeah we get into bernie's part two they get joe biden to run maybe he wins and then he steps down in the beginning of term two as as dastardly as that scheme may seem what you put it be how you put it beyond democrats they're about to lie about covid stuff in a year and how it's too dangerous to be in line to vote so they can try to win more elections than midterms i i think here's what i wish i wish the presidential election was next year because i think if trump ran he would absolutely obliterate whoever is running in uh whoever's going to be running for the democrats if the election were in 2022 there are so many things that can happen between now and 2024 that it's hard to forecast exactly where we'll be right where we'll be who's going to run like i mean would you have foreseen if we were sitting here in you know 2013 and one of us had come on the air and said hey you know i think 2016 it's going to be between hillary clinton and i think donald trump's going to run and i think he's going to beat hillary clinton but would have been a pretty crazy prediction i remember i was i was in uh i was in conservative media at the time clay and i was over at cnn and there were all these different i was the on you know an on air conservative when they still allowed they don't even allow that anymore but they used to have they'd have like you know they'd bring you on that say ahem right wing lunatic buck sexton wants to weigh in on this one and just let everybody just attack you with the whole thing but but even at that stage they let's never forget they put trump on air at cnn in 2015 going into the 2016 election they put him on air because they thought it was funny they thought it was amusing it's good to read how dumb these republicans are they're going with this guy and of course we got the last laugh which is why clay also they never would forgive trump because the thing that he did it was even more than about the supreme court picks and how there's now a real threat to roe thank god and all these real real policy changes that came from trump the the unforgivable sin of donald trump as far as the media was concerned was that he was a threat to the vanity of the journo elites they would that was too far too much calling them fake news all of it 25% we should mention the study that came out 25% of trump sorry of biden voters now regret their vote and so i don't think there's any way they can weekend at bernie style to try to drag him across the finish line i just i'm not even sure what they pivot to i think abortion and the supreme court will be one of the things they try to distract people with i mean i think that's where they feel maybe they can energize some supporters who aren't energized in any way by joe biden i'm curious to see what happens with the budget because i think that's a big part of this too if roe if roe is struck down though as we've talked about here clay and this will be a big issue from now until june it just goes back to the states and then what i think will happen is people will see okay well state legislatures will pass laws about this and some will have you know a six week or a ten week or whatever restriction others will be abortion at any time for any reason and when people see that it's not actually this handmaids tail distopia that they're the lea so i'm not i mean that it's it's a great point it may not even be the issue they think it is so you know basically everything is racist i think is their most like oh and and class warfare socialism stuff there you go and we'll see what happens with the budget it's going to be huge i think to see whether biden can get that pushed through it and i'm not sure that he can thanks for being here with us play not excited be back with you please check out the clay travis and bucks exit show podcast you missed any part of today back tomorrow talk to you
