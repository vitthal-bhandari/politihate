    "text": " Today, the experts say your child can now be gender-preyous. Yes, yes, I'm serious. Planned Parenthood says they may have to shut down in Texas and Joe Biden touts Bidenomics because things are going really well, right? Right? We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. MUSIC Welcome to the News and White Matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and today, although you over there at home are likely feeling the squeeze of inflation, you know, higher gas prices, way more expensive groceries, spending hundreds of dollars per month than you did just two years ago and just a general feeling of economic insecurity. Our dementia riddle leader Joe Biden is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, inexplicably taking a victory lap on of all things his economic record watch. We pay for low wage workers as grown at the fastest rate in two decades. Prices are growing faster than inflation. Yeah, that's actually not true. By the way, wages are down 3% and everything sucks, but all right, whatever you say, Joe. And it isn't just Biden gaslighting you on the economic instability of the country. His Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is here to tell you that not only, you may not know this, guys, not only are your finances stable, you're actually financially comfortable here in 2023. 75% of Americans believe the economy is in poor condition. And maybe that's because, again, even though inflation rates have come down, they are still paying more. 63% of people in this poll disapprove of how President Biden is handling the economy. What do you say, Secretary Ellen, to the clear majority of Americans who simply do not believe that the administration is helping them? Well, you know, Americans know best, I think, about their own personal finances. And it is important to recognize that when they're asked, how are they personally doing over 70% of Americans say that they're very comfortable with their financial situation. So they seem to perceive the economy as a whole, as doing less wealth than they are personally. But most Americans feel good about their own economic situation. Mm, okay. Well, in other completely unrelated news, a new report shows that the homeless population in the country has experienced its largest spike on record this year, with a roughly 11% increase marking the largest jump in over 15 years of tracked data. According to the Wall Street Journal, the surge in homelessness is primarily due to rising housing costs and rent rising over 15% nationally since the pandemic, with the national median rent price at $2,000 in $2,029. And that, my friends, is the real Bidenomics here to discuss this and more. We have Eric July, Blaise, TV contributor and founder and owner of Ripiverse Comic, also host of For Cannon's sake. But honestly, he's got too many titles. And I just, I get confused sometimes. Also joining us, Jason Buttrill, who I'm really mad at because I don't want to spoil anything, but he already taped Glenn's show for tonight. And just saying he dressed way nicer for Glenn's show than he did. I got out of that as fast as I could. Literally, just before this, he already had it on and he took it off to come on my show. He put on his dirty clothes to come on the news and why it matters. I'm not going to say I used your dressing room to do that, but I'm not saying that. So I just like the audacity of this administration to continue to lie and pretend like you, no, come on, Americans are doing great. They love the state of the country these days. They're not at all worried about their stocks, about their 401K, about their retirement investments, about, I don't know, just the US dollar itself. Americans love the way things are going. I really don't think that's the case. All right, I don't know how much time I got to take care of this issue of inflation. But let's be very clear Biden sucks. He has done absolutely everything that he could, let's say in his power as well as his party to exacerbate the issues that had already existed. But I'm going to just give you guys some perspective here as far as what has happened, definitely when they legitimize this fraud in 2020, roughly around that time, whatever you want to call it, the pandemic, whatever that is and all of the money that was fluctuating around that time. But 2020 and like what, 2022, you're talking on an upward of, let's say this, most of the money supply have been printed during that window of time. That's where the inflation comes, right? And then you had simultaneously the least economic activity that this country may have ever seen in modern history because well people weren't working because well, in a lot of cases it was illegal for them to do so. So you're printing money out to Wazoo, the Fed in combination with the Treasury, and you have low economic activity during that period of time. And because crack smokers seem to think that you could just print money, it's just out of thin air and there's going to be absolutely no consequences. And then on top of the printing of the money, they're giving away this fake money like it's going out of style. And the Republicans were in on it including Donald Trump's crackhead ass. I'm sorry I have to go out there and yes, y'all can be mad at me and start screaming and screeching. He was in on it too. I'm so sick of this damn issue of inflation and economic issues and we sit up here and gripe at the table all damn long and it's like, whoa, it's just Biden. It's just the Democrats know the Republicans were in on it too and you can sit up there and say, well, he had his hands tied. Stop mentioning about the problem then. That's why it's an issue. It's a combination of a few different things but it's not that complicated to understand whether this comes from if you want to have this issue, be resolved. The harsh reality is there's nothing that the president can do. What they can do is get the hell out of the way and shut up. That's it. Stop these massive spending bills that they continue to just say, all right, we don't have the money. The government, let me get this right. The government, every single year, the federal government, the Congress if you will sit here and negotiate and have these discussions about how much money, fiscal budgets and all of that stuff. And they every single year and the Republicans vote for it every single time, they know that they're not going to be able to account for the money. They know it's called deficit spending. They know it every single year and it piles. Of course, that money goes into the debt. They understand that and still, hey, here's the bills, let's pass some sign them, let's go. And then everybody's like, oh, I don't know why. Why the dollar keeps getting the value. What do you mean you don't know it's right there and it's so obvious. But because we sit up and play this blame game, it never gets resolved. And that's what's so frustrating because for me, it's not that difficult to understand why inflation is a problem. You don't need to be an economist to understand it, but you have to accept the harsh realities. And that is this welfare stateism that has to go, right? There's this over all this spending efforts that has to go, the Grenton loan business that has to go that if you want to your money to actually be worth of them, that all has to go. And at this rate and at this trajectory, even if you're just sitting on the money, it's being devalued actively and you're losing money just by saving. And that doesn't even make sense, but that's the truth. So Jason, I want to get your thoughts, but Eric, you mentioned the deficit and the debt. I don't know what you're talking about because Biden said that he is the first one to cut the federal debt by quite a large amount of money launch. And unlike the last president, my first two years in office, even with all we've done, I'm the first one to cut the federal debt by $1,700 billion. $1,700 billion cut. Cut. Yes, I am sure that that's true. Totally. Go to the bit clock right now. Right. It just keeps moving. Right. Yes. But it doesn't matter everything you just said because modern monetary theory, Eric, that will say. What's amazing to me is how these experts continue to tell us that there's no big deal. None of this makes it is not an issue to anyone. Meanwhile, you have regular people that are suffering. I mean, legitimately suffering on this. That viral song comes to mind. That guy, I cannot remember his name, that rich men, north of Richmond. Those are the voices that absolutely terrify the experts and the elites at the top. Terrifies them. Because that is, I think, Kerry Lee called it a valid, true American ballot at the time we live in right now. And it really is. People are working six days a week, 12 hours a day, making bull crap money off of it. They maybe could have supported their families a few years ago, go back several years ago. But now because inflation is so high, as you pointed out, people can't buy normal things anymore. Their money does not do anything for people anymore. But did you see how the mainstream media started attacking that guy? They called him a plant. They called him, they didn't buy it. They were like, oh, he's like a conservative plant. They even tried to associate him with QAnon. And the only thing he was pointing out was, look, we are suffering. They don't want you to know about that. That message cannot get out in the public that people are suffering. There was another viral video that, I can't remember, it was going around TikTok or whatever. But did y'all see that? Or people were, it was just individual accounts of how they live day to day. And some people were crying in the videos. They're like, I can't afford to support my family. I can't feed them, go to work for as many hours as I'm working. And then with whatever money that's left over, pay for rent. I can't do it. It was account after account after account after account. That is how the majority of Americans feel. And it's absolutely insulting to see people like Yellen say, oh, actually, you know, it's like 75% of the country. They feel perfectly fine. Who are you talking to? The people just in Washington DC? I'm sure they agree with you. They're right. There's no business in Washington DC except for what? Lawyers and lobbyists. That's it. And they're making a ton off of our backs. Right. Right. Well, and that's where the homelessness comes into play with the rise of housing costs and everything else. And this administration clearly does not care about any of that. They do not care about the average American. They do not care about what's going on in Maui. They do not care about what happened in the toxic train derailment in Ohio. They do not care about the two-year anniversary of the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan. They do not care about Americans outside of their little elitist bubble. And it's just really frustrating to see, you know, they keep touting like, oh, but we pass the inflation reduction act. Remember, it's called inflation reduction act. So that's clearly what it does guys. Don't look at us. It's not our fault. And that's the thing that's so frustrating about this issue because everybody even once people start to catch up to what the actual problem is when it comes to the solution, they're almost always, I mean, Gary, you can guarantee it. To the bank, well, probably shouldn't take it there considering that it's going to be devalued there. But take it wherever you need that they're going to deploy the worst possible solution. And that's what happened with doing the COVID situation. It's like, I know you remember, Sarah, I was here and we do talk about the stimulus stuff. And I'm screaming. I'm screaming at the audience like, this is the word. I don't care what the just because Donald Trump is going to sign off on it. This is a terrible idea. Well, we got to do something. No, you don't doing something sometimes, actually oftentimes when it comes to the government, them not doing a damn thing is the best thing that they could do to an already crappy situation. But hold on, because they created the problem too. So the last thing you want is them creating the solution to the problem that they created by shutting all the businesses down. Not the business down, low economic activity and it giving fake money away. I mean, of course, this is what is going to happen. I was screaming back then. I'm like, this is, you're going to be filling the impact for this maybe for multiple decades, that minimum or a decade. And this inflationary issue is going to be a fundamental problem. But because folks are so short-sighted, I don't know if it's because the election cycles work or whatever people are so short-sighted. It's like, well, just give them the money, shut them up for a little bit and everything's going to be fine. And now you have everybody screwed up. Doesn't matter what economic class you're in. Your money does not go as far as what it did before. And that's a problem that was solely created by the state. Let's just be clear and be honest. I remember watching, I think it was an interview on one of the cable news networks. It was probably MSNBC or whatever. And it was an economist that was linked to the government, somehow associated with what they were doing. And he was actually saying, right, I have to find the video and tweet it out later, but he goes, what we're doing is a forced recession. During that, they're in the pandemic time. He goes, we're forcing the economy. They're purposely driving us into recession to keep everybody from going outside. That was the plan. And they were like, yeah, so the commies in a dip. And remember they had those graphs where they were going to show us going to be an ass of cleanouts. And the key is always having a grasp. Always. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, I was like, I've never heard of that in my lifetime. And the hubris to think that, oh, yeah, it's going to be perfectly fine for everyone. Of course, all these people have already made all their money. All these people that are making these plans for people like you and me, they've already made all their money. It's like the people that wore an economic form. Most of them are billionaires. They're not thinking about your wellbeing or how you're going to climb back up that ladder and reflect that little stupid ass graph. They're not doing that. No explanation for that whatsoever. And you're right. This is, I don't know how long is it? This is going to be, would you say decades? I would say, yes. I mean, for sure. I mean, what we saw, that wasn't like anything we had there. I need Americans to understand that. What happened during that COVID time was something like you will probably never see again. It was insane. I mean, again, the low economic activity, yes, it was forced. The amount of money that was being printed at the same time, any amount of money that was being given away, that was all happening at the same time. I don't know how anybody that looks at that says, yeah, we're going to be fine. That makes all the sense. Because if that was something that could work, why don't you do it all the damn time? No, that was a terrible idea. And I think the shortsightedness is what burned people. Oh, and by the way, I know we got to go to break. I just want to throw this other fun fact in here. That was before we started sending all of our money to Ukraine. Oh, yeah. Let's just calm down the matter there with all the billions that we're sending to a completely other country that will never, well, we won't see it back. I mean, I think the Democrats have mastered laundering it through Ukraine by now, but you're not going to see it back. All right, we got to go take a quick break. We'll be back with more, but we want to thank our sponsor. It couldn't have been more appropriately timed. Birch Gold Group. We've been sitting here telling you, talking about how the United States dollar is not like the most, I don't know. Certainly in the back by the gold, which should be. Yeah, it's not a great investment. And you know this if you're looking at your IRA or your 401k every day and you're like, this doesn't look great. This isn't what it was like when back when Donald Trump was president. Yeah, what you need to do is look into diversifying with gold from Birch Gold Group. So historically gold has been a safe haven in times of high uncertainty, high inflation, which look around you is right now. All right, so here's what I'm asking you to do. I'm not a financial advisor. Obviously I'll tell you this. My family has done business, continued business with Birch Gold. We just heavily diversified even more into gold and silver with Birch Gold just recently within the last couple of months because we looked at it and we decided it was right for our family, but you're not going to know until you read more about it. So go get a free info kit on gold IRAs. Decide for yourself if a tax-shultered retirement account backed by physical precious metals is right for you. You can read that free info kit by texting the word Y2989898. Go get that free information kit. There's no obligation. There's no reason not to do it. Text the word Y2989898. Let's look at the absolute state of the medical experts in this country. We wonder why things are going so poorly. Here you have the chief psychologist and director of mental health at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Gender Development Center in California. This is Dr. Diane Arrensafft. It says that this is a woman I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. But she claims that children can identify as gender minitars among other terms. Yes. So she says that gender, you may be wondering, you guys didn't ask the question, what is a gender minitar? Do you know? Isn't that what the guy from Mortal Kombat, not Goro, the other one? Yeah. It wasn't his name like the half horse, half. Yeah. Like he was half man, right? Yeah, he was half horse, half man. It wasn't her. Yeah. What was his name? It's going to hit me at some point, but he looks like that. Yeah. So you can be the guy from Mortal Kombat. It's a part bull. Yeah, it's like a, yeah, yeah. It's a part bull. It's half bull, half man. That's a minitar. That's a minitar. I don't understand the reference. Okay. Well, well, you dumbass. Let me just share it with you. Your simple mind over here doesn't understand what the medical experts already know, which is that a gender minitar is a descriptor for the children who explain that they are one gender on the top and another on the bottom. This usually is to account for genitals at odds with the gender they know themselves to be. Yes. And also, there's another one of my favorites there, gender Prius, which... Is it like a car? No, you idiot. It's a male female car. I can't believe I'm dealing with such a sinner. A small mind here on the program. No, because if you weren't so stupid, you would understand Jason, that gender Prius obviously means you're half girl and half boy, and it was invented by a school-age child, which you're already like, oh good, we've got the gender terms being invented by school-age children. What could possibly go wrong in this country? Who from the front looked like any boy in basketball shorts tanked up and basketball sneakers? And from the back had a long blonde braid tied at the end with a bright pink bow. You see, I'm a Prius, a boy in the front, a girl in the back, a hybrid. Yes. Gosh. That's a thing. And so she says... Yeah, he's more thorough. That's his name for more... He's so good at looking at you. I'm not wanting to listen to it. I was like, I got to remember what the hell this is from Mark Conbet and the other one. That is so funny. That's his name. So these are the experts that are at these gender clinics around the country, and I want to play for you a little bit of this just wonderful woman, Diane, Dr. Diane. Here's Dr. Diane explaining that what the cure is for gender dysphoria. Watch. Gender may be the cure rather than the disease at heretofore was often thought of. Sorry, what? Next slide. This means for all of us who are at this webinar and beyond us, it is the responsibility of health professionals to cure this disease by getting involved in the community. She's literally just saying words. She's very gender health for all. This doesn't mean... And it doesn't mean people have to march in protest. Gender may. It would be able to both provide and speak up about quality care for gender expensive and transgender children and adolescents. Okay. So literally, that's just word salad. She's just saying a bunch of big words and trying to sound verbose and putting them all together and being like, I'm smart. Look at me. I have a medical degree. I want to play for you guys one more clip here of her talking about being able to tell if a baby is transgender watch. So let me give you an example. I have a colleague who's transgender and there is a video of him as a toddler. So he was a fine female at birth. There's a video of him as a toddler tearing barrettes out of then her hair and throwing them on the ground and sobbing. That's a gender message. And when it happens not just once or twice or three times. That's a gender message. Sometimes kids between the age of one and two with beginning language will say, I boy when you say girl, those two words, I boy, that's not a pre-verbal but an early verbal message. And sometimes there is an urgency, the tendency to say, well, honey, no, you're a girl because little girls have a giant is and you have a vagina. Yes, correct. And then when they get a little older, you hear them say, did you not listen to me? I said, I am a boy with a vagina. Okay, but they can't say that between one and two. But they can show you about what they want to play with and if they feel uncomfortable about how you are responding to them and their gender, if you're misgendering them. I'm trying really hard not to use the swear jar. This woman is like, we should institutionalize her, I think. This woman is crazy. Sorry, I tried. I tried. Okay. Not very hard. Okay. I don't know. You may have a tendency as a parent to tell your child if they have a vagina that they're a girl, but you should actually listen to the toddler who literally throws fits about every single thing you could imagine if they're throwing a fit about a beret in their hair, they must actually be a boy. You're not. She's not crazy. She knows exactly what she's doing. What kind of random social issue can we get out of a toddler that just throws themselves in the floor at the grocery store and starts rolling around screaming at the top of their lungs? What kind of social issue when you're two-year-old wants to eat? The dog food? Right. When you tell them, no, no, no, what are they? What social issue can we get out of that? The dogs. The point is there's no social issue from a two-year-old. This is ridiculous. To my point, she knows exactly what she's doing. What they're doing is, and I've said this before, they're Marxist. They're all Marxist. However you want to call them, maybe some of them aren't Marxist. They're just all about this big societal revolution that they want to change, but that's all it is. They took class warfare and they threw that out the window because that's been done before. You can't keep doing that. So now what do they do? Well, now it's like racial warfare. We all hate each other and we all got to separate from each other. Or it's the LGBT, elemental pee stuff. They're like, oh, that's the social area where you need your revolution. Constantly keep us in a state of revolution. That's what this is all about. The most sinister part of it is they're going after children on it. At least Karl Marx had a decency not to go after little children. I think. Maybe he did. I mean, at least not on the surface area, at least. They were like looking at workers, workers of the world unite. Now they're going after two-year-olds to try and get their ridiculous, sadistic political message through. It's insane. That's disgusting. Well, yeah, that's what they're doing. They're using children as a vehicle, as the socialistic type weirdos often have historically done. And they use various classes of people until you're pointing this is kind of more focused on younger folk. As their vehicle to promote whatever non-sensitivity is that they want to promote, and often these are very innocent parties. The parties that don't know better, should know better. In some cases like this, they literally can't. They don't have the capacity that they're one-year-old. Right. To possibly conceptualize these types of things. For them, it goes to show, at least for me actually, how crazy things have gotten where people are in the medical institutions are so confident in using terms like trans kids and all of this sort of moronic sort of messaging, criminal messaging, if you will. And they feel no backlash because of it. And that goes to show the culture of erotic, I've brought that up on the show many times. How far we have fallen, where people can't get out there on a freaking podium. You know, usually weird stuff like that, it's like kind of under the ground, under the surface, if you will. With this, it's like, no, we're on a, literally, on a podium saying that this is a thing. Saying that your kids can't trans, should be given some sort of, at some sort of age, should be given some medication to prevent them from going through puberty the natural way. And in a lot of cases, which is insane again, because they're confident, they've gotten away with actually going through with irreversible surgeries, right, to young people. And they say that with all the confidence in the world, because they understand that there's not going to be any sort of backlash. So to me, that's a metric to the American people. If you want to know, when we sit up here and talk all the old days were better, yeah, they were. At least everybody seemed to know, and the ones that didn't know kept it under wraps contained because they knew that they probably would have to bare knuckle box. Any event that you would say something like children, should be able to transition. Like that would have got someone punched in the face. For a lot less than that. But here we are. Now, your medical institution is all in on and promoting. Actually, the other ones leading the charge on this. Yeah. You talk about decades of damage. You know, we were talking about economic before. Think about what this is doing to an entire generation. I mean, we're already suffering. You might have covered this earlier in the week, but you know, record amounts of suicide, just skyrocketing. And again, you can look at that as an economic part because their lives are getting destroyed that way. But also our children now. I mean, and they're going through the system right now in public schools where they're getting indoctrinated for this. We're already seeing people come out like, like, like, like, colloquial. Yeah. People like her coming out me like, this destroyed my life. Right. Now, I mean, that's nothing compared to the thousands that are, I mean, tens of hundreds of thousands of kids that are getting this in elementary school. They're going to think that there's something they're not. And once they get into, you know, 18, 19 and their lives are destroyed. And their body parts are cut off. And they're that they can never recover from. That's what they're setting up. There's absolutely no shame. And there's probably going to be no accountability for these people because they're the experts. Right? I know. That's really frightening. Okay. On that note, we got to take a quick break, but we want to thank our sponsor, Tommy John. So what you need right now, it is still swell. I don't know. Maybe you're in someplace where it's cool. We're not. And by the way, we were just in Florida. And I thought that it was hot in Texas. Holy crap. With the humidity in Florida, we would go outside and we were sweating within like five seconds to just like drenched in sweat. So if you are still not particularly enjoying summer, might I suggest that you try to keep cool with Tommy John, they've got, they've got underwear from him. And I think that's where they kind of made their start. So I hear rave reviews about it from my husband. Apparently it's the most comfortable underwear that he's ever worn. But I believe that because I have their lounge wear, I have their sports bras. I have, I'm going to be a little bit, can I be personal or not? This is an underwear commercial. Can I be personal? Please, girl. Their thongs are the most comfortable thongs. I've ever worn. It's not like your butt is being flossed. It's actually, it's so comfortable. You don't feel it. It's lightweight. It's breathable. And apparently it's got four times the stretch of competing brands that keep you seven degrees cooler than cotton. So I'm telling you, you need a pair of Tommy John's. You're going to think I'm overreacting. You're going to think I'm being dramatic and you're going to buy some and you're going to be like, well, Sarah was right. It actually is that much more comfortable than any of the other products that I've ever worn. So you need to go to TommyJohn.com slash Y get 20% off your order off your first order right now at TommyJohn.com slash Y seaside for details. The state of Texas is suing Planned Parenthood. And guys, I'm really sorry I didn't bring Kleenex for this segment. I'm sorry to inform you that Planned Parenthood is very concerned that if Texas wins, they make a lot of business. So this is a hard time for Planned Parenthood. So the lawsuit alleges that Planned Parenthood wrongfully accepted payment from Medicaid during a time when the state was suing to end those funds. So what happened? This was way back in December 2016. Texas notified them that they would end Medicaid payments to the organization. They sued. They got a federal court to agree with it, which allowed it to continue Medicaid, but then eventually the Fifth Circuit reversed that ruling and it was upheld this initial end to Medicaid payments in 2021. So the lawsuit alleges that you guys just received all this money from 2017 all the rate through 2021 that you did not like we won the case. You were not supposed to receive that money. All the money that you received is fraudulent and you need to pay it back in the $17 million reimbursed funds. So we'll see what happens, but I know you guys would be really broken up, really, really broken up to hear that Planned Parenthood could be in jeopardy. All those babies? Well, all those babies that could be saved and lived. The argument that they're going to make as they do all the time with Planned Parenthood is, oh, well, look about what about the other things it is that they provide for these communities as if for one Planned Parenthood is the only damn place around or more, I guess, accurately putting it as if that's really not the driving force abortion that being for Planned Parenthood and what it is that they do. Look, we talk about this subject matter and I'm still like the fact that they receive any damn money from the government is like, why? That's even a thing. But unfortunately, it is and I have a problem with that. I think everybody should have a problem with that even if you are on the opposite side of me on this baby killing, which I don't know why you would be on the opposite side of me of that, but why the hell are they getting any Medicaid? Any? I don't care if it's a dime and any why they get any money to operate. If we have all these geniuses and I guess these rich folk in Hollywood and all that, why don't you all subsidize Planned Parenthood, $17 million that they need to do whatever it is that they need to do? Yeah. This is hilarious. I hope it does force them to shut down to be amazing. But I think this is a perfect example of what everyone on the right should be doing right now. Right now, there are more Republican Attorney Generals than there are Democrat Attorney Generals. What are we seeing right now that the left is doing against the former president of the United States? Any other politician that they don't like or even a media person that they don't like, they're using the law. They're using the Department of Justice. They've completely perverted the Department of Justice. They're just doing it to go after anyone that doesn't agree with them or they don't agree with because they can. Right now, the reason that they're feeling so emboldened to do that is because there is no, what do they call it, there is no mutually assured destruction in this arena. They know that we're not going to do it. Why? Because we don't want to pervert the Department of Justice. We want it to work as intended. That's got to go away. I'm sorry to say, but that's got to go away. If you are a Republican Attorney General, if you are a Republican prosecutor, if you are a district attorney, you need to start looking, pick whatever left wing entity that is in your state, in your county, city, whatever and prosecute them for something. But that's the thing. See for the first president, I'll give you the answer. But that's the thing though, like you don't even, I don't think you would be, if you claim a value liberty, I don't even think you would be out of pocket to go out of your way because that's the one thing that you would add to me. I think that's the card that it is that you play. If you are going to play this whole stateism card, I don't know, going out after people's money to me, that's for a game to what it is that you claim to believe in. Why in the hell is Medicaid bid or any sort of institution funding planned, apparently? I don't think that has to do with perversion or anything. It's more of like, yeah, we probably shouldn't be doing that. And that's right in line with the values it is that you claim to adopt. I don't argue that you should. That should have been maybe what you were leading with all of these people that are in these sort of government positions instead of using the quote unquote law to sit up here and play this sort of game or charade. How about you actually utilize it to somehow get the government out the way, allow people to keep more of their funding? Like to me, this is, you don't even have to pervert anything. Just do it. Go for it until you're born. I mean, I may just point about conservatives via the left in this country anyway. You're playing a real game. These guys don't care about the rules, man. So you could sit up for a high mighty hole. We're better than that. We don't do that. They're going to kick you in the nuts. That's how they play. That's the game they play. And they take advantage of your values. Like what these leftists atheists, for example, use, try to use the gospel against you knowing they don't believe in that because they look at it like, I want to hold you to a different standard based on rules that I don't have to abide by. But once you stop looking at the arena through that lens, then you're like, okay, if that's the game we're going to play, then let's play it. There's got to be some kind of fear. It's like right now, they should be impeaching President Biden. They should do it. I don't care. You don't have a strong case right now, even though I don't know how you couldn't. You could easily. They have a much stronger case than they ever did against Donald Trump for a stupid phone call. Oh, absolutely. And then just you could drag him through the process. If anything, just that. If you know that it's not going to happen, drag him through the process. And all the rest of his presidency out because that's what they did to you. So do it back to them until they realize, oh crap, there are consequences for stepping out of line here. Maybe we should pull back. Exactly. It's going to start. Exactly. In other words, hey, Kevin McCarthy, gross of balls. We've got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more. But we want to thank our sponsor, Moink. So I don't know if you guys realize this, but 60% of US pork production comes from one company. It's owned by the Chinese and their hogs are given something called Raktopamine, which is banned in 160 countries, including China. But you're going to find it in your grocery aisle every day. So if that doesn't sound very appetizing to you, if you maybe have some questions about that, maybe that's not something you'd like to ingest in your body and you want clean meat, might I suggest that you try Moink? They deliver grass fed and grass finished beef and lamb, pastured pork and chicken, wild codalaskin salmon directly to your door. And Moink farmer's farm, like our grandparents did, Moink meat tastes like it should because we all know the family farm does it better. My family, look, I don't know what I would do without Moink because my boys, they just eat, they just eat all the time and they love Moink meat. They eat their weight in Moink bacon. We throw Moink fillets on the grill all the time and they are always the best fillets we have ever had. So keep American farming going by signing up at moinkbox.com slash news. You can pick whichever meats you want. So you know that it's going to be something you're going to enjoy and listeners of the show are going to get free ground beef for a year. That is one year of the best ground beef you'll ever taste, but it's only for a limited time. So don't sleep on it. It's moinkbox.com slash news. That is M O I N K box.com slash news. Those of you watching on YouTube, listen up, YouTube announced yesterday a new policy framework to crack down on medical misinformation posted by users on its platform. They said that they will remove content that contradicts health authority guidance on the prevention and transmission of specific health conditions and on the safety and efficacy of approved vaccines. For example, this encompasses content that promotes a harmful substance for disease prevention. It says that basically if you don't agree with the World Health Organization and other global health entities that you will be removed, your content will be removed. So they don't want people to know that the COVID-19 vaccine doesn't work, that the COVID-19 vaccine is killing people. They don't want you to know that vaccines actually might cause autism and they definitely don't want you to know that you should be taking vitamin D and it will make you far less likely to even get COVID. Oh, by the way, the vaccine schedule in America that you are currently giving to your children has actually never been tested in conjunction with one another, all the shots that you're giving them at once, those have never been tested together at the same time. But you won't hear that from the World Health Organization. So I'm not sure who I'm even talking to right now other than Blaise TV subscribers. That's about it. There's only people out there that will look after back-to-back champion, strike-removal champion. I'm already making zero dollars off of YouTube. So I'm like screw it. I'll tell you on that. It's East guys man. First day, the other day, just a couple of months ago, they were saying they were going back on that and now they seem to be going back. I don't know if they got a message incorrect or something with the WHO, but that's the ones they always said that you have to listen to despite them getting it completely incorrect. I remember one of my first takedowns was actually me going through data directly from the WHO that was published by John Ian Eadis and they got me in trouble because it was saying what it said. I'm like, wait a minute. And then one of the approved out of course they took my strike down. But man, I'm getting a kick out of them. YouTube that is Twitch and others, these video platforms, streaming platforms, just kind of doing themselves in and the rise for alternative media. People are paying more attention on it. Twitch right now is in a big robbery with kick losing a lot of talented kick. We know what's going on with the rumbles, the odyssey and all that with YouTube and really doing stuff like this incentivizes people to look elsewhere. This reminds me of, I remember right when the pandemic came out, we were doing that, we did this show on event 201. You can do that. So event 201 was basically the pandemic war game and it was what, three months before the pandemic actually hit. And we never said that they knew it was coming and all that stuff. Just that they were making plans to where when the pandemic came. All true. All true. It was factually verifiable. Right. So they were like, how do we plan for this? Well, one of the things that they had planned for was having one central localized source of information and they had members of big tech. They have members of the mainstream media, all in attendance. So this was what they had planned from the get go. The pandemic just amplified everything and gave them exactly what they wanted. So now they've got all of, they had all the planning before. They've had real world experience and now they're doubling down on, and that's what central planners and big government does. They'll take a crisis, take away that that's a literal false flag. Yep. Right. It's actually not like, oh, government plan something. It's more of they took something and they knew it. They use it to their advantage and they either could have prevented it, decided not to because they wanted to utilize this for their own personal sort of gain. That's what they've historically done and that's exactly what it is. So whether you thought they caused it or not effectively, it's the same damn thing. You know what I mean? It screwed over and they're using that to their advantage to push whatever nonsense it is that they want. That pandemic was, I mean, I was set up right there for them. You know what I mean? That was perfect for them. Oh, by the way, if you want to know what we actually said right there, you're probably going to want to make sure that you're subscribed to Blaze TV. You can use promo code news for some savings. Guys, this is, it's getting pretty scary. I know we're talking about YouTube right now, but Glenn's entire podcast collection was just removed from Apple podcasts for no apparent reason. They haven't given him a reason yet. No. So the email that I saw, it said the podcast stores removed because of an issue. An issue. And the issue had to be resolved. Well, they haven't told us what the issue is. How can we even resolve it? We already know, we've already seen disclosures that the government's colluding directly with organizations like Facebook the most recent one. I think it was Facebook. Probably. We know they for a fact they did it with Twitter. We know for a fact they did it with Twitter. I mean, this is only going to get worse. It's snowballing pretty soon. There will be a minister of information. That's the only place you can get your news from. You have to look to them for them to tell you what's going on or what everything means. Oh, bull crap. Yeah. So it really is important that if you can make sure that you get a Blaze TV subscription, we're not sure how much longer we're going to be allowed to be around and not rounded up into reeducation camps. Gotta go. We'll be right back. Well, according to an Australian Tiktoker, there are too many American flags in America watch. I'm just going to say it. There are too many American flags. Like they're in houses, they're in cars, saw them on couch cushions. Like, I don't know who's making these American flags, but they'd be making a bloody fortune. And like you're the only country that I know that does this. Like the only time I think I've ever seen an Australian flag is like on the Harbour Bridge. Could not tell you what it looks like. Like, I know it's like blue and it's got some stars on it, but I think I could draw the American flag from memory. Good. I think I could make a bloody sculpture out of it. That's how many times I've seen it. It's enough. Let's pull back on it. Okay. Let's stay humble. Maybe since you've memorized what it looks like, you can draw it while your ass is on the plane to go back to Australia where you belong because we don't need you here. It's clearly never been to the UK. That's stupid flags everywhere. Yeah, that's stupid flags everywhere. I don't know what she was talking about. Not even this bad. I'm pretty much almost everywhere else. Yeah. They're just rocking a flag. What it is? So stupid. Our children are doomed. Thanks for watching."
