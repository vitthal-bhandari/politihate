    "text": " From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show. Hey, it is Ezra. I am on Book Leave this week, but we have the great Tressy McMillan Cottam sitting in the chair. She is a Times Opinion columnist. She is the author of Lower Ed, the troubling rise of for-profit colleges in the new economy, and the National Book Award nominee, Thick. She has been a guest on the show before, a host on the show before, her episodes, no matter where she is sitting in which chair are always some of my favorite. So I'm excited to hear what she does this week, and I hope you enjoy it too. And before we begin, one more thing today. So I am doing the annual Jefferson Memorial Lecture for UC Berkeley, which I'm excited about as a kid who grew up in California, idolizing and then getting repeatedly rejected by UC Berkeley when I applied there. And it's going to be the first time I try to work through the ideas of the book in public, with an audience, in conversation, with someone else who knows what they're talking about on these issues, Amy Lerman in this case. And if you'd like to join and hear what I've been thinking about, you can. Tickets are available at CalPerformances.org. We'll put the link to the event page in show notes. And again, that is October 5th at UC Berkeley. The library is as much an idea as it is a place. It promises books, guests, but also services, access, and public infrastructure in an information-based economy. For a long time, the idea that we all generally want more of what the library offers has been a taken for granted American value. But recently, libraries have become a political lightning rod, where even the most basic assumption of the value of this essential public good is now somehow controversial. According to the American Library Association, last year, there were 1,269 attempts to censor what materials appeared in public libraries. Across the nation, there are contentious debates raging over things like drag story hours, children's programming, and even what books and programming should be available for adults in public and school libraries. Emily Durbinski is paying very close attention to these efforts to censor libraries. She should be. Durbinski is what you might call a librarian with a capital L. In 2022, she was elected president of the American Library Association, a professional organization representing the nation's librarians. She also happens to be a queer person, a parent, a longtime librarian, and also in her academic work, a scholar of critical librarianship. I wanted to talk to Emily about the political and cultural anxieties fueling anti-library sentiments across the United States and what it all says about the health of our body politic. As always, the show's email is Ezra Klein's show at nytimes.com. Welcome, Emily Durbinski to the show. How are you today? I'm good. I'm having a good day and really excited to be here. You've written that children are people who deserve private reading lives. And I think about that a lot, one, because I interact with a lot of young people and they certainly think about their private lives. I remember being a young person and being obsessed with having a private life. And yet when I look at how we got here and where we are now when it comes to the fight about libraries and books and reading material, I don't hear a lot of the voice of young people in the conversation about where we are now. So I wondered if you could tell me what you mean when you say children are people who deserve private reading lives? That's a big question. And I don't know how popular it is to think of kids in that way. Since I became president of the American Library Association, I have spent so much time reading through our documents, our policies, our position papers, our analyses. And one of the things that makes me quite proud is the commitment that we have to children as people who can read. I have a child of my own, you know, and everyone's like, parents should be able to control what their children read. I'm like, do you have a child? Have you met a child? The degree of control you have over a child is more limited than I sometimes want. But I think it comes down to respect for individual people and their right to their own imagination and the sovereignty of their own minds and attacks on libraries right now are shaped and framed as attacks on books. But I think we all know they're attacks on people and attacks on children. We hear less from the readers and the writers of these books than I think we need to. I think a lot of parents would agree almost as an instinct or an impulse anyway. They would agree strongly with the principle that children deserve private lives. Like, right, right, of course, my child, you know, they get their own room, for example, right? Sure, they should have their privacy, they get their inner world. But I think they struggle with what that means in everyday practice, especially when it comes to, you know, when they're looking at their own child and against the larger context of fear, right? The world is this big, scary place and I am their only defense, their last defense against everything because that's kind of how we've painted modern parenthood. So you mentioned you are a parent and you're a librarian, a kind of big library. Capital L sets of librarian. So do you have those competing impulses in itself? How do you navigate them as a parent and capital L librarian? No, absolutely. Like I said, I have a teenager. You know, my life is consumed with worry about him and his future. And I worry for his world when he grows up in the world he's living in now and the constraints on his imagination from all kinds of different directions. And I also worry about his choices, you know, does he always make good choices? Absolutely not. Can confirm he made a bad one just today. But I made some bad ones this week also. So giving him the sort of grace to be a full person. But when it comes to the media he consumes and the books that he reads, yeah, I mean, I can't say it, it doesn't worry me. But that struggle around the worry that grappling with what I want for him and who he is and who he wants to be and who I want him to be that these are the conditions of loving other people of having children in our worlds and there are an easy answers for it. I think that's one of the things that's surprising the conviction some people have over what is right for children. I just, you know, I look at my kid and his struggles every day and one thing I'm not as sure about a whole lot. All right, so we'll come back to the tensions by the way between what parents might want for their kids broadly and what they want for their own kids because that is one of the fundamental tensions. The idea that there's what I want for my kids and that gives me a sense of certainty that I want to project out into the world and I happen to think that's where a lot of the political and social conflict lies as you mentioned how can people feel so certain when you yourself as a parent is like I'm riddled with uncertainty. Just guessing every day. Yeah. Every day and I think a lot of parents are but let's talk a little bit more about your current role. So you campaign to be the head of the American Library Association at a moment of great stress and distress I might say for libraries and for the country more broadly and I think those two things are related. So my first question is why did you campaign at this moment to head up to ALA? I mean why not me? Why not me? Okay. I was like no let me just step in here and do this. So you know I ran because I care a whole lot about libraries and I care a ton about library workers and I know what kind of stress we're under. I see it in my colleagues. I see it in the people that I talk to. You know I've been a librarian for a long time. I know librarians all over the country and there's not a one of them that feels secure in their ability to do the jobs that we want to do and I thought that if I ran for president of the American Library Association making a public argument about the importance both of libraries as public institutions that secure the public good and library workers as the people who are responsible for that and need the kind of support to expand that work that whatever happened it would be good to have that public argument out in the world. What does it mean by the way for public libraries to be a model or an example of the public good because I tend to agree with you just let me show my hand here by the way. I think it is one of the few places where people from multiple social classes still have to interact with each other as we have retreated from each other in public life right. People can take their personal vehicles. We don't have to interact with each other on public transportation. We don't interact with each other in the same shopping but libraries are one of these places where we brush up against each other but like I say that even I can hear it to my own ears just like this highfalutin idea and I'm always trying to make it really tangible for people. What does it mean to you when you say listen the public library is a model it is the public good so I was in Des Moines, Iowa touring a library and they have a library of things which many many public libraries have these days and they circulate book club kits and sensory kits for kids and science materials and cake pans and tools and this library had started circulating to carpet cleaning machines and I remember growing up in Boise Idaho my mother saving up for months to be able to rent that carpet cleaner at the Albertsons in Boise, Idaho so she could clean our carpets. And this library takes that out of the equation and it means everybody can clean their carpet and it seems like a small thing it's like one thing happening in Des Moines, Iowa but you know multiply that by the hundreds and thousands of public libraries across the country and every single one of them has something like that that's securing and expanding access to public resources for everyone. It doesn't matter who you are you can be anybody you walk in they did say there's a line they have two of them and they said the whole line for those carpet cleaners is 45 people in line so you got to wait which is a testament to to how much people want access to those public resources how high the demand is when we make public goods available. Not a small thing. No it is not. Not a small thing at all and one of the things I love about working in libraries is that they're it's material you know those highfalutin thoughts about the public good in the library rubber meets the road just constantly every day it's a space where use in the bathroom and get a drink of water like those are public goods and we're the only people that offer them. I think a lot about indoor space also like the bigger the library the more indoor space you have. I was in Grimes Iowa and the library there had served a community for decades and never gotten beyond its sort of one room size. The library director was telling me over years of one-on-one conversations with the people were in the city council and the people who run the businesses in this small town and grinds eventually after all that time managed to secure 82% support from the community for a new library that's four times the size and that means so much more space for people to come and meet and gather so much more room for books so much more room for bathrooms. It's brilliant and amazing and good and we want more of that. Yeah this is really small infrastructure is basically what we're talking about. Yeah that's right. Yeah you know when we talk about infrastructure in this country you know we think bridges and roads and those things super important don't get me wrong but I got to think this small infrastructure matters a lot too and it's the kind of infrastructure that people don't think about needing until somebody says hey could you use a carpet cleaner? That's right yeah and suddenly there are 45 people. And think about what institutions are the that circulate things I think about that a lot that like moving things around and sharing them like you've got the post office and you have the library those are the two kind of infrastructures that circulate goods and services among the people and the library is like a place that does that and kind of the only one. Yeah not a surprise by the way that you just mentioned two institutions that have each face a political appeal battle for capital and relevancy over the last 20 years. The post office facing its own set of challenges and the idea of the library facing its own and both as you point out really important to circulating the things that people need. Should there be an afterlife if I get there I want it written in the big book that I loved libraries but there is such a thing I know that you know you can love something and want it to be better and that that can be an act of love and service and you have spent a lot of your scholarly work on critical librarianship and I think this would surprise people first of all that there is a robust field called critical librarian ship. There is quite robust there are lots of us yep and in fact the librarians that I have had the great fortune to hang out with over the years almost all critical librarians. Oh yeah there are a bunch of us. So what is critical librarianship? Tell us what that is. You know it's like anything there are a million definitions and who you ask will tell you something different. I think of critical librarianship as taking a critical view of the systems and structures that produce the library as we know it and experience it and think about ways that that library could be different. So I've done most of that work around cataloging and classification and thinking about the languages that we use to describe things and thinking about the order in which we put things and so you go into a library and you think the books are just arranged in Dewey-Dussman order and that's kind of annoying but whatever but critical librarianship takes an interest in what that knowledge organization system what the story it tells about itself through the ordering mechanism. You have written that one of the insights of critical librarianship since the 1970s has been this acknowledgement that invisible intellectual structures actually have a relationship to the material world of knowledge construction. That something's happening in there. You go in there and like you say you just go oh hey look this book comes before that book. So what's happening when that book goes before that book? Why does that matter? So everything for me comes from my own experience of the world so I got a job my first college library job was at Sarah Lawrence College and I came to that library as it was finishing a major shift and like if you're a librarian you've worked on a major shift of the collection shouts to you I hope we never have to do it again because you got to take all the books you got to put them somewhere and move them around and so I was working on shelving the sort of last sets of those books and we had a copy of Christine Jorgensen's autobiography A Memoir of a trans woman published I think in the 1960s and that book was downstairs on the in the basement in the R section which is the section for mental illness psychiatric diseases. We had a second copy of that book that was with a historicizing introduction and it was on the third floor in the HQs which is where we shelved social problems and I was struck by the distance between those books right and they tell you that one of the books is that gender is a problem in your brain and the other one is gender is a social construction that is malleable and the distance between those says something and the elevator was slow and so the physical distance was really real you know you had to walk up all these stairs to get to the two books and put them together and so the context of where the book sits is consequential for the meaning we can make from it. You know I was thinking many of us encounter the catalog is just the card catalog but you're saying it's more than just this like accessible lowly practical way to find a book or a resource basically what you just described I mean you know the catalog is power. There's a lot of power in where the books are placed and how. Absolutely. I'm working on an oral history project with a colleague right now and we're recording oral histories of people who have developed alternate classification schemes and we're recording with a couple of librarians who were part of developing the chicanos thesaurus for chicanos movement materials and the way they talk about that experience of trying to find information about themselves and their experience in the Berkeley library say and just the absence of it completely the inability to find anything you know they threw themselves into making this index because there was no other way for them to organize information about their experience like they had to. So like I think if you don't see yourself in the catalog which is like a ton of us it's pretty clear and it's pretty problematic. I've got to talk about though why this may have come to a head when you were finally elected April 2022 other people then were surprised they don't know what critical librarian ship is. You write a tweet that says hey I cannot believe that a Marxist lesbian who believes that collective power is possible to build and can be willed it for a better world is the president elect of a la library. You know it was an excited utterance right? There's a lot of backlash okay so some republicans accuse the a la of being suddenly a radical leftist organization. To be fair they now accuse everything. Yeah of being a radical leftist organization but I do think this was a new experience for the American Library Association. The Montana State Library cut ties with the LA LA lawmakers and states like Wyoming, Georgia, and Mississippi pushed to do the same. We can get into the like the political muddslinging but how unprecedented is this? This is unprecedented and it is extraordinarily painful and the attacks on libraries and individual librarians to see those intensify and to see those attacks be directed at institutions that would protect them that represent them that they are a part of. You know the American Library Association we run right around 50,000 members and each one of those people is committed totally to the project of expanding access to information for everyone and so to have this politicization of our role get in the way of that work for me is the most painful part of this experience and I just you know wish I could go back in time and push that tweet right back in the bottle because it wasn't you know it was an excited utterance for me and my friends and to forget for a moment that I was in the public square was regrettable. Yeah yeah I'm just a person you know I got a kid in high school I'm worried about him you know yeah it's been tough and you know I think all I want to do is make good on the promise of the ALA for American librarians and the communities we serve and to have this stand in the way of that has been a devastation for sure. Yeah what do you think it is about the American Library Association and librarians and in this moment that feels like an acceptable target for this political discourse you represent something clearly. What is it that makes you both vulnerable I think we can kind of you know under-resourced sure not much of a political defense I think we can see maybe the vulnerabilities but such a rich target like what is it that is being projected on the ALA and on librarianship in particular you think. You know it's very confusing to me because the vast majority of people love the library. Survey after survey like poll after poll nobody wants what's happening right now nobody wants this. The Michigan Library Association ran a poll recently that 78 percent of their respondents said they didn't want restrictions on reading materials and they wanted to have the right to sort of guide their children's reading rather than seeding that to a handful of people. The ALA's polls are similar are unite against book bands campaign surveyed the public you know across section across the political spectrum and and the vast majority of people again really want libraries and want libraries to be available and accessible to everyone. So I you know I think that's part of what's confusing to me is like it's a small and vocal minority that somehow has the power to shape the narrative about American libraries right now and how they got power is the thing that I find really confusing and the thing that I really puzzle over but I think the part that we were talking about earlier that libraries are public institutions that are about expanding access to public resources that we are sharing institutions that we want to take resources that are held in common and distribute them equitably among everyone. I mean that idea is I think the thing that's most under threat right now. So there is a perspective that could say we agree on one thing right the critics and critical librarians agree that the library is powerful. Oh yeah just perhaps disagree on how the power should work. Does that seem fair? That seems fair. Yeah okay. So let me put something really controversial before you. Okay can a library ever be politically neutral? Yeah I mean this is a question right so libraries what do we do we provide essential information and services to the public and we are intended to be valued pillars of our community that's what we're for and we're not politically biased organizations that's not what we do. This is not normal I think to be embroiled in this kind of a political fight and so neutral is a thing that we I think many times strive for like we write neutral meaning we want everybody to be able to come in and we want something in our collections for everyone but it's hard at this moment when intellectual freedom and the right to read or under siege it's hard to imagine a modern library as a neutral bystander. Let's talk about book challenges the American Library Association has an office that tracks reports of book challenges. In 2022 that office received a record 1,269 challenges which is the most on record that's nearly double the 729 challenges reported in 2021 what patterns are we seeing in these challenges. There are all the patterns that you would guess that you probably don't need me to say but I think it's important to say it again and again these books are books that tell stories about certain kinds of lives and experiences the lives and experiences of black people lives and experiences of LGBTQ plus people the lives and experiences of people of color the attacks are on those kinds of stories books that are about you and about me. Yeah. All right we know not only that the books are disproportionately written by or about members of the LGBTQIA plus community or by and about black people indigenous people and people of color but recent research is also showing that they seem to be like the same titles over and over again showing perhaps a pattern of identifying the same sort of books and authors over and over again. There's a list. Yeah. On the ALA list of most challenged books in 2022 four of the top five feature queer characters and that's a pretty consistent pattern going back several years and then we sort of start to see a shift over the last few years to stories featuring more trans characters. That coincides with a flood of bills of course restricting gender-affirming care for minors so you see this intersection of the change in political narratives with books that are being targeted so none of this is happening in isolation obviously. Yeah I mean if we define the problem as simply one banned book the solution is put that book back on the shelf so I think it's really important to think about the problem more expansively as you're describing it. And so what would it mean to think beyond that solution of put the book back on the shelf what is the larger if it is larger than that how do we need to think instead of just going to then saying hey no not those books you know showing up at my local library meaning hey not those books what would it mean for me to argue more broadly? I think a couple things like it's not just not those books it's not those people right that's the link that I see when you're describing the sort of anti-trans laws which are about not wanting trans people in the world. There was a recent study that came out looking at the status of like queer kids and queer books and queer school libraries and 90% of the respondents said one of the places they feel safe at school is their school library. So there's that piece and then I think the other piece is thinking about like the ban on the book is also a ban on the library and wanting the library to disappear. So we're seeing in some of the attacks like if the books aren't banned or they're banned in a way that we don't want or not enough or not whatever like it's hard to even know you know it seems like it doesn't have a whole lot to do actually with what the library how the library engages or reacts but another the next sort of next step is to defund the library altogether and eliminate it and we see this in Michigan happening in northern Idaho it's happened in states that are withdrawing their support from ALA right part of the project is to dismantle these institutions period and so for all the reasons that we just talked about about how libraries are amazing community anchor institutions efforts to dismantle them and disappear them are that seems part of the end game as well. It reminds me so much what you just described I just had this sort of shiver because it reminds me so much of the massive resistance response to school desegregation which is if we have to allow one black child we'd rather there be no school at all. We'll fill the swimming pool right with concrete that's right which always suggests that this is about some larger idea about who is included in the political project for whom the legal provisions will acknowledge so not those books not those people yeah you made me think about something that I think I've heard some people kind of say not in a way but just sort of like a shrugging off about when a library closes what the real impact is and that is because I think we have sometimes a late assumption even if we haven't thought it affirmatively that well you have the internet right well maybe you do like oh you know like maybe you have it right what is the impact when a book isn't available in a library or a library isn't available in a school or a library isn't available in a community when we have the presumption that especially a vulnerable minority group or person can just find their people or find their material or find what they need in the safety and anonymity of online communities and materials it's just there's a really big difference right between Googling it and having access to literature and imagination and what other institutions there that exist that can give you both the technological infrastructure right like the computer and the internet but also like the person who will help you and so when the library disappears it's not just the book it's not just that but it's like everything that that library can do for the people in the community and I think sometimes when people like well who needs a library you can just go on Amazon they're not remembering that not everyone lives a life like ours which I think is another like sort of poverty of the imagination in this country sometimes which is like we just don't want to imagine that anybody lives a life where they don't have a laptop you know we forget and so when people say we don't need a library I'm like you have you ever been to a library like you know when I worked at the public library the line for the computers would be 20 people long before we opened the door all day long they're such busy places there's so I think people forget that like the people who use the library a lot they are also people who deserve the state to provide for some of their needs I like to say to my very well to do friends sometimes about the library and one of its most basic functions as you have so eloquently described is that oh they do for people what you do for your elderly parents exactly if you've ever walked your elderly parents through their technology problem thank a librarian they are doing that for people all day long with much higher stakes yeah exactly yeah it's a fiction as opposed to you know I don't know my mom can't get her kindle book you go which is a problem it is a certain type of a problem yeah it is you are right it is a category of a problem that my mother also shares I just finally canceled the kindle I couldn't we got rid of the kindle we got rid of the smartphone we're like you know these aren't necessary things but you know what I'll say about my mom is she goes once a week on Wednesdays to the Boise Public Library that's right she checks out seven books she goes home the following Wednesday she goes she returns those seven books and checks out seven more books my mom does the same thing with her audiobooks on cassette and CD and it's been a godsend yeah because material culture she can still work it mm-hmm she can keep track of it the problem with the digital downloads is that she couldn't touch it yeah where is it where is it that's right and I couldn't get her over that sort of cognitive leap you know the best thing about being a la president is I get to visit so many libraries and I've visited so many libraries and they're all amazing and some of them have phased out those collections entirely and others have like I was at a ski resort with my family last Christmas and the ski resort library has like a vast collection of DVDs which a lot of libraries have gotten rid of because you can stream things but the community there they have a lot of people who work at the resort and live in their vans and they don't have the internet in their van and so they have a way to check out a VCR and a video so you can watch the video and it's like libraries meet the needs of their communities I'm not sure people know how libraries acquire their stuff yeah I think this is really important because my sense in the debate and the fights I should just let me just speak just very plainly the fights over book bands and information bands and libraries assumes that there is just this sort of you know materials are being selected by fiat by some authority on high but what you have just described there is a lot of negotiation between community needs and the materials that circulate in a library how are books like how do books get into the library they're born there actually not so yeah it's interesting because I'm really interested in the back end of things right like the sort of how's the back infrastructure working you know like how the books and they are selected and acquired by professionals who have training in collection development can you believe that no actual job that a human does so you're saying this is not AI this is not AI okay that's not to say that there aren't sort of subscription plans and selection lists and sort of things that make it easier to buy books for your collection but think about you know there's so much opposition to school libraries and what they have on their collections like that's really where a lot of this fight is happening is like at the school library and the school librarian all they do all day is like think about the kids in the school and look at the curriculum and select books that meet the needs of the curriculum it's like none of it none of the books arrive by accident okay all right yeah and there exist already these mechanisms right for people to nominate the books or ask for books or suggest the books and I think that's one of the things about this sort of the book challenge conversation right now it's not as if libraries don't want community members to engage with us about what we have make suggestions even express concerns it's the sort of bad faith many many book challenges the challenges of books I haven't even read kinds of things that are problematic you pointed out something that I wanted to kind of put a finer point on that so much of this has focused on school libraries and school libraries and public libraries are being targeted at we think roughly equal rates but is there a meaningful difference between trying to remove a book from a school library and trying to remove one from a public library oh that's a good question you know I think school libraries functional differently for their patrons right like we were talking about the school library is like the place I don't know I ate my lunch there every day in the seventh grade their homes for kids in a different way my kid went to a middle school that didn't have a school library there was a public library across the street guess how many times he went to the public library zero times so that he didn't have that sort of center of gravity of the collection that's in a school library and when there are efforts to remove books from the school library that's in you know a direct attack on the fabric of that community and the public library functions similarly I think and but the there's something quite special about the school library as the sort of heart of a kid's life because this is for a kid like the school's their whole whole planet right you know there's no other real world for a kid and in a lot of ways like their world is at school and so removing a book from the school library it's like removing it from their entire world right when you take a book out of a school library you really do pull it out of a child a young person's whole sort of ecosystem in a way and it gets me to thinking about what a library encompasses so a library has this market element it does allow certain transactions it circulates things and but as we've discussed there's also this democratic element it does this in this way that is more about sharing than it is about competition for goods and for resources so there's a market element because it's a man for certain kinds of books and that certainly matters you want things that people want but you want people's voices to be heard you want to serve the needs of a community even if there are only a few people in that community you still want them to have some stuff absolutely that they need that sound about right yeah i don't know i i'm a member of a book club and we read 50 books a year in 50 categories and we've got the categories and then you choose a book that fits in each category and it has really opened up my like reading and i now read a whole lot of books and translation which i never did before and so i read books from all kinds of different parts of the world and you know it's true what they say about a book it opens your imagination it makes the world wider and i'm a big reader you know but there are books i read now that i would never have read before like i read Paris Hilton's memoir this year oh wow i had to read a book that is coming out and has a lot of buzz and so that was a category so i read Paris Hilton's memoir oh and it's not a book that i thought i would read but i read it and it opened my mind a little bit it made me think in new ways and it was good and i'm glad we had it but i wonder if that's what some of the hostility is right that we want uh like it's difficult to imagine supporting something that was for everybody like even people i really don't agree with so as many people as like are mad at me for being who i am like there are lots of people that i don't agree with but i still think that they have a right to read a book you know i don't know but then you think about like what makes a social program successful it's that everybody's in it like social security is durable because all of us use it so when people say the library is vulnerable i actually think it's interesting how durable it has been how this moment is unprecedented we haven't faced what say public education has faced because it's difficult to imagine privatizing the library right you couldn't do it like i couldn't own every book in my house i don't want to own Paris Hilton's memoir i want to read it and then return it so someone else can read it right so it's actually surprising to me i guess in some ways that this institution that does so much to provide equal access to literally everyone in a community i think that is kind of the key to its durability as a social institution hmm you said in an interview that you don't want the library to get stuck talking exclusively on the terms they have set for us rather than the terms that i think the rest of us operate on every day what are the terms of the debate that you wish we were using i wish we were spending less time talking about the book banning stuff i wish we were having a conversation about how to expand libraries that we were talking about what good they do that we were talking about not just the carpet cleaners and Des Moines but the cotton candy machine they circulated the Donolly public library and Donnie's book circulated the Donolly public library in Donley, Idaho to make birthday parties in that rural part of the state a little more fun for kids that we were talking about how to get more cotton candy machines and every library go to has something else like that i just got back from Rotterdam where i was at the international federation of library associations and was going through the poster sessions and saw this library in Romania where they had a program that connected elders who were some of the last in the community to know the sort of lost art of embroidering shirts in this particular Romanian way with young people who learned how to do the embroidery but then also digitize the patterns so that they can be preserved forever and then they both made the shirt and wore it at a library program you know it's like that's magic so i wish we were talking about like more about what that means for a community what it means for the history of the place the future of the place for just that basic human connection that we miss sometimes what do we have to do to get more of that rather than trying to defend what little we have left of what i would argue is the best public institution in the history of the world the library we ask all guests on the show for three book recommendations and i cannot think of anyone better to ask this of not only are you a librarian capital L but you just admit it to being in the most aggressive sounding book club i have ever heard of in my life you know what you if you win the challenge at the end of the year you know what your prizes what you get to invite a new person to join the club i was kind of hoping you were going to say a gold sticker which so trusty if you're interested i i'll keep you in mind it's a big year for me but i still think i'm going to do it it's a big year for you all right keep me in mind all right okay until then do you have three books for us Emily the first book that i want to suggest is a book about libraries i think it's just fantastic by Dan Green called the promise of access and he's got a chapter about the library that just is some of the most solid analysis of what libraries can do and how we need to talk about them so i would recommend Dan Green's book second uh is a book that's on the list of the top 10 band books from the ALA called flamer by mike korato it's a book about a kid at sleepboy camp and i read it this summer when my kid was at sleepboy camp and you know you read it and you in that what we're talking about like do they want to be on the book or they want to be on the person and you read this beautiful tender story of a kid struggling with his sexual identity at a boy scout camp and it's so beautiful and sweet and gorgeous so just a perfect graphic novel i think very sweet and then the last recommendation have you read when we were beautiful by embo lumbuy yes i have oh knocked my socks off the best book i read this year the first chapter of that book should be required reading amazing recommendations thank you Emily thank you for joining me here today i appreciate the conversation thank you so much this this
