    "text": " Good afternoon, Michael Malice here. Let that be your welcome for the next hour and here for my very first episode on podcast one. I am very excited to bring Dr. Deborah Sow, author of The End of Gender, and someone who I absolutely love talking to. And the thing I love about talking to you, Doc, is that in every other interview I see, you always have this kind of very austere, serious vibe to you. But I've known you, we've talked a bit off camera. There is this kind of sweet dork underneath, which I don't think people get to see that much. So let me ask you this. My idol of all time is Camille Palia, and I'm sure you're somewhat familiar with her work. She's kind of this renegade feminist. And one of the things she talks about is sexual persona and how men and women play into different archetypes, both in the bedroom and the boardroom in their professional life. Is that something as a woman who's talking, who discusses things like sexuality and is a sex researcher? Is that something that you have to pay attention to and how you discuss these issues? Oh, yeah. Well, first, let me say thank you so much for having me on. It's so great to talk to you again. I really appreciate that you came on my podcast a couple of weeks ago. It's an honor to be your first guest on podcast one. And I think it's funny that you did notice that. For myself, I would say probably what people will see of me is more serious of a person than I am in real life, like my friends and family who know me, just because the issues I do talk about publicly, things like gender transition and children, things like the differences between trans women and women who were born women. I mean, these are contentious issues. And I feel like it's not really appropriate for me to shop and be laughing and joking about it, because I do take the things I talk about with a lot of responsibility. So but yeah, I would definitely say, I mean, when I get to talk to people like you or if I do other comedians shows, you know, people are like, Oh my God, she actually smiles. Yeah. I'm actually the personality. But regarding your question, I mean, well, I have a whole chapter in the end of gender about differences between men and women when it comes to dating and courtship. There definitely are on average differences between men and women in terms of how they pursue sex and dating. And I think to ignore those differences is futile and foolish because it doesn't end up serving you in the end. And that's not to say all men are the same and all women are the same. Of course, of course, there are some people who are different don't fit into that pattern. But for myself, it definitely I think is something that I have had to think about because coming from a background in sex research, I'm very proud of having been a sex researcher. But unfortunately, I think sex science, human sexuality, the study of human sexuality is not taken as seriously as it should be taken. And I think people also have all these weird assumptions about you as a person when you do sex research. And I think to some extent, I don't like to talk about sexism or misogyny too much because I do think as a woman, I'm very fortunate. I don't feel like that's something in the Western world that we necessarily have to deal with as much. But I do think sometimes as a woman, there's also this tendency for people to assume things about you when you do talk openly about sex. So I like that question. Yeah, there's a it's kind of a parallel to people who are libertarians who want to legalize drugs and then the knock against them is like, oh, you just want to sit at home and smoke weed all the time. Or if someone wants to let's suppose argue for legalizing sex work because it's like, look, these women need to have recourse to the police because if they don't, they're going to be the targets of violent crime and or murder with having no possibility to ask somebody for help. So do you get the thing, oh, you want to talk about this because you're some kind of pervert or something like that? Is that the assumption that people get usually or because my one of the areas of expertise when I one of my areas of expertise when I was in academia doing research is paraphelias. So that's unusual sexual interest, basically kinky sex. And I always tell people I'm very vanilla. I'm very traditional. I'm monogamous when I'm dating somebody, whether or not they believe me or is a different thing. I feel like I do say that, well, because kinky sex is stigmatized and I advocate for removing the stigma around it, so long as things are as long as what you're doing in the bedroom is consensual, I don't think it's anyone's place to judge you. But I also don't want it to ever come across like I'm speaking for that community. Just as I feel it's important whenever I talk about trans issues and the fights I get into with trans activists, I always say that I'm not transgender, not that I think there's anything wrong with it. Obviously, I fully support transgender people, but I just don't ever want to seem like I'm speaking for the community. So this is the same thing with kinky sex. I think people assume when you when you're sex researcher, you must be really promiscuous or you must have some personal reason for doing it or there might be something wrong with you. And that's why you find this interesting. But for me, I just I feel it's interesting. It's fascinating. There's no end to the number of questions that are out there and especially because it is an area that is so taboo. There's so much that could be done and so much that needs to be needs to be done that sex researchers are still fighting for. Do you think Freud has on net had a positive or negative impact in this area? Because for those, I mean, it's pretty common knowledge, but when Freud came out and started over a century ago discussing sexuality and how it develops in children, this was considered a huge taboo. This was a huge, you know, shocking conversation to have. Now there is kind of understanding. Okay, well, we don't really know how sexuality develops. There was a big argument about gay rights and that, you know, gay people are insisting they're born gay, but we don't even really know and please correct me if I'm wrong, how people become straight. We don't know how sexuality develops and what the mechanisms are. So what do you think about Freud's impact on this field? I would say it's the I would say the positive aspect is that it had people it opens up a discussion at least. And from a scientific expert, I mean, a scientific perspective because I always want to come at it from an evidence based perspective. There isn't really any evidence to back up those ideas. So in that way, I think it, well, I mean, it is what it is. And I think people people tend to latch on to things that they might see as somehow explaining their own experiences in life. So I understand that. But again, I think there's so much that is going on in the field of sex research that's actually fascinating that people should and well, they should be paying attention to. And I think with further dissemination of research and I think that is getting better in terms of the way that news is covering these issues. I do think they're a little bit more open to talking about sexuality. Although what we see now instead is, you know, an area that I talk and write about a lot is how left wing activism is now destroying the field and bending it to a particular narrative. Because it used to be, oh, why are these people wanting to study sex? They must be depraved. They must be disturbed. Or why are we wasting money funding these studies? And now the politicization or the interference is coming from the far left saying, okay, we're going to take these studies findings and either misrepresent them or work them to fit our agenda with regard to sexual orientation. So there is actually research to show that sexual orientation is biological. One of the chapters in my book, I talk about this. And so it has to do with exposure to testosterone in the womb. So higher levels of exposure to testosterone is associated with sexual interest in women. But so that's regardless of whether someone is male or female. So you'll see that with straight men and you'll also see that with lesbian women. When it comes to issue of trans and how this plays out because there is a differentiation in terms of say individuals born male who identify as female. And I always want to emphasize I support transitioning adults. I'm critical of transitioning in children because the research does not back that up as the best treatment pathway for these kids. But when it comes to, I mean, there's a difference there in terms of whether someone is a trans women who are attracted to men versus women. There's a difference in terms of the etiology. There's a difference in terms of what the best treatment for them is going to be. And also in terms of say something like bisexuality. People will often use that term to self identify, but it can mean a lot of different things depending on what it is that they find attractive, what it is they're fantasizing about. Yeah, I think the concern I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what JK Rowling said is that when someone is a child and they're like an effeminate boy or they're masculine girl like what tomboy or something like that, they're not going to have the cognitive knowledge or life experience and the difference between I identify the other gender as opposed to I'm displaying characteristics of their gender, but I'm still the gender that I am. So what she's talking about is look, if you have a little boy who's a sissy and you're just going to start pumping him with hormones at a young age, it could just mean that he's an effeminate gay male. It doesn't mean that he's at all transgender woman. And we're seeing this happen as I'm sure you know in your work in Iran, Tehran is the world sex capital, the world sex change capital because any men there who want to sleep with other men, they force them to undergo gender reassign surgery and therefore in effect make them straight. Yeah, I mean, this is one really sad aspect that I'm glad to see that it's being talked about more so now. Definitely I'd say when we were when I was in sex research, we were all saying this is the new conversion therapy because you take children who are gender atypical that is associated with being gay and adulthood. So if you have little boys from more like girls or little girls from more like boys, if that's associated with being gay when when they grow up. So now instead, if you have a child who says that they are the opposite sex, now the adults in their lives think that this means that this child actually is the opposite sex and that they should transition when it's absolutely ridiculous because in many cases, this is the only language that children have to express that they want to do things that the other sex does and especially if their parents or adults say to them, oh, you can't do this thing because say if it's a little boy, only girls do that thing. Well, of course, a little boy is going to then say, well, I must be a girl. And I mean, I even have people, I mean, gay adults reaching out to me and it really touches me so much when I get these messages, especially from gay men who said to me, they were thinking about transitioning at some point, but they happened to read an article I wrote or they saw me in an interview and they decided to wait. And now they are a bit older and they've come out as gay. And they said, they say to me, I thought because I was attracted or I am attracted to men and that I like doing things that girls do, that must mean I'm actually a woman. And I also felt to some extent, they will say to me that being a woman would be an easier life for that, which I think is really horrible. I mean, why are we not talking about acceptance for gay people as well? I do believe that trans people face discrimination. I do think transphobia is real, but I also think it's important to advocate for gay people. I grew up in the gay community. And so, you know, something I'm also very proud about. And it just makes me very sad to see what's happening right now. But I also don't blame the parents to some extent because they are being manipulated, in some cases, by the medical professionals, by these activist organizations into really believing this is the only path forward for their kids. Yeah, it seems to be an enormous, you know, there's the big criticism against like social conservatives, like, oh, you want us to go back to the 50s, but this is the same exact thing because for decades gay men who were kind of a feminine had to argue, no, no, no, I'm attracted to men, but I'm still fully a man. There's no part of me that thinks I'm a woman and they're being told, you're really a girl, you're really a girl, you're a really girl. And now they're being told this by people to their left that, no, you are actually a girl who's attracted to men. And especially when someone is dealing with atypical behaviors in regarding gender, regarding sexuality, it's going to be confusing for everyone. So when you start guiding into things like surgery and hormones, and that's another whole other issue, like everyone understands if women are pregnant or if men take steroids, which are testosterone, this is going to affect their psychology. Not women bodies with vaginas, Michael. OK, thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you for the question. Totally kidding. Thank you for the direction. But it's very well understood that when people have high levels of certain hormones, it's going to affect their psychology. So if someone is undergoing in a state of flux or about their identity to add hormones to that situation, it's not at all a given, although I'm sure it helps some people that this is going to basically calm their mental turmoil and make them feel relaxed. Well, there's often a lot of comorbidity that goes along with especially nowadays with gender dysphoria, because gender is this hot topic, trendy thing. So everyone is jumping on the gender bandwagon. And so when someone is upset about something in their life, even if they go into therapy to talk to a mental health practitioner, many of them will view everything through the lens of gender now. So if you're sad, if you're struggling with something, if you're uncomfortable with your body, that's somehow related to gender, which in some cases, it's just a natural part of life, especially when it comes to teenagers who are going through puberty, especially for young girls. So another area I talk a lot about is rapid onto gender dysphoria, this phenomenon of young women who are very suddenly coming out as transgender and wanting to undergo hormonal treatment, in some cases getting a double mastectomy very quickly. And for many of them, it's just a natural part of going through puberty. They're uncomfortable with having a female figure developing breasts, something being sexualized by society, not being comfortable with that. And no one is saying to them, you know, that's a very normal part of being a young woman, unfortunately, doesn't make it okay. But let's talk about that and let's talk about how we can work and fight against that instead of saying, okay, yeah, you really are a man, so you should transition. And also, I mean, in terms of comorbidity, autism is another mental health condition that you'll commonly see among these young women. And again, I obviously have no issue. I think people with autism deserve love and respect. And I don't think people with autism deserve any sort of stigma. But this fear that activists have about labeling anything as a typical, like mentally different or a mental health condition is partially why they've tried to really push for transitioning not being related to gender dysphoria. And also, I think why they really don't want to associate gender dysphoria or transition with other mental health conditions. Because in the past, it's been very common for people to dismiss transgender people as this is on your head, right? And that's why they should not be like the transition, which I don't agree with. But there needs to be more nuance to this conversation. And the biggest thing is, so I don't do clinical work anymore. But I would say mental professionals need to be able to do this work and ask the questions with their patients and not feel afraid. And that's very much what you see now with pretty much everyone I know they are terrified. They either don't want to do this work if they're an ethical practicing clinician or they feel they have to go along with it. This sounds to me from what I'm hearing and please correct me because I'm obviously coming from place ignorance. When I was growing up, it was extremely common for young women, teenager to early 20s to have some sort of eating disorder, you know, anorexia, bulimia. And what they had to argue for a lot of time in the public consciousness is this isn't really about food. This isn't really about your body per se, this is about control and feeling a loss of control about your circumstances or about the body itself. And the eating is almost secondary. And it seems like this, what you're describing us early on, early on said gender is for you. If I said they're term correctly is just a ship from, you know, having an eating disorder and having these kind of body issues to basically something that's just adjacent to it and the same phenomenon in different form. Yeah, I think there definitely are parallels, but unfortunately researchers are not going to be able to study this objectively because this is the climate we're in right now. That sort of a study would never get funded. And even if it did happen, there's no way it would get published. And if it did get published, it would get pulled and have all sorts of corrections forced on the authors if it was even allowed to be published, it probably would just be retracted up right. So it just would not happen in today's climate, which is really unfortunate because in the end, it is the people who are struggling with this that are going to suffer from that lack of information. But I do think I mean, for life is life is hard. And especially for young people, like the segment of individuals who are going through this, I wish that we could be having a more honest conversation to say to them what you're going through is really unfortunate. I mean, in many cases, there's a history of trauma as well. In many cases, it's also young women who are lesbian, but they're not fully comfortable being attracted to girls. So they think, well, if I transition to male and I'm a man who's attracted to girls or to women, then that's more socially acceptable. I feel like this question is going to trigger you not in a bad way, but in a way that's going to give you like you're going to start going off for 20 minutes. I recently read a book called Testosterone Rex, have you read it? I have not read it, but I know of it. Yes. There we go. Good. So this book was very lauded. And from the description, the description is completely incorrect. The description made it sound as if the author is claiming that testosterone is not important in terms of development of gender, in terms of development of the individual, and that the only reason men bench press more than women is because they've been socialized. She does not make that claim. The claim she does make, however, is that this evolutionary psychology idea, which I'm curious to be subscribed to, the idea is that men are, you need one man and you need like men are less valuable than women, right? The man wants to be as promiscuous as possible because the cost of donating sperm is very little, whereas a woman wants to be as discriminatory as possible because the cost of her for bearing a child is extraordinary hot. She's got nine months and she's got to raise the kid. So that creates an asymmetry historically and naturally that the men are the hunters and the women are the hunted. That plays out in terms of gender roles and dating. She kind of says that that's overblown and that really it's both things happen to a far net men are much choosier than we like to think and that women are much more promiscuous and for biological reasons than we'd like to think. What do you think about that whole argument? And basically that whole premise about you don't want one key that opens a lot of locks but you want that one lock that can only be opened by one key. I would probably have to actually read the book to really speak to the criticisms but I would say just more broadly in terms of the denial I see around biological sex differences, particularly in the brain or differences between men and women that are based in evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology. I understand why people find them threatening and I'll try not to make this a 20 minute rant. No, please. Why people find it threatening because yeah, there are, I mean, some people out there will take these explanations to denigrate women and say that women are inferior. We're not as competent. We don't belong in disciplines like STEM or I mean there's a whole, I talked in the book about just internet culture and how some people will use these explanations as a justification to treat women poorly. And I always try to be as clear as possible that when I say these things, I'm not giving evidence or I'm not supporting these really misogynistic views of women. But to deny that these differences exist does it disservice, I think, to gender equality because I think most people know that it's true. This information is true. So then when you just claim that it doesn't exist or it's not factual, people don't take you seriously. So they don't even care about whatever the aspects of your argument are when you're saying it's important for us to care about gender equality. They just think this person has no idea what they're talking about. So why should I listen to them? And then it also doesn't speak to the fact that there are these people who are using it for their negative, whatever views they have on women. You can't even engage at that level in terms of the conversation if you're pretending that none of these differences matter. And I think it does it disservice in the end of the day when it comes to actual dating and how this plays out because I hear what inspired that chapter of my book is all the young women who have reached out to me saying, I see my friends sleeping around or I'm trying to do this. I'm not happy. I don't know if there's something wrong with me. I would get a lot of young women saying that they don't understand why they don't approach sex in the same way that their boyfriends or male partners do if they're straight and that men can get aroused very quickly. Whereas women, it takes a little bit longer. There's a bit more of a disconnect between psychologically and physically being aroused if you're a woman. So when you know these things, this can help you in the bedroom. And then to just pretend that none of this matters, I think that's a really short-sighted way to view it. But I think also people are very quick to also look at specific cases of, oh, I know this person who's like this or I'm like this. So how can you say, but again, I mean, we're talking about averages and you can't pretend that millions of years of evolution just suddenly don't matter because you don't want it to matter. It's amazing how people don't understand, to a large extent, like I'd say, a good 40% population, don't understand that the expression tends to. So if I say, for example, men tend to be tall than women, I've had people reply, I know a girl who's 6'3\", which is as fascinating to me as if I live in a universe where I've never encountered a tall woman. And when you try to reverse engineer the thought process, they literally think you're saying all men are taller than all women, which is something so absurd on its face, but this is how they process data and then you realize there's no real conversation to be had. Here is the question I know everyone's going to be very excited for me to ask you. You talked earlier about autism, you talked about trans issues and aberrant sexuality. Have you been following the Christian story? No, what is that? Oh, basically Christian was a severely autistic internet personality who developed a character that's a mix of Pikachu and Sonic called Sonic shoe. He came out as transgender. She came out as Christian, transgender. At one point, she had a wound in a certain part of her body, which she perceived as God giving her a female anatomy. And she was recently trolled by the internet into having relations with her senile mother and is now in prison for this. And there's questions about which kind of prison male or female she's going to be put into. So there's like two hour internet documentaries about this, which I think would be absolutely the worst possible use of your time. But since many of my listeners have nothing to do, I'm sure they're going to follow that rabbit hole. So I apologize to you for going down that question. No, this is a good question. I'm amazed I haven't heard about this. I would say there's a number of things I could say with regard to the prison aspect. I mean, this is one issue that just blows my mind the fact that you will have. And so I don't really know too much about this Christian or Christian. Christian, as it like for Chan, Christian. Okay. So I don't know about this particular individual person. Can you look them up on your computer in front of us? Can you Google Christian to see the picture? Because I want to see everyone's, Deborah so reacts to the look of a Christian. Let me see. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see how the right thing comes up when we see how serious her face remains when she looks at this. It'll be like the Nazis looking into the Ark of the Covenant at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Okay. I think this is the person. Yeah, I think you'd know. Okay. Well, okay. So. Okay, good. Moving on. You're saying that prison though, and all seriousness. So prison. Yeah. Keep it together, Deborah. You're a camera. Keep it together. You're a doctor. You're a professional. You're an author. Like sneezed. So. What I would say about prison is it's it blows my mind the fact that you will have in some cases individuals who were arrested as male. Yeah. For a sex offense or in some cases they have a history of multiple sexual offenses and then they are put in prison and they suddenly identify as female and they're actually put into the women's prison. And I'm thinking, what are these people thinking? I mean, are they thinking? I've worked with sex offenders in the past, both clinically and in research, and you know that sex offenders, I mean, they're just trying to get access to victims. That's basically their life mission. So why would you give them another basically a free past? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if people are just overly empathetic to the whole issue of gender dysphoria or if they're afraid of the backlash from activists, but it's just that alone speaks to where we are culturally in terms of how crazy this is. How do you personally handle it if you're talking to someone who is a very known, or is a no-unestablished sexual assailant and knowing when they're talking to you that, you know, if this person had their druthers, you know, if I was in a alley somewhere, this person would be assaulting me right now. Like, how do you kind of keep your composure or have a conversation with something like that? Because most of us will never encounter someone, at least to our knowledge, who is that level of evil. If you were to encounter someone who is a sexual offender, sorry, I feel like I missed a part of what you were saying. No, because you were saying like in your work used to kind of interview people like this, right? So like, how do you handle it on a personal level, like trying to have a company like me and you, we could pal around, we can joke, and they're not like, it's not like the person has horns, they don't have a tail or a pitchfork, they look like you and me. They look like a normal person, but knowing that this is what they have done and knowing if they had their opportunity, they would be doing this again, possibly to you. How do you as a female just sit and have this conversation with them? Oh, I see what you're saying. I think I'm still like settling down from the Christian. I'm really proud of this conversation. I would just, I mean, it's work. So I would just try to be as professional as possible, but definitely there was a whole, I mean, I've never really talked about this, but there's a whole bunch of things that you learn in terms of how to physically protect yourself and what you look out for. I've always just been very good at reading people, so I think that's part of it in terms of how I was able to keep myself physically safe. But I mean, my reason for wanting to do that work was to help society or to understand this behavior, to do something good for society. And it's very difficult work. And I have so much respect for people who work in the field of forensics because it takes a lot out of you emotionally. I would say we talked a bit about this when you were on the podcast in terms of just how it affects you. Even if you try to keep your professional life completely separate from your personal life, it can't help but bleed over a little bit if you're a human being and you experience emotions, which contrary to what probably a lot of people think, I'm not a robot. I am a human being. So I do feel when you hear about these cases, especially when you read the case reports in some cases, it's very, very graphic. But at the same time, I think it has helped me in a way because I'm able to look at issues, whatever it is, very, very logically and rationally, to take the emotional aspect out of it and also to I think also deal with angry trolls on social media because to me, that's nothing in the grand scheme of life in terms of what's out there. You definitely become less desensitized to a lot of things after doing that type of work, which I do think has helped me in some ways. What do you think is the biggest mistake that young men are making nowadays when it comes to trying to mate or kind of because there's so much confusion about gender and I'm sure in your research, you've encountered things that are like things people are doing that are wrong anyway. I suppose things that are doing that do end up facilitating male female attractions. So do you have any kind of professional advice to young men? I would say to be a gentleman, number one, I feel young men nowadays feel this pressure too. They're so afraid of offending their date. I think it's good to be sensitive, of course, not don't be rude. But I say my book, if a woman's going to be offended by you holding the door, holding the chair or pulling the chair off or her, things like that, then that's probably not the right person for you. And I'm sure there'll be other things that would come up later on because there's no reason for someone to get offended over something like that. It's one thing to say that it's really not necessary. But I think any woman should view that as a kind gesture. It's not patronizing that someone wants to do something nice for you. And what else could I say? Yeah. And just to don't feel bad about being pursuing someone. And I understand in today's society posted me to the men are terrified of this. But women do still like the chase. I think there's a there's a balance there, which is one thing I feel was really unfortunate about me too. I do think there was a net positive. I mean, I was very critical of me too when it was definitely in the height. We were at the height of it because there was it just seemed that again, it's like so many issues. You can either be on one side or the other side. And it's very difficult to say, well, there are some good things here, but there are also some bad things because you're immediately seen as evil. And I don't think it's helpful to just say that men across the board are sexual predators and they're all terrible. And without saying, OK, there are some men like that, but most men are not like that. And how can we come away from this discussion with something that's ultimately going to be beneficial to both sexes? Because at the end of the day, if you're straight, you're going to have to interact. We're going to have to interact with each other. We're going to be dating with each other. And it's not helpful if if say women come away from this thinking that men are all predators and men come away with thinking, oh, if I do the wrong thing, I'm going to end up, my life could be ruined for this. So yeah, I think just my general advice would be if you're an ask woman, I was asked once and that's it. Women if you're not interested, tell a man you're not interested. Don't say, don't make it about something else. I think women we often feel we don't want to offend someone understandably because in many cases that comes from fear, especially you know, you don't know how someone's going to respond or retaliate potentially. But I think that's that in some cases can be part of this confusing dynamic. If a woman is saying, oh, I'm not busy right now or I have a boyfriend or whatever because then the man comes away from it saying, okay, well, now it's not the right time, but I'll try again later. As someone who's working to kind of destigmatize kind of unusual sexual practices in the bedroom, you're 100% has to be consent has to be something I both parties can appreciate and so on and so forth. One of the big arguments that traditional conservatives are making nowadays is that the prevalence of pornography and the increasing consumption of pornography has led young men to especially to have very unrealistic expectations of women in the bedroom and that it's also opening doors in terms of, you know, things like incest porn getting people just it's just getting trying to push the envelope further further further to the point where they're having a regular intimate relationship with their girlfriend. They just feel bored because it's too vanilla. Do you think this is the fair criticism of the pornography industry? No, I don't think so and it's interesting because you see this not just on the right you see it on the left too in terms of say radical feminists, radical feminism. So I think pornography is an easy topic to criticize because it has to do with human sexuality. So that is the salient thing or that's the thing that people tend to jump on. But it's more often I would say reflection of I mean it's difficult for me to say for every individual person. But of course, if someone has negative views about women or unrealistic standards, I think it has more to do with that individuals views about women as is and it just happens to manifest through pornography. I understand the concern because I do think today's pornography is very different from pornography of decades past and it's just in some cases it is very extreme, not just in terms of the sex acts, but also in terms of what people look like or what the expectations are. But I do think if young people especially have proper sex education and understand that pornography is not real life, that would help to mitigate a lot of these issues. But we don't have those conversations so much. And I understand why it's uncomfortable for parents. But I think it's very easy for people on both sides to just blame pornography for whatever issues that they're seeing. Or also I would say this conversation about violence in the bedroom. I've been hearing a lot about that. I think that's very disturbing. Can you stand on that? What do you mean? Well just young women saying that they will have male partners who are spitting on them, calling the names, choking them, thinking that that's pleasant. Some people, if they're into BDSM might enjoy that, but that's something that you have a discussion about with your partner and you have to detail boundaries. You don't just spring it on someone, especially not the first time you're together. Oh my gosh, that's horrifying. Yeah, I've been hearing a lot of stories about that. But the thing is I don't think it's pornography's fault. I think it's that these individuals who think that this is how you should treat a woman the first time you're alone with her probably have some negative use of women as is. So that's what we should be talking about as opposed to saying, oh it's porn. But I think for example, most people, you ask them how they think policemen are or how the military war is, they're going to point to a movie. People generally think like Lord of the Flies is history and not a novel or they think black panther is a documentary. So if you're a young man who has very little sexual experience and your entirety of sexual experience is watching it on a screen and seeing a woman who's enjoying these sort of things, can you see how he would get the idea that this is what sexuality is? Yeah, definitely. I mean, if it's someone who's watching it and who genuinely thinks this is what women likes, if he's new and to the arena and is figuring things out, I don't so much blame him and I blame the lack of sex education in that case. And I blame why I haven't his parents had a conversation with him in terms of what to expect when you get there. That's a bit different. Well, I mean, in that case, if a female partner says, no, I don't like it. And I also advocate for young women to say if you don't like something, say you don't like it and don't go along with it and don't feel like you have to say, you don't feel like you have to go along with something to please your partner. I think it's different if you're in a long-term relationship and you know each other really well and you have an understanding, you know, to be you can be a bit more open-minded in that case. But if it's definitely something new, no, your physical safety is the most important thing. And I feel for young women who because I understand where they're coming from, I think in many cases, young women feel the need to please their male partners in a way that men may not feel that pressure. In some cases, like we mentioned earlier, I mentioned earlier, in some cases, I think young women might even be afraid or feel a bit coerced. And so more broadly, I would say just for young people who are getting into this, that's why I think you should probably know someone decently well before you get involved with them sexually because it's such an intimate thing. You are putting yourself physically in a very vulnerable place, especially for women. And I mean, if you're into casual sex, that's your business. And I say, you know, whatever floats your boat. These are things to think about also because I think that would help prevent a lot of the unfortunate things that we've been seeing. And you're also putting yourself in a very vulnerable place emotionally, which I think is something for both men and women that's kind of swept in the rug. And I think both genders are taught that you're supposed to enjoy casual sex, not think much of it. And I think it's very hard for almost everybody to kind of have that lifestyle and not kind of, for example, I had a friend who used to clean up on Tinder. And now he's kind of obese, so he's not doing so hot. And I'm sure he's listening. So yeah, I'm talking about you. And I asked him, I go, listen, if you're sleeping with all these girls and you never see them again, doesn't that get lonely? And he's like, yeah, it's like really hard because you share this intimate moment. You had a night together having conversation. And then you never see them again. On some level, your brain is going to tell you there must be something wrong with me, either the performance or me as a person, if they just have no interest in talking me again. If you run that experiment enough times and you get the same result, it's telling you something. That's interesting because you don't really hear so much of that side of it with men in terms of casual sex, in terms of getting emotionally attached. Because definitely, I would say on average, women are more likely to get attached and men are more likely to have a great time and not feel that attachment afterwards. But I think that's a useful part of the conversation also to say for men, it might seem like a really fun time, but it may not be for everybody. How would you encourage healthier sex education and having people have a healthier understanding of these issues? Like what age? I mean, this is such a taboo topic. How would you navigate it? It would definitely need to be age appropriate. And whenever I hear people criticizing sex ed curriculum, I try to go and actually look at it myself because sometimes people will claim, oh, they're teaching kids all sorts of inappropriate things. But then when you actually look at it in the context in which they're teaching it, it is actually just about trying to prevent sexual abuse, which I think is very important. This is what we talked about when you come on my show. Very, very important just to help kids identify what is appropriate, not appropriate, how to talk about something if it has happened to them. I mean, this topic is so fraught. I would say definitely it has to be science based, which is very difficult because anything that has to do with human sexuality or gender has just been totally taken, the activists have completely, they're trying to destroy any sort of factual inquiry into these topics and it's just about their particular agenda. I mean, you have all this weird gender ideology and sex ed curriculum. So ideally, I would say it would have to be, I mean, consent is a huge topic. I think it's good that in many places consent is being discussed. I guess, well, how much time do we have those podcasts? I don't want to take up the entire episode. No, this is very important. I would just say legitimate experts in the field, scientific experts in the field should be the ones being consulted about at what age certain aspects of knowledge are appropriate. I do understand parents who are concerned or saying, you know, why are kids being taught about anal sex or why they being taught about XYZ? But the other thing is research has shown that comprehensive sex ed, so sex ed that is not abstinence only education actually leads young people to make better decisions when they do become sexually active. So they're more likely to use contraception and to also delay sexual activity. So they'll start having sex at a later age, which I think is a good thing. So it's not that sex ed puts these ideas into kids' heads and it's giving them ideas about things to do because I'm sure, I mean, I remember most kids, even just as they're getting into puberty, a lot of them are already starting to experiment. So it's not in many cases, parents, if you think that your kid is not curious about this stuff, I mean, they are. Especially with, so one thing I am critical about pornography, or one aspect of it is the fact that young children are using this as sex education and increasingly younger ages, I mean, in some cases studies have shown younger than 10. And I can't imagine if that is the first time you're encountering, like today's pornography is that that's the first time you are encountering any sort of ideas about sex. And that's what you think sex is going to be like. What I think can be, we don't know what the long term effects are at this point, but I don't imagine it's good for development. So in that way, I understand the concern. Okay, given your profession, I've got a question I'm sure no one's ever asked you, and I'm very curious to hear your answer, because there's no way this is what you wanted to have happened. What did little Debbie want to do when she grew up? Because she didn't know I wanted to be a sex researcher and author. So... No, what did I want to... I actually wanted to be an architect. Okay. Yeah. So how did that fall away and how did you fall into this career path? Because this is a very unusual one, of course. Yeah. Well, you know what? I wanted to be an architect and I also wanted to be a writer. Okay. And I actually remember it was crazy because... Wait, did you have glasses when you were a little kid? You must have been so cute. Did you have the big glasses? Oh my God, it's so cute. I think I did. Oh my God, little Asian girl with the big glasses. Oh my God, just pull it up. Bless your talks. I was so tiny too. I hope it's your question now. How you got into the career you have now as a better thing architect and writer, yeah. Right. I mean, I didn't even know that sex research existed. I went into neuroscience. I mean, I'm trying to remember what is it that took me away from architecture of the science. You know, brain imaging technology just was so wild to me when I discovered that we had the ability to see what was happening in the brain, semi-inreal time. I mean, FMRI, there's a bit of a delay when you're looking at brain activation. But it's basically real time and I thought, this is amazing. And then I did a placement in sex research when I got into graduate school and I thought, this is even more amazing. So that just ended up being the path I went down, but I did always want to write books eventually. So the fact that I got to do it at this stage is amazing. I mean, you've done so many books, so we should have a conversation about this one day in terms of comparing notes in terms of what the process is like and how you get into it. You get inspired in everything. I'm pretty promiscuous in terms of my assumptions. So are your parents like traditional Asian, like hard-ass parents? Very strict, yeah. Okay, so how did you sit down? Is a tiger mom? Was that kind of the situation? How did you sit down tiger mom and say, Mom, I'm going to start talking about sex for my job? Like, I mean, was that a fun conversation to have? I've always been a weird, like you said, I've always been dorky and I've always been weird. So my parents were not really weirded out by it. They're just like, okay, I mean, we're just happy. We're just happy that she's going to have a career to some extent, right? It could be worse. Do you have any siblings? Do you have any siblings? I don't like to talk too much about sex. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just right. I'm just right. Okay. Just because activists can be crazy. Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to pry. I thought it was just a fun topic. No, I know. I wish I could. I would love to, but I got you. I totally get it. I totally get it. Yes. I think I and even people in my position who take certain controversial perspectives and certain issues, I sometimes forget how fortunate I am that I don't have to deal with some of the harsher consequences for what could come of it. And I know you've had to deal with things like that. So I completely appreciate perspective and I was not trying to cross a line and I silly kids to go there. Let's talk about something fun. How bad is Canada right now? Like are you allowed to leave your house? Oh, man. It, yeah. I mean, we have a passport mandate or yeah, we have a mandate for non essential for basically like large areas and indoor dining and things like that. I mean, I could technically travel, but there's so many hoops to go through at this point. It's just such a mess. So I have this whole everything that's happened in the last two years. I just what worries me the most is the authoritarian aspect. I know this is something you talk quite a bit about just that it's scary to me to see the way people behave and this mob mentality about certain things and the lack of critical thinking. And also, I guess I'm surprised to see the people who have been upset at me for the things that I've said. But I also realize, I mean, I think my job as a columnist and as a political commentator is to say what I think is not to say things that please people. So when people get upset at me, because they love what I say about gender, but they're upset that I'm critical about certain aspects of this narrative, I think, well, I'm not, you know, I appreciate your support, but my audience, I'm trying to attract people who just want to understand the truth and to pursue interesting questions and ask me and not be afraid to ask questions. And so if it upsets you that I'm questioning things, this is my job. So I'm not sure what I'm not sure what to tell you. I understand that it's an emotional topic for a lot of people. I mean, I do think that the pandemic is serious. We should take it seriously. But there's a lot of stuff that's been happening that I find very worrisome. How do you between the pandemic and the seriousness of the topics you cover and dealing with people who are dealing often with extreme mental situations? I know we've talked about this a little bit, but personally, how do you kind of focus on maintaining good mental health? It's very hard to have that arms like perspective ourselves. Yeah, that's very important. I do really prioritize mental health both for myself and my loved ones. And I would say for anybody listening, it's so important. And especially I would say at the start of the pandemic when we went to lockdown, I mean, for me, I was in the process of I just finished writing a book. So that in itself, I'm not sure if it's like that for you. But that to me is basically like a lockdown. Well, for me, it's postpartum. Did you have postpartum when you finished your book? No, did you really? Every time I finish a book, maybe this could be I'm not joking. This could be a male brain, female brain difference because women tend to, by which I mean, every woman is better there men. Women tend to be better at multitasking than men do. So when I'm writing a book, this is the only focus in my psyche. And when that focus is taken away, it's kind of like, you know, I don't know, like, shopping off a cliff. I don't know what's what I'm focused on anymore. And I'm in free fall and it really does a number on me. That's less than now because I've got the podcast. I have my garbage on Twitter and all this other stuff. But when I was only doing books, it really was extremely difficult. And it took me a long time to understand that this is somewhat common and is I pretty much a similar phenomenon to postpartum. Wow. Would you find that before you were writing books, would you find that with other projects you were working on in the same, like, if you get really interested in something and then it finishes? Just there's a pause there. Yeah, because then because for me, my work is a large part of my identity. So if I'm not doing like I'm not going towards some goal at the moment, then who am I? And like, what's the point? And it's it's very dark. And now that I know that it's there, it's a much less of an issue. But so that's interesting that you didn't have the same phenomenon when you finished your book. No, but I think that's great too. Like you have great self awareness and that you you recognize it so that you know to also anticipate it the next book when I mean, you're writing the white pill right now. Yeah, yeah, it's it's great. It's well, it's very, very hard because it's I mean, talk about I mean, when you're writing about like children being tortured and driven to suicide and like things that they did to them. It's you know, there was a lot of tears because, you know, as an author, as I'm sure you know, you're reading source material and then you kind of have to empathize with the characters who are real people and then you have to translate in a way that was palatable that anyone can understand. And it's I guess it's somewhat similar being an actor, right? You're putting yourself in this person's shoes, but instead of being performative verbally and physically, you're doing it literally. And you know, when you hear about, you know, children being slaughtered and people in the west saying, this is a good thing. We need to import it here. And none of these people have ever been held accountable. It really does a number on you. You know, this one story, I think I maybe even told you on your show. There was a concentration camp for kids up through the 80s in East Germany. And you know, all the staff were largely staffed by like sexual predators because they knew that's where the victims were. And this one kid who was like 15 was like, Hey, how about I kill myself? And that let's make a distraction. The rest of you can make a getaway. And this is like 1986. So, you know, in like near Berlin. So when you know that this is like yesterday and across the street and like still no one cares, it's really, really tough. And it's like, why am I the only one who cares about this? This is just an abomination of abominations that no one should, you know, be indifferent to. It's so, so sad. And I remember when I was doing a deep dive into the transitioners and their stories, that was really, that was probably when I was writing my book, that was probably the most emotionally difficult part for me to realize that this is happening right now. And these young people are basically being completely ignored and treated. Yeah, not only that being attacked, they're being attacked by people until that they're bad people. But I would definitely say just more broadly when it comes to dealing with mental health, just social support is very, very important to always, you know, if you're, even if you feel like you can manage it yourself, sometimes it's okay just to reach out to people. And so for me, that was definitely what when I was in that many of my friends will tell you, I mean, if they could talk about this, that that was a difficult part for me. But yeah, in terms of just mental health more broadly, exercise is really important. And I know that, yeah, so my point with lockdown was just, I know it was really difficult for a lot of people. And I feel very lucky in that I've been really healthy. But I'm just, I think part of it is coming from a background in mental health and also being aware that you have to prioritize sleeping and eating well, exercising, being around positive people. That's a no, that's a huge thing. I think people can really underestimate the amount of influence that the people around you have in terms of the way you think and how you feel. That's huge. And there's a lot of this is what when you're young, you're just everyone who's amiable, you have shared interest, you tend to be friends with them. And when you get older, sometimes people never learn this, but it's very important that there are people who are extremely negative, who are driven by negativity. And it is very important for them to pass that negativity on to you, because if there's positivity, their worldview is implodes. So to validate their perspective, they really need everyone around them to be as visible as them. And when you, it's important to be able to identify these toxic people. And there's a term in recovery where it says, you can't make them sane, but they can make you crazy. So it's really important to have people who are around you who are supportive and understanding and not just there to pull out the rug from under you, because that's the world. Because that's the kiss of death. And today too, I mean, I am a huge supporter of people going and speaking to a professional, if that's something they struggle with. I really feel in today's day and age, there's no reason. And I think it's really good that therapy is being destigmatized and talking about mental health is destigmatized. So there's no reason if you're struggling with something, I mean, it can be scary, the thought of going and talking to someone about it. But the alternative of me for people who are extremely negative in many cases, like you're saying, they, there's a part of it. And I think it's a part of the problem that enjoys it or they want to stay that way because it's comfortable. But it's ultimately up to you what's good for you in terms of the people you have around you also. Dr. So we're running out of time. What has been your favorite part of this interview? My favorite part was getting to catch up with you and also the fact that your questions were so unique. I really appreciate that because I know that that, you know, that's hard work. You are welcome. One-third of all murder cases in America remain open. He had told me that if I opened my eyes, he would slip my throat. Each one is called a cold case. The DNA evidence taken from the victim was a match. The linen rapist was added again. Based on the hit A&E television program, a phone call is placed, one that changes a family's life forever. Cold case files, the podcast. If you could see the fire in his eyes, you screamed at me. You want it? Get your tape recorder out. Get new episodes of cold case files every Tuesday.
