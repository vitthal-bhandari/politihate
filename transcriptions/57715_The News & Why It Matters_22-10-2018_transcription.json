Yeah Welcome I've been here the whole time actually I've just been invisible Top story top story today. I think has to be the conspiracy wire What talk show host is capable of invisibility we have the answer to that We're going two weeks away from the election which gives me free pass to be is nerdy about polling stats Yeah, I can yeah, I can do that and we'll do some of that today alright Jason Losing a 17-point lead was not the top story for you. Well, that's why my voice is like this The We'll do that to your voice. I apologize. Is it really oh, yeah, I thought maybe you were sick. Oh, that's holy It depends on what kind of sick you The migrant caravan the latest numbers are insane who is originally behind this do you have it the new numbers? No, do you have who's behind it yet? Originally originally alright All right, got a lot to get into there before we do that want to thank our sponsor brick house Brick house is getting me through today with their product from dawn to dusk because After a really terrible Cowboys loss. I found it hard to fall asleep. I was really angry. I'm sure you Yeah, it was the only thing I got me through today was I knew at least the Cowboys lost too But yeah, there's days especially when you when you don't get enough sleep or you get that you know through one of those like you know Mid-afternoon meetings and you're really struggling no fence plant You need the dawn to dusk and it does a great job with that. Yes, and I actually slept well last night I was yesterday. I was in a English pub Believe it or not and I was watching football Okay English football. I don't even know whose side but I In thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't there was an age screaming. I was just like wow that's fun And I moved on with my And you like their costumes the costumes were nice But they also have a field of greens which I know we've all tried on the show Usually with men it's a much better way for them to get their vegetables because you guys are all like I don't like to eat my vegetables So that's how we sound Very accurate so you can go to brickhouseblaze.com and use promo code greens for 15% off of your first order Or you can text screens to four one four one one Glenn conspiracy wiper Well, I found out that by just Saying the truth about mr. Koshogi Koshogi Koshogi so Koshogi there's about 20 pronunciations the dead guy I Am a conspiracy theorist once again. It's a conspiracy theory just to say what he actually believed in his own words It's a conspiracy theory It shows you how powerful the left is and how in bed the left is with the Muslim Brotherhood He's the guy in south that was killed from Saudi Arabia that was in Istanbul And there's some new details that have come out that are pretty remarkable. This is like This you wouldn't this couldn't happen in a movie you wouldn't believe you'd be like oh, they'd never do that but apparently they might have But let's not forget who he is and let's not forget who they are and let's also not forget who Turkey is There are no good guys in this story Turkey is not an ally. I remember when we were thinking about let's bring them in a NATO I remember thinking that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard and I was playing Britney Spears records at the time They're not an ally not a friend. They want to caliphate They just want to be the head of the caliphate and it's a Muslim Brotherhood to caliphate Saudi Arabia they want to caliphate they want I will hobbyist Caliphate and they have spent Millions and millions and millions of dollars spreading that virus even here to the United States They deny it our officials deny it but anybody who lives in certain parts of Virginia know exactly what I'm talking about People who live in Dearborn know exactly what I'm talking about They have they're not a friend of freedom or the United States So kashoggi kashoggi kashoggi hops and befords incorporated or whatever that was The He leaves Saudi Arabia because he is for the Muslim Brotherhood in his own words Yes, I joined the Muslim Brotherhood. He leaves he takes exile in in one of his writings For the Washington Post printed in the post He says it's foolish to think that any government could be formed in the Middle East that wasn't an Islam Assist run government. Yeah, but other than his own words other than his own words saying hey I am for an Islam assist government Which by the way is never good That's what Saudi Arabia has just a different form of Islam not the Muslim Brotherhood I tweet this Weekend something about him saying hey, let's not forget Muslim Brotherhood I'm a conspiracy theorist No, no, here are the facts. Here are the facts. Is it somebody in the media? I did that no it was a dog pile. It was a dog pile. I didn't even I didn't care to even notice who said it I just noticed it was being said and and it was it was craziness craziness definitely seems like their take on this is to try to any any words of criticism on him are being taken as you're Excusing what happened or you're you're trying to protect Trump or I because everyone has to relate everything to try tweeted three things This is not a defense of Donald Trump's response to this. This is not a defense of Saudi Arabia. He did not deserve this But it's not a conspiracy to quote him now Donald Trump I don't know what he's going to do yet I don't like the way we've handled it, but I have to reserve the right to say I don't know how I would handle it as President of the United States this one's a tough one a lot of people in the media and Even big-time think tanks like Brookings. I was reading this thing from Brookings talking really downplaying How bad the Muslim Brotherhood was like actually that not even downplaying it they were straight up saying that they were Going along the lines of they're a secular, you know political entity Of course They're not and everyone that's ever looked into them knows that but the problem is is that the Obama administration was very very good with people Like Ben Rhodes making people think that no, no, they're all good Here's how we know about the Muslim Brotherhood not only through history and when they were founded not only through their current day slogans and everything else in the Middle East but we also know because the Muslim Brotherhood printed and we found after 9-11 a list of their goals in the United States and One of them was to turn the press into an ally to say the Muslim Brotherhood Isn't really anything but a secular group promoting democracy Well, they're stating what they're trying to do back in the 90s We find it after 9-11 and now the media just Wait what you're you don't think they just did that to you because that was their goal It's a kashoggi's his is he's got a really interesting story He really he was he was he was aligned with that with the government in the in the very beginning with the Saudi royal family and His job was basically to edit newspapers to make sure nothing bad came out about the royal family So that was his job if that sounds like a freedom a press loving, you know Your your mistaken so then so so he is he should be the he should be the enemy of the press Just just on that background alone He should be the enemy but the moment he slipped up was when he allowed a pro Muslim Brotherhood attack on a Wahhabi cleric to slip through the cracks and get through then he got basically kicked off that that Beat all of a sudden he became a media darling all of a sudden out of nowhere. It makes absolutely no sense They should all be it not of course I think because the timing is interesting I think the timing all of his friends ended up in a you know Saudi slaughterhouse because the Muslim Brotherhood because of what was happening in Egypt and you know so By that time everybody in the media is telling us Muslim Brotherhood and the revolution in Egypt is wonderful Are they not? Yeah, the timing wrong. No. Yeah, it is amazing I mean the whole story is incredible Obviously when this first comes out there's reasons to be skeptical about it, right? I mean Turkey Turkey is no friend of Saudi Arabia. Almost every report was coming in from Turkey That that this was what was happening But now we have reports that they actually after he was murdered had someone who looked like him put on his clothes and walk around town So he could be caught on camera so they could later say no he left here I mean this is like it is legitimate like Brad Thor type stuff going on in the middle of the story We've this this story is amazing to me And I think maybe why it matters in a bigger larger context is that we've all just been kind of given a glimpse into The reality on the ground in the Middle East right now There's two we have two allies. They're supposed allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia And there's this war that's being fought between the two and it's a bloody very bloody war and they both support terrorists Terrorist activities on both sides of your law and the coffee exactly and now you have the media and other government like legacy You know think tanks. They're all kind of rushing to back, you know their stance They've had over the past decade to say no no Yeah, the Muslim Brotherhood They're really great guys They hope that you don't do your own homework and look in and mark my work these are facts Muslim Brotherhood invented modern-day jihadism. They inspired al-Qaeda The co-founder with Osama bin Laden was a Muslim Brotherhood member They are the ones they are the ones who said we'll infiltrate Western democracies because we have to destroy them so we will disguise ourselves as Democracy lovers and we will implant ourselves in there so we can destroy them from the inside. Am I wrong? You're exactly right. I mean it this is all well known and this is who they've jumped in bed with but on the other hand We've also jumped in bed with the Saudis. Yes, who is a mafia state I mean they're doing the same they're capable of this barbering barber is such a mafia state Tell me the godfather part of the story that just came out today. Oh my gosh. This is insane So this is again. This is a Turkish source, but these keep on rolling out So supposedly they also have proof that there was a Skype call between one of the guys from Saudi Arabia that ordered the hit His name's Katani. He's like the head of the princes like communications or something like that Basically propaganda main guy number one that he's skyped into the torture session So he's up on a big screen it is there pops his face they he could see he could see kashagi and He ordered the hit from Skype so face to face ordered the hit from Skype Pup told them to dismember the body, but bring the horse to the head make sure they bring the horse to the head back to him So basically bring his head back to me, which is godfather. That's insane. It's crazy Want to move on to Stu's topic, but I want to make sure that you have enough time to geek out Good. So let's take a break and we'll be back in a minute Glenn back is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country, but at least we can all go down laughing Glenn back live The addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall All right a lot to get into but I want to make sure we thank our sponsor the segment my patriot supply Glenn I know that you have worked with my patriot supply for a long time big advocate of Keeping emergency food. Yeah, I think I mean you're seeing this we were just talking about this this morning I think we're gonna do a show hopefully on On the reality of the ground in the hurricane nobody's talking about the president and female who's to blame and everything else You go to Florida some other talk about they're talking about do you have water? They're talking about my neighbor doesn't have electricity. How can we get electricity there? they're talking about real-life stuff and That's when when the crap hits the fan That's what matters and that's what my patriot supply does and does better than anybody else I know I've looked at all of them. I've been doing this for 20 years These people are the best and they make it easy for shiloves to which I think is important to note because Glenn's like an actual like He actually you know knows stuff about preparation and doing this for a while. I've got a surgery kit. He's got I do you really I do wow and a book and a bunch of appendix out I mean I will say with Obamacare. It may be coming by You know you got all that I'm looking through this book and I'm like who do I know that would have the guts to do this? You'd have to be laying on the ground going just cut me open Okay, but it's not gonna work out well You can get two weeks of Emergency food supply that is breakfast lunch and dinner two weeks worth for seventy five dollars That is a steal you can go to prepare with news Dot-com and get you that two-week food supply. All right, Stu We're two weeks away from the election basically two weeks tomorrow and we will have by the way coverage here on the blaze I'm not gonna be exactly the kind of coverage that you get you know an NBC it's gonna be a tad different Which means it's gonna be way better. Yeah. Oh, yeah It's gonna be one you're gonna want you're gonna want to have some boost. Yeah, I'll enjoy this we can make that happen So but what's interesting is there's a new poll out from NBC and the poll told an interesting story First of all was the best poll that Donald Trump has had in a very long time I think his approval rating was 47 percent, which is high as it's been in a non-rasp muscle and pole You know raspa's and it's been is always been very positive for the president 80% But to get that from Wall Street Journal of NBC is a big deal But in the poll they have they ask a question before midterm election And the question is on a scale from one to ten give me your intensity on this election How closely are you following and how much are how excited are you what's your what's your the intensity of your participation? And if you look at this going back in history on midterm elections, it really tells the story of each election For example, go back to 2006 2006 Democrats had 69 percent that had a nine or a ten percent ten rating They were 69 to 56 and that was a wave election for Democrats 2010 is the next one well you see that was the Tea Party You know wave election 66 to 49 for Republicans where they are favored in this high intensity scale go on to 2014 another big Republican win not quite as big as 2010 But again a nice lead for Republicans 59 to 48 you go over to 2018 and this is the story that has been told in the polls I think all the way leading up to this point which has been Democrats look poised for a pretty solid win where they would We would win the house and have a shot at the Senate though Structurally it's very difficult for them to take the Senate this time But it was going to be a Democratic situation that goes all the way up to the to September Kavanaugh happens and now look at it Democrats that go are more intense than they were at the beginning of the year nine by nine points But Republicans are more intense by 15 points. They've closed the gap from 10 to 4 and now if you look at all five of those elections you will see that 72 percent Democrats and 68 percent Republicans at high intensity are the highest of any party in all of those elections For the most for 72 is the highest history and in the entire history at least going back in the least recent history And then you know you see Democrats at 69 basically these are the two highest numbers you're gonna get out of all of this Which is really interesting because I think now the Kavanaugh thing among with some other details have really built up The people going to their own sides and saying you know what I really care about this Usually in midterms this helps Republicans because when the Republicans care they're more likely to vote their likely voters are more likely to go to the polls and And there's a little bit of a reverse in here where I said Trump was at 47 percent approval among Registered voters. He's only 45 percent among likely voters, which is it's usually the opposite I will say like it's kind of exciting if you're a poll nerd because like they don't really know what the hell's gonna happen here They think you know Republicans are gonna lose the house. They think Republicans are gonna hold the Senate But I think you know anything's on the table And you notice what I talked about the only one that has seen this because maybe it's skewed I've seen stories that are now Couching it from Left sources that are now couching this whole thing with you know It's really an uphill that always been an uphill battle for the Democrats to take the house. No, it wasn't. Yeah No, that's all I mean, it's just a couple weeks ago Nancy Pelosi said was it gonna be a blue waiver? Is it gonna be a tsunami? We don't know right now. It's this very true and that's an epinar you blew it Interesting you notice that because it's it really has been a change of messaging from them I mean they were they were out there saying they were gonna do this there and they had a really good chance of taking the Senate and all of a Sudden this is big uphill battle that tells you something and that's what it tells you is probably really good for Republicans Can I ask you one question? You know, we had Ben Sasson today on radio and Ben is not real popular right now He said some things that are making people really angry looking at that. I'm trying to figure out what Ben is saying based on what I see retweeted and the sentiment See if this makes sense with the poll numbers If Cavita would not have been supported by Donald Trump We would not be seeing these poll numbers The Democrat the Republicans would not Would not be on fire to go out and vote. Would you agree with that? Possibly I think there's also a chance that they didn't get a nominee through they may be very intense to get a nominee through I think this happened because I think we would have been demoralized But I think Donald Trump is seen like him or not is seen by a lot of people as somebody who at least is in the fight He's taking a stand and he's in the fight every day and they like that somebody is Standing up and fighting so with Ben Sass Ben Is a guy who is talking about like me is a guy who's talking about it written a book about it but he ain't in the fight every day and so you don't get that extra credit of Look man. I'm in the middle of battle. I'm gonna make some mistakes, but at least I'm in the battle. I think that's Partly true. I think you know with with the Kavanaugh issue and sass in particular like sass is look He's he he he gets publicity when he because he's one of the very few Republicans who will ever say one even Questioning word of Donald Trump so he gets a lot of publicity about that and people I think take him as this big time Trump Opponent we went over the numbers today. I mean he's voting with a guy 87 percent of the time He's not I mean, you know, he just he doesn't like his approach He's approach that still like you know, this is light criticism coming from an a real ally in Congress There's no reason for this. I do think I think the Trump thing is part of it I I tend to believe that the biggest part of these numbers strengthening for Republicans As it relates to Kavanaugh was how insane the Democrats went and I think Trump's part of that like I think Trump drives people to To up their level of of crazy The media I think it was guilty of that and I think the Democrats are too and they went so far so crazy so To points that were so indefensible that I think a lot of Republicans were like whoa we can't let this happen Right and I don't think it's separate from Occasio Cortez. Yeah, I mean I think you know All of the stuff go get them at the lunch counters go get them where they're eating all of that stuff helping plus Democratic socialists saying yeah capitalism isn't always gonna be here and Kavanaugh the world has gone insane and people are like I gotta get out and vote I think to the the caravan is part of this. I know you're going to the caravan here in a second Blessing for republicans is a gift to Donald Trump, but look at these polls. This is another interesting part of this 2006 again wave election. This is right after the Immigration comprehensive immigration thing fails with Bush They're at 62 percent Latino voter with high interest in the election And that's a big win for Democrats 2010 again a Republican one it goes drops down to 48 2014 another Republican win. They're down at 41 percent in 2018 up to this point 47% really middling and not all that exciting however the caravan going on the I mean 71 percent It's it's 71 percent of Latino voters now That's caravan. I think that's too early for caravan It might be too early for caravan although it is on the heels of the you know children in cages controversy That could also be Influencing that so I mean I think that that stuff is gonna be playing into it and so really they there's a lot of conflicting information They really don't know what's gonna happen right now. Well, I mean it's interesting too because you know when Donald well before Donald Trump got elected They thought that they knew that Hillary was going to win didn't they yeah I will say that they are much more sure on the polling now to say the Republicans are gonna lose the house and win the Senate Then they were with Trump. I mean Trump people say that like you know they had no idea it was coming I think give him a 30 percent chance I mean that's not nothing They did not see him as the favorite is the really easy way to talk about that I mean but like you know a good hitter has a 300 batting average It's about what they said he had a chance to I mean you know to win I mean they there were pretty some of them were not like that I mean some of them gave there's some of those projection models to give him almost no chance But I mean 538 which is the most you know talked about one was about 30 percent I mean here they're saying 18 percent 20 percent chance So I mean the polls don't look great But these numbers are kind of conflicting and you know the Kavanaugh thing was real whether it holds all the way to the election I don't know in the news cycle like this Well people even remember Brett Kavanaugh's name in a month after he was put in I don't even know anymore I think maybe two people confronting Mitch McConnell at a restaurant. You know those things happening. I think all just dog piles Good for Republicans. Yeah, good for Republicans. Yeah, exactly. All right Back in a minute.

Oh, yeah You've got nothing to lose but years off your face Go to try skin kick Really Okay, Jason so the Meyer caravan now says the last estimates were seventy five hundred strong It was five thousand this morning five that it started off it with three thousand or something like that And just for context the one that happened back in the spring was about 1500 I thought I thought Mexico was told stop this at your border or Guatemala or one of those countries they were every single country at every single border at the Honduran Guatemala and the Gu I'm just letting him through so well at at Mexico they actually had people come in and you know at federal police and stuff and they basically just kind of stood there and said no Stop no wait, you know make sure you check in with the you know immigration Personnel and they just kept marching through cuz it's five thousand people so at that point so how you gonna stop them? So they just kept on marching so now they're going so that they're they're continuing on Who started this so we've talked about this a little bit before Glenn But this was this is a Honduran political stunt So it originated from we actually I think you broke that on radio. We were the first ones to talk about this seriously We were the first ones talk about this. I think Heritage talked about it the day after that and then Fox News said they had this awesome source that told them that this was a Honduran political stunt But it's a Honduran political stunt from a political party that was ousted in the coup at about 2009 they're called the Liberty and Refoundation Party and Very very leftist they had ties really into Liberty Yeah, that's not just a catchphrase. It's not like the Patriot Act really isn't all that But yeah, they had ties to Maduro In Venezuela they had ties to Raoul Castro and Cuba. These are bad guys But so they've never gotten over being ousted in a coup So they're always doing these little political stunts and I think after the success of the first caravan that happened in the media You know firestorm that blew up then I think they're just copying that to put a focus on their own government So it started off that way now the question is what's like I want to show really quick a video This is a video that started circling around. I think there was a congressman that actually tweeted this out It's a video of a group of people of two men handing out cash So we've geo located this area. So this is back in Honduras. This is not in Guatemala This is not in Mexico. So this is geo located actually in Honduras I've no one has actually identified who these people are my guess is there probably party members that that would be my guess Some people said that they were just shop owners that wanted to like help out, but they kind of look like they're in They kind of look at their own uniforms I guess it's possible, but I think they're part of this group Shop owners in Honduras don't have the money to be handing out, you know cash like candy in Honduras Depends what you're selling. I guess right it depends It's also there's also a question is are they getting funds from somebody else? We're still looking at that here at the blaze. They could this party could be getting funds elsewhere But this could go a lot deeper than just even You can go actually go deeper than Soros. It could be this could be an attack by the Venezuela Maduro I know it could be a stunt from all these places look for Go back and look through all the pictures and I would ask the audience to do this too Look for a red rose on anything on this Red rose is the democratic socialists, especially down south in south america You'll see the the use of the red rose Anything that is promoting this scour the internet for anything that is sourced from Mexico Guatemala Venezuela anything that is involved with this see if there's a red rose attached to it that that could be a tip Off that it's democratic socialism. Well, there's there's definitely some funds that are being filtered here I want to show a picture really quick of There's a picture that a lot of people are seeing these long lines of people look at that I mean that thousands and thousands of people this looks like the migrant crisis in europe In the middle, how many women or children are forced to pretend that they're 20 something I don't I don't even yeah, it seemed no women and children in in that group But you can see they're they're proudly flying as they're walking through Mexico the Honduran flag So now see this is still a political stunt a Honduran political stunt because every time they do this they break out the flag I think that's very very important to this and something that we need to keep an eye on but also Change the flag when they get to the border to the american flag They have help somebody is advising them because That's what will set this up as a You know, you're not going to let a bunch of Hondurans and that you don't know anything about But if they are carrying the american flag through They're just poor migrant workers that have been oppressed and they want to be here It will it it adds a different dimension to it Oh, they're definitely getting funds and you know, you look at this picture and I'll describe it for the people just listening on the podcast No one's tired. So everyone's walking they're walking thousands like hundreds and thousands of miles No one's tired. So what do you think is happening? I think they're walking all the way across multiple nations and getting to the united states No, if I can show the next video that we just found this is a video where you see they're they're all in these little vests Someone is coordinating this they're jumping into a truck And they're getting bust around or they're getting trucked around to places But when the cameras are are are on and they want that the media spectacle They all jump out of these trucks and they march in a long line. Otherwise, they're going in trucks That's amazing. So someone is paying for these these trucks are not free those little vests, you know But these we these coordinators Something that we saw when we looked at the last uh, maggot caravan is there was a group from an umbrella organization called kara I'm gonna break out my phone really quick. So I got to the connourals. It was it was sorals Finance it was soros finance. So I want you when everyone's doing your own homework on this I want you to look for a few groups because these are notorious Soros fun and groups that are dealing with some of these caravans not necessarily this one, but they could pop up Um, but look for a group called kara. It's an umbrella organization But they also include a group called the catholic legal immigration network and the american immigration council These are two people that we talked about uh when you did your show when you out at all this before They're the ones that get checked straight from soros And they send they send on the ground coordinators to go and actually help them do stuff like that So what does this look like stew on the ground when are they supposed to arrive? I I don't know. I haven't seen any estimation estimate They're the very southern tip of mexico remember it's next Next week is the last full week before the election a weekend from this next on trucks. They could definitely make it Yeah, I mean if they make it, you know Friday saturday sunday not this weekend, but next that's right to the lead up of the uh election And I said this earlier as well, but it's really no longer purely right to say or two weeks away from the election I mean texas early voting started today I mean people mill you know more than half of the people who are going to vote in this election are going to vote in the next A couple weeks before that date actually comes up And uh, you know early voting is a big deal absentee voting is a big deal And that's what's interesting about this is that as this happens. I think I think this helps donald trump immensely at the very least until they get to the border Right like right now this this threat of thousands of people just rushing the border is helping trump I think it's helping republicans right now Um, we we're talking a little bit about this earlier. I gotta tell you I think Even at the border the images are going to be horrible. He's going to sit because we don't have a wall So he has to send troops. What are they going to do? Shoot them? Yeah, I'm not going to shoot them So it'll be tear gas and you know swat team kind of stuff It'll be rad and rubber bullets And it will look like you know 1968, you know, it won't be good And that will I think there's a large part of the country that will see that as like look I I might be able to be on the side of a dreamer right some kid who came here at four years old and now he's 16 And he's never lived anywhere else and he doesn't remember anything else other than america All right. Maybe I can understand that argument I can't understand having 7500 people rush our border and overwhelm our border troops That is not that's so foreign to the american experience That I think people will generally speaking look at that and want to shy away like they want to shy away from Antifa or push back against you know chaos in the streets, you know, the sure the charlotte's field situation On the other side of this if you get those images They're going to and you're going to get the press will get them and it will not be pretty and they will and the press will present this as Here's a bunch of people looking for asylum from a terrible place. They just want to come in They're all good people and look at look at look at how you can't there's no reasonable person I just don't believe there's a reasonable person that thinks the united states could let 7500 people just walk across our border That's insanity. That's insanity. Yeah, but the the global media has a playbook on this though They won't even cover they won't even talk about that aspect like I was just in israel We're gonna have a special on this coming out pretty soon But um, it's interesting because we didn't we didn't expect really to do kind of this expose And how the press was handling israel But it just kind of turned out that way because we could not believe what we were seeing And I was at the gazza border on the worst day. Um, right when the embassy was being opened up in jr And um They were that it's it was horrifying. There's cluster tear gas canisters going off. There were grenades going off Um israel had to call in jets to bomb certain areas because we need we need to be there when that happens I talked to that I talked to the one of the commanders on the ground in israel and he was just he was So frustrated he was like the media i'm trying to tell them what's going on, but they won't listen to me He goes they're lobbing grenades over the fence. They're setting ied's with plastic explosives on the fence You know they're they're trying to kill our soldiers. It wasn't that the balloons went to Is there kites and balloons? Yeah, the arson. Yes where they're burning it It's it's it's it is absolute chaos, but the media does not cover it They cover only the response and that's all you'll see from west from our media is our response to them Not what they do they could be shooting at us, but they won't cover it guaranteed. They won't cover it Um before we move on, can I just request that you send him and not me Usually the way it works Pretty much All right, so this is really heartbreaking story moose are dying. Oh my gosh. This is a terrible story You say this like you're like you're being sarcastic. I am not this is this is the death of 70 mise moose's 70 dead well it's very scary global warming is affecting moose populations as you know global warming is at fault for You know extinction of various species And and the moose you agree that moose were one of those species absolutely right How many how many there used to be there's only 50 of them left and then only 50 of them But now I'm sure and main there was only 50 moose right and how many have died since then I mean How many died probably hundreds of I don't know I don't know exactly 70 or dead today. Well, this is the interesting part is we went from 50 and I don't mean my negative 20 Somebody's printing a niece There were 50 and not again 50,000 but four dozen plus two 50 moose in new hamster and main in I believe it was 1970 Now from 1970 today as you know we've seen Out of control global warming and you know what happened to these 50 moose they turned into the 75,000 moose Somehow Throughout all of this credible warming they were managed to thrive as a species and really come back And you know there's other changes as well, you know Do with hunting and all these other restrictions But bottom line is through this warming period is supposed to make all these species go extinct They went from 50 to 75,000 those 50 because I don't know the you know population between male and female They were busy Ladies Like the stormy Daniels So And so 50 to 75,000 you're in a good spot like that's a success story, right? Like you should be like this is incredible. We went from 50 to 75,000 Why are you burying the police? Well, the story now is that global warming is to blame for this incredible Explosion of moose population which has include which has created an incredible explosion of ticks Because ticks what they're doing is they're finding these moose and they have up to 100,000 ticks on them at the same time Which is super creepy blood suckers just like him just like me just like him and other capitalist blood suckers So now global warming was to blame for them not having any moose Then there's there the global warming is to blame for having too many moose Now the global warming is to blame for having too many ticks and those ticks are now threatening the moose again to bring it back down to the early levels They have already killed 70 mees Yeah Are dead now they say that there has been a reduction from the heights of 75,000 by a couple thousand and they think it's related to these ticks And I thought that was fascinating because like they're blaming global warming for literally every single part of the story every outcome good bad Explosion destruction everything is global warming. How do you lose with this argument? I mean, it's it is incredibly flexible argument The other thing I thought was kind of interesting is it's it reminded me very much of how people talk about the life issue Which is like Here, you know, we always they always say well, yes, there's been these you know 60 million abortions But how many of those people who were aborted would be unhappy now? Who would be living a low quality of life now? Who would we would not be able to live the life of their dreams? And it's like the argument though is you should it's better to be alive and have that opportunity Right and here's the meese who were out there They went from 15 to 75,000 and now a couple of thousand may have died from too many ticks Which by the way is an explosion of another species Like this is like the ticks aren't thinking this is bad And of course if the ticks kill all the map meese then they'll all die too because that's how they live they live off the meese So it is like it's it's an incredibly fun. Thank you. I know that Just wanted to correct you and we go back to that picture And i'm sorry if you're listening to this but I just want to point out something else a global warming is responsible for apparently Meese Male pattern baldness. Yes You look at that picture at that. Oh wow that moose. Yeah. Yeah, he's losing his hair on top of his head He looks like me with some horns All right now is the time of the show where you get the opportunity to submit like super private personal questions The guys And also glen back. He loves when you get ultra personal Uh, but use the hashtag the blaze y and send us your comments or your questions You know, I challenge you. I think I could make you more uncomfortable with my answers than you could with the questions asking you Give us all you got hashtag at the blaze y that's wh y for the podcast listeners Worship leader calib just wanted to let stew but you know that he will be calling uh A rork bob franco rork from now on bob frank. Yes He thinks you for a yeah, we would discover this on For I think it was friday's show when glen was out pat and I were fulfilling in and we realized that because betto said everybody who's named Robert what was robert robert um bertow Albert and albert All always named betto of course everybody everybody knows that they're called right We did later find out that there was almost no white people who were called his all hispanics Under the circumstances often are and then we got to the point where we're like well robert frances a rook should be just bob franco rork Right, that's actually so bob frank. I think it's an okay way if you put bob frank on the signs I might vote for him just because it would least he'd be being honest, but no I would not vote for well But and to add to that really quickly before we get to the poll there's the audio of Someone introducing yeah bob right when he was in the band pretty interesting He was when he was in the band he was on a show and they were trying to alert him that the show was like We're running out of time need to get the song going because it was a terrible intro They kept playing and you can hear the host of the show going bob bob bob We're gonna run on a show if you don't get started here. He's calling him bob because you know, it's his name It's not betto it's bob All right and today's poll uh so the trump administration has just unveiled this proposal to use the scientific definition of gender In all of the federal programs things of that nature not science. I know can you believe it? Bigots all of them a lot of them. Um and so again if there's any dispute Uh, it will be clarified by genetic testing. It's actually really strict So they're rolling back the previous obama administration. So wait a minute. Hold on just a second. So Who's the science denier now? Uh, yeah Well, that will say it's trump right? Is not recognizing the new realities that we've discovered that people gender is just a social construct Also global warming is responsible for everything. Yes. Yeah, obviously Uh, so the poll question is do you support the trump administration's plans to use the scientific definition of gender when it comes to federal programs Can we get the the the next day? Can we get the answer because i'm most like i wonder what the one i know? Yes, I will make sure to get the answer for you. Thank you All right, that's it for us.
