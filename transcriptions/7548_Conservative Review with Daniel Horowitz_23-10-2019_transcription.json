    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots to the conservative review podcast on this fine fall Wednesday here at our northern command center and we are back after a brief hiatus and I'm sorry I've been out a lot of Tuesdays next Tuesday I do have a speaking engagement but we'll try to get in a show that day certainly whenever we're out so much work piles up because there are so many stories ideas policies that are in play for the future of our civilization where there really is no leadership on the right there is no vision as to where we should head whenever I come back I try to do triage all right what needs to be dealt with first and you know often here we cover national security crime illegal migration border security and I'll often say how nothing could systemically destroy a society a civilization more than having an open border where you basically merge all of the social ills all of the poverty all the crime the drugs the gangs from the world and you bring it here and what happened was I was I was talking my colleague Chris Pandelfo and I said hey you know what really needs attention and he said Daniel if we don't stop this rainbow jihad that's what it is this alphabet soup sexual alphabet alphabet soup licentious insanity of castrating and mutilating children or adults but especially with children there's no civilization to fight for and I thought that was a terrific point see even borders and illegal migration and crime it doesn't matter because what sort of civilization are we trying to preserve or from which we are trying to protect against you know external threats if the problems within if the problem is us if the problem is that we now have a society where they will go to a hospital or a doctor and cut someone's balls off and yes today we are not going to mince words because we are so inundated with information and often when you don't use the proper terminology and you use the euphemisms people become desensitized to what's going on where we could literally have a movement that a masochist self-immelating movement that seeks to cut people's genitalia off and they use some sort of malefluous sounding name to sanitize it and those on the so called right just sit back as if nothing happened so obviously by now most of you who are up to date know I'm talking about the Jack Youngner tragedy going on in Texas and that's really a big part of this the fact that this is going on in in red states like Texas states like Texas and even to the extent there's talk of you know Texas turning blue a component of that is the Hispanic population but they're not for this nonsense they don't support this nonsense almost nobody supports it so obviously while I was out you had this case with um Jeff Young Youngner locked in this custody fight with Ann Gurgolas this wacko ex-wife of his who wants to take their seven-year-old boy one of two sons of twins and wants to castrate the kid chemical castration I don't know if it's eventual physical castration and a jury sided with her and basically gave her complete custody and said the guy the father James Youngner or Jeffrey Youngner can't have anything to do with James and cannot treat him like a boy cannot have him around anyone who will treat him like a boy now a lot of people are focusing on the custody aspect the court aspect the judge is supposed to issue some final ruling in a couple hours so we'll have to wait for tomorrow with that but there's something much more fundamental going on here something much more fundamental and I don't know why I'm the only one bringing it up this directly but why is it even legal for any medical practitioner to castrate someone so I mean you could talk about tragic cases with battles for custody in the courts where one parent is abusive and wants to do something to a child that's really very abusive so for example let's say to cross dress the child and just all in all just mentally ill treat the kid like a girl in this case because he's a boy but we're not we're not taught we're not even talking about that here we're talking about going to the step of castrating the kid so that requires some sort of medical intervention some sort of interaction with a health care practitioner a hospital a doctor how is that even legal if I and forget about even kids forget about custody a consenting adult if I go up to could I go up to a doctor and say I want you to chop my arm off I want you to chop my leg off I mean I think we should all agree well that's you can't do that and indeed the doctor won't do that yet there is not a single state where it's illegal not in Texas none Idaho not in Wyoming no red state as we always say on this show there is no such thing as a red state you look at a blue state and you'll understand what it means to be blue you don't have that mirror image in red states and we're gonna talk about that specifically through the context of the rainbow ji hot and the so-called castration transgender agenda but in this case if if you castrate so on that is a hundred times more systemically damaging to a person than chopping off an extremity or example of an arm or a leg I mean it's practically the worst thing you could do to so on after killing them and again I'm talking about forget about the confusion of what a kid certainly a kid can't understand what they're talking about in this case the father alleges that it's not even the kid if you take his side of the story which I'm certainly more inclined to do because the mother has already demonstrated she is mentally ill and it's just a very sick demented person who should be locked up but according to the father it's all coming from the mother and the kid is totally normal around him and she's the one in planting this in his mind and actually engaging in psychological abuse to it to demand of him that he acts like a girl but that's that I'm not even talking about that what I'm saying is the antecedent to this entire problem the antecedent here is the fact that somehow it's even legal why is governor Greg Abbott and lieutenant governor Dan Patrick who controls the legislature right in the southern states lieutenant governor is pretty much run the state legislature why are they not calling the Texas legislature into a special session and criminalizing castration I mean unless there's cancer or gangrene in a in an extremity or an genitalia um you can't do that it's a violation of the Hippocratic oath we shouldn't have to do this but at this stage in life we need to do this republicans control the trifecta of government and the governorship and both houses of the legislature in 22 states where's the action I'm going to tell you something it's an observation I haven't heard anywhere else but to me it demonstrates not just the insanity of our country which again I don't think it's anywhere near a majority of people it's it's a very small percentage of demented people but all it takes for evil to persist and succeed is for good people to do nothing and because good people only have their political outlet through the prism of the phony broken perfitus republican party well guess what that's exactly what we have good people doing nothing in the state of Texas I mean could you imagine in California and this is certainly not the equivalent on the right wing end but if you had a parent who borrowed a kid from acting like a homosexual oh terrible terrible could you imagine California and taking place in California can you imagine California democrats just like ignoring it now I've been out so correct me if I'm wrong but I don't see any major fight from any of the statewide Texas elected representatives I have not seen it on their social media maybe one of them has commented one time correct me from wrong where are they this is the bigger story I mean if you would have told me 10 15 years ago we'd be having this in this country I think you're crazy but I would have thought if this would be happening the entire right would be inflamed but really it's the same people it's the matte wall she is it's the daily wire it's you know my colleagues here in our network handful of others chip Roy obviously spoke out about it the usual good guys but this somehow is not galvanizing now there is a whole you know conservatives really get traction on twitter but this hashtag protect protect James Youngner protect James Youngner I think that's uh it demonstrates I think the people are horrified by this but we have no political leadership we should have a legislative session to straight up criminalize this but anyway I stepped on my point to make this juxtaposition to blue states did you know that in almost that in I believe 18 blue states like the west coast the northeast maybe even new Mexico and the district of Columbia almost half the states pretty much wherever the democrats have full control they have criminalized what is called gay conversion therapy which is nothing more than you know two adults consensually agreeing to have a contract to you know engage in therapy the guy is not touching him must much less immutably mutilating and disfiguring the person yet they are saying no the homosexual gender is sacred it's from god someone is quote gay and that's somehow immutable and no you can't do that yet not a single red state criminalizes chopping someone's balls off so when you put the two together what that means is that our political elites in both parties are essentially saying that it is more natural for a man to be a woman than for a man to be a man right a man could say I want to be a woman and that's natural a doctor could just scapble you know cut gone that's that's okay but for a man to be a regular man with normal proclivities no that we're going to we're going to criminalize any effort to just engage in therapy to to work on that person see when you punch this movement in the face you'll notice it's support is a mile wide and an inch deep what is happening is it's not that the world went crazy in a matter of 10 years i'm a strong believer that technology and social media did a lot of this that you had this existing radical group of people and what social media did is it and especially with i think the substantial evidence that social media with the algorithms and all the silicon valley companies are tilting the playing field towards one side what it has done is it's magnified and it's spread the cancer everywhere that people think everyone thinks this way because they're just so incessant they're so indefatigable they're everywhere everyone's like it's not that most people agree with it there's a silent majority that opposes it we spoke about this last week when governor matt bevins allies ran the ad against the transgender jiad and girls sports and his numbers went up by eight points there's no question the silent majority opposes this but it's kind of like in an authoritarian society where you know at any given point there's let's say an old soviet russia kgb agents and everyone's scared no one wants to speak out because they don't know when someone's gonna jump out at them that's what it's like but if you just punch it right in the face you'll have a jailbreak and um people will start speaking out i think we saw that in the chick fillet moment a number of years ago and i i think that still persists i think we all understand that the one-sided fight cultural warriors on the left without any response on the right for the last decade has taken its toll on society and i think i would readily admit that probably the median cultural value in this country is to the left of where the audience on the show is but they sure as heck are not holding by cash duration but this is what republicans did they lie to us and they they tried to convince um republican voters that like hey everyone supports this stuff and there's nothing you can do about it so let's just ease off of it and let the left do whatever they want but what we're seeing in this case is you can't let them do that i mean i thought i've seen everything in life but for them to grab a seven-year-old kid and just castrate the kid you need an emergency session i mean remember when we had terry shivo and they're gonna take her off of life's life support which is not nearly as insane philosophically not that i agree with it but as insane as what's going on here and it was all hands on deck a legislative session in in washington in congress the senate should convene and strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate any of these cases of state laws doing this and states need to need to combat this where are they we don't have a conservative majority in a single state government that is the brutal brutal reality i'm sorry to bring this guy the this uh dose of truth to you am i missing something i mean where is the impetus to act i'm just not seeing it but i'm not seeing it now um obviously in this case it's more tragic than even the kid being you know suffering suffering from gender dysphoria it's not even clear he does um but i mean i think those of you have kids this is very scary because look i got three boys i have a seven-year-old boy seven-year-old a nine-year-old in a four-year-old and um i mean you know kids are quirky kids are weird to a certain extent that's normal and they're forever playing imagination and dress up and acting out um the seven-year-old is always it's really annoying he puts on his bunny voice and he says i'm a bunny and um sorry starts doing so i mean what are we gonna start you know and sometimes they slither on the floor and do their little things so we're gonna chop off their legs if they say i'm a bunny so especially if you have a culture that's now specifically pushing this stuff and and if you have a parent that's actually gonna push it you know it doesn't take much to get a kid into that to start you know playing the opposite gender stuff you know it's no different than playing uh animal you know personification of an animal or uh or acting animalistic as a human and that's really very normal behavior before you even get to mental illness so in this case um uh you know according to matt wall she has a good article here at the daily wire the texan reported that um at least the father saying that this mother said that the son is is really a woman based on his affinity for the movie frozen and is request to get a girl toy from mcdonald's she also says he started expressing a wish to dress in girls clothing but jeff younger recently explained an interview that if james ever had any desire to wear dresses it's only because his mother started putting him in dresses and painting his nails when he was just three years old he claims that she used several other methods of manipulation including locking the boy in his room and telling him that the monsters only eat boys jeff speculates that um gurgulous would withhold affection from james if he did not act like a girl and um but again we need not get involved in a messy custody battle and the courts there's a very simple solution you wall this off you make it illegal to engage in that so you could do whatever you want and you know so even if a court decides you know it makes a terrible decision to give a kid over to a mentally ill i don't even say mentally ill just an evil demented woman like this at the very least it should be illegal to actually go and chemically and physically castrate and mutilate so on i challenge anyone to tell me how cutting off someone's penis is better somehow less problematic than offering to cut off someone's leg or arm because it's not i mean this this is much worse it's much more systemically damaging not to mention the follow-up hormonal mutilations and everything they inject into the body they don't live long the suicide is insane um but what you're seeing in this case is it doesn't even take much it's not like you have a kid that's totally suffers from gender dysphoria completely mentally ill with that this is just it's not even clear there's there's anything out of the here based on what we know so it's not like republicans have anything better to do anyway what are they doing today they're they're uh they're trying to concoct a resolution opposing trumps pull out from syria so the funny thing is it's likely unconstitutional have troops there because congress never authorized it and they're not upset with the you know the president and previous president deploying troops without congressional authorization they're upset that he's pulling them out without authorization and as we mentioned on our show on monday blockbuster show if you haven't seen it with uh retired captain jason jones from texas dps is uh intel encounter terrorism division we have a failed state to our south it's much more important than syria and none of these guys care about that what else are they doing they're passing three budget bills appropriation bills busting the budget caps i mean they already decided that last year but it's not like you know just because you passed a bill saying you can spend more money which is what they did in september they busted the budget caps it doesn't mean you have to then go and appropriate the funding for it but that's what they're doing this week so um um oh thankfully finally after years of sanctuary cities lindsey grams senate judiciary committee did hold a hearing on sanctuary cities but there's no impetus to do anything with it and make democrats take tough votes um on those issues which as always you know we'll we'll catch up on that later in the week or next week lots more sanctuary legal immigration news but again you know to quote my colleague chris it's hard to get hyped up about any other news story when this is going on i don't know why this doesn't trigger a terry shivo moment times 10 i mean i remember back in you know when when i started my career in this even establishment republicans would have been triggered by this and now even so-called conservative ones are are barely anywhere to be seen we have the most extreme policies taking place in red states when democrats get in power they control state boom anything they want to do on a legal immigration on crime on gender bending on lgq fu you know abcd fng whatever they want to do they enact they enact swiftly they enact categorically without any compromise but yet when republicans control all three branches in texas they're just sitting there damn patrick is too busy concerned with gun control so the same way you have jailbreak and criminal justice deform in the state of texas you have castration force castration against the kid going on but but but again it's not just a kid you know one of the writers um and i'm not criticizing him i forget his name but he just responded to my article on twitter one of the daily wire writers said you know because i was saying it's time for states to uh to uh criminalize this and ban it and he just subtsuates me at least for kids well i wonder what i mean at least for kids i mean that's a separate issue but for anyone you know if i say go chop off my arm you can't you can't legally go and do that go kill me you can't you can't do that it's not it's nothing to do with adult consent there are certain things you just can't do as a society i mean think about this think about this we regulate every aspect of health care in america as you well know what they could do what they can't do i mean it's insane the regulations think about this end of life treatments there's so many people with terminal illnesses who have no no recourse um you know no at least non-miraculous recourse without the grace of god god wants to just perform a miracle for them but you know basically from what we see the guys you know three the six weeks to live you know it's gotten a little easier over the years but still there are so many experimental um treatments and and and medications that they're trying to break out into the market there's so many regulations it's so hard even i mean there's been cases really terminally ill people that cannot get these treatments that that's how much we regulate you know the safety of health care in this country sometimes too much but yet in all 50 states someone could just come to the doctor and say hey i want my balls cut off or a female saying i want you know my genitalia cut off and they'll do it and in many states they're required to do it and they have to get like a religious liberty exemption and some states you can't even get that but as i tell you this has nothing to do with religion i was telling my colleague he put the term social conservative in his article and i said look this is not just about social conservatism you need not be a social conservative to believe there's something wrong with conson's balls off i mean we we move beyond that we're no what we're fighting for today is not even social conservatism with religious liberty that's property rights and conscience rights there's nothing to do with religion you can't force me to service your garbage and um with castration i mean that's the Hippocratic oath there's nothing to do with anything let's not limit this to some all uh social oh and we need religious liberty we need to protect the religious community from from castration well don't we need to protect everyone from that i mean that's what i'm saying if people want to live in sin so that's that's one level we're not we're not talking about that there's there's you know immoral sexual proclivities and activities is what it is we're not the ones blocking that you could do whatever you want in this country it's the other side that is taking their pagan religion which evidently is stronger than any other real religion and and and and shoving their stuff on society i was hoping this case would be a watershed moment the younger case i don't know if it will be we need leaders that's the problem where are they has Ted Cruz said it's anything i mean maybe he did again i was out yesterday so i can't confirm he didn't but i certainly can't find on anything on the governor's uh twitter greg abbot or lieutenant governor dan patrick what about the attorney general again you might you might think all this is some sort of private court battle for custody that that's beside the point here that you have crazy jurors crazy judges that's all another story liberal judges in the state of texas these are local judges you would think you know over the years of republican governance the type of people who would be on the bench would be good they're not but that's besides the point republicans control the state legislature and the governor's mansion there is no reason why this act shouldn't be criminalized so even if the mother wore to get custody and unfortunately continue in this terrible terrible psychological um abuse of this kid at least you don't have a mutable masochism going on man that's where we are with this and just before moving on i just want to close the loop on this discussion of conservatives lacking any leadership vehicle any frontline generals in this civilization clash um and this is a clash again it's a clash like like no other you cannot recover from this there's no there's no where you can go from this this is it this is the de-civilization agenda as we speak about so often here um in its most radical form so where are these leadership you know social conservative groups so called conservative representatives you know it's funny it's not just that they're mia i'd rather they be mia instead they say a biblical godly agenda is the sorrows agenda so i mean look you guys remember me talking about this the family research council tony perkins they support criminal justice reform they supported the first step act so we have that i mean this requires all hands on deck we have the rainbow jiad the sexual licensees alphabet soup agenda all over the place and they're like hey you know i don't think sorrows has enough money backing and prestige in pushing open borders and bosom refugees pro-criminal laws let's go and help him and say that that's the christian thing to do that's the biblical thing to do that's what god wants that that's what jesus wants i mean this is what's happening so meanwhile we talked about this couple weeks ago when we had a number of republican senators complaining that trump wasn't bringing in enough refugees from the middle east well guess what a group of 18 house members sent a letter led by this guy congressman who is anger in michigan saying the same thing and i was floored ken buck congressman ken buck from colorado i've had kind of a funny relationship with him last number of years i called him out when he sabotaged the rebellion against john bainer for speaker a couple years ago we kind of made up and work together on some important issues i thought he was doing good on immigration then he screwed us on a whole bunch of issues since then so now he wants more refugees when we have an a one million person backlog in immigration court with all these bogus asylies and all these other categories we spoke about i mean who needs these people they've replaced fighting for our civilization with destroying our civilization and promoting the sorrows agenda i mean the these are the same people we we have sorrows pumping in millions of dollars to promote refugee resettlement to promote um jailbreak abolish prison abolish ice policies why do we need republican congressman and phony social conservative groups to lend their name and their prestige and often money to this just go home and i want to tie into the next um next issue here but it's it's really connected it's connected of how we are losing the fight for civilization what else happened yesterday some of some of you guys have sent this to me the ninth circuit ruled two to one against the little sisters of the poor the religious exemption for the hhs hhs mandate meaning that they cover abortifacients and any um employer-based uh medical insurance plan now many of you might be wondering well didn't we win a court case on that quite a while ago the famous hobby lobby case eight years ago that government it's unconstitutional for government to mandate that an individual business must you know violate their conscience and provide this and in this case the trump administration is siding with them they they don't want to do it the courts are mandating you must do it so you have a federal court telling the stronger executive branch of the federal government you must infringe upon someone's private property conscience and religious liberty rights what's so important about this well number one we're still losing the civilization battle but this gets back to our thesis on the courts guess what once you agree that a court could is supreme so if the trump administration says it's unconstitutional and i'm not going to promulgate a regulation mandating uh you know contraception coverage on private business owners and religious institutions and if and if federal court says no you must do that the notion once you agree that the courts are supreme you're done well daniel wall appeal to the supreme court we did and we already won and comes in the lower courts and says hey hold my dr pepper hey you know that's what i'm telling you lower courts do what they want as if they believe the supreme court wasn't liberal enough now the minute the supreme court issues a radical liberal opinion then oh that that's like god's word from day one this is just yet another example i mean another example we saw yesterday um my home city baudamor so it it's um full of drugs gangs crime no one wants to live here businesses are moving out and they're like we have a genius idea we're gonna go and sue big corporations for being responsible for the pink unicorn of global warming oh i mean i forgot climate change um or whatever they call it these days now the notion that you could take a political issue in the abstract to court and sue a private company for it is insane now you would so the businesses appeal to the supreme court they're like look we don't have time we know this is frivolous we know it cannot succeed and when i'm going to spend millions of dollars on it you got to shut this down they denied it now there was no recording of um a dissent so often there is but not always so it doesn't mean that thomas and elitos necessarily went along with it although elitos because of his um personal stocks and just financial holdings did um recuse himself from it but i'm just telling you what we definitely know is that we didn't have five votes to stop it that that much we know and this is part of our broader thesis that we know is true that we do not have anywhere near a supreme court majority that will categorically shut down this nonsense and even if they did if we continue agreeing that a lower court rules over the other branches of government on political issues it doesn't matter they they come back for more i mean hobby lobby is one of the few categorical cases we want at the supreme court the last number of decades and it's it's meaningless i mean courts all over the country are you know mandating that trump continue the constitution contraception regulation so you know that was there but this goes on and on on and on the notion that a court could just veto stuff is is just insane it's utterly insane it's one other thing i wanted to run by you just on the courts here is very interesting in the fifth circuit court they dealt with something called the severability doctrine and i'm glad to see judges hoe and oldum rule the right way on this um judge hoe is it was the boss of um josh hammer my friend we had on the show uh two weeks ago to discuss judicial supremacism but um i'm glad they finally make the case i've been making for so long so what's the severability doctrine so what happens what's been happening in the courts for quite some time is that the courts go and say we're nullifying some sort of policy or law of a state or federal government it's unconstitutional in our mind it's unconstitutional and often it it's totally fine but you know that that that's how that's how they are and then they ask this question well what do we do with the other parts of the statute do we sever it out or do we say the whole law is struck down and for years we're saying that entire concept of saying that once a part of a law is struck down the whole law is struck down is fundamentally violates the power of the judicial branch of government because they don't strike down the first part much less the whole law they don't strike down anything there's no such thing as a judicial veto what they do is they render an opinion in a case and say hey you plaintiff you don't have to deal with that but they don't you know they don't rip out rip out the statue and go you know rip it up that's not how it works they just say hey i i don't think that's constitutional so look we have no control over what the other branches do are doing but i'm not going to criminally convict you or issue a civil fine because i think i don't like that law but you don't say oh that renders the law struck down therefore let's question everything else that was coupled with that statute no so i'm glad to this was a case i'm not going to get into the details not so important um but this was a case Collins v minuchin and you know it's actually this something conservatives wanted to strike down the whole federal housing finance agency where it's one of these like fourth branch of governments where the guy is you know an independent single director who could only be removed by cause and i agree i agree with the courtier it's unconstitutional i totally agree but nonetheless that is something the political branches have to deal with the answer to that is trump needs to say i'm firing him on all these independent agency heads i'm gonna fire them because they they're under my control and that's it it's not because you need a court to veto the law for him because courts don't have that power so um what they did is they they said like pretty much everything in there is struck down so judge old ham and hoe said no i mean there's no such thing as striking down and um they noted and and i'm just going to read to you here in the final constitution the judiciary was given only the power to decide cases and controversies to resolve legal disputes between parties and order remedies to address injuries thus when a court concludes that a statute is unconstitutional it is not striking down or avoiding or invalidating the law it is merely holding that the law may not be applied to the parties in the dispute the constitution does not empower courts to delete sections of state and federal codes the founders expressly considered the possibility of a judicial veto and they rejected it multiple times during the constitutional convention they're referencing this council revision and as i've noted on this program several times even when they entertained and then rejected this idea of a judicial veto it was only coupled with the presidential veto it was instead of it and it was when the legislature was so much more powerful once the legislature was less powerful it was bicameral it didn't have power to veto state laws as it originally did under the first design and then you had the separate check on the legislature of an independent presidential veto there was no way they would have ever conceived a separate independent judicial veto independent of any elected representation so i'm glad at least there's some judges that finally get that and it's certainly not surprising it's a guy like judge hoe thank you for doing that anyway we're about at a time today i hope today's show was informative as always um we will discuss the issues that matter to you not the soap opera not the nonsense send me your tips at dharrowitz at blaze video.com i certainly learn a lot from you a lot of you guys are keeping me up to date on some of these crazy criminal cases illegal alien cases in your neighborhoods and your cities and states that i would otherwise miss and um i've taken a lot of your cases to ice and i've asked them hey is this guy in the legal and uh i've gotten information on that so keep doing it to me i can't promise i'm going to always have time to deal with every case but too much information is never a problem we should embrace information because information and knowledge is power we need to empower the people we need to empower all of us to fight back against this decivilization evil castration agenda that's what it is that's what we need to call it and once you identify it then we know what to fight against because prat you know let's face it you can't fight something that you can't identify let's strip the pcs language the euphemisms i hate when our side uses the term lgb whatever no don't use their terms as if it's some sort of legitimate legal social codification no it is the most illegitimate evil criminal act and it needs to be treated as such so tomorrow god bless you all and thank you for listening"
