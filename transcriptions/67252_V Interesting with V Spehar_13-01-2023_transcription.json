Hey friends, today we have a super special show and an incredible guest who I am so excited to bring to your attention. Tony Michelle has served as a policy member of the Atlanta Mayor's 2019 Task Force to reimagine and repurpose the Atlanta City Detention Center. And also, the Atlanta Police Use of Force Task Force in 2020, which was created after the murder of Ray Shard Brooks. Today, she's here to talk to us about how she's helping to make communities more safe and joyful. I'm so excited you're here, Miss Tony Michelle. Thank you for having me. I'm so excited to meet you and talk with you today. I'm excited to have you. I've been looking forward to this all week, honestly. So when did you first recognize a need for the type of work that you do in your community? As a young person from Atlanta, you know, I experienced a lot of hardships growing up in my family. My mom was a single mom who experienced domestic violence and things. And, you know, it was literally people in my school, the community around me, my friends and their parents and moms who were also single moms supporting us. And so I knew that there were other people like me and my friends also had similar experiences. When I went off to college, you know, I experienced some violence on campus, you know, being a trans woman and being placed in male dormitories at historically black colleges and universities. I had to learn how to advocate for myself, not like create a wall and go into a shell, but to like speak up and act out so that people could hear me and see me. And so I started working in my senior year of college in 2012, started working at a nonprofit that's now called the LGBTQ Life Center of Hampton Roads in Norfolk, Virginia. And I was running and supporting a T-Girls Empowerment Group. And I learned so much about trans women's experiences outside of mine. And, you know, the things that they were facing and the communities that they were building. And so I committed myself to that community and to that journey to support all my girls and all my family. So you just said, you know, when you went to historically black college and university and they misplaced you in the men's dormitory, and that was like, that's one thing that has happened. That's a struggle that trans women have to overcome so often. What are some other things that folks might not think of that are, you know, injustices that trans women have to face just for existing? Absolutely. I think one thing is isolation. We oftentimes forget about people being pushed out of families and out of institutions that they pour so much of their time and their skill, right, and their vision into. We've heard about the violence that black trans women's face across the country and across the world. I also, you know, don't want to forget about the experiences of young trans girls who are oftentimes forgot about and pushed to take care of themselves and also take care of their families and the kinds of work that they have to get into in order to survive like survival sex work, like panhandling or idlingo solicitation, the things that are criminalized by, you know, cities and counties across our states. And so just the attacks that have been on trans youth, we don't talk about like what it is outside of, like what their experiences are outside of sports, right, for the girls and the young trans girls who love to do makeup in here, but still experience this kind of push out and isolation from cis women and other cis young girls and those communities. I mean, there are just so many things, right, that we experience. But I think the most important thing is to acknowledge that we also hold an embody and experience so much joy and resilience. And that I think has really transformed this kind of like a movement that trans folks and renaissance that black and trans folks have been experiencing over the last four to five years in media and also in advocacy and policy. What are some of your biggest accomplishments of the last couple of years? Oh my goodness. We got a brag on you for a little bit. I get all sweaty and clammy talking about myself. So a few accomplishments. Okay. So I'll start like 2019. Okay, because it's actually been some amazing moments that have happened and also some very hard moments, but I've survived them and excited to be talking to you in the end of this season about it. But I started like 2019. So I did not finish college. Back in 2013, I had studied abroad in the Czech Republic and I got back and I was like, why am I in America? You had, you know, wait, it was better in the Czech Republic. It was safer. I'm like very stunned by this. You know, it's not that it was safer because I was like a triple minority, right? I was like, black, trans, non-binary, a woman. American, all of the things. So it was really, really hard, but it grew a different layer of skin, right? And I found, I didn't have like my family and friends who had this idea of who I was or who I should be. I just had a place to start over and that kind of like starting over that kind of like internal transformation supports, I think, and regenerates safety in so many ways, you know? But yeah, so I did that and I got back to the States and I was like, oh, I am right here. And I really kind of like fell into a deep depression and I didn't finish my last semester of college, but I went back in 2019 and I pulled up by drawers, honey, and I went back to Virginia and I finished school. I was with a whole bunch of young people and it was very liberating. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about young people in 2022 or at the time of 2019, but went back and made new friends and now homecomings are litty. I know everybody from my day today, I'm just like, yes. And so I've like built a new community. So I'm really, really proud of that. And I love that. I can tell you, I am in shock right now. Okay. And you are because you're such a vibrant and lovely person. And then you say things like, I went to the Czech Republic for college, which is a hard choice for just anybody in general. And you're like, nope, did it. And then to go back to Virginia, which is not necessarily one of the most progressive states to finish your degree, are you a person who isn't afraid to pick the hardest path? Like, is that what busting up these boulders is is picking this hard path? You know, I don't necessarily think it's about picking the path. I think it's just about being present enough to know where you belong and to trust where you are. I, you know, me picking Virginia, picking Norfolk State was really about me wanting to get away from, you know, hard family dynamics and me wanting to have again more space. And so I think for me, I do lean into, and I also am in Aries. So I love a good challenge, but I lean into what's possible for me. And I also lean into and think about what's at stake. And so if I can take an opportunity, and I can just think about the possibilities and, you know, the only thing that says stake is just time, baby, I'm going to take more time somewhere. Yes. So I love to travel, and I love to have new experiences. And I think that when I choose the experience, or I choose the people to like support and invest in my leadership, all of the different opportunities come to me. That's been my, my tea. That is very inspirational to me because I am a notorious coward. I'm afraid of literally everything. And so when I'm looking at stuff, this is why we're friends now, because when I'm looking at stuff, I'm like, Oh my God, I'm so afraid. And that fear can be paralyzing. And you're looking at stuff and going, I see this as an opportunity. And so I want to ask you, when you started Snapco, what was going through your mind at that point? Because that's another thing that just feels so insurmountable. So so difficult. Yeah. So second big accomplishment was becoming the executive director of the Solutions Snap punishment collaborative in 2020. I actually, I did not create Snapco. So Snapco actually was created back in 2013. We are coming up on our 10 year anniversary, woo, woo. Wow. And at that time, the city of Atlanta was trying to pass legislation on ornaments that would banish people charged with prostitution. Okay. And that was primarily Black trans women in the mid, I don't know if you've ever been to Atlanta, have you ever been to Atlanta and been to Midtown? No, ma'am. Oh, okay. Well, we got to get you down to the A shot. But it was started in response to that attempt from the city to pass this ordinance. And there were people from the racial justice actions center, social bavera, who's a founder of Snapco, Ms. D.D. Shambelie, Black trans woman who has really been incredible and trans advocacy over the last 20 years. And then a few other folks, but they created Snapco. And I was hired as first generation staff in 2015. And I really was hired along with my partner and justice and my brother, Dean Steed. We were charged with leading a campaign called the Pre-Arresta version initiative, bringing more like policing alternatives to the city. And then also charged to build some like leadership development opportunities for Black trans and queer folks across the city. So I spent my first five years at Snapco building those programs. And social bavera, the director of the racial justice action center, wanted to retire. There were things about, you know, what she had created, you know, pouring into trans leadership, also pouring into like the leadership of Black incarcerated women, of women on the rise that it was time for her to like do the next thing and also entrust our leadership. And so that is what we did. And so we sunset the racial justice action center and then spun off. And so in this new iteration, I am a co-founder along with social as well as Ms. Marilyn Nguyen and currently the executive director. So it's been really, really amazing. And it's been a scary and fun process. You know, I've learned a lot about project management and fundraising and HR, all of the things that executive director has to do. But to the heart and to the core, I'm a performance artist. I'm an organizer. And I love my people. I love entertaining my people, bringing joy to my people and keeping my people safe. And so it's been amazing to be able to be resourced to do that and to bring so many people who believe in our mission alone with us. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Boller and you might know me from another Lemonade on Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved non-invasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your healthcare provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of cola rectal cancer. False positive and negative results may occur. Any positive result should be followed by a colonoscopy, not a replacement for colonoscopy in high-risk patients. ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Get your screenings everyone. Cola, it's your old pal, Sarah Silverman. Do you love the holidays? Do you hate the holidays? You and I both know that they can be tough for a lot of people and I want to help you out. I have got an episode of the Sarah Silverman podcast out right now where I answer all of your holiday related questions. Family stuff, emotional stuff. Heck, I'll even give you bad cooking tips if you want them. Listen wherever you get your podcasts from Alemonada Media. Tell me a little bit about you say keeping people safe, looking out for each other. What does that mean on the day to day? Yeah, so I think one of the most amazing parts of our work and one of our premier programs is our taking care of our own fund, which is a grassroots fund that supports emergency bellouts, housing and mutual aid for Black trans and queer folks and our families who need support as well in order for all of us to be together and be together well. We created this fund back in 2016 so those original founders of Snapco were the creators of that fund as well as myself and Dean Steve and we've been keeping it going. In 2020 we had a flux of coins to come into our organization. We love that but also knowing that it was really on the backs of folks like Ray Sharp Brooks on the backs of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and on the backs of the organizers and the leaders who were leading those movements and fights during the pandemic and the uprisings in the summer. Since 2016 we've been able to support 250 people and with our small team of just three to six Black trans folks and queer folks and our allies supporting the work. Again, we've been able to bail over 50 people out of jail. We've been able to house 100 folks and connect them to more resources. We've been able to just give grant seeds and monies to folks and support folks with surgeries. So in this past year, really been able to support the trans youth that we have. We had three youth who were queer and trans and we were able to house them for half of the year, start their gender affirming, you know, therapy sessions, laser hair treatments, honey, getting them together and on their way. So that has been really amazing. So that's been the day to day being in folks' lives, supporting their material needs, their emotional needs, cultivating their sense of belonging with our membership programs and advocating for them and teaching them and supporting them how to advocate for themselves. That is our work and that is what we do day to day outside of, you know, shutting down express ways and, you know, going toe to toe with police and city council. I want to ask about that too, because, you know, I report on the news every day and every day I go through my comment section and I talk a lot about bail reform and we talk a lot about harm reduction and the way that the incarceration system is so just wholly broken and it just is. I mean, that's just a fact and I always get comments from people that are like, okay, I'm down with mutual aid. I understand that. I'm down with housing people. I'm down with wraparound services. I'm even down with makeovers. I'm down with whatever is going to make somebody feel confident enough to go out in the world. But what I'm not able to wrap my head around is why we're bailing criminals out of jail and I'm like, okay, listen, because you're, and I hear so much bias and so much fear in people's voices oftentimes just the way that they're saying, why are you bailing criminals out of jail? And I'm like, okay, you're already assuming that these people have committed in atrocity, which is oftentimes not true. You're also assuming that we're like trying to put people what benefit would there be putting people who cause harm back into our own communities? So I wanted to know from you when folks say to you, you know, why are you bailing people out? What do you tell them? Oh, love this question. What is a crime? Right. Who is a criminal? Jesus. So many people, but not all of us. Sometimes people are just trying to survive. Sometimes people are in unfortunate situations. And so I'll just kind of talk about what's been happening in Atlanta. The Atlanta City Detention Center, which is known in Atlanta as the extra jail was created back in 1996 when the Olympics came to Atlanta. Everybody remember that, right? Yes, I'm probably Olympics. Yes, honey. And so that jail was created to kind of like sweep up like most jails are, to sweep up communities around the Turner Field area in the downtown area of Atlanta. And what that jail held was about 1300 people who were arrested for petty crimes and or non-violent offenses. And we want to be careful about nonviolent versus violent offenses, right? But definitely want to say that J walking, peeing on the sidewalk, traffic violations, right? People were losing their jobs. People were losing their whole lives by those kinds of offenses. Those folks don't deserve to be in jail. Those folks don't deserve to be in the cage. Those people deserve time and more of a process to be accountable, right? In ways that doesn't involve them being locked away, right? And in horrible conditions. In 2019, former Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms did a few things. Number one, she paused and stopped and ended the relationship that the city jail had with ICE, right? To help create more of what we don't really call anymore. But what we call it this time, more of a sanctuary city for folks who are immigrants and coming to Atlanta undocumented folks. And then also she signed legislation that would have put in place a design team to really reimagine what the jail could look like, right? If it wasn't a jail. And to also close the jail, right? To really create ways, this task force to create ways that would empty out the jail over time. Because what was happening was that there were $34 million a year being poured into that jail. So we're talking $34 million for people who didn't pay a ticket, right? $34 million to house a homeless person or a person who is experiencing homelessness. When they could be using some of those funds to be housed and to be resource and cared for. And so that was kind of like the need to like reimagine. So I always encourage people to think about who they have. Improximity to their lives, like who in your family went to jail and really didn't deserve to go to jail figure out why, right? And we know why the system was designed to cage black and brown folks and from keeping us from being a part of society, just like they do with trans people who are wrongfully incarcerated and also youth who are wrongfully incarcerated. And so we do want to challenge those ideas. We do want to be able to have the skill to reimagine more for our communities. We're going to be here for some more time, right? And so we can do something different. You know, you're talking so much about the black and trans experience in Atlanta and these communities that are built. And I'm from New York and I grew up in Connecticut. And the only thing I thought of my whole life is I'm going to be gay someday. So I have to move to New York City. I that was the only place I thought gay people existed as a young child. And I was like, that's where I'm going to go. That's where I'm going to be safe. But you have said that Atlanta is a legendary LGBTQ capital that doesn't get enough attention. Tell me about living in Atlanta as a queer person. Darling, it's amazing how need to be black, to be queer, to be trans, to be a woman, darling, in this generation, in this lifetime, in the South in Atlanta is liberating. Living in Atlanta is like, you know, I'll say the normal things. It's kind of like living in a Wakanda of some sort of like black queer rainbows and community and joy. There's always something to do. Atlanta is really like, so it's so special because you can go anywhere and be around everybody and everybody be okay. You know? Yes, yes. I know that there's a lot of talk about gun violence lately. There's a lot of talk about like the sparking of like crime and you know, outside of those kind of like the jargon around what to be afraid of, there's so much more space of like creativity and joy and like community building that happens across the city. And I think we do do it in justice to our communities. And again, what we're building and have built when we don't leave space for what's actually been changing and what we know to be possible. I'm sure New York is like that too, right? I mean, people talk about crime and violence, but I'm sure your friends are litty. Yeah, they're fine. They're fine. Yeah, I mean, Boston was built by the Butch lesbians. We all know that New York was off it was built by Black trans women and gay men. That's that's like where it was at. Atlanta, though, I had not heard of previously as like a really safe and joyful place for queer people. So I wanted to ask you even more about it because so many folks are listening at home and they're looking for community. And they're looking to change their mind about the the national narratives that are put on certain big cities is like being good ones or not good ones, right? Is it a recent change in Atlanta? Is it who built it? Who made it? Why is it so good now? Who built it queer people, Black people, Black people built Atlanta, Black people will sustain Atlanta. Creatives have built Atlanta. And I think about my favorite artists outcast, escape, you know, all of the 90s, you know, celebrities, RuPaul, his first days was in the cities pumping through the city of Atlanta and Midtown, you know, our culture, our love for each other, our passions for the things that we want to create and the things that we see and manifest. That is what has created and cultivated Atlanta, our civil rights leaders, right? Queer, Black, White, Allah, all of us, right? We have created the culture in which Atlanta is the basis for and the foundation for rights and justice and accountability. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news. But behind the Bleak Headlines, there are people working to protect our right to control our future. The Defenders is a new 10-part series about the fight for freedom in a post- Roe America. Co-hosted by Samantha Bee and me, Gloria Riviera, the show will examine ways people are still accessing care from crossing state borders to self-managed abortion. You'll hear from activists, providers, and everyday people doing the work to expand reproductive freedom. We're here to tell you anyone can become a defender. The Defenders is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Hi, friends. I have an exciting announcement. You can now show your support for our show with your very own Let's Be Smart Together T-shirts, mugs, and tote bags. You can order all of the new V interesting items and more at www.lemonautomedia.com slash shop. Let's be smart together and match outfits. You have the facts to back it up, too. I know it's like a 37-page report, the deeper than visibility report about trans-visibility skyrocketing in the past decade and how representation truly matters. Can you just let folks know some of the top line stuff? I'm going to link in the show notes to the report so people can read it because I think it's important for them to see it firsthand. But tell me about the deeper than visibility report. Beautiful. Also, this project, as many projects that we do are near and dear to my heart, this project was birthed the summer of 2020 during the uprisings. We were on the ground. There's a short documentary produced by Ryan Horne and his brother in the Atlanta Journal Constitution about the night that the Wendy's caught a flame in Atlanta and the highway was shut down. I know so many people remember that night. It was actually right after Ray Sharp Brooks was murdered in the Wendy's parking lot by a Atlanta police officer. I was out there that night. If you watch a documentary, you can check out the story and my story and contribution to keeping folks safe on the highway that night. But there were so many conversations about safety in Atlanta. There was also, after Ray Sharp was murdered, there was also a young girl, Sequoia Turner, who was murdered by stray bullet and killed by stray bullet during a protest that weekend. The police force was disbanding within themselves and going on strike. There were so many things happening in Atlanta. Our police chief, the first LGBTQ and out and open police chief Erica Shields had stepped down and resigned after that. And so the city was in flames literally with Wendy's and we wanted to know what were people really afraid of when we talked about defunding the police. We talked about reimagining our relationship and more community safety. What are we afraid of? What are people thinking? So we started talking to folks. We talked to over 600 people across Atlanta, Fulton County, Cobb County, the Cap County, Clayton County. And we asked them those questions. Do they know what's happening with police budgets? What do they recommend to happen with police budgets? What have your experience has been with police? And we found out some really, really important things that really helped create a narrative of alternative building to policing in our city and how we should be shifting public safety and not just with police reform, but with police abolition and more resources again into the community so that they can now build after abolition, but rebuild what is more necessary and what they feel keeps them safe. Right? And so that is what our report does. You're able to see the survey results and what people were thinking, some of the stories that they experienced with police. You're able to also see a timeline of like reformist and abolitionist efforts when it comes to police, a few scandals, a few people that we love who've been forgotten about, who've been harmed by police violence in Atlanta. And then you're able to also see some policy recommendations and a few ideas to help us move forward like a new trap cultural zone or zones that support businesses and communities with more de-escalation tactics. Also a trans safety initiative that again allows trans folks to be in their dignity and to have a buddy of some sort and then to also get their records expunged and documents updated. And so you will see kind of this vision of safety for not just trans people, but black people. I'm a black trans woman in Atlanta, from Atlanta, and all of my people who I mean at the intersection are important to me. So we wanted to create a document that really lays out our works to invite more people in. I'm going to tell you, it was really helpful to me and I'm going to expose myself a little bit here. I sometimes hear defon the police and I'm like, well, but who's going to, but then what are we going to do? And then you know, and then you have to really research and learn. And the thing that I learned from this particular document is that at the end of this, we're trying to provide safety to communities, right? So one way that it had been done historically was with policing, your friendly neighborhood policeman who's going to protect you from any potential crime. But when that isn't happening, because the police budget is so inflated and the budget for things that prevent crime, like housing people, like getting people the mental health care that they need, making sure that domestic violence isn't occurring, making sure people aren't in desperate circumstances that force them to commit crimes just to survive. If we sort of invested in those things, we would have safety and we wouldn't have crime and we wouldn't have to rely on this really aggressive form of safety that turns out is not that safe. It is not that safe. You know, we've seen that over the last couple of years with the rise in social media, the way that the citizen journalists can truly document in real time what an interaction with certain police forces is like. And that does not represent safety. That's not everyone everywhere. And so what I loved about this document was it reminds people that the point here is for the best of the community. The point here is to lift people up to make them feel included. It's not to say like, you know, let's get rid of everything that exists and everybody did a bad job and you're all, you know, a problem. It's like, shit ain't working. Here are some ideas for how it could work. Maybe we ought to give them a try in collaboration. And I just absolutely love that work that you do. Thank you. Because like you said, you're you're sitting at this intersection of being black, of being trans, of being a woman, of being in the south. I mean, I do the news every day. I could do just news on the crimes that are perpetrated upon your community. And it would never get to the end. And it's like, who is protecting you? And your answer is ourselves. And now you've come forward with some really good action steps for people. Thank you. Yes. It wasn't you even partnered with the scariest app in all of the app store, the citizen app, which scares me every day I get I had the citizen app. I had to get it off my phone. They report too many things on that. And I live in like nowhere now. I live in Rochester, but like, you know, I'd be dinging me all the time with stuff. But tell me about the partnership with the citizen app even. I mean, you guys are freaking everywhere. We are. Thank you. We've been working really hard. And I'm really proud of our team. It's been a journey building a team in the last three years. It hasn't been easy, especially with the pandemic. But the folks that I found and that we found, they love us. So we love them. And they pour so much into everybody that that comes into our base. The citizen app, my God. So this partnership, it came out of the sky. It came out of the blue. I was introduced to a representative from citizen and they share with us the work with other communities around offering just free premium subscriptions to to the app. Again, with this kind of initial thought that if folks have access to something else, right, that they could generate a little more safety for themselves and like within their communities. And that is something that we believe in. We know that there have been apps like Neighbor and things that have been, you know, harmful to black and LGBTQ communities. But we've done research with citizen and that really have a clear understanding of like what is allowed and what is not allowed on their platforms. And that it is overwhelming to receive all of the information. But I think for us, the main thing is that we want trans people, particularly trans women to have someone else with them who is not police. Because at the end of the day, I think of an example, you know, as a trans woman, I hate walking through groups of men. Okay, it is like my worst fear that someone would see me as trans and respond violently to that. And to know that, you know, a lot of times, I don't feel comfortable calling a friend to letting them know it's like, girl, they probably tired of hearing me being scared about it. But to know that I have an app that I can just tap someone's with me within three seconds to just walk with me and wait with me by the bus, walk with me and went through the parking lot until I get through the store. If I need support, they can escalate for me to call the police if I needed that or to contact someone for me. If I needed that, we want that for our people. And we want them to have that resource. And so, it is a resource. I know that's even what it did. I was just like, Oh my gosh. Now I'm learning to today, right? So now I'm going to put back a phone. Yes. Snap call and I'll give you that I would absolutely love to do that. I think that sounds like such a great way to like help folks and be a part of the community and like just generally be looking out for each other as simple as that. It's an incredible idea. It's simple as that. And so, they've been great. They've been great with us and we're excited for what's to come. That is fantastic. And we get a lot of questions from people who do want to know how to help. And we've now taught people, film the police, film where you are. If you don't feel safe, click into the citizen app, ask for help. Don't assume that things are going to be okay. Tell folks at home, what is the power in de-escalation? And maybe add, what does that look like? You know, like how can they take control of a situation if it starts to get out of hand? The power of de-escalation is simply being able to live through a moment. It's as simple as that. You're able to live and breathe through a moment. You know, being able to be dropped into your own body, being able to understand spiritually and wholly the choices and agency that you have, being able to trust, you know, in the ways that it matters, that people have your back and that you have what you need as well. And also to trust that something else is possible on the other side of it. We already know like what escalating things would do, right? Folks get killed, folks get harmed or hurt, folks get arrested and taken away from families. People get fired. People are stuck and forced with shame and all of the things that hold us back from each other. And so when I think about de-escalation and the power of de-escalation, it's about interconnectedness. It's about presence and openness for possibility and change. And we need that. We are yearning for that. Some of my favorite teachers like Prince Himpfield and mentors and sisters like Adrian Marie Brown, you know, that they are, you know, teachers of these skills and this like process of embodiment. It's so am I. And so I think there's just so much power inside of it for the sake of our communities, our families and our futures as black people, as people who love black people, who want to support trans people. I think that there's so much more possible when we are all have detectives in the skill to de-escalate, to calm, to ground so that we transform a moment to be better connected to each other. Yeah, I love what you said. It gives you the power to live through that moment. And sometimes that's that's exactly where we are. You can't make a big change, but you can make a tiny adjustment. You can hold your own power and you can get through that moment and then you can make a different decision. It doesn't have to be all the decisions all up at front in the first place. What is your vision for black trans liberation in the new year? In the new year, honey? What's 2023 going to bring? Baby, I hope it brings people new bodies and the bodies that they desire and see for themselves. Absolutely. I also see wins. Wins on state and federal levels for trans and LGBTQ and black equality and justice and restoration. I think that that is on the version on the horizon. I see more folks understanding what safety is and what is possible for them. It's our 10 year anniversary. Okay, so I see us having a good old time being gay at a gay love. Ballroom will be in the ballroom. We'll be in the ballroom, darling. Supporting and investing more in trans lives and leadership across Atlanta and into Snapco.
