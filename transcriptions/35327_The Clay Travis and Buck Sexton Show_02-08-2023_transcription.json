    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome back in final hour of the week, 14 hours up. This is the 15th hour. We appreciate many of you who have spent all 15 hours with us so far this week as we've been tracking the biggest stories in the country and around the world. We're joined now by Julie Kelly to break down the latest on the Proud Boys trial, where that stands, what's going on with the January 6th defendant and how it all ties in with Donald Trump. So, Julie, what can you tell us about the convictions that occurred this week of the Proud Boys for seditious conspiracy and how you believe that ties in with what the Department of Justice is going to try to do as it relates to Donald Trump? Hi guys. Thanks for having me on. So yesterday after a four month trial about five or so days of deliberations, a jury in Washington, D.C. came back with four convictions of four members of the Proud Boys five or on trial. Four members convicted of seditious conspiracy and other conspiracy counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding. One defendant, Dominic Pazzola, was found not guilty of two of the conspiracies, including seditious conspiracy. This brings the total number of January 6th defendants, both convicted or having accepted plea deals, 14 January 6th. There's American citizens, Trump supporters convicted now of a post civil war statute. No Americans ever been convicted of it until the January 6th criminal prosecution. Now we have 14 Trump supporters who have now been convicted of this count that is synonymous to treason. The reason why it poses such a grave legal threat to Donald Trump is this now bolsters special prosecutor, Jack Smith's attempts if he pursues them to get a grand jury indictment against Trump for the same charge of seditious conspiracy. You might recall that the January 6th Select Committee, they didn't send a criminal referral on seditious conspiracy, but they suggested in their report that DOJ should consider that charge against Trump and specifically mentioned convictions in the Oath Keepers case and the pending trial of the Proud Boys. So that's where I suspect this is headed. Julie, it's Buck. We really appreciate you being with us as always. Can you just tell us, because I was able to see some fragments here and there about the specifics of what these individuals, you've told us what the charges are and the jury findings on them. What is it that they supposedly did? And in one case, my understanding, and if this is incorrect, I know you'll update us, and that's why I like being able to ask you this stuff, is that somebody wasn't even in DC at all, one of these individuals on January 6th? Like what is it that they supposedly did and were now convicted of? What they did, Clay and Buck is have a lot of text messages in encrypted group, group chats, which by the way, included an unknown number of S behind informants. We know there were at least eight. That's what the government stipulated in this case. I suspect that there were dozens. But all of the evidence basically was chats on parlor and chats in group chats, posts and group chats that talked about stopping the steal, attending the rallies in November and December, planning to go to January 6th, talking about 1776, talking about a possible war, the Joe Biden was not legitimately elected, etc., etc. That was the evidence. How do you overthrow the government, which is the essence of seditious conspiracy, when you bring no weapons to you? Yeah, is it correct, based on the court documents, this is a matter of record, that the prosecution didn't even allege that these individuals on the seditious conspiracy charge had come up with a plan for the conspiracy and the sedition? Am I missing something? No, you're not. You're exactly right. To get back to your first question, in Rekaterio, the group's leader was in Baltimore on January 6th. He had been arrested on January 4th for an altercation back in December. He was arrested order to leave Washington, which he did, but he's still convicted of seditious conspiracy. So what exactly was this case about? It was about these texts. It was about people who didn't really know each other, meeting up on January 6th, marching from the Washington Monument to the Capitol. They stopped at food trucks on their way there. Yes, they didn't have weapons. They didn't assault any police officers. They were accused of knocking over a fence, a metal fence. One of them smashed in a window with a riot shield. That is the totality of the case. But this is the slippery slope. And as we've all talked about, the obstruction of an official proceeding felony. This is the bastardization, weaponization of laws that have nothing to do with political protest. But this is how they're wielding them, weaponizing them to criminalize political dissent. And they're doing it very successfully. You said 110% chance that you believe the Department of Justice was going to charge Trump. You also put out a tweet saying that you laid out basically, probably the argument that Department of Justice is going to use now that they have these seditious conspiracy convictions that Trump is basically the person that put this all in motion with a tweet that he sent on December 19th about the events on January 6th. Are you even more? You said 110%. How much more convinced are you now based on these convictions that charges against Trump are coming? And what do you think they'll look like? So I'm still over 100% confident that they are going to indict him. I would say there's probably a 70% chance that they'll go for seditious conspiracy indictment against him. But to your point, the tweet that Donald Trump posted on December 19th come to the rally on January 6th will be wild. The government said that that date was when this alleged conspiracy began. And they cited Donald Trump's tweet as sort of evidence that this group was then starting to conspire to commit sedition. But going back even further, the very first clip that the Assistant U.S. Attorney played during closing arguments last week, I went to DC to watch closing arguments, the very first video clip he played to the jury was not of the proud boys committing violence or trying to overthrow Congress. It was Donald Trump's comment in the September 2020 presidential debate when he was goaded by Joe Biden and Chris Wals to condemn white supremacist militia groups. And he asked for a name. And Joe Biden is the one who said the proud boys. So Trump said proud boys, stand back and stand by. That clip was played. It was also mentioned in the official press release that came out today by the Department of Justice that that comment spurred on the proud boys led to a big surge in their membership. And that's how they came to try to overthrow the government on January 6th. DOJ put that in their press release today. None of this is by accident. It is warning shot to not just Trump but people around him possibly Johnny and others for allegedly conspiring. And the language, and I posted this on Twitter today too, if people want to look, the jury instructions are extremely vague. It's not just that you're trying to overthrow the government by force. It is prevent, delay or hinder execution of a government law. Now think of how this could apply to past and certainly future political protests. So in not even force, the force part of it was never proven and doesn't have to be proven according to the jury instructions. So if you yell at a police officer in service of a political protest, that's by force trying to commit seditious conspiracy. If you delay a congressional hearing say or a confirmation hearing, anything that we've seen, especially in the past five or six years by the last, this would apply. So this is really the very discouraging way that these judges quite think they are letting the Department of Justice bastardize laws that have nothing to do with what happened on January 6th, but nonetheless are being used to criminalize political dissent and punish Trump's supporters for protesting his election that day. Julie, you're certainly looking very prescient with your six months ago telling us you think they're going to bring what they've already brought as we know a criminal charge against Donald Trump. That Rubicon has been crossed, but the federal criminal charge up to and including possibly a seditious conspiracy charge against the likely next Republican nominee. What do you think their timeline is for this? And also, do you believe that they want to and would if they can lock Donald Trump up? I mean, these proud boys are facing 20 years in prison from what I understand. Not only are they facing up to 20 years in prison, possibly more, they've already been in prison since the spring really winter of 2021. This was even before they were charged with seditious conspiracy when they were just charged with obstruction and regular conspiracy. Judge Tim Kelly denied their bail. They were in jail almost two years as innocent men before they had a chance to go to trial. So there's precedent for both obstruction and seditious conspiracy for the government to come in, ask for pretrial detention, meaning deny bail for Donald Trump or anyone else charged with these crimes. And these judges, Trump Biden, Trump Obama, Clinton, all the way down to Reagan, according to judges, have signed off on pretrial detention orders even for non-violent offenders with basically what would be a sort of a process crime. This is a very dangerous, I wish I was not exaggerating, but you guys know because you so I'm so grateful for covering my work. I've covered this for more than two years. And what's happening in that DC courthouse is getting worse than when I first started covering it. It is the Marxist Banana Republic style, whether it's a Republican judge, Democrat one, where these prosecutors come from, it doesn't matter. They are all in cahoots to punish Trump supporters and get the brass ring, which will be Donald Trump. When do you think the timeframe, Julie, would be on an indictment? Jack Smith, he had Mike Pence last week, testified before the grand jury for January 6th. I think he's getting close to the end. I think that this will kind of wrap up sort of loose ends that he needs. So it could be June. I doubt that it would be as quickly as May, could be June, could be July. But if anyone who thinks that this Department of Justice or Jack Smith is going to abide by longstanding traditions of not pursuing political prosecutions in election years or etc, none of that matters. The rule of law doesn't matter. The Constitution doesn't matter. Decency does not matter to these people. They are vengeful, reckless, and they have bloodlust in them, but it shocks me every day to see it. And so if I pray that I'm wrong, but I don't think that I am. Julie, you have killed it. Continue to do so covering all of these cases. We will have you on again soon. Go follow Julie Kelly on Twitter. And thank you for your time. Thanks for always having me on guys.

He is a particularly loathsome leftist in so many ways. And it is also an authoritarian. Remember what he did to the Canadian truckers. Remember how he acted during COVID, a true power mat lunatic without a single brave or principled bone in his body. But here he is. I thought this is funny. Clay, you have a 15 year old boy. Yes. So you could weigh in on this from the dad perspective. Justin Trudeau. He is very concerned with the possibility that his son might be seeing sneaky misogynism. Play 26 men have to have conversations with their boys. I have a 15 year old son who spends too much time on the internet. And I know the kinds of things that are out there. The sneaky misogynism that sort of slips through and workout videos and bro videos. Having those conversations are way more difficult for me than having just the basic birds and the bees conversations. Anyone talk about birds and bees anymore in this era of too much information on the internet. But having those difficult conversations now about women's rights, about equality, about these things that are core to how boys are raised, these are something that men have to be better allies on. Oh my God. I mean, honestly, Clay, workout bro videos. That's what he's concerned of all the stuff on the internet too. Guys are like, Hey, like, here's how you can wail on your pecs and grow some muscle fiber. Like, that's what he's concerned about. Does anybody out there listening to us right now think there is too much masculinity in America or Canada for that matter? Because I know we've got some Canadian listeners. Are there people out there legitimately who are saying, Hey, what's really wrong with America in the in today's era is that there are there's too much toxic masculinity. I just sneaky misogyny is a new phrase. I haven't heard that before. But this goes to what Buck, you and I have actually talked about. I've got a 15 year old son is misogyny ever really sneaky. Like, right? It'd be pretty obvious. Like, what's sneaky? Well, that's I think he's saying sneaky misogyny is, you know, workout gets stronger and be a man. Do more pushups be tougher. This is what we've talked about. And I think about it a lot. Because I've got three boys 15, 12 and eight. And the one thing he said that is correct is they get most of their news from YouTube. And that's why I've said on this show so often, Hey, go subscribe to our YouTube channel, share clips that you may like from this show with your kids and grandkids on YouTube. They're way more likely to watch it there. And so it is true that kids are on YouTube. But what boys in particular are seeking out. What I hear and see so much is they're being told that being a man is wrong. And many boys out there, young kids, young boys, they have no idea how to grow into adulthood because they're being told, you are what's wrong. And it's actually the opposite. I think of what Trudeau is saying, boys need to be taught how to be men and also be taught that there is a difference in the sexes and that you should be a protector of women. Totally true.

Dial pound 250, say clay and buck and save 50% off your first month. Again, dial pound 250, say clay and buck and start saving now. He's basically the same guy on air as he is off air. And this is pretty wild. There now is a letter that has been sent from the law firm representing Fox saying that they are not involved in any way in these leaks and that what media matters is now putting up from Tucker Carlson is not from them and also a proprietary material and they're demanding that media matters cease and desist. So buck, I present you with two options here, both of which are pretty wild. One option, Tucker Carlson has been leaking videos to media matters in one of the all time great espionage moves because he knows they make him look better. And meanwhile, most people will attribute the leak to Fox or Fox has been leaking these videos expected for the result to be more favorable for them. And now is saying that they are not leaking them. How would you assess as a former CIA operative the origination story here of the Tucker Carlson media matters videos as a latte drinking CIA analyst. I've had that undercuts this as the most esteemed member of the CIA from your generation. A man. I mean, Jack Bauer slash Jack Ryan got nothing on me. No, I would say the chance that this is coming from Tucker is zero. I don't I don't see I a esteemed former CIA analyst. I would say the chance that Tucker is putting this stuff out there itself is a zero. So there's really I mean the two options are it's coming from it's coming from Fox someone within someone within Fox. Yeah, whatever the third option to be fair, there is a third option that it's someone that is not affiliated with Fox necessarily that is leaking them. Well, what I was going to say is I mean, there's the possibility that someone had access to this line had hacked into it to look at Tucker. I mean, that's that's possible. I'm not saying that's what happened, but meaning some third party got access to the relay back to Fox. The timing would still be strange. The tech. Look, technically, that would be I'm not saying that's likely. Okay, I'm just saying that is a theoretical possibility. The much more likely scenario is, okay, what's really going on here? There's either a mole within Fox. That's really what we're talking about a mole within Fox with access to these outtakes who is directly sending them to media matters or somebody within the Fox administration is saying or you know, within the Fox hierarchy is saying pull this stuff and release it to pressure Tucker because there's obviously legal wrangling and a settlement going to come about what's happened here. Those are the only options as I see it. I don't know which one of them is more likely. The mole scenario was certainly very possible. Like where did the member the will do it live video? Well, no, below Riley, that was that not at Fox. That was at Access Hollywood. Is that right? I think that's right. Not access. Sorry. No, I think he was. Kid guys, no, current affairs. They're gonna be like, yeah, God, man, like it wasn't an access. Hollywood current affairs. But just, you know, somebody in that control room just decided we're gonna take that and share it. So that could be what's going on here too. But it's amazing to me. People keep saying, look, what do you think of this? I'm just like, this is Tucker. I mean, no one who was a Tucker fan is seeing any of these outtakes and actually chose him being really nice to staff and like friendly and relatable and normal and funny, you know, funny. Not everybody who's, you know, making tens of millions of dollars doing TV is like that, folks. I could assure you, I mean, and then you start to get into like, you know, the Matt Lowers and the some of the people out there, what they got away with for such a long time, you're like, Oh, you mean Tucker is like a nice family guy who treats his staff? Well, interesting. I will tell you now that I think about it on the mole angle back when I was doing before I did daily television for Fox Sports, I did a bunch of different pilots and many of those pilots never saw the light of day. Oh, man, I would love to see some of these old school clay pilots. This would be phenomenal. I did. I did a show where it was like drunk sports. So instead, I think a lot of people have seen drunk history. I did a show inside of Fox Sports. We did a pilot where it was me, Kyle Brant, some of you may know, Kyle Brant from the NFL Network, Petros Papadakis, Lindsey theory, the four of us, if I remember correctly, all had alcohol and drink and just talked about the stories of the day. We all were wasted. It was like an hour long show and they were like, just keep drinking. We were all wasted by the time we finished. They actually had drivers to get us back to the hotel. That thing never saw the light of day. Another pilot that I did though, got leaked to, I believe, dead spin. And it was never aired. It was just talking about the issues of the day. Somebody grabbed it and shared it and turned it into a story. So that wasn't from like higher ups at Fox Sports. Somebody, a mole had grabbed that video and shared it and it turned into a story because we were doing a pilot for a show. And they were like, here's Clay Travis. I don't even remember what I was talking about back in the day, but it was not something that ever aired publicly. Some, some rules here, everybody. Never talk to the feds. Okay. We know that one. All guns are always loaded. Everybody farms know that one and all microphones are always recording. You live your life that way. You'll be better off and safer because you just don't know video or audio. All mics are on. All guns are loaded. All mics are on. Don't talk to the feds and, uh, you know, be sure to tip your weight or well, just be the same person would be another lesson. I think this goes for all mics are on. We live in a world buck where there's virtually no difference now between public and private. So whatever you are doing in a, in your private life, at some point, it better be somewhat similar to the way that you live in your public life. Yeah. And that doesn't matter. It used to be just if you're a public figure, you had to worry about that. These days, anybody can become a celebrity overnight just based on a viral video. And this is, I don't know how many people saw this. It was really good. Glenn Greenwald did on his show, which I would want to give a shout out to, you know, Glenn's a man of the left. I actually had a couple debates with Glenn back in the day on some pretty intense terrorism stuff, but he is a man of principle when it comes to the first amendment. He sees reality and it's funny because people say he's not right wing. He just still believes in free speech. He still believes journalism is a thing. But he did a whole show on, on his show system update, I think it's called, and this is maybe a week or two ago, where he just talked about how the left doesn't want people to realize that they've created this. If you have the right opinions, how you act doesn't matter standard. And it's obviously for climate change, this is a big thing, right? Oh, yeah. You know, John Kerry has to fly private everywhere to save the world from climate change, right? We're like, this is a joke. But even, I mean, we mentioned before the, the woman who was talking about how, look, if you get punched, you know, the leftist from that, that ridiculous show, if you know, she's saying, oh, about the Jordan nearly case, if you get punched in the face, no big deal. Like someone's having a tough day. Who cares? She went to some $30,000 a year private school. Glenn tweeted this out in the last hour. She is some rich lady who is now who has that had a life of privilege. And she is white. And now she tells an audience of imbeciles. Oh, but we are all socialists now. And we're all about social justice and, and dealing with, you know, racial oppression and all this other stuff, frauds. But the left has to create this standard for their people because like Keith Hoberman's a horrible human being. Like everyone who's worked for it will say this to you. He doesn't care about the poor. He doesn't care about people who are oppressed. But he has the right positions publicly so he gets a pass. It's so true. And you can argue, I think legitimately, that the white liberal, in particular white liberal women who are a huge position of the Democrat Party Foundation on the far left, are in many ways destroying the country by, as you pointed out, being wealthy, being elite, living in high income neighborhoods in very protected environments. And they just go out and say, you know, every, it's like in San Francisco, Buck, when they started saying, you know, if your home is getting robbed, do you really need the property that's being stolen from you? If you get assaulted on the subway, do you really need to hold someone accountable? The white guilt is overwhelming. The desire to call the police, we are told by the left, is a form of violence against black and brown individuals. This is their rhetoric. This is what they say. Meanwhile, why do they make that assumption? There are people of all races who commit crimes, but their belief in San Francisco. This is referring to a San Francisco Chronicle editorial. I think it was a couple of years ago is, well, if you call the police, because there's a disproportionately high probability that a person of color is the person burglarizing your house, you, the person, whatever color you are in that house, is calling for violence against a person of color by calling the police. That was the real argument being made by the left. And that argument was made by the New York Times editorial board. You'll remember when Tom Cotton said, hey, all this rioting, looting, pillaging that's going on associated with BLM protests, we need to call out the national guard so that we can protect American cities, American people. The New York Times editorial board staged a revolt because that editorial was published because they said it threatened black lives to have actual implementation of the law was such a just the argument, not to actually do it. The argument was unacceptable to be allowed because of the danger that it put black lives in. That's what you're hearing from this MSNBC contributor. That's what you heard from the San Francisco Chronicle. And that's what you heard from the New York Times editorial board. And that all is destroying the fabric of justice in America. Mark has been brutal. Everyone's talking about inflation. It's everywhere. Buck and I recently met with Dutch Mendenhall, Dutch is the founder of rad diversified.

It's just us hanging out. And also other podcasts that we do that don't appear here on the radio show.

We've also got to tutor Dixon doing shows every week. Go check out the clay and Buck podcast, please download the iHeartApp a great way to do it. Now, client I was sitting here. We could have saved giant lawn penis for the end of the show, but we already talked about that story. If you missed it, someone in anticipation of the Royal Coronation tomorrow in the UK has made a very large male genitalia outline in the grass at the coronation site, which means they're going to have to do something to try to cover this up. I don't know if they cut the rest of the grass shorter, but it is very clear what they are trying to show people. So we were going to save that for the end, but we didn't. We jumped the jump the gun on that one a little bit. But can we do we want to do the the banks that we're talking off air? It's like, I hate to give you like a hey, the world's going to burn and we're all screwed segment right to close into the into the week. We were looking for a kind of like, you know, international puppy day kind of a story. We couldn't find one. So I guess instead, we're going to talk about how maybe the banks are all going to collapse at some point, not all of them obviously, but some of the banks. I'm just kidding. It's all going to be fine. But here's Charlie Gasparino saying we are in some deep. Well, I'll let him say at play 17. How should we read what's going on today with these banks? We're in deep, do do. I'm afraid. This is a bad situation. That a technical measure. That's a that's an economic turn for, you know, something I can't say on on air. But here's a thing. You have three banks. Each one of these banks that that failed were considered one offs. Okay, there's no such thing as one offs. There's no such thing as three offs. The same sort of stuff risk taking that those three banks took is duplicated throughout the banking system, particularly in the mid-sized banks, the regional banking system. There's not a lot of confidence in the banking system right now. And people are pulling their money out of banks. Clay banks are herd animals in a sense. They all move in the same direction. They're all trying to make money for the most part in the same basic ways when it comes to lending and looking at the rates and what they're doing. And that means that if some of these banks are on the brink, others are on the brink. What happens? It's not going to be pretty. And we started off the week, unfortunately telling you, and I'm surprised that it isn't a bigger story. The second, third, and fourth biggest United States bank collapses in history have happened in the last six weeks. And I don't think, unfortunately, that this story is going away because what it feels like to me is occurring here is things are rapidly getting worse as it pertains to the fastest interest rate hike we've seen in 40 years. I keep hammering on this show. Look out for commercial real estate. That is the next one. A lot of banks have massive amounts of risk on their books with the amount that they have guaranteed for the purchase of many of these big commercial real estate properties. And as these real estate properties are moving off of two and three percent interest rates, suddenly the math doesn't work because they have two simultaneous issues going on, Buck. One is a lot of people just aren't going into the office anymore. So many companies don't need anywhere near the amount of real estate that they have right now for their office workers. Two, the inflation rate has, I mean, the inflation rate certainly a skyrocket, but the interest rate has skyrocketed. That combination of both is going to create a major bloodbath that may threaten many more banks before all is said and done. I don't think this is over. I hate to finish off the week talking about this. But if I were worried, if I were investing in a lot of these regional banks right now, I'd be super nervous about where things are going. Well, I'm going to head over to peg like Parker and get some barbecue here in Nashville because that's my favorite spot. So I got that going for me, which is nice. And Clay, you know, we're going to be doing some Nashville things this weekend. And we hope Edward has a really nice time with their family and go to my own. Yeah, go to my own. Maybe make yourself a margarita and enjoy. So happy thoughts, happy thoughts, everybody. It's all going to be okay. Make sure you join us Monday. We'll explain on Monday why it's all going to be, well, not all of it, but like in general, things are good. This sad story is box fault. Have great weekends."
