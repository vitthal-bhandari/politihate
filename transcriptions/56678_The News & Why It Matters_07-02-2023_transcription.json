    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Trans Lives Matters carried out an insurrection on Oklahoma State's Capitol yesterday, House Democrats cry out white supremacy in today's hearings and J. Low and Ben's honeymoon period appears to be over. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and I am joined today once again by Jorge Ventura, independent reporter and also I would say the lovely but I'm not so sure. Michael Malice, author of The White Pill and of course, host of You're Welcome. I love that you just came totally like everything you got your book, you've got your own shirt on. I'm not wearing pants. Whoa, I didn't know because when I walked up here, you already seated. No, so I want to I want to get into stories of the day, but I also I just want to say really quickly right off the top. I considered canceling Michael from the show because he very recently wished me a happy birthday except he wished me what was it 53rd? So I was on Twitter and I said everyone ever I didn't just wish you I said everyone joined me in wishing Sarah Gonzalez a happy birthday and there was a picture which was unrelated which is a cake that said happy 53rd birthday now. I had Carrie Lake on my show this week which airs tomorrow and she's the former she's the governor of Canada for Arizona. She's fighting to have the election overturned because she said there are irregularities in the voting and during the interview she turns to me and she says you know we're about the same age and you know how well she is 53. So there was my instant karma that happened there is all but I have a question for you if I can ask. Okay. People watch this show for a couple reasons. One is that they're lonely and depressed but two they like you and they like your personality. They like how articulate you are. They like you're a mom who's like your family informs your issues. I was supposed to be here on your birthday. Yeah. So I want to know what you actually did for your birthday. Well I mean it was frozen so it was just thawing out. We got to go to Habachi dinner and that was it and we I mean you know the kids were home all week from school because everything was frozen and so I look it was really great to get back into the routine on Friday. Okay. But we did we we got to go to a Habachi for for dinner but you you do still let me lunch. But what was the best thing that happened to you in the last year? Everything sucked. Really? No. Come on. Share your journey. No, no, no. I would say I would well. You do agree with the that's why I was. Yeah. Yeah. Defend our kids Texas. We launched that and we've done a lot. We've had a lot of great success. In fact I just found out from a I know we'll get to the news in a second. All right. Hold on. Yeah. Yeah. The Democrats read again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just found out that our website since I posted a picture of a new shirt that we are we're doing at real women's club.com that says real women aren't men. We got like 21 million hits. DDoS hits on our website. They keep trying to take our website. Oh, wow. Yeah. They're they are really pissed at us for trying to fight grooming and pedophiles. So yeah. So of course the website is still up and they were not successful. But it's always fascinating to see how many hits we get depending on what it is that we're with what we're doing. So anyway, I appreciate that Michael. Well, I didn't appreciate the joke. All right. It was kind of funny. Whatever. Actually, what was so hurtful was the people who were like, Oh, cool. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I'm like, what? How do I look 50? Do you want me to answer that question? No, I don't actually because I would like to still be friends with you. So I want to get to this this trans lives matter protest. There was an insurrection over in Oklahoma, Oklahoma State Capitol yesterday. They occupied the Rotunda to protest against there are a couple different bills that are going on that are being discussed right now in Oklahoma. One would ban the gender affirming surgery for people under 18. The other would ban it for people under 21. And the Republican governor obviously is championing this legislation seeking to ban treatments. There's one that seeking to ban treatments for anyone under the age of 26 by punishing doctors who provide the services they would face criminal prosecution and lose their license. But it's just it's really fascinating because you see these I didn't see Capitol police storming in removing these people, you know, launching tear gas, police officers beating the crap out of them. I didn't see anyone, you know, getting shot. And I'm just I'm just curious as to how this movement these these trans individuals were able to get to the highest part of the totem pole, right? I mean, it really does feel like they are untouchable. They can do and say whatever they want. They can show their genitals to young children. They can, you know, go and occupy the Capitol. And nothing seems to happen to them. They're this new protected class. Meanwhile, I don't know, I just feel like, obviously, there were bad things that happened on January 6th. It shouldn't have happened. But there were also a lot of people who were there and were peaceful and not violent and now, you know, face all of these charges that they're going to have to probably spend the rest of their lives paying off or defending. I have a slight question for you. And this is going to sound like criticism. But I really think a lot of the audience is going to have the same thing. No, why did you use the expression gender affirming surgery for children? Because I feel like that's a trans I agree with you. I said it because it's in my notes right here because that's what was that's what was written, which I agree with you. And just for context, I walked on this set late because I had an appointment to take my son to so I hadn't even had a chance to review the way that this was worded because I always make it a point to call it genital mutilation or, you know, chopping young women's breasts off because I think it's important that we say what it really is. I will never say top surgery or bottom surgery. I sure hope someone gets fired for that blender. No, no, we don't. It's like a poor answer. I'm going to talk to an actor. No, no. To answer your question, we also saw it before January 6th with what happened in Michigan. Remember, they were kind of storming there and so on and so forth. I have to say like I am in favor of as many people storming as many state capitals as possible to make it as absolutely uncomfortable for these demons who are both parties who seek to legislate and rule over our lives. I think this story is going to go absolutely it's just funny how I think people don't appreciate to what extent people don't have contradictions when they look at the news. Yeah, like they'll look at January 6th. Those are bad. They'll look at this. They'll say it's heroic. Then they'll go back to January 6th. It's bad and in their minds, they live in this kind of state of like a perpetual present. So if you had like cereal for breakfast, then you have like a sandwich for lunch, that's not a contradiction. And that's kind of how they look at the news. They look at one story and have one perspective. They have another story with a completely different perspective and they're never forced to buy the media to kind of combine those two and have a coherent narrative. So it's kind of fascinating to watch the reaction of the masses to these kinds of stories. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Also, I talked about and if you speak to a lot of people in politics, a lot of black Americans are actually super frustrated with this movement. Kind of what something Sarah was alluding to earlier was they are the new protected class and they're now getting all the attention in the media. And if you speak to a lot of minority communities, they feel like this LGBT trans movement has just almost hijacked that and it's all about them. They already have rights in this country. No one's not let them get at their sex changes. If they want to get a sex change, it's just you have to be over 18 or wherever state. It's just that for these children, we still today haven't seen any evidence of it. Even in like scalding in countries in Europe who are like very equal when it comes to this gender stuff, even they're not even on board with this stuff yet because they haven't seen any evidence that this is healthy. I mean, we literally don't know what's going to happen to these people. And there's now activists coming out like Chloe Coe or they're speaking out and saying, hey, I was almost kind of groomed by the doctors saying I would be happy now that I've done I've basically destroyed my body. One of the sad things actually had a conversation with Chloe about this. She says, one of the sad things for me, Hori, is that now if I have a child, if I could even have one, I can't even have like the breastfeeding experience with my child and it's all thrown away. And one of the things that no one wants to talk about at all, and I want you to speak on this as someone who's had two kids, when you give human beings hormones that changes their psychology, when you give men steroids, which is testosterone, people are familiar with the Freud range, something like that. Everyone knows that it's extremely common with women where their hormones are raging. Their behavior becomes often erratic. But this idea that if you take someone who regards themselves as trans and give them hormones of one, four or another, that that's not going to affect their behavior in psychology, or it will only affect it in positive, beneficial, and psychologically healthy ways that to me is absurd in its face. If you give a female, a certain amount of, assist female, a certain amount of estrogen, what that's not going to have any effect on how she thinks and acts, that's crazy. Well, I would say I don't really need to speak on that for you, because if you've ever dated or been in a relationship with a woman or known a woman, you know how their personality changes just at that time of the month, right? Like, I mean, yeah, there are very obvious changes. She's Latina. It's, yeah, you get you, she's coming at you with the chonicle. God bless my husband. So, okay, so I do want to, I want to touch a little bit more on what you're talking about Jorge, which Chloe has been on this program before as well. But just the, I really think what it's going to take for the pendulum to swing back are the massive amounts of people like Chloe, who are saying, you guys did, you didn't, you didn't give me informed consent, because I think that that's what really this boils down to when we're talking about the doctor's aspect of it, is you're not giving me informed consent. You're not telling me that you don't know what the long-term effects could possibly be. You're not telling me that this could potentially be irreversible in certain ways. You know, oftentimes they talk about puberty blockers, they talk about hormones as being, there's no, no harmful side effects, no lasting damage. And so they're not getting true informed consent when they are walking themselves into this. So, we have this, this movement of D transitioners who are saying, what you guys did to us is criminal. There's also parents out there who are, I would say, at a less of a rate, but there are parents out there who are saying, you know what, I transitioned my young child and I shouldn't have done that. I want to, I want to play here. One, this is a mother confessing to transition, her son at four years old, and she wanted to remain anonymous. So when I play this, she's, she has her face is blurred because she wanted to remain anonymous. Gee, I wonder why. And so, she raises her two boys as gender neutral. She later realized that living that lifestyle was like, leaving the lifestyle was like leaving a cult. I want to play a little bit. I mean, it's just like the idea that gender neutral and trans are the same thing or this kind of then diagram. There's such a big difference between someone who has gender dysphoria, with their male and their, of the belief that they're female, as opposed to I'm a human being who's genderless. These are entirely from concepts and they're just being all thrown together. So, so then I want, I want to piggyback off of that and ask you a question. So, would you agree then that the treatment for gender dysphoria would be not to affirm? And so I, I, I, I, I defer to the doctors on this one and that doctor is Dr. DeBresau, who I'm a good friend with. She's, she wrote a book on this called The End of Gender. And what they have found scientifically is for people who have gender dysphoria, socially transitioning is the healthiest approach. So that actually works for a lot of people. A lot of people. You have to correctly diagnose gender dysphoria. Sure. But a lot of, a lot of young people who have gender dysphoria also tend to grow out of it. So when you're doing things that are irrevocable, like stopping puberty or, you know, surgeries, that's very different from someone who is socially transitioning and being treated as a female. So, so let's, so let's play this, this mom talking about her regrets with transitioning her. Again, this is like a three, four-year-old boy. Watch. And I feel like I am leaving the cult because that's what it felt like to me. He said to me, mama, this is your fault. You changed my name. So imagine had we not, you know, had we not realized our mistake and you go 10, 20 years into the future. Imagine that mama, this was your fault then. I'm gonna be on that show. This trigonometry. Great guys. Really? Yeah. So I guess my question becomes, if you defer to the doctors, right, the medical doctors, which I, Dr. So is a friend of mine as well. She's been on this program. But I think that it's, it becomes very murky because the doctors, the medical community seems to have been infiltrated by all of this woke ideology. So then it's like, okay, well, I trust the doctors, but which ones? In California, it is against the law for a psychiatrist or psychologist. I forget which term is which to advise a kid who's having gender issues to kind of wait. You have to buy law, affirm their gender dysphoria and push them into this direction. And that is even if that's the case with 95% of the time, let's just steal man their argument. What about that 5% of kids who are just, you know, caught up with whatever it is, or maybe they're subjects of use. There's a million reasons why people might have some kind of temporary gender issue. So it's this kind of thing, how if someone is having psychological issues with their gender overnight, they figure themselves out. And now I know exactly what to do and so on and so forth. That is such sloppy thinking about how the human mind works and the kids are the ones who are going to be paying the price because, and here's the other thing that people don't like talking about, having a trans kid is like hitting the lottery for these live moms. Yeah. So they parade them around on TikTok. Yeah. So there's really an enormous incentive. And again, people don't like talking about this for having that mom to be like, my kid is really, really special because other than this, there's not going to be special, anything special about that ugly dumb kid from that mom. Yeah. And also, Michael, that we were speaking about the psychiatrist, I actually interviewed a Salvadoran mother named Abigail Martinez where the school psychiatrist actually convinced her daughter to start taking puberty blockers and to Southwestern boosters. And her daughter actually ended up going, you know, it was just not good for her men since she actually ended up killing herself committing suicide in the state of California, moved in and took away her daughter from Abigail. And this is someone that like, you know, on the left, they're saying, oh, you know, we're for minorities and stuff. This is an immigrant mom from a Salvador working class. And this happened to her in the state of California, you know, particularly protected by the school. I'm kind of surprised because for El Salvador is going to have a very strong, my understanding Catholic community. So they'll be the first ones to be like, get the behind me Satan when it comes to things like this. But I guess, but it's just a school experience. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Because she is, is they immigrated here and the school's not telling the parents what's going on. And they're getting all of this. That's cool. Putting the blame on the mom. And if you're, you're not okay with this, then we're going to move in and we're going to take her away. We're going to take her away. They put her in a halfway house. Holy crap. And the daughter ended up literally standing in the middle of this train tracks and ended up killing herself. And I'm going to say something else that people aren't going to like. There is virtually zero movement within the Republican Party or conservatism to abolish the government school system. The best that we're looking at is to have school choice. But even school choice, many of these schools are going to be run by corporations and corporations are pushing this even harder than the government is. So I would love to see some movement in this country towards abolishing government schools because that is really the main vector toward pushing this kind of stuff onto the kids. Prishing to the choir on that one. All right, we got to, we got to take a quick break. Want to thank our sponsor Patriot mobile though. So Patriot mobile is America's only conservative wireless provider. We talk about parallel economies all the time. And they're so important right now.

Tout his wins to Congress and the American people. But of course, we know that the state of the union must it's going to have to only be filled with like twists and distortions and you know, blurring of like what's true and what's not. Because I can't imagine that he has much to say that he's done that's been positive for the American people. But he also plans to showcase, you know, the president invites certain people to come in and be guests as part of the whole thing. And one of the guests includes an Austin woman. And so she was 18 weeks pregnant. Her water broke. And the doctors said that they were unable to intervene to help her because they were concerned that providing her the treatment that she needed would violate the Texas abortion ban, which obviously there is a certain like exception made for women's whose lives are in danger. This would have fallen under the exception. But she developed sepsis and you know, they say she continues to suffer from medical complications to this day. And they're calling it, I guess, like this is this is the laws problem and not the the problem of the doctors for turning this into some sort of political grandstanding. I mean, I'm having a tough time understanding how that could possibly be interpreted by the doctors as that. As a Texan, I think I speak on behalf of everyone in our fair republic when the answer that is too bad. This is just clearly a political stunt. I wasn't even listening to what you're talking about because clearly she was just going to put some lady up and let Texas needs to change her laws. And I think Texas has increasingly understood that Washington cannot and will not represent them. The Texas law, even the people who are in favor of it, makes no sense. Because if you were giving her an abortion, I can sue. And even though I'm not a party this at all, I don't have standing. And I talk to a prominent Texas attorney about this. And they're like, well, you have to have standing in federal law, but in state law, you don't. So this is kind of unprecedented. And the point is, I don't care. The point is this is not this state is not for you. Keep your business elsewhere. Can I just make one more point about the state of union? Sure. This is another reason I really hate the Republican Party. If the Republican Party were smart, the person who would be delivering the Republican response to the state of union would be Senator John Federman. Because no matter what he says, it would make the Republicans look great. Am I wrong? There's the best folks than the Republicans have. I'm not sure that he would agree to it, though. They're like, hey, you want to deliver all you gotta do is give them a baby Ruth and he'll be there in the snap. You really it's incredible to me that his people, his staff, keep saying like, no, no, these things are going to get better. It'll get better eventually. Don't worry. Every time he comes out, he would have another stroke that never happened. Right. Right. It's not like being a senator is a stressful job. It's just fake. Virtua. So as soon as the Roe v. wait, this is it even came down. Joe and Joe Biden like went to like Delaware for vacation, Nancy Food to like Italy, but then they'll like fundraise off this issue. I'm actually surprised. They're not like inviting Zelensky or someone from like Ukraine to be the guest. So I mean, it's fake. Virtua. So they know they could get that anger from their voters and some fundraising dollars. But legislative, they really don't even care about this. I mean, you know, they tell us about their action. Do you guys think that it was a net win for them in the midterms that Roe v. way got overturned? I've heard a lot of both sides from conservatives about whether it was a plus for the Democrats or not. I would say it was a net win for the Democrats because I feel like it brought like all those young voters in the college universities, like out to the polls like crazy, especially Gen Z, like they just went out to the polls like crazy. So that's where I would say yeah, for the for them. For me, it's hard to see what else it could have possibly been. But you also look at Texas and it's like, well, if that was the case, and Texas was the one that just passed this horrible ban and women were so upset about it, then why did Beto lose? Yeah, right. Right. Like you would think that if that were the case, that I mean, maybe it's just because it's Texas and that type of thing wouldn't happen here. But it's hard to understand if that were the case, why that didn't happen here, where abortion was so severely restricted. And we're getting so many transplants. And everyone I spoke to whose pro life is like, if that's the cost of overturning around. Oh, for sure. Oh, yeah. Like that. Every day of the week. He too. That's why I'm like, yeah, I'm fine with that fallout. It's just I gravitate towards yes, only because I'm like, I don't know what else could have possibly and I mean, even in Florida too, I mean, the sense is won by such a large gang and they didn't even, I mean, even more Hispanics voted for him. So, yeah, it's interesting. I think that they beto is also just a horrible, horrible candidate. Like that's fair. Beta is like the best person in terms of raising money with getting no return on your investment. Literally. He's a piece of piece. He's got so much money and has nothing to show for it. I think people in republicans, you should be like an angel investor in like, yeah, valley that just raised funds. I like to take a little bit of credit in him. To go take a professor job in like, Chicago. Did he really flee Texas? Yes. He I don't know if he's gone yet, but he yes, he took he took a job as a professor in Chicago. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm like, but bye. You didn't belong here anyway in the first place. Thank you. Okay, so I want to touch on one other thing that's going on right now on the hill where as we're we're just discussing, they don't actually care about any of these things. It's all just all this political grandstanding. There were some congressional hearings today that were getting a little bit heated over immigration. Let's listen to so actually, let's let me show you first, the house oversight tweet that the democrats tweeted earlier this morning before the hearing. They said, good morning and good luck to everyone except GOP oversight members who are using today's hearing to amplify white nationalist conspiracy theories instead of a comprehensive solution to protect our borders and strengthen our immigration system. How disingenuous do you have to be when you are a democrat and you are claiming that you want to work together to protect our border? How disingenuous do you have to be? I'm going to go to you Jorge who spent a ton of time on the border which is left completely wide freaking open and the federal government has given specific instructions to border patrol and all these people to not do anything. In fact, when the Texas National Guard gets their little behinds out there, they are told to stand down. They go and lock a door. The federal government goes back and unlocks it. Like how disingenuous of these people to try to act like they have any intention of protecting our borders at all. And the thing is it's like they want to use the word white nationalist. Let me just remind everyone that lives at the borders like these towns are 80% Latino and they're getting overwhelmed with fentanyl and crime and smugglers. I mean these people are actually and the thing is they're these are people that vote democrat for years. I mean some of these towns have been voting democrat for hundreds of years and they're asking help from Washington DC. When I speak with border patrol one though a conversation that always stood out is an agent told me he said Jorge I'm no longer a border patrol agent. I'm just a noober driver because these guys just cross over illegally. I pick them up take them to a process center. They get released and that's all that's all we do now and the fentanyl is coming into our country. So for me it's it's it's uh No it's the immigrants the one getting the ride. It's like the opposite of uber. The Lord and I say this is an immigrant. I'm assuming for racist reasons you're an immigrant as well or yes yes. But yeah so it's it's just like when you hear the word white nationalists it's like come on man it's it's it's Latino towns are being overrun. They're the ones who feel forgotten about in El Paso I mean literally just like a month and a half ago you had immigrants sleeping on the floors and there's no politicians there to help them out. The Grammys just just passed. We didn't hear lizzo and all these people like do speeches for the migrant children being trafficked so it's just once again it's a I think what they're referring to with white nationalism is this kind of like Schrodinger's cat about the issue about America is going to become a majority minority nation but at the same time like saying that that's going to happen is like it's not going to happen so when they like it it's definitely going to happen to something to look forward to but if someone says wait a minute let's like look at this twice it's like how dare you pretend that that's happening that's not happening so it's this really weird dance that they do about the issue where they can't acknowledge it's going to happen but if they do acknowledge it it's only a good thing. I feel like how it was like I was just reading 251 000 apprehensions I think I was at December I want to say. In one month? Yeah that's why I think how can you not say like no this I mean it might be like the scary part of the apprehension number is that's just that's just the migrants at the cops. The other term is the the godaways and the godaways that seem scary because the Border Patrol is able to detect with technology but they didn't have the manpower to stop and the reason why those people don't want to turn themselves in is because most likely they've already got crimes committed here in the United States. Most of them a lot of sex crimes these guys committed years ago and they're trying to come back to the country. Right but that's racist because when Trump said that there could be rapists and murderers and drug dealers coming across the border everyone called him racist. I mean law enforcement Maryland they literally just arrested a teenager connected to MS 13 he actually killed a 20 year old girl with autism in in Maryland and he was one of those godaways one of the many godaways since Biden and Harris have come in the last report that we got there's been 1.2 million godaways in the country. Yeah incredible. All right let's take another quick break first we want to thank our sponsor Raycon so we have several pairs of Raycons in my house and that is because my whole family was stealing them all the time because they are so great so they're earbuds but they don't have the I'm sorry I don't mean to offend anyone they don't have the dumb stems like why do you need stems in your earbuds it's just going to weigh your ear down and it's going to be more likely to fall out you don't need that okay so you got to try Raycon they've got premium audio quality but you're going to get it at a steal of a price you're not going to have to pay as much as some of those other brands like the stems make you pay and you're still going to be getting that premium audio so you can go to by raycon.com y for 15% off that's buy by raycon.com slash y I have the pink ones I love them but they come in all different flavors so flavors colors so you can go there by raycon.com slash y for by a Norwegian professor who proposed that brain dead women could be used as surrogates for anyone who wishes to avoid the risks and burdens of you know having a baby develop in your womb and Blaze Media.

Head on over to the Blaze.com to see some exciting updates and learn how you can help the fight against big tech censorship. It's really fascinating yeah it's it's like it really struck me as such a crazy bizarre concept um to be happening at a time where you have this movement of women saying my body my choice you know talking about bodily autonomy not when you talk about getting the vaccine and being forced to get that but bodily autonomy when it comes to the issue of whether or not I want to choose to carry a child at the same time that they are you know there's an uproar about that we're having professors propose that brain dead women should just be used as like surrogates like brain dead slaves I guess I mean I don't know it's like it's such a bizarre way other than our college campuses where are they finding so many brain dead women this is an issue is it like the Hillary campaign like maybe that's what they they're gonna take the graduating classes and they're gonna take them into like these harvesting uh I mean I'll defend this in terms of like I am and I hope you guys are two and most people listening are organ donors right and I think that's something that's wonderful so if someone's dying wish is like okay if I die at least maybe I could be a mom I can wrap my head around that how someone want that but in terms of that they're on the they're like in the hospital doo doo doo doo it's like all right let's put a baby in her she'll do as an oven that seems a little crazy to me I mean I do think that it is supposed to be meant as like a donation type thing but it just feels really gross because what if you I don't know I mean you're you're still kept alive so you you're not given the ability to like hey I want you guys to stop using me as like a harvester because you're brain dead but you're still alive so they're and it's so weird I mean if she's brain I mean this might be a dumb question if she's brainer can she breastfeed I mean I don't I don't think she's gonna actually have to not gonna teach you know Salvador we need to build the wall to get him out of here get him out and hurt the good measure at least at least now no one remembers when I read that I don't know can she breastfeed Oh we're door he says I don't want to hear another story about little show I don't want to hear a story about little yimity and the moose to race the most appearance on this show that moose didn't just raise little yimity he put him through medical school they're not gonna be like going to PTA meetings and they're in there and they were like, bad. Your son's doing really great in gym. This is dead lady. What is that? Because breastfeeding, my God. And so is the un-assed question, all right? They are going to be breastfeeding. If they're brain dead, their body's they're probably lactating for no serious medicine. Yeah, that will, that's what I mean. They will likely be able to lactate. But the problem is they're not going to be bonding with that kid. And that mother, that brain dead mother child bonding is the key to having that brain dead surrogate. Well, so that- Historically speaking. So then the question becomes like- The presence came out of Norway. The question becomes brain dead father rights. We've got plenty of those out there. The secret custody from his hospital. So, okay, but Jorge, your- Yeah, try to make sure that- No, no, no, no, but your mistake actually leads to a good question is- Can you save it? If you know, if you can donate your body as a womb for someone else, a surrogate, or a dude, are they then, are the babies actually going to breastfeed from a brain dead woman? Because that's kind of creepy. Like where do you draw the line? I think the whole point of surrogacy is you, the kid gets taken- Just get taken. Well, right, I understand. But if breastfeeding is obviously breast, feed your baby, however is best for you. But obviously, scientifically speaking, nutritionally speaking, breastfeeding is best for the baby. So what if the person who was taking the baby said like, well, I still want the baby to breastfeed? You're really trying to make this work, aren't you? No, I don't want it to work at all. I think it's kind of- These are the times that make sense in any level. It doesn't, it's so weird, but like, how are we talking about this as a society? Who is this doctor, first of all? This guy is something. Anna? Oh, it's a woman, what do you know? It's magic. You know, it's a woman actually, it was like- That means it's a nurse. Anna Smajour, no, and she actually, so she's a professor, but she's a professor of practical philosophy. So she a real doctor? She a Jill Biden doctor. She's a Jill Biden doctor. Okay, okay. Yeah, she's a Jill Biden doctor. This is like a thought experiment. Well, this is a report that was published in the Journal of Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics. So Spinal Here's the real question. This is for head scratch, we put home. Would you rather have the brain dead surrogate or actually have a real woman who will never see the kid again, who she gave birth to? That's true. That's a tough question. That's true. Now, I mean, they do sign up for it, but I can, I could never imagine the psychological trauma that was on with that. And it's one, as a mom, I'm not obviously never had a kid, but like, it's one thing to be like, sign up for it and other things actually give birth and have the kid come out of you. Right. Those are very different things. Right, right, right. No, I totally agree. Yeah, that's actually, that's a great point. That's a great point. I think we just got to give more women lobotomies and that'll solve the fertility issue once and for all in one generation. That'll solve a lot of the question. I'll get my ice pick. We're gonna get Rosemary Kennedy in this whole country. Oh my God. All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back with more. Oh, good. I want to have time for this other stuff. This is my last time on the show. I just thought it was like a new. I'm gonna have time for this. Senator Steve Danes from Montana is, look, he's been banned from Twitter for the very egregious, egregious action of posting a hunting picture on Twitter. Those of you who are watching can see this. Those of you who are listening. This is, I tell me if I'm describing this accurately. It is Steve and his wife and this, I don't even know what this animal is. I had a lot before kind. Yeah, and there's, I don't see any blood, do you? No blood. He's holding up the head, but there's no blood. No guns. It's not gory, there's no guns. There's no puncture wounds that are visible. And yeah, go ahead. Just two happy white people. I mean. But we can't have that. Yeah, you can't. Maybe that's the bad. So this reportedly got him suspended from Twitter. And I believe that they showed that it was like, it went against their sensitive content or violent imagery policy, which. But those tweets don't get in your band. They just have to be behind like a warning. That's what I'm saying. Like what's going on, Elon? Because I thought that you were going to fix a bunch of stuff over there. And you've got Republican senators getting banned for posting a picture of him having fun with his wife. But let's ban all senators of all kinds from Twitter. I think this is the step in the right direction. There you go. Maybe we should start hunting them for sport. I think that would, I'm in favor of this. Not legally, I'm just joking, right? I hope you. He's just joking. You'll okay. He's definitely shouldn't hunt politicians for sport. Just for liberty. Like I was in the New York Times headline, Michael Malice says. But seriously. Sir, get women. Go ahead. OK, I know that you're joking. But it is important that like, let's say, Donald Trump getting banned from Twitter. Like that was a bad move, right? Yes. OK. But we should hear from politicians. Well, I think it's bad even from their perspective. Because if you have a president who, from your perspective, is hates democracy and is fomenting insurrection, is calling people to violence, you really better know what he's saying. Right. Right. Exactly. From their perspective, this guy's dangerous. I want to know what, like if the terrorists are threatening to bomb New York, I want to know about this if I'm a New Yorker. Not like, do, do, do, do, do, do. Right. Right. Yeah. No, I just, OK. Because he jokes all the time. But I just wanted to make sure for clarity purposes, I got your stance on that. OK. But I don't, what do you think of Twitter? Now under Elon Musk? I think it's still going through its changes. And it's still going through its transition period. Elon is getting a lot of those old staff members out. It's those famous pictures of Elon where he's in the Twitter room. It's all liberal white women. And then it's like now it's just like guys and dudes and their and stuff. So I think it's still going through its transition. Now it's just guys and dudes. Guys and dudes. Guys and dudes. There's just dudes, you know? So I think it's going through its, it's, it's, it's. You know, you're a good server but the two genders are guys and dudes. I know I'm like, I don't want the liberal white women all in there. But I, like we could use a little bit more than guys and dudes. I'm just saying. So that's, that's, you know, I think it's still, it's still transitioning. And I think they're trying to find out how to like get this thing profitable. But I think it's, you know, it's still transitioning. And I think they're trying to find out how to like get this thing profitable again. So do you trust Elon? I would say, I don't, I don't trust anyone in that like high power. I think, I mean, you don't trust African Americans. That's what it is. I think the, but Elon buying Twitter was more for the data. I know people want to put him as like a free speech. Absolutely. Like I don't know. But I know for sure he needs the data. That's what's, what's valuable about this. So I think there's two great things that he's done on Twitter. One is to stop having corporate journalists be protected class. Before there were all these steps to keep them from getting ratio. For those people who don't know if a post has more replies than likes, that means it's a bad post, a good sign. And journalists with their Adjut prop were constantly getting crapped on on Twitter and it was delightful. And they were taking steps to kind of hide likes or hide comments. And that was taken away. So that's one useful thing. Second of all, there's now a feature on Twitter when when someone spouts one of their lies, readers can comment and provide context. And very often with something is just completely egregious. And I think that's why they immediately under it will be like well this photo is actually from this this and this so that you know this person is not only being disenj, is incorrect, but they're being disingenuous about it. Yeah. So those two major steps to my direction. Wasn't there one that corrected Joe Biden not that long ago? Oh, is that right? Yeah. It was actually, it was like a White House tweet. Yeah. It was like, it was about the economy. Yeah. They had to like, they had to like fat check the white. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was I know. And that was when I was like, okay, we could use more of this. Yes. Yes. I would totally love that. But I, I don't trust Elon at all. That's not all great. Any African American. Right there. I want to hit another story really quickly. So we talked recently. I'm not sure if you guys had heard this, the Disney Plus. Obviously, they're going fully woke. But they just had a cartoon that is trying to teach children about reparations and that slaves built this country. And we demand reparations and all of that. So going completely woke. Oh, but at the same time, they have just recently cut an episode of The Simpsons from the Disney Plus streaming platform in Hong Kong that references forced labor camps in China. The problem with slavery from Disney's perspective is that when it's against the wrong race. There it is. Right. I mean, really. Are they going to suffer enough financial consequences to course correct? Because sometimes it doesn't feel like it. Especially when I hear people, I hear families who are on our side, are aligned with all of this. And they're like, yeah, we're taking our kids to Disney. And I'm like, Sarah, here's why. Why? I'm going to give people some bad news in the audience. I'm not joking at all. If Disney suffers some financial consequences of enough parents being like screw you, I'm not working with this company, they're going to get on the phone with Mitch McConnell in two seconds and they're going to get a bailout. Same thing with the airplanes. Same thing with every other. The newspapers in Canada, they're heavily subsidized now by the government. Whatever company you're dealing with, if they are getting hit because of the nonsense they're putting, they have a phone into Washington from both parties to make sure they're taken care of. I thought your book was called The White Pill. It is. And the answer is to not look to Washington for answers. And it will never be the source of solutions for this country. It will only be a problem. Well, because if Washington was out of the picture, then you would agree that financial consequences would be a noce to OK. Yeah, because I'm just like, guys, what are we doing? Why are you still supporting this company? We need to give them enough that they, but now Michael has just so many. Am I wrong, though? And we watched a minute of that programming yesterday. It was a proud family. They're doing the reparation stuff. If you're going to make that episode, make it and be critical of the politicians sending over $100 million billion to Ukraine. I think Americans would rather give that to black Americans any day than us shipping it to some other foreign country. Yeah, I mean, I'd rather just keep my taxpayer money. I was money. I was born Ukraine, so frankly, I'd like a little bit of the reparations money to Ukraine. No. All right, let's go ahead and let's take a quick break. We'll be right back. Little late there. Better late than never. OK. Yeah. Yeah. All right, we only got a couple minutes left here. Let's cover something fun. We talked about the Grammys the other night. Of course, the satanic rituals being performed right there in front of everyone's eyes. But what we didn't talk about was something that everyone is talking about on Twitter, which is Ben Affleck apparently hating his life and being miserable. And I think I might know why. Let's play this interaction between J.Lo and Ben. She snaps at him. He's like, OK, sorry. And he really looks completely dead inside. Do you think that Hollywood still has his soul? I'm not sure. I don't know. He looks very uncomfortable. I'm speaking to two men who are unmarried. And I feel like Ben Affleck is not selling the marriage thing. As someone who's unmarried, I'm positive I can speak for you. I don't care about Ben Affleck in any way, ever. Can you just have fun with us, Michael? I mean, I hope for the best for him. Or if we don't like him, I hope bad things happen to him. Do you care about Ben Affleck at all? No, no. I don't know who really who he is since Goodwill Hunting and the one way he robbed the bank. Yeah, so I'm going to be like that. And all of the story is, when you live in Hollywood for this long, you're clearly dead inside. Well, you were dead inside before. I think you feel like some of them go as hopeful that they're going to have to. You don't think Ben Affleck's been dead inside for a long time? I mean, probably. I mean, you try to think they start out that. I'm sorry, though. You try to be best friends with Matt Damon, and you try being chipper in the morning. Yeah, yeah. Are you kidding? Ben Affleck was almost like every guy when their girlfriend takes some shopping. He just hated his life. So at least he was a little bit related. All right. OK, all right. All right, Michael, tell everyone where they can get your book. Whitepillbook.com. Whitepillbook.com is where you can go. Show us a cover, Michael. Come on. Here you go. Tell them why they should buy it. They should buy it because this is why we're going to win. And the other important thing is I am currently being Mike Pompeo in audiobook sales. So thank you to the listeners. Wow. Take that, you filthy spook. I love it. We'll make sure that you pick up Michael's book and make sure that you tune in tonight as we roast Joe Biden in our state of the Union, roast it's going to be myself. Cut Prather, Stupor Geer, Glenn, and Alex Stein. So literally anything could happen when he's involved. We will see you there."
