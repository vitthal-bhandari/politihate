    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome everybody into the clay Travis and bucksxton show on this Tuesday Thanks so much for rolling with us for joining in we've got so much to discuss Kamala Harris with I don't know if it is the most Kamala Harris moment we've seen yet, but it is definitely a memorable one About the passage of time Remember this is somebody who was supposed to fix the border. Maybe fix Ukraine Hasn't really fixed very much at all the the katangi brown Jackson hearings are Underweight right now senators questioning the Supreme Court nominee up on Capitol Hill Clay, and I'll give you our sense of how that's going where that's going any big takeaways from will be joined About the second hour of the program today Bottom the hour by our friend Shannon Bream chief legal analyst at chief legal correspondent over at Fox News And we will also talk a bit more about the situation in Ukraine right now. There are two battlefield narratives Or two battlefield assessments that seem to be in conflict one is that Russia has stalled out and there could even be the usage of chemical and biological weapons by the Russians Biden has brought this up I mean this is not fringe conversation because Russia has stalled out on the other side It's people pointing out that the Ukrainians should sue for peace and negotiate as soon and as earnestly as possible because a breakout for them against the Russian invasion is Effectively militarily impossible absent major military intervention from the outside meaning us and NATO which doesn't seem like that's going to happen hopefully so Got a lot of that to talk you about but we had mentioned in passing The last few days, I think this Yale law school free speech event That has started to get more and more attention as people I think realize the full extent of what occurred here and and it's indicative of a much bigger trend something that should concern and worry all of you across the country because of what it means for Who wields power not just in the apparatus as a general sense, but the legal apparatus of this country So this is a piece up on the Daily Mail law schools are in crisis The truth doesn't matter much the game is to sing signal ones virtue Yale law school professor who tackled woke mob at free speech event Says the future of the rule of law in the US is in crisis. Let me say She's telling you the truth The law schools have gone ultra woke They are churning out activists and they don't change their minds when they graduate from law school They become prosecutors. They become partners at big powerful firms They become the people that make the determinations within the legal apparatus Clay you went to law school you understand the progression of this over time It is remarkable to talk to attorneys today who will say it's not that the left-wing Law school and now post law school, you know in associates at firms all the way up to now more senior lawyers and prosecutors It's not that they disagree just on political issues They get outraged by the notion that everyone's entitled to a defense that you have the right to remain silent no matter How bad of a right-wing person you may be maybe you're part of the insurrection. This is madness Yeah, it is and for people who haven't seen the viral videos of The Yale Law School free speech event being shouted down by Yale Law Students it's terrifying Because it's one thing when and I don't want to say uneducated but youthful and dumb 18 and 19 year old kids college kids which a lot of us have been at some point in time get fired up and Decide that they're going to speak out against someone who is on campus. I don't agree with that in any way But by the time you get to law school by the time you are 22 or older and certainly as you are studying the law which I was fortunate enough to be able to do at Vanderbilt Law School It's shocking to me to even think From the time when I was in law school in the early 2000s. I graduated from law school in 2004 That at any point while I was on Vanderbilt's campus There could have ever been a speaker who was shouted down no matter what that speaker was discussing is is unfathomable to me that it could have ever occurred and When I read and see what is going on in law school communities now and also inside a big law firms buck This is a big deal that I don't think is discussed enough There are companies that are so woke now buck that they are saying not Give me the best lawyers to represent this company For purposes of legal representation but they're saying give me a set quota of Minority lawyers to work on my legal issues something I've never heard of before The idea that you wouldn't pick the best lawyers inside of the best firm But the you would say the people who work on this have to be cosmetically diverse It's crazy and the idea that we have allowed This belief and I mean faculty too. There are so many faculty buck. There was a big story recently about the inward ends you remember this story inside of I think it was Yale Law School as well that a professor had read the inward in a court case and it had turned into a Massive issue that you would even utter it's inside of a proceeding right the factual analysis of a case so their expectation is to change the court record of what was said because it offends all this is read Yeah, the examples that we give of okay, and by the way This is why I say this notion of banning a word for some people in all usage is wrong Yeah, we all abide by this unfortunately because in society you get destroyed But it's wrong meaning that there are words you should not use to refer to people But there's always a context in which a word being said could be Justifiable for example reading back in testimony in a court What a person said the court's stenographer is not a bad person for reading back what was said But this is about ultimate control control of your mind and Control of your actions obviously as well and the reason I think the Yale Law School thing is so interesting I mean Clay well knows this because he went to a very esteemed law school by the way Hey, but he's on yeah, but Yale Law School is the number one law school in the country I mean if you get into Yale Law School our buddy geopolitical strategist Elbridge Colby was a friend of mine from the DC days He's a Yale Law guy is super smart. You got a Yale Law everyone supposed to essentially Genuflect at your legal altar these places are churning out woke maniacs and I just I want people to understand across the country the woke maniacs don't change they go from They they take their little Yale Law School golden ticket to the top of the legal profession They clerk for federal judges. They become federal judges. They become prosecutors They become the top partners at law firms that I mean just to remind everybody Donald Trump the sitting president of the United States had a tough time getting legal counsel for the fake Russia collusion Bull crap that they pulled against him because people didn't want to be ostracized They didn't want to yeah, they didn't want to be untouchable the legal profession clay I knew of other people working in that White House who didn't have a lot of money didn't have a lot of and it was tough for them to get The lawyers that they wanted because nobody wanted to be associated with think of this a lawyer Who doesn't want to be associated with giving the proper defense to White House employees of a sitting president? This is what the woke legal madness has done and props of Barry Weiss for dealing with this inner sub stack and having people Write about it and do it so well No doubt and and I'm old school in the sense that I think the ACLU should defend all speech right not just speech that They find to be acceptable in any given day To me John Adams when he was defending the British redcoats Who had fired at the Boston massacre up on the colonists is what a lawyer should aspire to? The best possible defense buck I've said this before on the show, but I've defended murders I've defended people accused of domestic violence. I've defended drug dealers in my young days as a lawyer That's not because I agree with what they have been accused of but because to me a lawyer has a zealous duty to defend to their utmost ability even Even people and even in situations where you would personally not be on the same side morally as the people you're defending and so this idea that has taken root in in law schools of The basically the woke universe taking over the legal profession, but look at the ACLU It's it's a great example of an organization that in the 1970s was willing to defend neo-Nazis who were marching in Skokie, Illinois There are a lot of Holocaust survivors there not because certainly they respected the opinions of the Nazis in any way But because they valued our first amendment and our legal system more than they did the heinous beliefs that were Being defended that day. That's what lawyers should do stand up for principle over politics and instead politics is overwhelming principle now We are watching right now. We are witnessing and of course it's this is the in the background of We have this Supreme Court nomination hearing underway right now and the senators are asking their questions You and I both believe Clay and there's been polling just because most the GOP doesn't even really care because they figure it's either Gonna be Katanji Brown Jackson or another left-wing activist So what difference does it really make she'll get through and so this is why we're not spending to we'll spend some time on the Conversation today, but in the background of this we are witnessing in this country And if you speak to me clay you you know about this you've seen this friends of yours who are lawyers I have I have friends and family who are lawyers as well the transformation the last 20 years where the left has gone from seeing What is a system of justice through our law to a system of power and the wielding of power? This is why there are banned it in core principles like the right to a defense for everybody This just played out in the previous administration under Donald Trump. Do you think it also might have played out folks? I ask you this question for anyone says all this sounds like law school insidery stuff How many judges wouldn't take any of the election? Would even look at the election challenges that Trump and his lawyers are bringing through them out right away Wouldn't even bring them into court now. Maybe some were legit. Maybe some weren't Do you think it might make some impact on this when you have people coming out of law schools particularly elite law schools who are effectively? Insane leftists who believe that their goal is not a justice system in this country But writing the wrongs in a Marxist sense of the past by having a disparate system of justice Today, I mean, I think that that really does matter and and here's a quote that that I think nails this home play in the daily home A daily mail piece Partners are being blindsided by associates who think they are liberals in their own image, but they're not according to a Lawyer in Washington DC the associates want to burn the place down Yep, that's what I'm hearing from people all across the country And for any of you who have ever had to go to court for any of you who face the justice system for any of you who think that your vote Is supposed to count even though there are all these activist organizations the corruption of the legal system by the left wholesale and the usage of Law schools as indoctrination centers to do it is a major problem. This is like the deep state But it's the deep legal state. I'll give you an example Buck. My wife is in law school right now I was in law school 20 years ago. She experienced what law school was like 20 years ago compares it to now It's a it's a time warp. It's crazy how different the overall vibe is And not just because by the way, I do think this factors in because it dehumanizes much the last two years lawyers Have had to wear law school students have had to wear masks think about how crazy that is Buck if you are too Well right now, so they call first year of 1L 2L 3L takes three years to graduate if you're a 2L right now You're coming up on the end of your second year of law school. You're entire law school training You have been forced to wear a mask everywhere in class you've been restricted in how much you can travel and I think that's only going to accelerate the insanity because it dehumanizes so much and makes everything It is just going to I this is an underrated story I was my jaw dropped when I saw that protest at Yale Law School smartest lawyers in the country But they study law at Yale one reason people love to go there. They don't give grades. That's how cocky they are Well, this is why they've also changed the admission standards dramatically by the way So that it's really hard for some people to get in and a lot easier for other people to get in and they don't want Those disparities to be apparent over the three years of law school as they are in other places Back 50 years ago. They did the pass fail system, which is why I was like man. I'd love to go to Yale They can get away with you know because there's not the same Oh, yeah ranking in the so they can change their admission standards such that it doesn't doesn't affect The perception of a man or a maid woman no matter what if you get in there? I think Stanford also does pass fail which which is pretty incredible But that's that's unheard of to be that exclusive where you don't even have to rank any of your students You're all supposed to be that elite Nearly a third of us suffer from chronic pain because of aging or exercise or over exertion This means that at this moment hundreds of thousands of you in this audience are experiencing pain We have a solution for you and it's likely a name you've heard us make mention of for good reason It works created by doctors and perfected over 15 years of scientific research Relief factor was made for these circumstances with four key ingredients relief factor is a 100% drug-free product Which addresses joint pain knee hip back neck and shoulder pain hundreds of thousands of people have ordered relief factor and nearly 70% of them go on to order more if you're currently in pain and have a 7 and 10 chance to eliminate it Those are pretty good odds join them more than half a million people today order the three-week quick start for only 1995 go to relief factor calm or call 800 for relief to get the 1995 three-week quick start relief factor calm or call 800 the number four relief factor A new world order Joe Biden says The phrase that gets people's attention. Welcome back to clay and bucks show We've got a lot of Challenges here at home you could even say and I think you should Failures under the Biden regime up to this point the border inflation economy crime in cities Find me a major policy area where there's been decision-making energy energy fossil fuel regulations and market intrusions by Biden and his team All this stuff that you've seen has been bad, but they really like to focus now on global leadership They're trying to re-establish. I think Joe Biden as the steady hand on the world stage that we were promised that we've never actually seen this is the remarkable thing Joe Biden has spent Longer than I've been alive. I think in public office and never once you've said wow he really led on that issue you know that that important treaty got signed because of Senator or vice president or now president Joe But he's saying there's gonna be a new world order now and I want to talk about what that will look like we are an inflection point I believe in the world economy not just the world economy in the world occurs every three or four generations as One of them as the one of the top military people said in a secure meeting the other day 60 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946 and Since then we established a liberal world order and that hadn't happened in a long while a lot of people died But nowhere near the chaos and now is the time when things are shifting We're gonna there gonna be a new world order out there and we've got to lead it We've got a unite the rest of the free world and doing it. I think Clay He's writing that there's a shift underway. I think unfortunately His administration is playing a role in it in a bad way away from a sense of American leadership and America as the best last freest hope of mankind and toward China Russia Non-aligned states that are finding ways to exploit Weaknesses notably recently the fact that we are more reliant than we should be on Foreign energy sources, but on a whole range of ways and factors it feels like a Biden led New world order is one in which Putin and she and others are getting a bigger piece of the pot Yeah, and One of the big challenges that we've got is When we grew up buck there was a universal enemy in some way beating the Russians was something that was in the back of your mind if you were growing up in the 70s the 80s the 60s any of those eras you really had the sense of America as a force for good in the world We talked about start to show off the protests that's going on at Yale Law School what unites all of these woke ideologies buck and I don't think we spend enough time talking about this is the idea that America is evil and was founded on evil grounds and that as a result our Progress does not matter because at inception we were founded upon a great evil Which is slavery and so if there is no moral authority in America then you tear down and denigrate the institutions of America and What many of these woke Embossils are not sophisticated enough to understand is you have to compare American ideology with ideologies around the world right now China is doing and committing genocide on its own people right now and that's why to me the window of The world showing up in Beijing Buck we bent the knee to China after they lied about COVID After they created COVID in a lab in my opinion based on all of the evidence and the whole world Every democratic country us Canada England Australia All these places that are supposed to be standing for the betterment of human rights around the world All showed up in bint the knee at Beijing for the winter olympics and said virtually zero Nobody did about China's obligations and responsibilities in the world. Do you think that some of the? Emotional validation that it seems many in the West notably here in this country seek with their fervent support of the Ukrainian cause and the righteousness of it and the flagpins and the Zalensky is you know Abraham Lincoln George Washington and Pericles wrapped into one whatever. Do you think some of that is in reaction to? For those who at least pay attention to these things the underlying recognition that China is engaged in human rights crimes and atrocities on a regular basis China's undermining the United States China's a totalitarian state and we were basically all clapping during the Olympics while the Chinese Communist Party was saying yeah, you guys will bend the knee You know what I mean? Do you think that it's it's almost like a compensation? We're so anti-pooten in some cases in some places here because we've already sort of said well I mean she come on I really like those cheap products I get from China and I don't want to cause any problems Well, I think that's a good point and that raises the question of the precedent that's being set with Russia I mean I asked this question Buck on the show after the state of the Union with Joe Biden when we saw all the Politicians with Ukrainian lapel flags that they were wearing at the state of the Union How many people would wear Taiwan lapel flags if China invaded Taiwan? Would we isolate China's global economy businesses like we have been able to do with Russia? I severely doubt it. I mean buck you and I are both fans of Top Gun the movie You know they took the Taiwan flag off of Mavericks jacket in Top Gun 2 to avoid offending the Chinese they changed in the remake of red dawn They changed the country that invades America from China to North Korea Because they wanted to avoid offending China. There are no Asian bad guys There are no Asian villains in any Hollywood films now because China has got all of Hollywood by the throat And that's a metaphor of the larger control that China exerts upon American business Everywhere well, this is also why would people get all mobilized as? And very preachy on countries that they're outraged about you know, they're human human rights abuses look It's it's if you're right you're right But you also need to be consistent or need to be aware of inconsistencies and the fact the matter is we are because the elites in this country Make so much money from and from China and need in their minds access to the Chinese market We have very different we have a Relativism if you will of human rights standards And remind me talk about Saudi Arabia We could talk about a lot of places with whom we do business but there are the there are the good guys and the bad guys in our minds and You know, I think that the discussion around Ukraine and around Russia has fallen into this a simplistic narrative that is not particularly helpful to the moment which is First and foremost about how we get the bullets and the bombs to to stop right? I mean, how do we get people to be safe and then we could figure out what the new world order as Biden says may be But I don't think it's helpful to us to think that there's a a simple a simple storyline here And if only we all rallied to one side or the other in just our words and and the way that we sort of promote Individual brands on social I mean us. I mean everybody right everyone's like, oh, I stand I stand with Ukraine Okay, but what does that mean? Yeah, and how do we bring this whole thing to a conclusion? And and I think there's also been a I do believe there's been a transfer of the mass mobilization mentality from I listen to Fauci I obey, you know, I obey the elites I do whatever I'm told with COVID to Anything Ukraine needs we should do Ukraine Ukraine. This is the most important thing. There are a lot of people and that's why I found that Study or they a poll out of Canada so interesting where there's a direct correlation I mean the basically the more shots you get the more involved you want as a Canadian the military to be there I am certain if there was a poll like it in America, it would be the same result The the crazy thing buck is Emotion governs everything most people don't take the time and and the wild thing is remember initially when social media Kind of took off buck the idea was while this is going to be the full Flourishment of the First Amendment how quickly does social media demand consensus? And if you step outside of the lines of consensus, I'm not sure there's ever been any American media Entities that have enforced consensus more than social media companies. There was a guy I think the book is called the net delusion. I read it many many years ago and his point was that that this notion And again, I'm going back now I think 15 years so I might be but I think the net delusion was the name of the book and the notion was that we believe that the internet Is going to create this free flow of information that liberates all mankind in terms of speech and the dissemination of knowledge and there is some truth to that There's also truth to we have entered the panopticon, which is the it's a prison where you're being watched at all times I mean we are we have seen and China is obviously pioneering this the usage of the technology that was supposed to free us all and allow us to communicate Instantaneously and does at some levels being turned now increasingly into tools of suppression tools of control of constant surveillance And of and let's be honest of power as we're seeing from the social media companies in this country who are telling us You know bend the knee say a man is a woman peasant or else Or else I'm gonna build on that next because we got more suspensions on Twitter over that exact situation Oh my the most unexpected repair bills often happen when you're visiting your car mechanics something You don't know or realize has happened to your vehicle and the next thing you know You're paying a fifteen hundred dollar bill for something you can't even make sense of it happens with cars particularly the newer ones that have all those electronics So having a protection plan that covers those expense expenses is a no-brainer.

There was a monster article on him in CNBC over the weekend About the potential that he may end up losing his job. He hasn't been a Disney very long over this story and I think there are a couple of angles that are worthy of contemplation here one the majority of the American public agrees with the per top part of the bill dealing with kindergarten to third grade over whether you should be teaching sexuality of any nature in public schools to kids they agree that that doesn't make sense a pretty substantial majority But also secondary part to this I Find it troubling that Disney which is a corporation primarily I know it's not exclusively but primarily designed for families and for kids is so obsessed with This particular aspect of the bill that there are Disney employees walking out chanting say gay say gay When the entire basis of their protest is unfounded from a kindergarten to third grade perspective, right? I mean, I'm a kid. I'm sure you were although. I don't know to the extent I grew up buck My family we would go to Disney World that was the vacations we would take and it's wild We would stay at Fort wilderness, which is the campground at Disney and we would stay oftentimes in campers Unair condition no bathroom. We would stay in a camper my sister and I and my parents and we would go to Disney World And we would watch Disney movies while we were at Fort wilderness and all these things I take my family regularly have to Disney World as well my three boys the idea that this children's to a large extent entertainment corporation is Taking the stand that they are against ronda santis and the state of Florida is Frankly disgusting to me. I used to get dragged out to the boundary waters clay where I was told to carry canoes for a Portage of up to a mile sometimes as like a 12 year old and then had to clean Waters, I don't even know what this is really oh the boundary waters is northern Minnesota It stretches into Canada the critical National Park area. I don't think I'm gonna leave Eli Minnesota I believe is how you say it we used to go there like a kids camp No, this is like real deal camping like like catch what you are catch what you did. I did not do that Yes, you did it you portage. You've never done a portage Happy you got to carry your canoe in your back over land to go from one leg to another. I've ever had to do that No, it's it's rough stuff. Let me tell but it was good, you know, it puts them I mean, you know put some hair on on my chest. I guess I don't know I mean, I wish I was a Disney world. I think is what I'm really figuring out here But look I think that the Disney wokeness thing would be fascinating again I'm always trying to draw these these I guess sociological comparisons or try to look at the data I of the people that are walking out saying or saying gay because of the say gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay Yeah, I bet none of them have read the bill not a single one of them I would I would I would are I wish I could be there right now I do one of those man on the street things Where I'd say okay So have you read the bill and I've just asked them the most straightforward questions about what I bet They don't even know the name of it start with that and then I think if you also press them a little bit You'd find that they believe in double-masking they think Fauci is great And if we have to go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine, that's fine because these are people who believe what they are told By the Democrat apparatus. That's what you would see Overwhelmingly But you know I'm in the process because my kids are gonna be down in Orlando in Early May and we were talking about potentially taking them that they're doing a competition. They are taking him to Disney as well I Looked up some of the rates at Disney hotels and my jaw dropped I Cannot believe what they are charging and what they are getting now I think a lot of people didn't travel for a couple of years and so they've saved up But I am stunned, you know for a family of four to go to Disney World You're talking about easily spending 15 or 20 thousand dollars if you are staying at a Disney property right now I mean we're talking about thousand dollar and night hotel rooms that are just kind of okay hotel It's like you're staying at you know the four seasons because by the way I've looked up the rate at the four seasons Do you know what the top this is this blew me away buck? What is per night the four seasons Disney World? Rate right now at the high end per night. What do you think family? I've got five so I have to fit you know like everybody into a room I got three boys and my wife. What do you think the top rate? This is a Disney property resort the four seasons What do you think they cost tonight? Disney four seasons a night a one like a sweet. What are we talking about? It's got it's got to have big enough room to fit five people right? It's not really a sweet But it's bigger than like a standard room right? It's got to pull out couch and like a couple of beds I'm saved by the bell because our friend Shannon Bream from Fox News just called in here We'll come back to this though when we return. We'll discuss more. I'll tell you more about about real deal camping, mr Travis. I'm actually curious about real deal camping. Shannon. Did you grow up going to Disney World at all when you were a kid? Oh Heck yeah, in fact we I was born in Sanford right outside of Orlando Yeah, mom went to Disney World when she was pregnant with me where they did like a private preview for residents who lived in the area So I've been going since in utero one of my favorite places. Oh, it is a fabulous place. What do you think then? Well, well, we'll come back the answer. I'll give you the answer in the next segment. That's called a tease Katanji Brown Jackson you you are there right now watching this hearing Comparing contrast it with the Brett Kavanaugh hearing please. Oh my goodness He was a totally different world for many reasons first of all the public the general public is not allowed in the capital right now in Into these hearings that makes any enormous oh, yeah, because When they were allowed in some of them would come with things, you know Hidden under their shirts or their hats they would jump up and have posters and they would yell I mean you guys if you remember from the very opening statement by then chairman grassley He was interrupted numerous times and we thought oh my goodness This is not gonna be a normal confirmation hearing and it was very jarring in the beginning because it happened so consistently in the capital police bless their hearts These are fantastic men and women. They were just taking out protester after protester after protester It was just a constant stream to the point where about like the third day They were yelling and jumping up and no one even flinched. I mean it had gotten so ridiculous that people just kept talking This is a totally different Situation here it is much more common respect ball and I think a lot of that is because the public's not allowed in Is there any drama at all about whether or not she's going to be confirmed in your mind? I Don't think so simply because the Democrats have the boats that they all stick together and I imagine they will and probably get a couple Republicans too So we're looking at this through the lens of you know the GOP trying to score points for the midterm I think a lot of it is about that this argument that judge Jackson is soft on crime Or that you're gonna be really progressive. I think it's more about kind of Trying to to paint the Democrats with a certain philosophy in a far left philosophy More than it is about the actual vote on her Shannon Spock, I gotta say I think that one of the big differences between What was I mean what what their goal was with Kavanaugh versus what any kind of goal would be here Was that the Democrats believe that if they could if they could scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination they would get a a more Moderate which would mean more Democrat leaning and decisions justice to replace him right that effectively the GOP would have been scared Trump would have said fine will give you Merrick Garland or somebody like that instead at least that was their plan Is it fair to say that if it wasn't katanji Brown Jackson and I've said I think she'll get four or five GOP votes in addition to all the Democrat votes But if it wasn't her it would be somebody who has a similar judicial philosophy, right? I mean there's no there's no chance that the demo the Senate Democrats in the judiciary committee I'm sorry that there's no chance that Biden rather would put someone forward who wouldn't be along the lines a of a leftist And an activist on the court is that am I misreading this? Well, yeah, listen He's definitely going to choose as a president somebody that he feels would would rule in the way and share the philosophy that he has about The law and interpreting the law and interpreting the Constitution and statutes and the text and all that kind of thing But I gotta tell you that there is some reaction from the far left That's not thrilled about what they're hearing from her answers today because she's saying things like here's what I do I try to be neutral I go read the text and I go back and look to the original people who wrote the text what did they mean at the time? They wrote it that doesn't sound like a super far left progressive, you know situation where I'm gonna just the constitution is living and breathing I'm an interpreter. She specifically said I would not interpret statutes of the Constitution based on my own personal policy preferences Or the policy preferences of the day So she's saying all the things that you would need to say to get Republican votes But there's someone the the left feeling like Wait a minute. We wish president Biden had actually gone further left She sounds a little bit too mainstream or reasonable compared to what we thought we were gonna get Shannon she said or that she was asked during Questioning about saying that George Bush W. Bush. I believe was a war criminal and said oh I didn't intend to offend him did that register any significant impact in your mind You know when I was actually out of the room when that happened But as the as the hearing just restarted with with senator Dick Durbin Who's the Democrat who runs the chairman of the committee? He just he was bringing in some materials saying that he wanted to give context to what she had said So I think that you're probably gonna hear more about that this afternoon and she's she's gonna want to after that quick break She's gonna want to readdress that I think and and give people a more definitive answer on that Outstanding stuff as always Shannon. We appreciate you making time. No, you got to watch all that hearing And we look forward to watching you on Fox News as well Can I ask a question? I want to know how books bracket is doing? Oh, that is a fantastic question Who did you pay by the way Shannon Liberty wasn't in it so You guys had the fantastic uniform reveal I know the best uniform reveal ever. Yes, Sheldon will tell you my husband You know that when I have to make a decision about sports a lot of times I go to the quote costume. Yes Shannon, I'll just tell you this mr. Mr. Fancy sports Notal man Travis's top pick is already out in my own Villanova. What's the mascot clay wildcat? Thank you my own Villanova wildcats that I love so much are still in it Shannon. So there you go He may end up beating me. He may end up beating me Shannon. So it is a is a mess by the way Well, I'll I'll text you the answer on this for on this cost for Disney overnight stay, but I'll tell everybody else and we come back Thanks so much Shannon that is Shannon bereaved us fantastic work as the kataji Brown Jackson Continues with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing you notice something in our country too many people no longer identify themselves as Americans first But instead identify themselves by race class or sex there was a time all Americans related to one another that we were all part of a great Democratic experience a melting pot of cultures diverse backgrounds It was the premise of the entire melting pot of citizens both new and old I'm talking about citizens and citizenship if we lose that we don't have a country as it's been imagined for nearly 250 years That's why Hillsdale college is trying to make sure that everybody gets educated about our history And that's why they're offering a free course on American citizenship to help you learn about what's happening and why courses taught by Victor Davis Hanson he's a doctor of history who will equip you to help restore our country with this information You can sign up for free at clay and buck for Hillsdale.com You'll learn about topics like the history of citizenship the deep state and even the great reset Please sign up today to take Hillsdale's free course at clay and buck for Hillsdale.com. That's clay and buck for Hillsdale Third hour already upon us here on the clay Travis and bucks X and show. Thank you all for joining Thanks for rolling with if you've stuck with us the whole time appreciate that in particular Obviously if you missed any part of the conversation that we've been having today the podcast on the iHeart app the clay and buck Show is a great place to go put up hour by hour please do check us out there and Clay, you know, we we've been talking a lot about the transgender swimmer issue Because a transgender swimmer just won the NCAA 500 meter woman's freestyle Championship and there are some women who are very rightly Upset about this because it affected their ability to compete at the NCAA finals at all which for some women would be a crowning achievement to You know spending what 12 maybe 15 years of their lives in the pool training training trying to get faster I mean to be at that level as a swimmer is a remarkable achievement for women and that was taken from some of them Well, we do have some in this country in elected office. We're willing to say Something about this. They are not going to stand silent on it Here is ronda Santas put out a statement today by allowing men To compete notice he used the term men. He doesn't say biologically gendered previously described males He says by allowing men to compete in women's sports. The NCAA is destroying opportunities for women making a mockery of its championships and perpetuating a fraud in Florida. We reject these lies and Recognize Sarasota's Emma Wyatt as the best women swimmer in the 500 meter freestyle Clay you've said it. I've said it's absolutely true Emma Wyatt is for all intents and purposes a gold medal winner number one for women in the NCAA 500 meter freestyle and DeSantis even spoke out on this today play it the NCAA is basically taking efforts to destroy women's athletics They're trying to undermine the integrity of the competition and they're crowning somebody else The woman's champion and we think that's wrong and so in Florida I'm gonna be later today because this is a Floridian who I think deserves to be recognized You know, we're gonna be doing a proclamation Saying that Emma is the best female swimmer in the 500 meter freestyle Because she earned that and we need to stop allowing organizations like the NCAA to perpetuate frauds on the public He's I think he's totally correct totally right man This is an example of How to fight back? I mean it really is now This is not something that is but you and I have been fighting on this a lot Outkick has been aggressively covering this story and in fact we had an article up over the weekend congratulating Emma Wyatt who I believe is from the University of Virginia swim team and would have been the 500 meter women's champion but for the inclusion of a transgender swimmer and so I Get I didn't know she was from Florida credit to Ron DeSantis and his staff because I think that gives a Like a no-brainer Effect to the decision they're making Because it is a Florida native who was deprived of a 500 meter I think it's meters sometimes I screw that up but the 500 she would have won and I will by the way is Twitter gonna ban Ron DeSantis for having this opinion They might I mean I never know that Twitter is trying to defend this this lea Thomas story They may well suspend Ron DeSantis's Twitter account for proclaiming that this 500 this other girl would have won or this girl would have won the 500 meter and This is the kind of battle that we're in right now where the party Ostensibly of science buck. Let's emphasize this the same people who are lecturing all of us through dr Fauci you don't believe in science when we say hey you shouldn't wear masks or when we point out That many people who are double vaxxed and boosted Ie Jin Saki who just announced that she had tested positive for COVID again Many people who are double vaxxed and boosted are still testing positive the party of science in quotation marks is Refusing to acknowledge biology and by the way this swimmer still has male genitalia Sorry if there's kids out there, but walking around in a women's locker room when you still have By you're still biologically male and you're competing against then just think about take it outside of transgender issues buck What would happen? I? Coach little league sports if I showed up for our 11 year old baseball team and I had a 16 year old with me and I tried to play that 16 year old in 11 year old boys baseball Everyone every parent at that field would reject what I was trying to do because in athletics we try to have people compete against other people like them ages are Paramount high schools. We have different sizes boxing. We have different weight classes All of these things are designed to increase overall competition But can you imagine if I just showed up with a bunch of 16 year olds? They would kick the crap out of the 11 year olds because they're older bigger stronger faster I mean what would happen if the 16 year old says why identify as a living everybody would say that's absolutely absurd and And the absurdity of this is in in many ways I think becoming more and more apparent to people the arguments in favor of this are rooted in the negation of reality and mob madness and such that even some Democrats in Fox. I know clay played this over the weekend of Video of three women who are protesting the Leah Thomas Swimming quote victory at the women's championships. Here's what these women all claim to be lifelong Democrats said I was historically liberal. I mean, I'm a walk away Democrat. I am a lifelong registered Democrat who ultimately feels politically homeless I would say I'm politically homeless now because I don't think the Democrats care about women and girls the Democrats are not even Acknowledging women as a sex class now now men can have babies men need abortion It's no longer even a women's issue. I cannot be a part of this party anymore That doesn't even recognize my sex class. I know a lot of historically liberal people especially parents who have Felt like they needed to walk away from the Democratic Party and I don't know who they're gonna be voting for in the new It's saying next elections Welcome to reality and welcome welcome to voting for Republicans It's just a question of time because if you insist on living in reality You're not going to be able to pass or you're not gonna be able to vote in good conscience for these leftist lunes of the Democrat party And I mean clay at some level you bring this up with the the existence of Leah Thomas's male genitalia and the changing on a regular basis in front of In front of women You know you think about you know In decent exposure for example right if you walk up to somebody who does not want to see that part of you And you get arrested you get arrested for this right because we have some understanding that this is this is in a front to a person's dignity to have to see this Although these days in New York City I mean, you know, there's all kinds of stuff going on and seems feels like nobody gets arrested for anything here anymore But in general you can be arrested for this there's been I think all along an Exploitation by the left of conservative kindness and courtesy This is how they've gotten it even to this point. Oh, come on. It's a be nice to everybody be inclusive Just use the just use the preferred pronoun. This is just about being nice to people Why won't you be nice to people? Always in the context of whoever the trans individual is deserves your kindness and simply by all all people including trans people deserve our kindness Sympathy and decency what they leave out of the conversation though is what about the women in the locker room? How is it kind to them? How is it kind and courteous to tell a woman who's been swimming her entire? You know life that she can basically remember Sorry, you don't get to have your peak athletic experience. You don't get that gold medal that you earned You don't get to be even the NCAA finals which you earned. That's that's Discurious, that's unkind, but they don't even talk about it. That's why women who are actually they think they're feminists are realizing Hold on a second. The wires are crossed here. There's something going on. Well, and this is why also the entire concept of inclusivity is in many ways a lie Because the very inclusion of Lee at Thomas is Excluding women from being able to compete at the highest level. So when we talk about inclusion We're also talking about exclusion Excluding women who otherwise would be able to perform at the highest level. I believe this one woman swimmer give her credit from Virginia Tech spoke out and said Lee at Thomas a man swimming against women cost me the opportunity to compete for a championship and this amaliant that Rhonda Santis is giving the proclamation for would have otherwise won and let me say this to buck that all those women We just played discussing how they feel politically homeless There are a lot of people listening to us right now. I guarantee you who don't identify necessarily as conservative who don't identify necessarily as Republican They identify as team sanity They want for America to be sane again, and I know Donald Trump ran on make America great. I think 2022 and 2024 make America sane again is Actually something that appeals to a huge number of otherwise democratic voters to a lot of suburban women that went against the Democrat went against the Republicans in 2020 and we want you to be listening to us we are a Voice for sanity in an insane world and I don't take that lightly because I know we have an Incredible privilege on this show buck you and I get to come on for better or worse And I know sometimes you don't agree with everything that we say but for better or worse we have the privilege every single day for three hours of saying exactly what we think and fighting back against the voices and rising tide of insanity in this country and I know that a huge number of you out there listening to us right now feel voiceless and feel as if you are surrounded by that insanity and you come to us for three hours every day and We try to do our best to make sense of the world and we welcome all of you Regardless of how you may have voted in the past because I really do think there's a new lineup that is occurring in American Politics and it's not necessarily in my opinion Democrat versus Republican It's saying versus insane and the Democratic Party is on the side of insanity and awful. I mean I think the party's kind of a line on You know saying versus insane these days This is what we are seeing and we could go through and do go through I think a lot of the ways in which that plays out through policy Jen Psaki I by the way, I don't think it's a story when anybody has COVID anymore But this one is kind of funny because she's gonna be fine first of all She's gonna be fine. We wish her a few recovery. Yes, right? And she'll be you know She'll be sipping tea for a cuz I had it you had it she'll be sipping tea for 24 to 48 hours And she'll be you know back on the on the soul cycle In you know three days probably anyway But it's funny because you have to if you're a lib you have to sing that are required to in a second The second you get COVID we all know you must say something and we'll actually play that for you.
