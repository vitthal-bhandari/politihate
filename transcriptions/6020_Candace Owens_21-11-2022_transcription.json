    "text": " Happy Monday everybody. I just did a nice long relaxing weekend with my husband in London we did a long weekend there and it was amazing It just feels good to get out of America wasn't following the news cycle. It was nice We even left the kids behind we felt like we were kids again. It was a wonderful and then I touched down Back in Tennessee I turned my phone on and the first thing that I saw was a graphic that said that I have blood on my hands That I can't a so-and have blood on my hands. So the question of the day today is What did I do to have blood on my hands again? Yeah, you're gonna want to hear about that plus San Francisco launches guaranteed income programs for trans gendered people and the application provides for over 130 gender sexuality and pronoun options and encourages and rollies to check all that apply Yep, sounds about right for San Francisco all that and more today on can of sounds So I'm guessing you guys know this but the way that geo targeting works is that wherever you are you are targeted with News and information regarding your surroundings So yes, I got on a plane and went to London with my husband just so we could enjoy ourselves for a couple of days We haven't done that obviously now. We have two kids It's been busy and it was the most relaxing weekend ever honestly just a perfect weekend But of course while I was in London I was getting news pertaining to whatever goes on in the UK even when you open your Twitter account It works according to their trends nearby trends in the area So I was completely ignorant of everything that happened in America for the last four days And it was wonderful. It actually really allowed me to relax So again the plan to come back about a nine hour flight from London to Nashville I opened my phone and I turn it on and I go to Instagram and I'm not even kidding I see this graphic and I am tagged in it from about a hundred people have tagged me in this graphic and it reads You have blood on your hands and the graphic is a photo of me Matt Walsh. He actually looks great Ben Shapiro Marjorie Taylor green Laura in Ingram Lauren Beaubert from Colorado and Tucker Carlson So I the first thing I did was I laughed because I just thought okay, what did I do? These are these are my friends. I guess why why what could all of us have done together to put blood on our hand is such a Also, just funny because it's a ridiculous statement. You have blown your hand It's just like I'm tired of people saying that give me something with a little more thought you have blood on your hands And also it reminded me and then I said to myself I shouldn't laugh reminded me of that time where similarly I happened to be in London and I got a message from somebody saying that you need to respond to this and it was a trend that was happening My name on Twitter as it always is saying that I had blood on my hands for if you guys remember this the Christ Church mosque shooting that took place in New Zealand I remember waking up and seeing a message and just going this is the most insane thing I've ever seen I tweeted something like LOL What and then the news cycle went crazy and it said kennus Owens laughs at the Christ Church shooting of course I wasn't laughing at the shooting it's horrific, but it took place in New Zealand. It happened at a mosque I live in America. I don't even talk about Muslims or mosques. It was just ridiculous that people were actually trying to attach me To this horrible tragedy all the way in New Zealand And of course there are reasons for wanting to attach me to it was because there was allegedly a manifesto and this manifesto This insane individual put my name They also used Spyro of the dragon which is a child's cartoon Spyro of the dragon as a source of inspiration And this psychopath also included Nelson Mandela as a source of inspiration Why not because we inspired him of because he's a psychopath and of course we should not be adding legitimacy to a psychopath's claims That didn't stop the news people Nope that didn't stop at the journalists who just hate kennus Owens and want her to go away and thought this was a way to do it in fact it culminated Into a moment months later when I was testifying on the hill Regarding the rise of white supremacy and of course the Democrats had called three white people to testify on the rise of white supremacy Republicans had called me up and This woman she of course had a PhD because that's what happens You go to school for a long time and then you can't think anymore Actually use the Christ church mass shooting and tried to insult me and say that I laughed at the massacre You guys remember that her name was dr. Kathy Baloo and here's the moment I Just have to say that I object strenuously to your use of the worst hilarious To me this feels a lot like your reaction to being named and one of these manifestos now You're of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document But I do think that laughing at it is a real problem Because these are real families that are impacted by this violence And I think our efforts towards talking about this have to start from a place of mutual respect Which is what I've heard from from this side of the table now the reason we don't have those numbers I want those numbers as much as you do But the number to say the numbers don't show something is simply not supported by the data You know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing black America and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is Attempt to make the election all about race as the Democrats not in my case It's my care is rise my motive mr. Chairman. It's my time. Yeah, it's my time. You've got your time, Mr Minas every more sec Every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what I meant when I said hilarious And you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to Republicans to our president and to conservatives Which you tried to manipulate what I said to fit your narrative, okay? I was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious I said it's hilarious and we are sitting in this room today And I've got two doctors and a missus and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess How big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be So you can manipulate and the audacity of you to bring up the Christ church shooting manifest Oh and make it seem as if I laughed at people that were slaughtered by a homicidal maniac maniac is in my opinion Absolutely despicable and I think that we should be above that To try to assign reality or any meaning to a homicide a homicidal maniac riding a manifesto Which by the way let the record show also stated spiral of the dragon the child's cartoon as a source of inspiration He also cited Nelson Mandela as a source of information I don't think I don't think that Nelson Mandela has inspired mosque shootings You can correct me if you think I'm wrong you are you would rather assign meaning to a homicidal maniac Then to actually address that I said to the things that I said today that are actually harming black America number one father absence Number two the education system and the literacy rate illegal immigration ranks high abortion ranks high white supremacy and white Nationalism if I had to make a list again of 100 things would not be on it This hearing in my opinion is a farce and it is ironic that you're sitting here And you're having three Caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are do I know my expertise are? Black in America. I've been black in America my whole life all 30 years And I can tell you that you guys have done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle and it needs to stop So there you have it Dr. Kathy Baloo f2 round and found out very quickly I had no time for that no time for a woman who had no argument She had no statistics on white supremacy She just kept talking about how she felt because she's an expert on white supremacy. She went to school She has a dog, right? She has a PhD. I'm a doctor on white supremacy Whatever that means trying to sell to us that black people are at risk and she can't actually win on data In fact, so she turns around and goes back to this moment of a Christ church shooting in New Zealand At a mosque which I of course had nothing to do with and tries to extract emotion that way Oh, you laughed out of this no I didn't I didn't laugh at that I laughed at the absurdity But this is what the left does when tragedy takes place the absurdity of trying to connect a tragedy To the thoughts of conservatives sometimes overseas So of course I see this graphic right when I land right saying that I have blood on my hands It reminds me of that situation. I'm thinking what I've possibly done while I was in London with my husband What did I do with Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson and I actually had to search for it as I said What does this even come from what they were talking about of course? Was that recently you guys are probably following the story a gun man 22 year old gun man Filled five people and injured 25 others at an LGBTQ nightclub the club is called Club Q in Colorado Springs just before midnight on Saturday again. I had missed that and So the left saw this and decided that the proper way to respond to it was to say that Conservatives who have not supported the transgendered movement because we shouldn't right because absolutely should not support Giving puberty blockers to children because we're moral because we understand that ruining a child's body is satanic, right? But it's our fault that this tragedy happened because if only we had gotten on board with parents Encouraging children to remove their genital parts if only we had gotten on board with gender mutilization If only we had gotten on board with the side effects of drugs like Lupron that are being used to suppress puberty side effects that give young boys Micropenises when they get older right that render these children Sexually dysfunctional for the rest of their lives decisions that are being made by their parents not the children right ideas that are being Seated in the classroom by teachers who are going along with this dangerous ideology if only we had gotten on board with that Then a homicide on maniac would not have walked into Club Q in Colorado Springs to shop a bunch of people But that's actually what they were trying to sell to us. It's so sick and so twisted You almost can't even respond to it. It's so insane basically the argument that they're making is If only you guys would allow mental illness to prevail then mental illness wouldn't happen Because obviously this individual who shot this club is a mentally ill individual and by the way There is no signs as of today and right now there are no signs This was motivated by his hatred of LGBTQ people in fact more signs point to the fact that he is just a crazy person For example, he was recently arrested in June of 2021 after a woman reported that her son Had a threatened her with a homemade bomb Multiple weapons and ammunition according to the press release from El Paso County Sheriff's Office So that individual we eventually shot up a club was already Arrested because he had threatened his mother with a homemade bomb and multiple weapons ammunition in 2021 okay, but that's not relevant of course I'm assuming that he didn't do is because his mother was lesbian or trans or gay probably because he's insane because he's a maniac and He should have of course been monitored because it takes an insane individual to threaten to blow up their own mom But no the left never misses an opportunity to score some points against the right Even if those points are not being scored because we stand by our assessment that we need to protect children and what's happening to them In terms of the spread of the transgender agenda is wrong and of course Nancy Pelosi never misses an opportunity To try to dunk on conservatives and miss and she released a statement yesterday in honor of Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm just going to read you some parts of her statements She said as our nation marks transgender day of remembrance the House Democratic caucus mourns the countless Americans stolen away by a scourge of transphobic Violence a crisis that continues to disproportionately harm trans people of color that seems completely fictitious She went on and said that fight remains more urgent than ever as right-wing extremist target transgender Americans most fundamental rights and freedoms whether spouting dangerous rhetoric from cable news desks or openly bullying school children from the halls of power Magna Republicans are cruelly undermining the safety and well-being of our transgender community Corrified by such shameless bigotry house Democrats are proud to march alongside our Trans friends neighbors and siblings as we work to uphold justice and dignity for all Should on to say heartbroken for so many beautiful souls murdered by hate and guided by relentless activities across the country Let us renew our resolve to build the future that our children deserve I Can't even I don't have the words to describe how positively twisted and maniacal that statement is I don't have the word describe it the idea That you are trying to sell to people that if only we had harmed more children Right if only the Magna Republicans could just get over this need to protect children's innocence If only you would allow us perverted and sick individuals To teach children that they can rinse themselves of their gender that they can just become somebody else If they agree to have a bunch of cosmetic procedures, right? If they agree to mutilate their own body if only Magna Republicans would allow this this shooting wouldn't have happened Trans-gender people would be safer. She says safer. We know that's fact factually incorrect Because we know that the suicide rates of transgender individuals go up after they transition not before that's a lie They keep telling us right it's but it's because they're struggling and they don't know their identity if only you allow them Trisha's and they'll be happier. They'll be free or no once a happening is they Don't know what they're doing because of the society and sick twisted individuals like Nancy Pelosi that are encouraging them to go down a very Dark path that they cannot turn around from and they go through with procedures and they realize that far from what they were taught in classrooms These procedures are not reversible whatsoever. Of course. You're going to have lifelong effects. You cannot just skip puberty It's on a YouTube video You don't just press pause on your puberty and think that everything is going to be fine afterwards and when they are met with that Reality when they are met and faced with the reality that actually they were abused these children are being abused by adults Who are allowing them to form these demented thoughts that are encouraging the demented thoughts of children people that we should fight to protect Every day of our lives Then they become suicidal Then they say I don't want to live anymore because I'm never going to have a life that is full I'm never going to be able to have a normal natural family because I was lied to as a child That's what's happening and the idea that you think we're going to shut up about that that you would stand behind dead Innocent people in order to further your sick causes Again, I have no words. You guys are monsters. That's all I have to say about that All right, it's no secret that inflation continues to be a plague on our economy our families and our savings What's more irresponsible Democrats spending continues to exacerbate the problem now is not the time to be Overleveraged in the stock market or let your savings whether away How'd you get some place in with gold from birch gold today with almost 20 years of experience converting IRAs and 401ks into precious metals Birch gold can help you too and listen to this if you text Candice to 989898 Birch gold will send you a free gold bar with any purchase by December 22nd But you have to claim your offer by Black Friday Don't have a lefty value your savings text Candice to 989898 and birch gold will send you a free info Okay, on how you can own physical gold and silver in a tax sheltered retirement account plus when you place your order of Body summer 22nd birch gold will send you a free gold bar. So text Candice to 9898 and Secure your future with gold. Okay. Now it's time for some topics to do All right, so close your eyes and imagine that you live in San Francisco I'm just kidding. Don't do that. That would be a nightmare. It's Monday. Don't just do that. That's a bad activity I'm sorry that I even imply that you should do that But if you are some individuals that are still clinging on that maybe San Francisco is going to turn around You shouldn't do that you should pick up your stuff that you should leave and start your life somewhere else because they are just I Don't know. I don't know what they're doing. I don't even know what they're experimenting with anymore But they have now launched a guaranteed income program for transgender people It's amazing how much effort is being made for transgender individuals I showed you guys my BLM documentary the greatest lie ever sold that so much money is being funnels to support these transgendered projects Namely also trying to experiment with building the first ever transgendered neighborhood in San Francisco So that is a fact and now they have decided that they are they they just have to give them money just for being Transgendered so the guaranteed income program application provides for over 130 gender sexuality and pronoun options and It encourages enrollees to check all that implied because you might not just be one you could be 20 of them The program is gift. It's called gift guaranteed income for transgender people and it will provide 55 economically Economically marginalized transgendered people who have a monthly income of less than $600 with $1,200 per month for a year and a half Imagine that so some of the pronoun options on the application include ZZM ZIS Fae fair fairs and Tae turturs Tae turturs So if you are a tait turturs or a Tae or turturs You can go on to this and you could you could fill out this application And yes, it is being done by the transgender district and they want to help you out there I give you $1,200 a month and my favorite option of all the gender options by the way I didn't even know if this was a gender, but there's one that's called gender F gender and that is an identity of gender that is that you basically I'm gonna try explain to you. So you're a gender if You like the idea of playing with gender cues to purposely confuse Stereotypical gender expressions usually through clothing. So I don't know. Maybe that means like I don't know Harry Styles I guess would be considered a gender and that's an actual real option So if he wants to receive $1 a month in San Francisco He has to tick that box and say I like to just wear dresses sometimes and play with gender cues to purposely Confuse stereotypes and gender expression Of course, I also have two spirits which I just do not care to figure out what that means And you can also choose between sexual orientations like BDSM and kink again Where is money coming to fund the transgender district and which is producing these applications? It came from BLM. This is where the money went Well, a ton of money went to the transgender district who are now sponsoring this application Process. So if you really cared about police shootings against black men, I hope you equally care about the zeezer zims Taiturturs The taiturturs that is what is happening All right guys Another story and this was really breaking news It was the first thing that I heard when I was coming back from london Trump is back on twitter. This is amazing I was so happy to learn about this that elan musk has reinstated donald trump's twitter account namely because Uh, donald trump never tweeted anything violent It is just a made-up narrative people pretended that he tweeted on january 6 march to the capitol and burn it It never happened right they just decided to shut down his twitter account and his facebook account on january 6 Because I guess just him existing encourages violence and it just begged a question What is freedom of speech? How are you penalizing somebody for something that did not happen on your platform at all? What what is the process here? There was no process an elan musk understood this and he reinstated donald trump's account He also reinstated which I am equally maybe even more excited about project baritas You know, we are good friends with james james o' keef over at project baritas. They are doing real investigative journalism The government hates them because they are investigating the government They pointed out the lies that were being told during the covid scammers They pointed out the lies of the vaccine manufacturers and their ideas that this faction is totally safe and effective and because of that They have been banned from the twitter platform again never inside any violence They just incited people to take a look at their own government and realize that crimes are being committed And that wasn't allowed under a jack dorsey twitter, I guess elan musk re-instated them and predictably People had meltdown about this in fact The best part is that this came about because elan musted a poll and said to trump be reinstated and the majority of people Felt that he should be reinstated. I think it was 54 percent of people said yes to it and sam harris as just one person who was having a meltdown over this tweeted this in response He tweeted elan musk If you do bring him back you shouldn't please have a terms of service that covers the deliberate Spreading of dangerous lies and then apply it He will be off again within a week But the deliberate spreading of dangerous lies is just spoken like an absolute leftist And he wasn't done because then trump obviously got reinstated and sam harris said this He said the prevailing opinion among quote unquote free speech absolutist appears to be that this platform in order to become healthy Must helplessly publish The malicious lies of any maniac at scale regardless of the consequences Good luck with that such a pretentious feat from sam harris. Why do I like sam harris? Well a little story if you want to go back in a time machine to 2020 I think it was 2020 when the cold covid stuff happened. I instantly knew it was a scam I instantly knew the government was lying I was the most vocal outspoken person with the platform against the covid lie And I tweeted I don't know what it was I tweeted but sam harris hit back I said that well, I said eventually we're gonna realize i'm paraphrasing myself here that covid was a lie And sam harris tweeted back and said your tweets are going to get people killed and then dave rubin who's a mutual friend of us both reached out to me and said please just get on the phone with sam harris he's a good guy I don't want you know two of my friends worrying, you know, he tried to play switchelyn in this And so I honored my friend with dave rubin by getting on the phone with sam harris and I will never forget the conversation He calls me up and he sounded like he was in a bunker He sounded actually like he had taken his children and his wife down into a bunker With whatever was needed to survive and he said to me you don't understand They've used the fact that of course what they always do what these academics know absolutely nothing but what they read in books They do do they do not possess Critical thinking skills at all and he said I know doctors and physicians over in Italy This thing is gonna hit america in two weeks. There's gonna be gurnies on the street There's gonna be gurnies on the street because there's gonna be no room in the hospital You don't understand this thing is real. He was speaking to me like the bubonic plague was about to hit america And I was just very calm and respectful. I was in the car on my way to an event. Obviously. I was not walking myself at home I was in texas. My husband was next to me and I was just making faces like oh this guy sounds a little cray cray He has definitely sipping the cool aid and I just said okay Thank you and they start running rattling off some statistics and trying to under make me understand how by His work because he's got a degree from stanford university. How could some heroes be wrong? And of course hung up the phone said to my husband he's completely out of his mind Crazy that man is not coming out from under that bunker for months to speak And I went inside didn't event shook everybody's hand and did not get covid until years after that And I survived it never had a vaccine everything turns out I was right some Harris was wrong But it I Sam Harris type universe I would have had my account suspended for spreading malicious lies because how could I possibly know anything? When the experts and the academics are telling us the opposite they read books guys They understand the data. They own the science, right? That's the whole point. You spend enough time in school You become an idiot. I say it every time he's got a pht from stanford Which lets me know that he is somebody that believes in his own magic, right? He believes that he's super educated as his leftist tend to be i'm a journalist So I I am a responsible purveyor of information. So this in journalist don't understand We should tell you what's right and what's wrong? And in a world where you disallowed other opinions and by the way, my expert It was kind of like what I said when I was on the hill I said my extra was being black in america my expert teas on the covid stuff was experience I was going and I was doing my events still. I was shaking hands. I wasn't wearing a mask I had my family over nobody was dying using anecdotal experience to debunk the idea I mean six feet apart. I mean how completely asinine was that Works, it's it's why we should have open communication and we should say I understand what the experts are saying But here's what I am seeing and experiencing in my life. Oh, okay. I have covid and it felt like So a very light cold guys, but no, no, no, no They wanted you believe that it was a bibonic plague They wanted us all to get on our knees to close our businesses to impoverished our families and sam harris By that very metric should have been taken off of twitter because he spread that dangerous and malicious Misinformation makes me happy that these people who were broken by trump's existence are still unhappy and upset and here You know what sam you could just leave twitter. That's an option if it's so dangerous Why don't you just get off of it? How about that?

You know, I love her now. I just i'm leaning into her victimhood. I think it's great. I love her I think her podcast where she talks about how she's a victim every day is amazing And I think it's amazing now. She's even winning awards for being a victim I think that's what we need more of in society more victimhood and tears And even if you're a princess and you're dripping in saudi arabian diamonds on your wedding day You too can be a victim and that is what I have learned from megan marco Well now parenteria megan marco are going to receive a prestigious Human rights award for calling out the structural racism within the royal household now You're wondering what structure or racism that was basically megan restructured racism to be anytime She didn't get what she wanted it was racism. So like right now i'm megan marco and i'm like, hey I want a hundred thousand dollar raise daily wire and they're like, hey, no I just go racism that was structural racism after they wire because I was told no And so that's why i learned from megan marco and that's why i'm really happy that she is receiving this award It's the robert f Kennedy human rights award because of her courage to stand up within the royal institution and call out that racism kerry kennedy is the president of robert f kennedy's human rights center and non-profit that gives out an array of awards to individuals for their transformative work in the pursuit of a more just and peaceful world La, blah, blah everything's kidney garden.

Let's jump right in first and foremost We had a comment from holly and she says hi can as I absolutely enjoy watching your videos I'm a muslim living in the west and just wanted to let you know that sharia law Isn't as gruesome as the media portrays firstly sharia law is a comprehensive code of living for muslims that upholds universally accepted Ethical behavior for example giving charity respecting your parents being kind to your neighbor etc And also prohibits traditionally recognized in moral behavior such as adultery Usery alcohol consumption Robbery murder of innocent people and much more furthermore of a law provides guidance for daily life for daily life pardon Such as what is permissible to eat how to eat how to pray The part of sharia law that gains most attention are the punishment laws which are undoubtedly severe but for Reasons as your friend explained the severity deters people from committing the crime and is comparable to the death sentence So she's saying that comment because I covered the Remurgence of sharia law in afghanistan and I just shared with you guys Again, not offensive sharia law whatsoever that I did know that there were muslim people who don't think it's that bad And that there are people that say that it actually creates a more peaceful society At the opposite would be san francisco where there's no rules and so what's worth a society that's more dangerous or society That punishes their criminals more harshly again. That was just fodder for people to think through Without taking a stance on it and we do need to stop however believing that because we are in america We understand entirely how other people should feel about the societies that they live in the laws that they abide their lives by We have I just think we have to stop doing that in the west There just seems to be this arrogance and going well everyone wants us to march it and free them And that's not always a circumstance and people are happy living in the way that they live And I knew this because I knew someone who was excited about their burka Excited that they were going to one day be able to wear a burka as the sign of honor For her father and her husband and so it just makes me realize that We don't know everything in the west even though I very much appreciate the way that we live our lives out here So more food for thought Another comment regarding zalinski. You know I did a couple of monologues with him last week because I don't like him Julia d writes I'm polish and it effing breaks my heart when I see what zalinski is doing We have so many Ukrainian refugees in polan now they get so much money from our government They act like the biggest a-holes They think that they can have everything they want and they actually get it polan is a poor country and now it's even poorer Polish people don't even get a third of what Ukrainian people get Zalinski is destroying my country together with our crappy president and corrupt government Thank you can is for telling the truth. I'm a huge fan of yours You are the only person that from the beginning knew what was happening Everyone called me a Russian troll only because I knew what was happening I hope this bs finally ends, but we all know that it won't there you go speaking of other takes from people inside of countries We just assume that every person in poland is on board and wants Ukrainian refugees into their country and is buying the western narrative that zalinski needs more money and more aid and that they should just Open up their countries to a bunch of people that are fleeing and that's not the case people's live shipping impacted and yeah There have been a few stories about some Ukrainian refugees but I think most notably that story of the woman who moved into somebody's house in the uk And then very quickly began sleeping with that woman's husband and she tore apart a marriage and she was a Ukrainian refugee I mean you could only imagine what that woman is going through She reads some articles Ukrainian refugees need your help And she opens her house to a Ukrainian refugee and the Ukrainian refugee begins to sleep with her husband and break up her marriage Now of course, I do not mean to suggest that Ukrainian refugees are all bad people and they're Sticking their hands out. That's completely wrong and fictitious and but there is a a nuance the situation Where we should be allowed to have a more informed discussion Of course polishes shouldn't should not be called russian trolls for saying that their lives are being negatively impacted By the refugee crisis That's happening over their borders and so again I'm all about just hearing everybody side and things and I really don't like when they're censorship And we're being told that this is the only narrative that we must accept which it seems Has been the case in terms of Ukrainian russia Next comment is regarding kc Anthony Don says i'm not saying kc Anthony is or is not guilty I can make note that years ago. I saw video footage of her and her parents on a jailhouse call And was very triggered by their dynamic and the way they interacted In someone who has had a lifetime experience of a narcissist family dynamic emotional abuse physical abuse manipulation Minimization dismissiveness gaslighting same a few and back then Their dynamic kicked me in the gut. I have nothing more than that to go on But it left me questioning if the parents are hiding their abusive nature They shaped kc for how she has developed and that there's more to the story I have learned to trust my gut since getting out of the brainwashing of the narcissistic family cult something is off I do not doubt that kc Anthony came from an abusive household abusive household There are tons of them I did not doubt that her parents are not wonderful human beings I wouldn't doubt any part of that if that was a presentation But I also feel in my soul that kc Anthony waiting 30 some days to call the police when her child was missing Is all we need to know about that particular case now these are two different things There are people that like to explore what you know Motivate someone do something horrible and drastic and to kill somebody right and people who like netflix did in terms of jeffrey dama i want you to understand the mind of a serial killer And there probably is some tale that leaves people to be crazy There always is and it usually does come from within their own households But it still does not in my opinion make kc Anthony and innocent individual And we will never really know what happened and I guess I have to say that she is legally innocent But my gut is just that she potentially got away with murder The next comment Is regarding the thread that we brought to the forefront about people that are detransitioning and calling the trans community occult Well, people are correct Toro 190 right yep I just left the cult and throughout the kool-aid was half transitioning for two years and honestly I was lazy as hell. I didn't even come up with pronouns and barely even told anyone except my doctor Then when I was like, nah, this isn't for me. I like being male I got so much backlash from trans people the gays and straits have been very supportive in my choices and understand that it's a whole Con job. Yeah, of course because the trans community if people if gay people and lesbian people Were smart they would kick that perverse narrative right out of the club. They would kick it out We're talking about child abuse is it's not about sexual desires This is about people that are experimenting on children and creating franken children is what's really going on And of course it will take time for people to stare that in the face and call that demon what it is and call that satanic ritual What it is and it's why it's important for me to use my platform to do just that but you don't want to be on that side You are not going to be want to be on the side of standing with transitioning children When that hammer drops because that hammer is in fact going to drop Do you owe back taxes to the irs?
