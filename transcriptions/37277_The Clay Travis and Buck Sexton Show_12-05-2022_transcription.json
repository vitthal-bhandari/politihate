It's just I had never said foot in the place I've always wanted to go I actually have some friends from new york that have moved there permanently and and love it It's one of those rare places where new yorkers Sometimes we'll say that you know they found their their forever home and uh and they like it better Some of them sometimes and I asked everybody as you know for and I got all these great recommendations And now i've even got the official Social media accounts of different restaurants and things time to go check it out So it's fun to have the reach that we do clay on this show But there are also a whole lot of people who are writing make sure you bring a bulletproof vest Make sure you go armed Watch out keep your head on a swivel and i'm sitting here first of all i'm from new york city Okay, it's not it's i'm not coming from uh, uh, you know eastern Montana where there hasn't been a homicide in 20 years or something like this is this is a uh, i'm a guy who works for the NYPD i'll be all right But it is it is uh frustrating because the crime situation in the in the country right now in major cities is bad Uh, it has gotten a lot worse and we should look at why and we should look at why going into this midterm election before we dive into What what do you what do you think the primary reason is why do why am I being told? that I need to Go armed. I need to go strapped. Yeah into chicago 900 Shootings plus actually it's a little over 900 shootings over a hundred of those dead It's not even halfway into the year the city only has two and a half million people and this is playing out In different ways in new york in phoenix in l.a. In portland and you know in name name a city in in ladda All over the place miami actually does not have a huge increase in homicides the last couple years something else that i looked up recently Clay we got to fix this So how does the country fix this? What we need to do it's it's a good question and i was looking uh reading the wall street journal yesterday And for gun murders We hit a high that went all the way back to 1994 in 2020 and if you look at the graphics uh of uh of annual deaths by homicide per 100 000 people It's sky rocketed in 2020 and the numbers have gone up pretty substantially since 2016 What happened blm all right. I mean this this is the truth Yes, it's an inconvenient truth that a lot of left wingers Don't want to acknowledge that lots of people who consider themselves quote-unquote mainstream Journalists that aren't allied with either position Buck the data does not lie with the rise of the blm movement Thousands of otherwise would be still alive today uh black people who were to a large extent being protected by police officers who are white black asian and Hispanic have been kept from doing their job and the murder rate and the shooting rate as sky rocketed and you can't argue against this anymore Right. What did they say for a long time? Oh, it's because of the pandemic But when you actually looked at the data in 2020 The the covid numbers were way down because people were staying home in march in april and may These murder rates sky rocketed starting with the george floyd protests and they have continued to sky rocket all over the country new records Unfortunately being set for murders in many different communities Lots of cities where people are listening to us right now buck And they still try to argue a variety of different things. I saw somebody the other day. They say well This is one of the cost of inflation I was like what one of the cost of inflation is a rising murder rate I I don't know that I buy into this at all and uh, and they're looking for any possible Explanation other than the one that is staring us right in the face Which is when you demonize police officers people pay with their lives who would otherwise have been protected by those police officers and there's a part of me that just feels Frustration um and you know, we're we're americans We have pride in our in our country and in our major cities And it's it's sad to me when i'm when i'm going to a major city I know we've got chicago and we're listening now and I understand some of this as people just being a little provocative but the chicago does have a Reputation now because of all the shootings that are happening there and the democrat who runs the city The mayor laurie lightfoot and the democrats who run all these other cities are failing And the corporations that spent millions and millions over a hundred million dollars Bending the knee and begging forgiveness of the blm movement should know that their money It's not only that they did not help that the blm movement failed to help the blm movement Made things worse And and that has to we have to have I know they don't want to have this argument that I wanted this debate But clay instead of us just relying on the narrative. I can turn to or rather a battle of narratives I can turn to this excellent. We like we got to get berry wice on the show. This is fantastic work Yeah, uh on her sub stack she she has a a guest writer. She often does zach kriegman I cradola. I criticized blm. This is zach kriegman's piece I criticized blm then I was fired and as I was reading this This is one of the reasons I sent it to you. This guy clay is the roiters chief Data scientist now winners it provides the newsfeed that a lot of other news organizations Relay on as their news ticker and so the the narrative power of roiters and the associated press Even exceeds what you may have from some of the better known Uh, you know the the other media entities out there, right? Yes But I was thinking about you because this guy He's not one of us in terms of his ideology. It's not a conservative But he's looking at the numbers and he's looking at what blm is saying is happening And what is really happening? And he crunched all the data and I just to cut to the chase here You know what he found out? That in a use of force situation where there could be any discussion about a police officer using lethal force White Americans were more likely to be shot than black Americans in similar Situations and circumstance his data findings aligned almost exactly with professor frier at harvard You've brought this study up before who also found that white Americans in a use of force situation with police are more likely To be shot now we could discuss why that is in perception Clay, what do you what do you think happens when he puts that finding on the internal chat board of roiters? It's not acceptable because it it it conflicts with the narrative let's start there And there are going to be oftentimes there's lots of people listening to us who would think about this inside of their company Even when you're sharing raw data Even when you are just sharing what the data shows You are in danger of being called racist, right? And most people are fearful of doing this. I've said it before book and it prepares repeating Over half of all murders in america are committed by black men Black men represent around six or seven percent of the united states population So you are talking this is facts. It's not racism. This is direct factual evidence Over half of all murders are committed by around six or seven percent of the population even smaller than that Honestly, because most murders are committed by men and we sometimes have fun with this data, right? in terms of Sex because if you were to say oh the police are overwhelmingly sexist because they only arrest men by and large for violent crimes Why aren't women being arrested in proportion to their population? Well, people would say well men are more violent So police are having to interact with them more So if you tried to make a sexism argument there people laugh at you Why can't you look at the raw data and say police by and large are responding to violent criminals? a 88 year old Hispanic woman is probably not going to end up in a violent interaction with a police officer a 16 year old white kid might right because age and sex Factor into a large degree in terms of the overall criminal population But you can't talk about that in some of these woke corporations So tell us what happened to this guy who looked at the numbers shared the factual data inside of roighters Which is ostensibly we should say a neutral news organization. It's not like we're talking about msnbc, right? Supposed to just be just the facts. Yeah, or the water's imposed. Yes, roiders are supposed to be the gold standard of Journalism as journalism is meant to be and of course if you believe that you know, I got a bridge to sell you in the middle of nowhere But this is what happened he got fed to the diversity and inclusion HR machinery. Yeah, and as I've said before you you hunt for red october you've seen it right great. Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah The first person that shawn connery when he's rameous takes out is the political commissar because this was a real practice in the soviet union There were people whether it was on the factory floor or in the front line of a military unit Their only job was to monitor the conversations and the political fealty of other people than the soviet union Essentially you better say the communist party is great and our leadership is amazing Or you're going to end up in the gulag straight up in a different context With different severity but similar mentality diversity and inclusion HR departments are kind of like the commissars They're there to make sure you say what you're supposed to say or you get fired. This guy starts having the meetings They say it was provocative. They say what he posted it was antagonistic. He said well, can I Who says that can I can I actually sit and have a conversation with whomever in HR says that they say no Someone said that this was what the favorite comment that I saw just in how crazy it was My unwillingness this is one of his colleagues who wrote on the sub on the on the chat Clay my unwillingness to engage with you doesn't signal the strength of your argument If someone says the KKK did lots of good things for the community prove me wrong. I'm not obligated to do so End quote. So this is how they handle it Yeah, he puts up data and they say we won't engage with your data because it would be like saying the KKK did good things The argument is so stupid and so intellectually Embarrassing and you know what they did after all this they fired him Six years at Reuters fired for sharing data in an internal chat thread No one says the data is wrong. No one questioned the actual numbers Not allowed that's the country we're in now and by the way He points out back to our initial premise here on BLM clay That the narrative of police are killing all these people with no cause except racism Has resulted in a lot of people particularly or disproportionately black people dying You would not have died BLM I believe this the BLM protests have likely led to thousands of additional black lives And again, this data points important 75 of all people shot every year according to washington post database By police are white Asian or Hispanic how often do you hear about someone other than a black person shot by police almost never? 75 of all police shootings white Asian or Hispanic Uh, it's not unusual to get a text these days from an unknown number saying your credit card's been used somewhere and can you approve it?

He's going to be speaking with retailers and manufacturers apparently that's from the white house But there's something else going on here bide administration shipping pallets of baby formula To the border. That's the town hall piece. It's up at clay and buck dot com right now from katie pablicch Who joins us right now from fox news? She's a town hall dot com columnists as well katie great to have you on the program Hey guys. Thanks so much for having me. Tell us about this one because we had a katie We could have taken phone calls for the whole show yesterday from just Ang anxious and pretty furious parents who are scrambling to get baby formula your piece in town hall Let's everybody know that well, there's no problem with baby formula at the southern border. What's going on? Yeah, so republican congressman kat kamik had a board of patrol agent contact her sending her photos of Stock shelves inside a board of patrol processing facility with baby formula and told her that there are pallets of baby That have been delivered to these processing centers. So while shelves Stores across america are bare And parents are driving hours and hours to find formula for their children The federal government clearly has some kind of contract to buy up the limited supply and deliver it not to those stores But to processing centers on the southern border So this of course brings up two issues the first is that the crisis that the southern border is a man made by the administration Problem and as we dig further into the reasons behind this baby formula shortage It's clear that that's also another by the administration federal government problem with the fda shutting down a major plant that Did not reopening it putting wrapping it in a bunch of you know red tape and now of course There's a limited supply and much of that is now going to solve the crisis on the border with people coming across with their children Who of course still need to be fed as well. So It's infuriating it's frustrating parents are you know wondering where the next You know case of that is going to come for their family and there seems to be plenty available for people who broke the law The country but not enough available for people who are citizens of the country K is great work by you and it also shines a light on how little attention is being played paid to the border that it might take a Baby formula shortage and therefore baby formula being shipped to the border for many in the media actually cover anything there As we are talking right now I just got an alert sent to my phone from the wall street journal and the headline is baby formula shortage could last for months Um in other words, this is not something that is going to uh leave anytime soon They are now limiting how much parents can buy Inside of uh of stores when they actually find baby formula there Katie we know from the pandemic unfortunately a lot of us experienced this When there is a fear of a shortage in a product it actually exacerbates the shortage because when people find it They buy more of it than they otherwise would otherwise would how does this get fixed for so many moms and dads out there That are trying desperately to find baby formula all over the country Well the FDA could work to get this major plant back open after there was a recall it's been months now They keep saying they want it to be safe for our parents and babies obviously everybody wants that to be true But they keep throwing up these roadblocks to reopen this plant that supplies the country with something like 50 percent of the baby formula Also, I would note that yesterday The incoming press secretary korean gene pare whose first day starts tomorrow. She's currently the deputy press secretary Was asked specifically about how the Biden administration is working to manage this crisis as it gets worse She gave, you know a paragraph worth of Statements about how they're working on a 24-7 how they're looking at all the options The usual bureaucratic speak and then when the follow-up question was asked about who exactly is handling the situation She literally laughed out loud and said that she did not know We played that audio. It's crazy. That's a problem. Uh, so they're claiming that they're dealing with this issue I'm wondering where Peepu to judges at this point um and there you know that our government can do a lot when it comes to commerce and figuring out how to Look at these contracts. Maybe that are going to the border and maybe limit the number of um baby formula palettes that are sent to there before they're sent to American stores across the country. There's a couple different options they have but we haven't heard much about it We're speaking to katie Pavlich editor at town hall.com fox news contributor Katie, I know you spent a lot of time down at the border and and have a lot of contacts in border patrol Immigration and customs enforcement What are you hearing from them about what's going to go on here with the title 42? Revocation which supposed to happen here in a couple of weeks. I know there's a judge that's involved at this stage Uh, but also given the number that just came out yesterday 107 Thousand overdoses mostly fentanyl and most of that uh vast majority that's coming across the border illegally Feels like there's renewed urgency to get this right. What are your border patrol contacts and folks telling you? Look they're saying basically border patrol has been turned into a processing agency and immigration and customs enforcement has been turned into a travel agency Uh the administration's response to title 42 getting taken off in the estimates of 18,000 people a day Crossing the border is not to deter people from coming to put up barriers to entry It's to simply open up new processing centers so they can process these people through and then give them a plane ticket to wherever they want to go Uh, that's the solution that they're they're offering here. Uh and border patrol is you know terrible morale at this point Um, you know their job and their mission is to protect the homeland from foreign threats Uh from drug traffickers as you mentioned from human traffickers from human smugglers Um, but this administration's policies have been to simply process thousands of people through the system Uh and to let them go into the country It's it's kind of like having a roof a leak in your roof and putting out a bucket and then as the bucket fills up And the leak gets bigger. They just add a couple buckets So that's what they're doing. They're they're going to open up new processing centers They're doing that going to put people in the front of the line for title 42 processing in terms of the courts System making the backlog even worse. Um, so that's where we're headed as a result of this katie When we talk about baby formula shortages and the border being a sieve and inflation at 8.5 or 8.3 Uh, you've got obviously murder rates skyrocketing everywhere You're really smart. You're good at communication skills If joe biden came to you and he said katie I need you to make a pitch for something that i've done really well So far in my presidency nearly 18 months buck and i are fairly smart guys We can't even come up with a pitch for joe biden as we get closer to the midterms I'm not talking about the abortion angle. What has joe biden actually done? Well, can you even i mean that it truly is incomprehensible? How bad he has been even for people who expected and i think buck and i are in this can You are too that it wasn't going to be good But i don't think any of us expected him to be this bad Could you even point to anything that hasn't been a disaster for him? Well, no, I mean his pitch is not to The entire country as he promised mr. Unification his pitches to the far left Of his his party. He is controlled by the far left of his party if you look at the move they made yesterday to Stop the leasing in alaska and the gulf of mexico You know they think that that is a pitch to the base hoping that the base gets out in midterms because mid-term elections are base elections And that's who he's pitching to that's who he wants to talk to that's who he's communicating to so if you see it from that perspective You know, there are a number of far left policies that he's implemented that He would see as a success that they would see as a success But for the rest of the country it has been a complete and total disaster It's like you look at those polls that show You know, do you think that joe biden is doing a good job and like 30 of the country still says yes And you wonder who those people are well if that's the far left of the base that thinks that These things that he's doing are good for the country or like a cleaning up of whatever they think that trump did And uh that's who he's speaking to he's not speaking to the entire country We've got katie's piece linked up at clay and buck.com on Plenty of formula at the border, but not for all the rest of the american people katie. Thanks so much for being with us Come back soon. Thanks guys. I will. Thanks so much. See ya Another month more bad news on the cost of living and inflation. You know it.

It's going to spread beyond abortion And during the commercial break. I was reading the washington post They are doing direct agenda based journalism Buck they have got washington post reporters obsessively calling every video game company To find out what their policy is going to be what their statement is going to be In the event that roby wade is overturned. This of course is not journalism It's a pressure-mounted campaign to try to get all of these companies to issue woke statements relating to abortion meanwhile So far most companies seem to be avoiding making these comments and what is this telling us? What are we learning from this obsession coming from the leak from justice elitos? Potential opinion remember it still hasn't even occurred potential opinion overturning it It's that roby wade by itself isn't enough There has to be more associated with it. So this was chuk schumer After the senate failed to advance what they were calling the women's health protection act Here in cut nine He says and follows along what we talked about yesterday the slippery slope argument of Contraception is next to listen to schumers litany of what's to come In the wake of this opinion the vote we just took makes crystal clear the contrast Between the parties as we approach the midterm elections vote Elect more pro-choice democrats if you want to see a woman have control over her own body Elect more pro-choice democrats if you want to protect a woman's freedom and right to choose Elect more mega republicans if you want to see a nationwide ban on abortion If you want to see doctors and women arrested if you want to see no exceptions for rape or incest So far that has not come to fruition anywhere, right? That's the slippery slope argument But buck what you're seeing actually is that democrats have enshrined that they believe abortion should be legal up to and including the ninth month of Pregnancy which is a radical proposition that is overwhelmingly rejected by the vast majority of the american public But this campaign is underway This washington post journalism I'm putting it in a quote in a quotation mark of calling a company and wanting to know what they're going to potentially be doing And then writing about a failure to act which is what they did in the newspaper Is advocacy direct and straightforward and this is all part of the campaign that is underway? To define this elitoe opinion. I think they're just trying to mobilize corporate america the way that they did With plle voice we just talked about in the last hour. They're they're expecting the same Genuflection and begging for forgiveness from corporate america now and then there's also a lot in corporate america who would They're just open advocates for this a lot of major companies But the difference is with blm in the initial days. I think there was a bit of There was a moral panic, but there was also a sense of well Maybe this is a time for a conversation Half the country doesn't want to have a conversation about whether or not women should be able to Abort babies for all nine months of a pregnancy. They want this to stop They've wanted it wanted this to stop for a long time. They've wanted this to stop for decades. They've set up organizations They've raised a lot of money. They've been engaged in advocacy They've been helping women who are who are um un you know unplanned pregnancy setting a button plan pregnancy centers for women to have babies There's been a lot that's been going on here So this isn't just one side gets to have their argument and no one else is going to stand a fourth them and say We'll hold on a second as that was the case remember with blm nobody I mean there are very few people who are willing to say early on I will say that I was among them that this was not going to help. This was a bad idea This is rooted in lies On this issue I think that they underestimate the strength and the um and and the solidity Is that a word? Um of the I think it's a word of the pro life movement and how it's been Waiting for this moment in time to now take it to the states You notice the panic among the democrats is oh my gosh. What if people can vote on this? Yeah, what if what if states actually have to deal with the intricacies and the gray areas and the Differences in opinion the democrats need this cover this fig leaf this fiction Of roe and now they want it at a federal level think about how Obtuse this thinking is as well when republicans come into a majority they can just remove you're gonna have a federal law That is saying you have this right. No, you don't have this right that's going to ping pong ping pong back and forth depending on who's in charge No states make you know very clear determinations Somehow clay we've lived in a world where you know I go in and and I go by a handgun in the state of texas And i'm enjoying my second amendment rights I walk around the streets with a handgun in new york that I haven't run through their special six-month long anti gun Get fingerprinted and treated like a criminal before you've done anything system They're gonna lock me up for three years like i'm a bad person They're violating my constitutional rights, but we live with all kinds of differences among the states That's where this is heading and that's where it should have been all along And I just think the democrats know that their arguments are weak And there's also a sense this is not going to be the mobilization Yeah, of course if you're left with the people that are outraged about this The blue haired nose-ringed Shrieking banshees outside of kavanagh's house and outside of roberts's house They were all voting democrat anyway clay. I really don't now there will be some people that maybe See that things you've been talking about the emails that say oh, it's gonna go after We're gonna take away your contraceptive rights. We're gonna take away exactly But I think there'll also be a lot of people who say Hold on a second Chuck shuma really believes and we're not making it up He does and beddow a rork and what's the the senate? That's him ryan would be would be senator from ohio Nine months you don't want to have a baby anymore doctors should take it out of you and kill the baby That is what the democrats believe people are going to realize what that actually means too No doubt and I think that's important to emphasize what actually was voted on There is a totalitarian nature in pro-choice abortion rights Arguments that now requires buck Lest you offend them that you support abortion all the way up to the ninth month of pregnancy That is what they believe that is what they voted on yesterday. That's what 49 democrats affixed their name to What's interesting to me associated with that is The pro-life movement actually has a variety of different perspectives within it right some people out there Do believe that there shouldn't be any exemptions at all that you're right to have that opinion right for religious-based reasons Whatever they may be other people and I would put myself in this category uh believe that contraception should be widely available and And some people disagree with that but i'm in that category uh in terms of what the line should be for rape incest for For how many weeks? Abortions should be available if at all there's a wide variety of perspectives the reason why I bring this up is I think there is a tendency to treat pro-choice people in the media certainly as if they are more of a reasonable group Think about this nine month pregnancy abortions That is murder That is now the position of the democrat party and it is one that if you are running If you know jd Vance is running up against tem ryan in ohio Tem ryan is trying to say hey i'm a moderate for the democrat party running in the state of ohio It ain't moderate buck to believe that a nine month pregnant woman Can decide to do away with her abortion And that needs to be you need to get everybody on the record in the midterms who is out there Do you support a woman's right to have an abortion in the ninth month because you know what if that woman was shot And the baby died Most of our criminal statutes would call that a double murder As they will most everywhere out there and as they should pointing out. I mean that we need we need to take a moment here And and really think about this as a country prominent democrats Really the most powerful democrats in the country are arguing for a legal right to what is Obvious infanticide. Yes full stop nine month babies. They could be born at any moment You'd be anybody who's gone through a pregnancy has had a baby nose you get to seven eight nine months You get to nine months that baby can come in any moment full on infanticide Pretending it's a constitutional right pretending. It's a moral right pretending. This is somehow about women controlling their bodies They are they aren't saying hold on. Let's have a let's have a national conversation about difficult things There are they're advocating for savagery full full on savagery. That is what they're actually Publicly demanding right now Something that we would have you know, if you're looking at a at a previous society. I think I mentioned this before You know the Aztecs Premodern, you know, pre discovery by by the west society That used to have massive human sacrifice And we look at that we say well, that's that's so awful They thought they had some reason for that whether it was to appease some gods or whatever Our reason is effectively according to democrats convenience. Yeah, it is inconvenient. You had you've had uh jannett yellen say You know, hey, it's it's really we need to make sure people can abort babies because you know babies are expensive and it's and it's it's hard And it's particularly difficult for low-income and minority communities That's an immoral position. She's advocating for I mean people's jaws should be dropping I do think we need to have something of a moral awakening in this country You know, we want to have a conversation about you know, when does life begin and and what legal protections for you know week one and week Forward that that is I think going to happen and that should happen at a political level That should be something that goes on if we can't agree that a baby is a baby at nine months What can we agree on think about this analogy? Woman goes into the hospital headed to a hospital at nine months pregnant Man before she can go into the hospital Jumps out and pummels her in her stomach leading for her to lose a baby. That's a vile awful Unbelievable crime to be committed and most people would say that man should go to the prison for the rest of his life Woman walks into the hospital and decides to have that baby aborted people are totally fine With that occurring in the democrat party right now When if think about how crazy that is just that that that difference between somebody assaults a pregnant woman And she loses her baby That man goes to prison for the rest of his life. I'm not a big direct attack I'm not a big advocate for saying well, what does the rest of the world do on a whole range of things? Sometimes it's interesting the rest of the world gets to have Secure borders to the degree they can and not be considered racist or xenophobic like every other every other industrial country modern country Gets to try to control its borders and that's not but on this issue you want on abortion You look at what the rest of the world believes? America is only Aligned in terms of what the democrat party pushes for with china Which created of course the one child policy and forced sterilization forced sterilization and north korea So countries that have open concentration camps and to this day and the united states Are democrats of course are the ones that advocate for this abortion for all nine months of a pregnancy There's no it doesn't get more morally clear than this actually like this part of the discussion There which is I think why democrats are so Uh, they're they're they're enraged They're over emotional that they because they don't want to actually think it through They want to shout slogans and live in a land of make believe where they haven't been advocating for evil for a very long time and they have been And this is something that they all need to go on the record for and this is what I would say is the benefit of The elito opinion in the event it becomes law because we go from debating whether rovey wage should be the law To what should the practical law be and that is why all 50 states should have a democratic process to figure out what is and what is not Permissible our friends at black rifle coffee man.

We are joined now by rob smith. He's in a rock vore war veteran political analyst host of can't cancel Rob smith a podcast which just launched yesterday Rob i'm going to tee up early here with a lot of the topics that we've been discussing so far today Uh and over the past couple of days. What do you think about us spending? 40 billion dollars On ukraine while we can't even get baby formula on the shelves in this country for moms and dads running around trying to feed their young kids Not only do I think that this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard and the most absurd things that i've ever heard It's one of those things that actually makes me angry It makes me physically angry when I found out that this was happening And when I think about this and when you think about 40 billion dollars being sent To the ukraine while you said like you said we have baby formula shortages while people are struggling paying more gurus paying more for groceries paying more for gas Um, it's outrageous and it makes me absolutely angry and I need to make a point right here Now, you know a lot of people i'm conservative Identify myself, you know, I vote republican all that stuff But a lot of people really do like to think that this is just something that comes from the left There's something that comes from a couple people on the right And I think when people need to realize sometimes that there is a uni party in washington dc That is united on this stuff. We have only a couple of bold and brave Um, congresspeople that are bold enough to vote against this stuff Rob, you know There's also a real concern and i'm seeing it start to Speaking of the uni party not just on the spending front but when it also comes to foreign policy Interventionism getting involved in things more than the american people actually want We're we're hearing a lot more now from democrats and from republicans about how Ukraine is an opportunity to bleed russia or ukraine is an opportunity to To offset, you know russias ambitions in the region And and they even will say things like you know, we're we're at war or we're close to war with russian ukraine I think that there has somehow been a mission creep that has happened and very few people have noticed this and it really is Concerning as we all know pouton has thousands of nuclear weapons Yes, absolutely and the thing that I hate about this book is that you have all of these chicken hawks, right coming from dc And they're talking tough about russia and pouton and all this stuff Um, most of these people have not served most of these people do not know anybody that is serving most of these people Do not have family members that have served so you have a lot of people talking this very tough talk when it comes to russia And like you said, you know, this is a nuclear power And this is something that that really irritates me as something that is very concerning how sort of casually these people are Branting up this rhetoric and pushing us into this war now. I'm not entirely sure now russia has always been an adversary of ours I definitely get that um, but I am not entirely sure when it became our responsibility To send all of these billions of dollars to ukraine and try to bleed them Um to sort of launch this offensive against russia and so we have people talking about no fly zones We have people talking about this tough talk against russia It is absolutely insane to me when we are going through the toughest times that we have seen in years Right here at home, but you got to understand and I go back to the swamp and I go back to the uni party These people do not care about the average working american What these people care about is making their donors happy with these people care about is continuing to fund the war machine What these people care about is continuing to see their stocks go higher and higher and higher when they use their positions to sort of bring up this rhetoric a lot Rob we saw dave shapelle get attacked on the stage In la a couple weeks ago and then the d a in la decided not to charge his attacker with the felony There's been a lot of discussion certainly with dave shapelle about the trans universe As it compares to the gay world and and and all of that What do you think about kind of the unholy alliance that exists right now when you see all of the discussions about Teaching kids who are first grade about transgender related issues How in the lbgt larger community how much conversation is going on? How much agreement is there on issues like these in the trans universe? Well, the thing about it is there's not like, you know, you guys both know i'm a gay dude myself I don't identify with the lgbt qi or any of that stuff. So what's going on here is is twofold First of all, you have gays and lesbians in america right now that have basically the rights that that you know They have fought for for decades and decades and decades are talking about don't ask on tell repeal being able to serve openly in the Military we're talking about the right to get married fine Now what the radical trans agenda has done is it has latched itself to be very powerful organization That existed to advocate for gay rights and have done so for decades And so gays and lesbians don't even exist anymore to these people they're talking about trans They're talking about q they're talking about a hundred different genders. They're talking about literally Transitioning, you know kids that are as young as five six seven years old And so that has a lot to do with the fact that we are seeing thanks to the work of places like libs of tiktok Where you see these people have infiltrated the public school system in the agenda that they're pushing to these kids has nothing to do with gay and lesbian And everything to do with this sort of radical gender ideology that has taken over that entire movement Like i said guys It has nothing to do with the average gay and lesbian american who just wants to live their lives in existent peace And this has everything to do with a very very very far left Sort of transgender gender identity cold ideology that has taken over that entire movement to the point where most saying gays and lesbians Do not even want to be involved with it anymore. It's being a rob smith He's a arach war veteran political commentator. He's got a new podcast that just launched yesterday can't cancel Rob smith, but you can listen to him and you should you should check it out rob i'm just wondering before Uh before let you go Clay and i have this ongoing discussion and we're just we are so curious that i know maybe it sounds like we're Just a bunch of guys sitting around, you know smoggin cigars trying to figure out the trajectory of the democrat parties politics It is it is kind of a fun game to play but Biden runs again How do they run him again given what's going on? But they can't run comela because nobody would vote for comela and they can't replace comela with may or peter Because that would look good and if they brought hillory out of quas I retirement, I mean What do you think happens we we go back and forth on this all the time? How do you think this shakes out? I do not think that biden runs again at the top of the taking his the thing as of right now They're doing a very good job at hiding Biden, right? So we see if you're a conservative doing personally or somebody that is just very anti-biden we see all of them as customers We see him struggling with the teleprompters. We see him, you know, not knowing where he is half the time They cannot take that out and run that again in a national election because then everything that we've been talking about the vast majority of the public Is going to see now they also cannot run comela at the top of the ticket as well because she is so deeply Unlikeable she couldn't get past 1% when she was running I think honestly that that mayor peed is playing his cars, right? I think that he will be on the ticket at some point They're going to have to find something to do with comela Harris But I do not believe that either biden or comela Harris is going to be on any part of that ticket Um in 2024. I do not see that happening comela is too weak. She has failed Um, she is good at being a politician and bat at every single thing else Biden is old. He is weak he is female looking he is Ineffectual and you cannot put that out in front of the american public In the rigor is that a presidential campaign would have to sort of get from him. I don't see it happening Rob fantastic stuff. My man. We appreciate it All right.
