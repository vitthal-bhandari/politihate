This show is pro-black, pro-queer, proudly feminist and pro do what you like. Every week you are going to get the best of what goes on in my head, what we're loving on and what we hate on. What we might be and what we ain't going to. Politics, pop culture, just a few weeks left until midterm elections and what we need to do about it, we cover it all. We know that no matter where you are, it's a challenging time, a changing time, a time of transformation, it's all the things all the time nowadays, but we are going to help you understand the dynamics of this time every single week. So be sure to tune in, tell a friend, and leave a review on Apple Podcasts. We do it for the culture, so the pod is free 99 because we know that with a country in chaos, the least we could do is keep you from putting your money anywhere else than where it's needed. Dear listeners, this week we're going to look back to help us move forward. Yep, let me explain. midterm elections are almost here, and I cannot overstate how important it is that we participate, get involved, get motivated, get angry, get inspired, and vote. In fact, don't just vote. Run for office, infiltrate. We are fighting for our power, our freedoms, and I'll go ahead and say it. Yep, we're fighting for our sanity too. Republican white nonsense is bad for my mental health and yours, and I am going to do something about it, and I surely hope that you do too. Now this week I want to go back and listen to a couple of interviews from two illustrious guests who really inspired me back in the election season of 2020. You know, when we were about to fall off a cliff? First, we're going to hear from W. Mondale Robinson from our talk back in November 2020. Mondale is the founder of the Black Male Voter Project, a national organization with a sole purpose of increasing Black men's participation in electoral politics. Note what he says about what we get wrong about the political participation of Black men and what we need to do about it. Let's listen. Let's talk about your work, my friend, and first and foremost, before we even jump into all that, one of 13, Chuck? I mean, I can barely remember my baby brother's name sometimes, so I'm trying to understand how are you keeping track of all them siblings? How is this happening? Yeah, so I'm blessed that I told my parents they think they were slick. It gets easier the more kids you have. Say it from a person who has no kids, right? But we were raised in sections. There's like four, then four, then the rest of us all together, except for the last two. But yeah, I'm the middle child of 13. I think that made it easier because it was either I'm fighting the older group or the younger group, but never like there was a difference in this pie where we're going to take care of Mondale. So probably because I deserved it because I was always doing something silly. So it was like one of the best experiences that I didn't know until I was an adult because so many things that I were protected from by my family, the sheer size of it, never having to like pretend to be friends with anybody. It was never a thing where I'm going to pretend to be cool with somebody or I'm not going to do what I want to do because I'm going to go home and have enough people to fight and also have best friends with. So I had this wonderful luxury and privilege of being me since I was able to even think about anything about personhood. And I think that you're absolutely right. It had a major impression on like how I was going to show up, especially in the political space that constantly pulls you to the center of what they call liberalism or centrices, which is not a good thing for me. Okay, facts. I understand that. So talk to me then. What was it like growing up with 13 siblings? And how did any of that experience shape your involvement in politics? Like how are all these things coming together? So like 79, the year I was born, it was an interesting time, I think partly because I came from an apolitical family. Like my family up until recently had never voted, don't vote. They didn't vote. They just very poor people from the South, Eastern North Carolina. My dad grew up working on the plantation that my family, that his family was raised on, but he was a he was the son of a sharecropper on the same in the same plot of land. Think about that. So and he also it was also the space where he got a felony conviction because the white guy who owned the farm, his son, who my dad had undoubtedly grew up playing with because they were similar in age, smacked my grandmother and my father reacted. But in the 50s and 60s, a black man can't hit a white man regardless what he'd done, especially not something he did to a black person. But my dad reacted and got a felony for for hitting that white man. And I think growing up hearing that story in my life, that was probably one of the most impactful thing, not to mention that the white guy that used to spray my mom with a fire hose when she was a child was still the fire chief in my life when I was growing up. So feeling like that, that feeling of not being able to, every day I wanted to do something to this fire chief, but I'm eight, nine years old. There's nothing I can do, but I knew what he did to my mom. And I also knew that the laugh and the smile that she tried to put on when she told those stories as if it was funny was not her normal big smile that showed all of her teeth and her wonderful gap. And it made me feel something type of way, which is when I began to fight for equity. Like earlier on, and I knew I didn't want to be a firefighter. I didn't want to be a police. I didn't want to be a politician. I wanted to be a voice piece for black folk and equity. And equity does not just stop at the ends of racial skin tone. It's actually for anything. When I see and hear anything about inequality, I lose sleep. And it didn't just start as my entire life, I've been that way. So, yeah, I think those things influenced me a lot. And then one time I was extremely rude to my mom, and it taught me how to be extremely self-sufficient because it was like Christmas. And I got a tape because we were extremely poor. I got a cassette tape that was, I don't know if you remember the bootleg tapes from the stock, the flea market, they didn't really, you know what I'm saying? And I'm like, man, why can't I get regular tours like a regular kid? And my mom was like, just be happy you got anything. I was 13. Just some people didn't get nothing. I'm like, man, whatever. But later that night, when they thought all of those kids were asleep, I heard my mom crying to my dad about that being the worst day of her life because of what I said to her. And that literally was the, that is literally the last time I've asked my parents for anything. And I started like digging in the trash can for like back then, we used to have glass odabottas and you could recycle them for 10 cents. So I used to help out my parents with that. And I stopped asking for shoes to go to school. And I would just like, by me, it's Nike's to go to shoes. I'd take them back, go to the dollar store to sit the super 10 and get like, like some cheap shoes and some T shirts and be fresh with new T shirts and give the money back, you know what I'm saying? From my parents. So, and I started selling pecans and everything like that, like, because we country folk. So I could sell stuff like that to help out. And that's what I would do. And it was the last time, literally the last time I asked. And once I was in a dumpster, I found a jewel. It was the soles of black folk by Debbie DeBose. And for the life of me, I'm certain that 14 I didn't fully understand what he was talking about. But I felt like this is, this is what I want to do. Like, I want to be, I want to be that preacher and everything else he was talking about in that book. I wanted to be, you know, that, that mystic or that medicine man, or whatever, everything he called the preacher, I felt like that's what I was supposed to do. And I literally tried to do that in my life, went to law school because of that book. I went went to divinity school because of that book. I went to college. You got a political science degree because of that book. Everything about black folk or the souls of black folk, I try to live about that coupled with Eddie Murphy movie, Boomerang. Those, yeah, you just came out to cut with the boomerang. I'm maybe with this deep story. You don't have to say that you're like, Oh yeah. And then by the way, boomerang. Yeah. Okay. I got, I got, I got, me and my therapist are working on a toxic side of me. And I'm telling you, it comes from boomerang. And, and that is not me trying to deflect on like me, not owning my problems. I literally thought that was like how successful me and was supposed to show up in the world. And I'm still trying to shake that right now. So funny. I love this so much. Months ago, my organization put out a report on the political participation of black men. And we had this theory that black men were potentially swing voters in this upcoming election cycle. And that largely that had to do with a lack of attention that was paid to black men in the political process. But we were not the first to see this. I mean, you started an organization called black male voter project to address this head on way before this report came out, y'all been around for a second. There's been a lot of conversation about the role of black men in the selection cycle. And unfortunately, not none of it has been positive. So help me break down. What the hell is going on here? And can you give us some myths and facts in particular about what just happened and what we've been dealing with? Yeah. So let's start with a, I should have grounded in facts. Right. So first of all, we were this little organization black male voter project. Right. So the work that you all did was actually extremely important, right? Because we know about access and when people are talking about things that need to be said, sometimes folk can't hear from my voice and we need a need echo. We need the voice to be amplified. So let's not even minimize what happened over there that way. Right. But a lot of what's happening right now with black men and their turnout, this massive amount of energy and turnout for black men is grounded or being grounded in myth because people are talking about one exit poll from Edison, right? Edison is the same organization that did a poll in 2016 to say 54% of white women voted for Donald Trump. No one ever asked him to come back and correct that even though we know years now, like later, that it was so wrong and that report was latent with lies. Like that same report said 85% of white women had college degrees. We know that's not true. What exit polls actually are are meters for a certain type of people, not the entire electric, right? So that the polls are exit polls, especially our polls for certain type of people, meaning people that are willing to stop and talk to exit polls, 20% of those black men voted for Trump. But that was only 4% of the black men that they try to stop or they try to have conversation with, which means that that was not representative of the entire black men that participated. Also, if we look at the facts, these same polls said there's no energy. There's a lack of energy from a democratic base, right? There's no Donald Trump is winning on energy. The problem is you were pulling black people on Joe Biden. That doesn't even sound like an exciting, beautiful black people to swallow, especially black men who don't buy into this idea that personalities are enough to talk about a level of excitement, especially when at the white men, supposedly we were the first to receive our right to vote, which actually was the 15th amendment for black men really was another opportunity for us to be guinea pigs for suppression of humanity, right? And it's never stopped. So what we do know, though, is if we look at the primary, it's a better way to tell how black men vote it because some states have closed primary, meaning you need to be registered a certain way to vote in that primary. A great example of this is in Georgia. We saw 144,000 black men come to the poll in the democratic primary that did not vote for Barack Obama in 2008, didn't vote for him in 2012, didn't vote for Trump in 2016, and didn't vote for sister Abrams in 2018, nor did they vote in any of the midterm elections in between those elections. Now, that tells us a few things. One, first, these are not kids, right? These are at least 30 year old because you've been registered for 12 years. And also, there's a motivating factor of something different than the norm that makes you go to the poll. Also, it is highly unlikely that these people were so energetic that they didn't vote for the opportunity to have a first black president two times, and then came to the poll and vote in the democratic primary, and then switched to Republicans in the general election. That makes no sense at all. So when we went and then when you couple, right now, we don't have all of the numbers from Georgia or any state for that matter, because elections are just being certified now. But what we're seeing right now in Georgia is a large number of those brothers who did that did vote in the primary came back out and voted early in the general election. So for instance, we knew about before the day before election, we were counting early votes of that number that 144,000 black men that are named, 80,000 of them had already been back and voted early, meaning 80,000 people, black men who didn't vote for Barack Obama, Trump, or Stacey Abrams, came out and voted early. And these are the same people who voted in the democratic primary. What is the likelihood that these people took time to go to a primary, a democratic primary, and then switched their mind? That's my first problem with the exit poll. They're not really talking about it. And then also, if you look at the sheer number of spaces where black people are over performed their 2018, 2016 numbers, 2012 numbers, you see a pickup of votes in these spaces. These are heavily, I'm talking small precincts that are majority black, and then the numbers that they're trying to say are belong to a black man voting against Joe Biden doesn't add up real well. Like, for instance, there are districts in Georgia that are over like 90% black, that you can't win that district without the participation, not the levels that Joe Biden won of black men and voting in some spaces. So I'm a whole data nerd over here, and it just doesn't seem true that we're going to base what we've said about black men on exit polls. Plus, I've been sitting on calls where people are saying things that are based on just wild ideas. For instance, I just got off the call with the Senate majority packet. I was pushing back on their poll because they literally had a list of names of dead black bodies. I mean, this is a motivating fact. And I'm like, first of all, I'm getting sweaty on my inside that you're thinking, this is how you're going to motivate black people by using this death. But to make it even worse, they didn't even name a Mard Aubrey in Georgia. Exactly. You're in Georgia. He's like, Oh, because of joy, what we saw happened in George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and they list all these names. And I'm like, and it's like, it all started because of George Floyd. And I'm like, first of all, you discount so much local work on people who've been, we didn't just start dying because you saw it on Facebook, right? That was not the first nine minutes of death for black people by agents of the state. And when we think like that, I mean, like you're depressing the vote, especially if you're on the phone talking to people in Southwest Georgia, which is so funny because of that poll, that's where the candidate is, where the week is. And I'm like, it's because you're polling people about black death and not even mentioning a resident of Southwest Georgia that was murdered by a cop this year. So I mean, so I think that we have these polls that are telling us, and people are using polls like they're factual in a very fictional way. And we need to own that too. I mean, this is part of the problem when black folks don't design these campaigns. We, you don't go get me on this whole train about how basically insert a name that becomes the proxy for what white folks think is the only thing that we care about really, which is criminal justice reform. I'm really sorry. On behalf of BLM, I'm really sorry. You're a black man and you are a voter and you have been working with black men to engage black men in the electoral process because you see where the gaps are here. What do you think is the potential of black men in politics? What's the different story about what black men are doing and what black men could be doing if sufficiently organized? Indeed. I mean, the potential is our sisters, what you're all doing, right? Like we have the same potential that you all have. I mean, y'all dope, this is your dope, this for sure. And I'm not trying to compare, but I'm just saying with some reality added to the way we interact politically with black men, then we too can increase a potential of a demographic that we definitely need to one easy to load of sisters and also just when black men are voting like women, we are better off as a country. We save the world and not in a hyperbole way. Let's literally think about it. If we care about progressive issues, then we need both those demographics participating in a high higher than normal for other races for this party that we, that so many people say we should leave when in actuality, I argue against leaving because we made this party what it is and leaving it gives away too much infrastructure that we already sweated for. So here's what I think. I think we at Black Metal Boulder Project, we threw out traditional campaign. We do not talk to black men about elections being your saviors or candidates being saviors. What we talk about is elections as an entry point to civic engagement. And the way that we talk about it is basically voting is brushing your teeth socially. You still got to take a whole bath, right? You still got a bath. So it's if you don't want social halatosis, you got to vote. So and the way we do that is it's grounded in lessons learned from Maslow hierarchy needs, meaning you can't approach people who don't have their basic needs meant talking about things that are self actualization and to black men who are literally living with their backs against the razor wall. We can't think the way we present polling to them or elections to them that it's going to be seen as anything other than self actualization. So we know that this is a demographic that makes up some of the lowest markers in this country, be it education, how we're overrepresented in expulsion, suspension, special needs, classes, etc, etc, etc, short as lifespan, all of that. And to say that this demographic is to buy into elections that come around every four years with some fried chicken and a church fan is beyond ridiculous. I mean, so we have to also address we need to address those issues that they're facing, not from a group of pollsters that are divorced from their community, but in a way that that values and also shows their issues as more important to candidates. So we created this approach called B M E P editorial approach, and it does just that. We spend a lot of time listening to brothers more than talking to them. Like we have 4000 conversations with black men this year, and it was no cameras. There were no women, no white people, just black men in a room. And we overpopulated for gang members for what the people call drug dealers. And we had a couple elected officials and a couple political folk in the room, not so that they could like filibuster the conversation or ground the conversation, but so they could see how wrong they were. And it was so amazing to go around this country and have these conversations and see those that are elected officials or democratic creatures at a democratic party raise their hand around issues like what is the number one issue with black men is that health care almost always people that were connected to the party would raise their hand. And the rest of the room be looking at them like they got three heads, like that is not the number one issue. If a cop killed me, I don't need health care. I'm dead. That's right. So I mean, I, I, it's just wonderful way of centering, recentering, the issues that are most important. What we are saying is if you engage black men the way you engage everybody else, a democratic party, which spent $1.5 billion on these elections and less than 5% went to black people. If you engage us the way you engage your conservative cousins, then you would have a smaller population of what y'all call, I think they call them low information on sporadic voters. I call them low investment voters because they don't invest in that's right. You better tell this truth. So much of what we talk about with respect to black people in elections is fraught with tropes and stereotypes and misinformation. But there's also contradictions that we're not dealing with. How do we have a both and conversation? Because I feel like with black people, that should always be the conversation, both and, okay, not either or for a whole bunch of reasons. So how do we have a both and conversation about black voters that could help us unlock what black voters really need, not for white dominated political parties, but instead really and truly for us by us? You see where I'm going here? I do, absolutely. I, I, and I think, I think there's, so the trauma associated with black community and people like you always go to the trauma. And I'm thinking because it's grounded in everything that is the black experience in this country require us to do a both and, right? Because anything else is going to be incomplete and it's not going to be grounded in reality. It's shifting sand as my country Christian folk will say. So I believe it's a hard space to create. But I think without cameras and with like people that are really looking to do that work, if we invest in it in a real way, I think it's possible. For instance, there are some issues with with black men around certain progressive ideas. And I think, you know, just shutting them out or cutting them out or canceling them may not be the way we can go for it and be sustainable as a community without at least first trying to address. Because I know a lot of a lot of black men that we were talking to were not where they needed to be. The idea of masculinity and trying to divide masculinity from toxic masculinity was a whole lot of our early conversations and trying to explain, like, explain through that and how we, how we would be able to organize around like there's a difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity. And then and how necessary it was that we pointed out which one was which. So as to make our community whole and also for people to be held accountable, like because you got to reconcile before we can go for it with a lot of issues. And I think I think there's a lot of work to be done around that and all of the things associated with patriarchy in this country and how it how it shows up in our community. And which is usually a on a more intra relationship, which is so scary because that means you're doing more harm to people that love you, right? A lot of the times the political space that I'm looking for checks or knows and yes, it knows the transactional nature. Don't give space for that or don't see that as as power or or even something that they want to invest in. So I think we I demand of donors like don't come over here, thinking you're going to fund me or position in my organization for this election. And then you're not going to so I need you to fund an organizer not just to generate a fifth, but for two years because we got work to do in our community and it requires more than just your victories on January the fifth in Georgia. So I think we as a we as a people who who own space in proximity to white money, we're obligated to ask for more than what they want. Don't just think you're going to fund I don't do voter registration, but not knocking my people that do. Don't think you're just going to fund voter registration over here without giving us donations and funds to do other stuff that is super important, i.e. addressing the harm that comes from black men to other parts of our community. And and also what what is what is that root of that harm too. And how you know what i'm saying like because white supremacy doesn't just hurt black people hurt white people. So the same is the same is true about the toxic stuff that sometimes live in in our community from us. So yeah, I think that question is is beyond the politics. It is a political question because it requires us to really address what people call the tricky or the trickiness of black men, which I think part of it is so for so long. We haven't had sister gender black men talking to sister and the black man about sister and the black man stuff in a way that is not considered shop toe in a way that's not grounded in you know science and hurt and hugging and loving. And we should we should definitely begin that. And I think I think you know black male voter project I tell people all the time the voter tricks you because we're more than a voter organization. We are in a holistic organization based in the lessons for my as low hierarchy needs. But we it also goes back to the my my as low hierarchy needs when you think about it. If your basic needs aren't met it is impossible for you to skip two levels and go to the space where you can create healthy relationships. So I mean so there's some grounding that we have to do but then also we also need to know that up that pyramid is the place where we have to correct broken relationships and harm calls by us. I'm completely obsessed with you. Family. I'm totally obsessed. Dear listeners I hope you got some food for thought from this talk with Mondale. Now I want to play a small portion of my October 2020 talk with the incomparable the illustrious the brilliant joy read. Her words about saving our democracy are just as important today. We are so not out of the woods yet. Here's joy. We are in full swing in this election season and you know what it's been a complete disaster. It's finished the show. How are we to understand this next 30 days? What's at stake? And we're talking all about voters and who's going to come and who's not going to come and who's staying home and who's getting you know activated. But I want to ask a different question which is what is critical right now to the outcome of the election? People know at this point you're going to vote or you're not going to vote and if you're going to vote you know who you are going to vote for. I don't believe that anybody is like I just can't decide is it tied in or no you know what you know you're trying to decide right now if you're going to show up or not. So that's right. What's at stake here? I mean I think we're going into this period where we're also starting to make contingency plans right. I mean this man has already said he don't believe in ballots he don't believe in voting. Remember he thinks the earth is flat so what are we working with here? Any predictions? So I'm I listen I predict in every race and I am sometimes right and I'm sometimes wrong. I will note that I did predict that Barack Obama would choose Joe Biden and I said he was the only choice he could have made. I was right about that. I did believe that in 04 I did think we were going to beat George W Bush. I was very much wrong. So we kind of did but you know technically we did. I did believe that Barack Obama was going to win. I was never the least bit unconfident that he would win both of those two elections. This is remember this is the black guy and who was running with him and who already won North Carolina in Indiana with him. That would be Joe Biden. So these people people have already voted for Joe Biden right. So I'm fine with predicting. I did think Hillary Clinton was going to win in 2016. So I'm about 50-50 in my predictions but I will make one at the end. So what I will say is very important is I'll go I'll do three things. Number one stop using the term election day. Don't think about election day. That's gone because of early voting and absentee. It's an election season and we're already deep in it. More than 3.5 million votes as of when we're recording this. Alicia have already been cast. Many of them by mail but many of them in person today on the day we're recording this. Lines around the corner in Ohio. People are voting in record numbers. This will probably be the largest turnout election in modern American history. Probably even more than the next largest which was Obama in 2008. This is going to be huge. For America unfortunately huge means maybe 62, 63, 65 percent because we're at the bottom in terms of the West in terms of our voter turnout. If we get to 70 percent it'll be a miracle but it could happen because that's how interested people are. The stakes could not be higher. If Donald Trump remains president of the United States and again this is not me saying this as a partisan. I'm just saying it as somebody who has observed this country and observed politics and observed other countries for a long time. We become closer to being Brazil. We become closer to being Turkey. We become closer to being Poland. All of whom have receded from being democracies. We will be less of a democracy four years from now than we are now. The rights of citizens particularly Black, Brown and Indigenous citizens and Asian American citizens and immigrants will be diminished. Stephen Miller will still have power to write our laws when it comes to Black and Brown people and immigrants. LGBT people will have fewer rights than they started with. The trans community will probably be the first ones to get hurt. You're going to see conservative Christians protected by the law in ways that they have not been in the past which for them it would be a victory but women will lose considerable rights including potentially the right to choose whether you give birth. A lot is on this. A lot is at stake. This is whether or not we stay a democracy. The founders of this country I was speaking with someone this morning who's also white by the way and so agreed with me 100 percent that the founders we have to remember were not perfect. They were slave-owning white men who created a democracy perfect for them but terrible for their wives, their daughters, enslaved people, Native Americans and everyone else. It took 27 amendments just to make it decent and what it never happened in 27 amendments is we never restrained the president and so whenever we have a president who is an autocrat that autocrat can actually get away with a lot more than we ever thought. Technically FDR was president for life. It is possible to do a lot in this country that we think of as what is done in other countries. So that's what's at stake. We must vote. If we want the ability to ever vote again, if we want to ever have a free and fair election ever again we have to make this one a free and fair election or we are doomed quite frankly and I don't mean to be alarmist but I am alarmed. Our democracy is super fragile. Just remember Poland emerged from World War II as a democracy and is sliding back out of democracy. Brazil is sliding out of democracy. China has a president for life. Russia has a president for life. All of these supposedly are democracies. So I would say to everyone please vote however you feel comfortable. Mail it but just mail it early. Drop off your absentee ballot that you filled out so you can get in and out quick. Wear your PPE vote in person. However you have to do it, do it no matter what and make sure everyone you know love even people you hate and you only talk to them once a year. Make them vote. That's right. Okay folks, it's time to get motivated for these midterms. Now this pod is going to bring you more people doing excellent work and making good trouble this election season. Please join me and we'll get through this together. We've come to the part of the show where I usually bring you the news but you know what, we are going to take the week off.
