    "text": " Welcome to Rising. We have a stellar show planned for you this Wednesday morning. I was a little late because I had difficulty finding an electronic scooter that was working. I didn't want to block two blocks until I got one. Then I was hitting every light. I loved to just zip through traffic. I was being especially against taking risks this morning. Well, I'm glad that you are risk averse. I hope one day that gets you to wear a helmet on your way to work. I thought this was still a free country, but maybe not. Let's get to the news. First up, a settlement has been reached. In one of the most historic defamation cases in American history, Dominion Voting Systems versus Fox News, just moments before opening statements were set to begin Tuesday afternoon. Fox News agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion over promoting falsehoods that the 2020 election was rigged and that Dominion's machines counted fraudulent votes. The settlement shields Fox from what was likely to have been grueling and potentially embarrassing coverage of internal strife between the network's executives, anchors and producers in the weeks leading to the 2020 election. Lead Dominion attorney Justin Nelson spoke outside the courthouse yesterday. Let's watch. The truth matters. Lies have consequences. Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories caused by the United States. Causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country. Today's settlement of $787,500,000 represents vindication and accountability. Lies have consequences. Fox News is not completely out of the woods yet. The media giant is facing another multi-billion dollar lawsuit from another voting technology company Smartmatic that alleges Fox broadcast lies that decimated its business. So there will be another one of these suits potentially could be a settlement as well. Maybe earlier this time. I think it's obvious that Dominion was in a really strong position despite the very high bar that a defamation lawsuit like this has to clear. There were setbacks for Fox even as recently as last week in terms of they had put off the judge with some of the attorney's behavior and not disclosing exactly what what the attorney's actions were. What Rupert Murdoch's title and position was. So the jury was delayed while they could really see if they could put together a last minute deal. It's funny. I was just watching. I've been rewatching succession with my wife who's watching it for the first time and we just watched the episode at like the shareholders meeting where they're rushing to make a deal with the coalition of people who are trying to take over the business. And I was watching this as this was happening. It was felt very similar echoes like last minute. Can they deal together? That's not wrong. Look, I in my experience, you know, as an attorney cases settle. Case of settle because litigation is incredibly expensive. And takes forever. And takes forever. And it's frankly unpredictable and these corporations are risk averse. And look, I know that some people feel as though Dominion should have pushed through one because of the kind of public disclosure value of unpacking more of what's been going on behind the scenes at Fox. Others feel as though the settlement value of $700 million or so much less than the $1.6 billion. But keep in mind, $700 and nearly $8 million is many times. Yeah, is many is many times more than Dominion's yearly earnings, like by orders of magnitude. This is a real boon for that company. Also, it's worth noting kind of the posture you referenced some of the antagonism that had happened with some of the lawyers and the judge. But there's a lot of others that went down this week. The judge sanctioned Fox News for withholding evidence, admonished it for not being straightforward with him. He said he would allow Dominion to conduct an additional deposition with Rupert Murdoch at Fox's expense. And I think that that from a Fox News perspective, having that deposition, knowing what we've gotten out so far, the potential embarrassment of that hanging over their head might have been one of the things that went ahead and pushed them over into settlement territory. And the judge also had ruled that Fox lawyers could not use newsworthiness as a legal defense, which narrowed their potential trial strategies. So the idea that even if something was wrong, it's something that people are saying, so we should have people long to cover it. Once that's off the table, it's not really clear what they really would have in terms of counter-arguments here. Well, and look, I think you could argue that this is a good outcome. Right, I know many people, many critics of Fox were eager to learn even more damaging and embarrassing information about the company. That was the major animating agenda of so many mainstream media outlets covering this gleefully. And you know what, turn about is fair play. Fox would cover their legal troubles with great glee as well. So, you know, these are rival firms within an industry battling each other fine. You know, that's the way it is. But I think, and I've said, as when we've discussed this, that I would be concerned from a journalistic standpoint, from a freedom of expression standpoint, about a ruling on the books that impacts a media company's ability to have on guests, even guests that are cranks and have controversial, likely wrong things to say, because sometimes a perspective that seems laughable and wrong and is totally counter to everything legitimate people think, and is totally conspiratorial, every now and then it ends up to be right. We at our show, we explore some of those things along the lines of at least foreign policy, and perhaps COVID, some things that were utterly preposterous have are not so preposterous anymore. So, I would worry about a slippery slope along that line if there was a ruling on the books saying that they were ultimately guilty of defamation. We didn't cross that bridge. They paid, so they have to make right to this company that was harmed by the statements made by guests on the program. So, maybe this is a win-win-win situation. It is worth noting that this is a defamation claim, and the idea that there might be a guest who is incorrect. So, there's two layers of this. One, it's knowing that the guest is going to say something incorrect, factually incorrect, not opinion-based incorrect, but factually incorrect and having it on anyway, despite there being, again, a record of internal conversation that acknowledges that the only value of having this person on, is that it appeals to an audience that is very pro-Trump and is embracing this argument not for fact reasons, but because it bolsters a narrative from a politician that they enjoy and will help thoughts on the ratings. So, that's one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is the defamation aspect. So, conceivably, you could have all those other elements, a guest that you know is incorrect, that you have on anyway because the audience likes it, but the guest, what they're saying, doesn't defame another party. So, the slippery slope argument would require a lot of different parts of this to be in place. The idea that we have a guest on that says, I don't know, you know, aliens have landed in, invaded Joe Biden's brain, you know, a guest defamed Joe Biden, but let's say, aliens have- Well, a public figure is harder. Sure. So, aliens have invaded in there, you know, all over New Jersey. Okay. You know, you can have that on, but you're still not in the context where you're in this position, where you're being sued for defamation because conceivably, who was actually hurt, it's a weird story, it's a wrong story, and I undermine the credibility of the institution. So, I hear what you're saying about that, but I do think it's worth parsing out exactly what would be required, not just the defamation, but also, a- an express behind the scenes knowledge based on documents that we have written or communications that have otherwise been captured between us, that admit that we know better and are only doing something to advance the financial interest of the company, which, again, is not something that I think that is journalism or I'm especially concerned about protecting. Yeah, I think it is- it should be perfectly open to criticism, but again, this was a lawsuit, and a lawsuit aimed not just at the people who literally made the statements, but a lawsuit aimed at the platform at which the statements were made, and yes, we're learning some pretty damning and embarrassing things about what some of the figures involved who decided to platform those people really, really thought about them, but I would- and I would say they should take their licks from now that's in the public record, and you should, you know, think whatever you think about those people or their integrity based on that, but again, a decision on the books that then impacts the financial bottom line of a company and might make other media companies very wary to have- to have weirdos and outsiders be a part of the dialogue doesn't seem like something to me that necessarily serves the public interest. Well, what do you make about this argument that some folks are making that the settlement doesn't include an apology? That Dominion- that Fox News doesn't actually have to admit that it spread misinformation and that it was wrong. You saw a little bit in the Dominion representatives, a spokesperson there that said that the settlement is accountability, that's the line they've been using, that the settlement is accountability, that apologies are about accountability, and since we're having the settlement, that's efficient. What do you make of that? So Fox News said in a statement about the settlement, we acknowledge the court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards, so they acknowledge that the claims made were false. You're right, it's not a- it's- they don't technically say the words we are sorry or we apologize. They are paying, you know, three quarters of billion dollars. And again, it's not just that there was some false claims. Sometimes false claims get made on the air. The question is whether or not they knowingly created a context for false claims to be said. Knowingly said, we know this is malarkey, but we're going to have these guests on because we know our audience likes malarkey and we're going to feed it to them. That's the bit that gets the company on the hook as opposed to the individuals, and that's the bit for which I think some people are still wanting an apology. But look, there's this other lawsuit coming down the pike and we'll see if those, as you say, are kind of thirsty for it or rabid for it among a larger liberal audience will actually get what they're looking for. More rising right after this. Music Alabama police have arrested two people in connection with a birthday party shooting. They killed four people and wounded 32 over the weekend. Tyrik McCullough, 17 years old, and Travis McCullough, 16 years old, have been charged with four counts of reckless murder. Police have identified the victims as 23 year old Corbin de Monterey Holston, 19 year old Marcia and Manuel Collins, 18 year old Philstavius Daudel, and 17 year old Sean Kiva, Kiki, Nicole Smith. They were shot and killed while attending a sweet 16 birthday party shortly after 10 30 p.m. on Saturday night. Here's Alabama police speaking on the matter. On Tuesday, April 18 at approximately 8 p.m. Alabama law enforcement agencies state and road investigation officially arrested and charged Tyrik McCullough, 17 of Tuskegee and Travis McCullough, 16, also of Tuskegee with four counts of reckless murder each. So they did not specify a potential motive for the shooting yet. I take it from reading the coverage that these the shooters were at the event. It's difficult. It's hard to tell. It's a little odd. I know this is just breaking. And so we don't. I mean it's breaking that they were arrested. Obviously this did happen over the weekend. So I know I know that it's just breaking. So there's a reason why perhaps we don't have those details, but if they were at the event, it seems like that should be an obvious like a very easy thing to figure out. But as for some background that it was one of the deceased sisters, sweet 16 Alexis Daudel. And she said she was looking forward to this. She had butterflies in her stomach. There was a rumor at the party that someone had a gun at which point. Their mother made an announcement over the speaker saying if anyone here has a gun, you need to leave. We're here to celebrate a sweet 16 party. And they tried to figure out who it was. They did it and the party kept going. And then all of a sudden while people were dancing on the dance floor, they heard gunfire and Alexis says, all I remember is my brother grabbing me and pushing me down to the ground. She fell into a pool of blood. She sat up and ran outside. Afterward, she reunited with her mom, but she couldn't find her brother. And when the shooting stopped, they saw him and a lot of others obviously on the dance floor and blood. I mean, it sounds like an absolutely horrific, horrific event. So I'm very eager to find out what the possible motive could be, why people at the party would start shooting in this way, shooting people that they know. And if it's not someone at the party, what their motives could have been to do something as horrific as this. Right, these individuals in custody are being charged as adults. They're 16 and 17. So they'll be much deeper potential penalties there. You know, it's interesting how these things take shape in the public perception. There's not been protests about this or even calls for gun control protests or protests about crime. This is a mass shooting. A number of people, four people dead, many other shot. That satisfies the criteria of a mass shooting. But it's not, I don't know that it's being characterized or discussed in the same way. The school shootings we've talked about or the bank shooting from the other week are described. It's, you see what I'm getting at? I don't know. I mean, I just, I don't know much about this case. I don't know much about whether there have been protests. I mean, there are a lot of- There's not been as much news coverage on it. For example, there wasn't a protest over the woman who was killed turning around in the driveway as far as I know. The protest around the first case with the 16-year-old who rang the doorbell and was shot was over whether or not the guy was going to be charged. There seemed to be some delay in charging and arresting the person who did the shooting. I think there was some concern because there have been a pattern of other cases where folks have not been charged. Remember, there was a DC case where the kid who was perceived to be at least trying to steal a car was shot by a homeowner outside of the house and wasn't charged for quite some time. So I think that the protest tend to be not that something happened, but that there has been a failure in the justice system and actually pursuing the case. And this one, it looks like they obviously, they caught people who really suspect and are likely to charge them or charge them as adults. Ultimately, there hasn't been a failure in the justice system with respect to the teenage boy shot the doorbell shooting so far. Well now, the protests happened because the guy wasn't charged. Those happened immediately in that gap period. I don't know if there have been subsequent protests, but absolutely I think that there should be an attention to gun laws in this case. Absolutely. Alabama has one of the highest. We talked about this yesterday. How when we're talking about dangerous cities and dangerous states, there was this weird politicization where conservatives tend to want to say Democrats are hypocrites for having, you know, cities, urban cities with crime, when so many of the states and localities with the highest amount of gun violence are in fact, and not that this should be about this, but in conservative states like Alabama and Alabama and cities in Alabama often rank very highly on that list. That's another reason I suspect the attention, not as much paid to this was, these were, these were not, you know, AR-15s, the guns that are, as I've said on this show, as most gun crimes are, most violent crimes, most murders are committed by the much more common kind of gun, the handguns, not the really destructive weapons that everyone gets so incensed about that are responsible for a tiny fraction. And the story has been covered broadly. I'm looking at a Vox piece, Buzzfeed News, etc. It's worth noting and people have been talking about this gun violence in the context of this case, noting that gun violence is the leading cause of death among Alabama children. I think what's interesting is that some people who are perhaps more right-leaning will often say things like, well, that statistic doesn't really matter. It's not a real statistic because it is cases like this or cases that are perceived to be about internal disputes, gang violence, and that that is not what some folks are really concerned about. I think a lot of members in living communities, where they're subject to this kind of violence, are very much concerned about the proliferation of guns, and they're very much, I think, victimized by how easy it is to get a gun, particularly in red states. But if anyone's saying it doesn't matter because of the particulars, that would be a bad thing to say. I guess what I'll suggest is that there's a specific, when there is a racism component to it, it can get a crime, can get a, I mean, this is what we've seen happen. It gets a national discussion and hearing that equally horrific or even crimes involving even more deaths don't get if there's not the racism component. Yeah, there's a lot of things that can escalate a crime to a national prominence. Often, there's been very much studied how if the victim of a crime, a murder, is white, blonde woman, they get a lot more coverage even the most missing children in the United States are not white, blonde women. So there's a lot of ways in which bias or a sense of salaciousness or what the public appetite is for drives news coverage, and sometimes that means that black victims of crime are ignored in favor of white victims of crime symptoms. Sometimes it means that white perpetrators of crimes that be focused on more than others, and I think it's worth having a robust conversation about why that is for sure. Well, we'll have more rising right after this. Another very tragic story to discuss having to do with the Stand Your Ground debate, this time out of Texas, two cheerleaders were shot yesterday after one apparently got into the wrong car in a supermarket parking lot, going to Heather Roth, her and three of her teammates carpooled to a local HEB grocery store after practice where some girls had parked their cars. Heather exited the car and opened the door to a different parked vehicle thinking it was hers, something many of us have done. When she noticed a man sitting in the passenger seat, she closed the car door and re-entered the carpool vehicle. Now, that man has been identified as 25-year-old Telo Rodriguez Jr. He got out of his car to confront the girls. Now, Heather says that as she rolled down her window to apologize for the misunderstanding, he began shooting, striking two of the cheerleaders. One victim was treated and released at the scene, another identified by family's 18-year-old, Peyton Washington, currently in the ICU in critical condition. Rodriguez has been arrested and charged with deadly conduct, a third-degree felony in Texas. So, this is horrible. So, Roth was grazed by a bullet, Washington, who's still in the ICU, was shot in the leg in the back. Apparently, Washington was a real superstar in the cheerleading world and is known to people who are competitive and in the know about that particular athletic field as a real star. This is an incredible tragedy and it is compounded by the fact that this is now the third story that we've talked about this week, where someone making an honest mistake, knocking on the door, ringing the doorbell of the wrong house, turning around in a stranger's driveway, and now getting in the wrong car. So, I mean, that in the error of Ubers and lifts, we've all done. I literally put my hand on the handle of the wrong car this morning before getting in the right car on the way to work, or find themselves gunned down. Now, this situation is a little bit different. There was even more of a feeling of premeditation in this one, given that they tried to get into the car. They got back into the air, and at that point, yes, he gets out, comes over, they rolled down their window to apologize, never anticipating it in a million years, I'm sure that they were about to be shot at, and then this happened. So, there are, of course, we're comparing it to similar-ish seeming incidents with the car that pulled into the wrong driveway, turned around, and a woman shot and killed there. And then, of course, this case of the boy, Ralph Yarl, who was shot after ringing the wrong doorbell by the man in the house shot and killed him, shot him in the head, he's been released doing a lot better, thankfully. Now, in both of those cases, the alleged perpetrator was an older man, a 65-year-old man, an 85-year-old man. This was a 25-year-old seemingly Hispanic man, also, you know, race in the case of Yarl is being discussed, because he's black, the shooter was white, there's been some protests, some people calling for there to be racial motivation. I think even one of the law enforcement authorities has suggested they have some evidence that there might be a racist motivation. But in the second case, it seems like everybody involved was white. Right. And that case- We don't know a lot about losses in the car, but at least the woman who was killed was white. Yeah, and in this case, you don't have a, you have a, I guess we don't know the racial makeup of the cheerleader. Precisely, the perpetrator seems to be a Hispanic man and much younger, not an older fellow. So, I don't know. Again, I say what I said about those cases, there is no right, regardless of any stand or ground law. To that effect, there is no right to just shoot someone after they- Yeah, another- You stand your car for another car. Another difference is that, you know, forced-stand-the-ground law to go into effect. Generally speaking, to have a self-defense claim, you have to be able to show that the deadly force was necessary to protect yourself, right? And the exception is defending your castle, which is why people are perhaps increasingly emboldened to shoot from their porches, the way that happened in the first two cases, feeling like they have some protection or some entitlement to do whatever it takes to defend their property. And also, civilly, you don't have to- So defend, right, so the standard ground removes- Without standard ground, there's a duty to retreat if retreat is an option. Like, you can still defend yourself if there's no standard ground law. It's just your first, your support, your duty to retreat. Right. So, Andrew Ground says, if they're coming at you, you don't have to make the decision to retreat, you can fire. But that doesn't apply here, because he affirmatively- He didn't shoot her when she tried to get into the wrong car door. He got out of his car, went to their car, and shot. So, that's not even bringing in a duty to retreat. You don't have a duty to retreat, you can stand your ground, because he then affirmatively went and made the shot. So, that's not going to- So, there's not going to be a protection you can turn to in there. And to be clear, originally, the castle doctrine applied to your house, and the whole point of standing there ground was expanding that castle doctrine to everywhere you are in the state, so that you never have the duty to retreat. This is- That is why this case, it feels like an escalation. It feels like- So, I mean, not that this person had knowledge of the other cases, and it's a literal escalation, but- As we covered- In the first case, it was completely, it seems, unjustified, but happened at someone's doorstep. In the second place, it's someone coming out of their house and shooting folks turning around in their driveway. Nowhere near them, it's hard to make- See what kind of case you can make at all for their being, even a subjective feeling of fear. And now, in this case, two cheerleaders walking away from your car, getting in their own car, prepared to drive away, and to go walk up to them and shoot them, It's really- It's really unconscionable. And it really does raise the question, whether the unconscionability of it will cause anybody to have more robust conversations about how to actually prevent these things from happening, or if we accept that we just live in a world where the second amendment means that sometimes people who are maybe crazy or potentially racist or just evil are going to have the ability to so easily jeopardize the situation. And that's why we jeopardize the lives of others. Sure, and look, I should say that even though we're talking about three similar cases here, these are getting media attention, and so we're talking about them as part of the media. We don't- Just because we've seen three cases, it does not mean necessarily that this is becoming more common or was even more common like this week. Just because these things are getting more media attention, we'd have to do a rigorous- We'd have to look at the statistics. So, you know, if this is actually increasing, it may not be increasing, it may be coincidence, it may be- It may be that three of these kinds of incidents happen every week, and just that first one got some media attention for whatever reason, so now people look on the lookout for others, we don't know. That could be the case. Yeah, it's interesting. I saw- There was some reporting, I believe, in the post about the shooter in the first case with Ralph Yarl having a no-solicitation sign on him. And the implication was that somehow that justified the shooter's behavior that Ralph Yarl, who again thought he was at the right address, somewhere where he was supposed to be to pick up his siblings, you know, should have known better than to knock on that door. You can in fact still solicit a house that has a no-solicitation sign. I know that from my brief, brief career, one of the only like real jobs I had before I started doing journalism, I did door knocking for Comcast in one summer in college, and one of the first things they told us is you can still knock the door. There's just no-solicitation sign, that's not like legally enforceable at all. Yeah, so I mean, I bring it up to say that despite what feels like a very clear-cut situation, a 16-year-old boy picking up his siblings, being gunned down by a guy through glass, you know, there was a barrier between them. There's no words were said between the two, you know, there's still this effort to come up with subjective reasons why a person could be justified in shooting. And I think that really gets to the heart of this where, standard ground laws, qualified immunity, which is what we're talking about in the context of police using disproportionate force, it always comes down to whether a jury, whether the public, believes in a sense of somebody's subjective sense of danger. And when I read the no-solicitation story, it's clear to me that to a lot of people, a young, like a kid, a 16-year-old, especially a black kid, you heard the shooter in that case say that the size of the kid made him afraid. I mean, he looks 16-year-old size to me, and I know there's obviously a range of sizes, but he wasn't some 6'5\", you know, super advanced looking kid. The size of the cheerleaders was intimidating. Exactly. So, you know, given the size of the woman pulling away in her car. That's what's so frustrating. But it seems like, from my subjective belief, I would have imagined that anyone would be trying to make excuses around that first case, and yet we see it happening, which is why I really am skeptical that this will lead to a more robust interrogation of the value of the standard ground law, which puts us in the position of having to make those kind of subjective judgments, instead of being in a different kind of realm where the onus is on the person with the gun to have the obligation not to shoot unless their lives are actually imperiled. Yeah, well, sure. I mean, if these people were operating off of a wrongful impression of the law that it allows them, again, to just kill on-site someone who rings the wrong doorbell or turns around in their driveway, or I think even more unlikely in the third case, you know, tries to get into the wrong... ...the cheerleader tries to get into the wrong door, then that will be something to reflect upon. But it does not give them that power. It is a power to defend yourself when that is necessary rather than just running away and fleeing. Or being in a dangerous situation. Sometimes people try to rob convenience stores or rob a dining establishment. There are, if there is a standard ground thing, in effect, you can fight back. You can not consent to have your property taken or anything like that. And I support that. This is so clearly not that. And people should not treat it as, again, an invitation to go around shooting people for no reason. People who do that should be brought to justice in all contexts. Well, we know more about this story and more about the perpetrator in this case. We will bring that news to you here on Rising. More Rising after this. Twitter has removed its policy against the, quote, targeted misgendering or deadmaiming of transgender individuals, AP reports. Back in 2018, Twitter enacted the policy against deadmaiming, which is referring to a transgender person by their pre-transition name, as well as, quote, purposefully using the wrong gender for someone as a form of harassment. On Monday, Twitter said it would only put warning labels on some tweets that are, quote, potentially in violation of its rules against hateful conduct. President and CEO of the advocacy group GLAD, Sarah Kate Ellis, said, Twitter's decision to convertly roll back its longtime policy is the latest example of just how unsafe the company is for users and advertisers alike. Yeah, this was a tough one. So, first it should be noted that, you know, just in the interview he did with Tucker Carlson, Tucker Carlson asked him a question about how he was able to get rid of 80% of the workforce and still have the site function. And Elon specifically said, well, if you're not trying to one run a kind of a nonprofit charity, but also if you're not doing as much content moderation, he referred to a censorship. I don't mean to make a value judgment there, but if you're not doing as much censorship, then you don't need as much staff. This kind of a decision does seem to be aligned with the idea that you simply can't police as much as the internet and make these kind of discrete content moderation decisions if you made a commitment to really parrying down your staff. So here we are. Substantively- What is that a bad thing? Yeah, substantively, it does feel like this one, many of the content moderation decisions that relied on more subjective assessments of what is harassment always felt a little difficult to police just because they were so subjected. So there were people who were asking, well, if I make reference to something that Caitlyn Jenner did, like winning the decathlon back when she identified as Bruce Jenner, is that dead naming? Did those sentence that I just say qualify as dead naming? Right. And I don't know that content moderators really should be in that position, even though I have a personal belief against dead naming or misgendering people. I just pulled up Wikipedia for Caitlyn Jenner. It lists Caitlyn Jenner's birth name as William Bruce Jenner. This is a famous person who was known to millions of people as Bruce Jenner before they transitioned, and now she's Caitlyn Jenner. And I don't, yeah, I don't understand, for like historical purposes, for almost journalistic purposes, the kind of dead naming prohibition, especially for people who are already known as the other name seems not well thought out to me. Or at least no one's explained why this is such a stark example of harassment that this cannot be tolerated, that this is worse than, I mean, I'm sure people make nasty comments to you online all the time. They make nasty comments. Every day, I am caught a genocide denier and my face is plastered all over the picture of dead children. There's no specific policy of banning every account that does that to you. If somebody spams you with that, maybe they should get banned. And if someone spanned Caitlyn Jenner with, then maybe they should get banned. But just having a policy of just mentioning that and banning that person seems much more ideological to me. Yeah, it is interesting. That's a good point. I have been photoshopped onto cotton fields. I have been subjected to all kinds of racist remarks and photoshops. I had someone once taken a video, a real video of me saying something for the Bernie campaign and then putting subtitles on it that made it look like I was saying something else entirely. This is before AI. That I would report. And I reported all of those things and nothing has ever happened. Nothing has ever happened. And I'm not even necessarily complaining about that, but it is, I think a lot of people react to, including some trans activists, is that what gets taken down is very inconsistent. And the realm of Elon. And if you don't want to see that, you can always block this person and then you can't see them doing this. You have Twitter and other social media sites empower you to make moderation decisions on behalf of what you yourself consume. Rather than having one rule that we must all abide by that obviously can't be enforced with any sort of rigor and fairness, the better thing is to empower individual users to have more tools and choices to see what kind of things they can see. I think that's right. But the question is, I think on the realm of Elon, is it the case that he is saying, okay, we're not going to do content moderation on this area, which I think there's a legitimate basis for. At the same time that he does seem very responsive to concerns of people from his own kind of political and ideological cohort. So people were remarking on how responsive he was to the Matt Walsh hacking. His Twitter was hacked earlier this week. He was tweeting about a bunch of things. Time flies in here. He was tweeting. He was obviously not Matt Walsh. Apparently there was a deeper kind of security breach. I don't think it's been fixed yet. I believe my understanding was that it had. And people were saying, well, it seems like your friends, Ian, Ian, Miles, Chong, whomever, they tweeted at you something and you immediately are tweeting back and resolving these issues. Meanwhile, if a random person has an issue with Twitter, they get a poo emoji response. And what's going on here? We saw them dance back and forth with Kanye West. I'm on his Twitter page and it has a link in his profile that directs to this. I can't imagine this is something that the Sassy shooters can spotify. So do you think that he just self-described as a theocratic fascist and that's been removed from his Twitter bio? So yeah, this has not been fixed yet. That doesn't say theocratic fascist is evidence that it's not the real metal. Indeed. So what do you make of the real issue here isn't the decision that's been made to not police dead naming, et cetera. But that there seems to be no predictable standards about how Twitter is being regulated. Yeah, I think that's correct. More transparency around the rules, more explanation to individual accounts when some kind of moderation action is taken against them, whether it's content deleted or especially content turned down. Explain to people why that is and what they can do to get back in the good graces of the site. Those are the changes I would like to see. But yes, to me having this broad prohibition against acknowledging that someone might have gone by a different name earlier seemed pretty extreme to me and not. And that's just not in keeping with how harassment is generally approached on the site if you're a person as you and I are who engage in kind of public conversation and debates and battles that are heated and sometimes encourage and draw heated. Comments and response from people and we've just kind of learned to shrug that off and to some degree that's just kind of what you have to sign up for if you're going to be a pocket person on social media. Sometimes you and another prominent black Bernie campaign or like Nina Turner have their faces photoshopped onto Diamond and Silk's body. And that's just to me you got to live with. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon had his own critique of the self-described chief twit Elon Musk after his series of interviews with Tucker Carlson. He said quote anybody who watched that interview with Tucker Carlson last night that's buying this guy's snake oil, you're a fool. Here's more of Musk and Carlson's chat from last night. I mean the urge to have sex and to procreate is after breathing and eating the most basic urge. How has it been subverted? Well just in the past we could rely upon simple limbic system rewards in order to procreate. But once you have birth control and you know. We should stay dressed. Now you can still satisfy the limbic instinct but not procreate. So we haven't yet evolved to deal with that because this is all fairly recent in the last 50 years or so. And for the poor birth control. I'm sort of worried that hey civilization you know if we don't make enough people to at least sustain our numbers perhaps increase a little bit then civilization is going to crumble. This is the old question of like will civilization end with a bang or a whimper? Well it's currently trying to end with a whimper in adult diapers. Yes. Which is depressing as hell. I didn't have Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson doing made a listen discourse on my bagel card. Elon Musk is doing more than any person alive except maybe Nick Cannon to repopulate the earth. He practices what he's preaching with about three different. I don't know what Steve Bannon's gripe was with the interview specifically. Although Bannon is a very Trump loyalist person and Elon Musk has suggested in his comments that he's more of a Santa's person than a Trump person so it could just be that. Yeah it is this is the clip that was going around the internet last night. I don't know how much there is. I don't think it was that wild. I don't know people were like. Well I think it's because there's part of it. There's this bigger kind of natalist movement that has been associated with certain kind of great replacements that ideology is the idea that white people need to have more babies because they're losing out in the kind of a pro creative arms race as it were and the perception that there's something inherently better, superior, valuable about white people means that they need to hurry it up. That is I think the subtext of why people find this so disturbing. Of course it doesn't sound that different from what Vanessa Lachey was saying and me famously delayed reunion episode of Love Is Blind earlier this week. So maybe it isn't really about great replacement. Maybe it's just a lot of people with baby fever. I know which I didn't watch and you have been trying to get me interested in all weeks. Seriously every time the cameras are off, Brie rings up Love Is Blind. More rising right after this. CNN's Jake Tapper seemed to barely hold his composure as he read the results of the Dominion Voting Systems Landmark defamation case against Fox News. Let's watch. The Dominion's lawyer saying quote today represents a bringing endorsement for truth and for democracy Fox trying to put a positive face on what can only be interpreted as one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism. Fox issued a statement saying quote we are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute. With Dominion Voting Systems we acknowledge the court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. The settlement reflects, I'm sorry this is going to be difficult to say with a straight face. This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve the dispute with Dominion amicably instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial allows the country to move forward from these issues. CNN's former anchor Brian Stelter waited on the case to hear he is on news nations Dan Abrams live on Tuesday. I figured there would be a settlement because that's what happens in these cases. The lawyers for Dominion expertly tortured Fox in public pushed them all the way up into a courtroom. The jury was seated ready to go. That's exactly when you would expect a settlement. However, the dollar figure is jaw dropping even for Fox which has $4 billion in the bank which makes loads of profits thanks to Fox News. It is still amazing to see this company have to pay out more than three quarters of a billion dollars even for Fox. That's a very big deal. I would think that hundreds of millions of more is still worth it to Fox rather than having to give an on air retraction. And rather than having Rupert Murdoch test a- That's for sure. Those are the two big pieces they don't have to worry about now. He's 92 or something years old just broke up with a woman he was going to get married to. You're not having the best time of his life right now. Now he doesn't have to show up in Wilmington and talk about what went wrong at his network. Now he doesn't have to face that. And neither does Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity or any of the other slides. Dan Abrams also took the opportunity to ask Stelter about getting the acts from the network. Here's what he said. I really truly don't know. I know I had a popular show by CNN standards and I know that it was pretty cheap to produce. But I also know every show gets canceled eventually. Sorry. Not going to table. Stelter said CNN appears to be trying to quote lower the temperature and he hopes the network find success. All right. Did you find Tapper's barely suppressed glee here to be distasteful? Is he in a good position from his own network to be talking about journalistic integrity? Look, I think Jake Tapper is one of the better and fairer reporters in general and I see you side-eyeing me so maybe you don't agree. But I don't have any problem with Jake Tapper. He's actually shared my work in the past when I, my biggest story ever when I was like the first person to say the Covington kids were being had been totally wrongly portrayed by the media. I wrote an article. I tweeted it. He shared it immediately. One of the reasons it had so much penetration in like the mainstream, my perspective was because he shared it. So I criticize him when I disagree with him and I applaud him when he does things I like. You could say it was not the most professional moment but let's all be honest. Like no one is neutral. Everyone has a perspective. CNN hates Fox. Fox hates CNN. Turned about his fair play. I've said this before. Everyone on Fox would make fun of CNN in a similar position. So I think it would be a bit rich if I expected Jake Tapper to keep his composure together there. They're loving it and that's fine. Now I would say that if we go into journalism standards, CNN and other mainstream news agencies have promoted narratives that I think are very false and damaging. Not all of them. Not everything they say is false. Not making that claim. But they were totally bought in MSNBC even more so to Russiagate to a just totally harmful, pernicious, wrong idea that we got Trump because of the pernicious influence of Russian bad actors on social media that has empowered the media to demand greater and greater strangulation of discourse online. I think that is very bad and damaging. I think mainstream media played a prime role in it. I think they were suckers for fraudulent stories. How many of them shrieked at us and yelled at us? Said we were racist for wondering about the lab leak idea saying that was a racist conspiracy theory. That's been retracted. I'm sure plenty of them. I'm not pointing fingers at specific people but I'm sure plenty of mainstream people pointing to Russia immediately in the wake of Nord Stream. All that kind of stuff. The Rachel Maddow supercut of saying if you get the vaccine you won't get COVID. Yeah, yeah. And then all the COVID stuff. Let's all be wary of our journalistic practice. I thought that Brian Stelter made some really good points. I think he's absolutely right about trial being used as an incentive to settle and that oftentimes there's a real expectation you're going to go. And that's what the question is, how close can you get? It's kind of a game of chicken. And that the settlement amount really is extraordinary. In an earlier segment I compared it to the overall yearly earnings of Dominion Voting Systems, which are in the kind of double digit millions, not in the triple digit millions. So the settlement was just under 800 million. So it's a huge win fall for them. But it's also worth maybe comparing it to the last big Fox settlement over the sexual harassment scandal a few years ago, which was a $90 million settlement. And this is almost 10 times that. So Brian Stelter pointing out that Fox's balance sheet is huge, but even $4 billion, $750, nearly $800 million is a pretty big chunk out of even a very well performing companies bottom line. And so I know that some liberals are hand-reading saying, well, it wasn't anywhere close to the 1.6 billion. I mean, that's a number that you ask for, not a number that you necessarily think you're going to get. And this does seem to be something that is financially damaging to Fox and might have some effect on behavior to the extent that we agree that journalistic institutions shouldn't knowingly put people on the air that they know are going to tell lies about other people or other corporations. And do so in order to turn a profit. Right. And even though Dominion had a lot of things going for them in this, in what had come out of the previous core cases to decide if we should even get to a jury trial, they had a lot of momentum behind them. But again, the bar is really high to prove defamation for a good reason because we don't want to prevent media companies from being able to report and potentially air in the course of reporting, difficult stories. Other countries have, it's much easier to prove liable in defamation in some of our pure countries, Australia being one of them, UK being another. And that has had the effect of silent, actually a lot of the early Me Too reporting wouldn't have been possible in those countries because you just can't say outrageous things about people without getting sued. So we are a free speech country, warts and all. And as I said, I worried about the risk of even slightly chinking away at that, even if maybe this was a case as some agree just wrongdoing. But we didn't get there and they paid out. 787.5 million dollars so that Rupert Murdoch doesn't have to go to trial. So it doesn't have to be deposed so that they don't have to root through his personal documents. I mean, that's a big chunk of money, but for someone like Rupert Murdoch, it really might be worth it. Indeed, more rising right after this. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has officially announced his presidency today. A new poll shows 14% of Biden voters are with him. Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, David Paligos, told USA Today in 2020 Joe Biden received more votes than any other president in US history. If the poll tells us that those same voters are open to other Democrats to wage a spirited primary. Kennedy, although a long shot at this point, starts in double digits and can't be ignored. So obviously he is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, former Attorney General when his brother, President Kennedy, was president, also assassinated like his brother. And so there's the family legacy, etc. Kennedy's a very popular family, very popular presidency for a certain American of a certain age of a certain generation. So there's that. Obviously he is most known. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is most known to the mainstream media as someone having an extremely anti vaccine agenda, and one predating COVID and all the discussion around COVID vaccines. But of course, he also stands for a lot of other things, a lot of other left wing causes, environmental causes, foreign policy, non interventionism, probably other things that you know would know more about than I do. Yeah, he was an environmental lawyer for most of his career, also a professor I believe at Pace. And so when we were listening to Snim as a speech in the break, it's ongoing as we are talking. And we'll try to get someone who was on the ground there to talk more about it later. Right, tomorrow hopefully. But this is a person who has also really foregrounded environmental rights issues and in a context where Joe Biden has frankly betrayed the interest of the environmental lives. During the course, this presidency, most recently opening up the Arctic to this conical Phillips deal. There is going to be a significant amount of appeal both on the left on that issue and the anti interventionism issues. And I think on the right for people who are very frustrated with how the Biden administration and frankly the Trump administration as well handled COVID and the lockdowns that they felt like lasted longer than they should have and weren't very well tailored to actually prevent anything from being able to be a candidate who I think will just straight up appeal more to people on the right than to people in the Democratic coalition, which has, you know, moved so far away from a Robert F Kennedy junior position on, well, not just on vaccines, the importance, necessity of vaccines has become very central to the kind of mainstream Democratic consensus on how COVID should be handled and other mitigation efforts as well as on foreign policy, a kind of hawkishness, very much now at the root of the Democratic identity with respect to Russia and Ukraine. So we will see. Yeah, so if you go to his website, you see the kind of name really emphasized. He says, I'm a candidate for the next year. But he's really really, very much now at the root of the Democratic identity with respect to Russia and Ukraine. So we will see. the Kennedy name really emphasized. He says, I'm a Kennedy Democrat very prominently on the front page above pictures of his father and mother and family pictures with his uncle in the Oval Office. And he's really clearly leaning into the power of that light name and the identity that so many Americans have with that family. And when you look at his political priorities, he lists honest government, which you heard him talk about a little bit in his speech, corruption, etc. Reconciliation, bringing America together, healing the political divide, getting rid of the divisiveness, which is also always a really popular talking point for politicians. The environment, what he calls revitalization, which is improving the economy, turning the economy around, peace with a section bring it home, which suggests this kind of anti-war ethos is going to be really core to this. And the final category here is civil liberties with a headline of restore our rights, restoring fundamental civil liberties and trying in the Bill of Rights to hold the essence of what America can be. So it's a little bit big at this point. I don't think that there's an expectation to have detailed policy promulgated at this point. But in terms of the broad outline, he does seem to have a finger on the pulse of a kind of consensus view. But I think frankly, majority of Americans very much hold. This is this is so far for the course for how the mainstream media handles these things. So I just I'm looking around for coverage. Here's an ABC News article from a week ago saying some experts fear rise in medical misinformation following RFK Jr.'s presidential announcement. Medical misinformation. Would they say that when Joe Biden inevitably declares that he's running again? Are they going to I think and have the same fears of medical misinformation? Joe Biden who called this a pandemic of the unvaccinated and said it's patriotic to get vaccinated so you won't spread it to other people or any you know any of the other mainstream figures who have said things about vaccines that are incorrect. Yeah, of course not. Yeah, look, this this looks kind of good. I mean, it is broad strokes in the way that campaign websites typically are broad have broad strokes. But there was this interesting kind of specificity in here. He points out in the environmental section that he was instrumental in transforming the Hudson from a dead river into one of America's cleanest. He did it so by uniting liberal environmentalists with conservative rod and gun folks who share a desire for a clean, healthy environment. He has a quote saying good environmental policy 100% of the time is identical to good economic policy. I'm sure people will debate that but I think that's a constructive framing because I think so much of what's wrong with environmental policy is that these externalities they they cost money but these costs are put on to the public not on the corporations that cause the problems and we're seeing that in East Palestine. We saw it with the shed Ron spill in Ecuador and the Amazon and we see it all across the country as communities are polluted. So this feels like a very strong of a messaging perspective even if it might at this juncture be thin on the particulars. Well, reporter at semaphore David Weigel is covering Kennedy's rally in his speech. He reportedly said quote the government lies to us. We all know it. Fact check true. Kennedy says citing low poll numbers in institutions. We know the media lies to us now and everybody knows it. Quote a lot of the misinformation's just statements that depart from government orthodoxy. You know you're being lied to and you know you're being silenced. Kennedy ties his campaign to his father saying that when RFK announced he had not a single molecule in him saying he could win the democratic nomination. The liberal press was 100% against him. That hopelessness in his campaign freed him to tell the truth to the American people. So, you know hitting some subjects there again painting in broad strokes but we know we have been misled by the government on a wide variety of fronts that is well known to to right wing people to libertarians to people on the left. It's actually well known even to like plain old liberal Democrats if they're being honest with themselves and if they're like doing a flashback to the George Bush years where they were all you know freely able to admit that. Sure. Until things change. Yeah and I got to say on Ukraine which I think is why a lot of people will be attracted to this particular candidacy. He says you know he will be he will start the process of unwinding empire. Bring the troops home. Stop racking up and pay a bull debt to fight one more after another. He says in Ukraine the most important priority is to end the suffering of the Ukrainian people victims of a brutal Russian invasion and also victims of American geopolitical machinations going back at least in 2014. He says diplomacy has never really been tried. We will offer to withdraw our troops and nuclear capable missiles from Russia's borders. Russia will withdraw its troops from Ukraine and guarantees freedom and independence. UN peacekeepers will guarantee peace to the Russian speaking eastern regions. We will put it into this war etc. What a cooke kidding. Yeah of course that all sounds very logical and reasonable and you know why it's not. He cannot claim that Russia will withdraw its troops obviously. He can't make those kind of declarations but the idea that that the diplomacy first should be tried and the goal should not be continuing American empire is going to resonate with a lot of folks. So I look forward to covering this candidacy. For sure. Well we'll have more rising right after this. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is getting dragged over his feud with Disney. Members of his own party. On Tuesday former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie mirrored Donald Trump's criticism of DeSantis's crusade. Here's what he told news sites simaphore when asked about it yesterday. I'm a conservative and I believe as a conservative the job of government is in the main to stay out of the business of business. Like I don't think we should be heavily regulating business. I don't think we should be telling business what to do what to say how to think. And I believe that's what conservatives have believed for as long as I've been alive. I don't think Ron DeSantis is a conservative based on his actions towards Disney. I mean you know where we headed here now that if you express disagreement in this country the government is allowed to punish you. To me that's what I always thought liberals did. This week DeSantis dug his feet in deeper in the clash with Disney announcing a new bill that could revoke development agreements require regular inspections of its theme parks and possibly convert the land around Disney World into a state park or even a prison. Here he is on Monday. And at the end of the day we made the decision as a state as a people through the medium of our elections that we would not have one corporation serving as its own government. That's not good government and it's not something that we want to entertain in Florida any longer and whatever rationale there was 60 years ago to do that. Clearly now we're in a much different era as a state. We've got a lot of competitors that are treated differently. A lot of businesses and individuals treated differently so we don't want to do that. So we want to make sure that Disney lives under the same laws as everybody else. DeSantis first clashed with Disney after former CEO Bob Chapix spoke out against Florida's Don't Say Gay Bill. So what do you think? Magga Kingdom declares war on Magic Kingdom. Look I do I think it's worth going back. I want more of a laugh of that. Sorry Robbie. Continue. Continue. Look remember that this started because DeSantis promulgated this bill. Some people call it a Don't Say Gay Bill. Some people don't. Some people just call it by whatever. Oh yeah I don't even honestly remember what it was called. Sorry but for these purposes I'm just going to call it the Don't Say Gay Bill. Disney employees pressured the Disney CEO to say something. There was criticism of CEO Bob Chapix for not for how it was handled. So a statement was released that basically said that this company has been telling stories for 100 years. Those stories have had a meaningful positive impact on the world and one of the reasons why is because of one of our core values of storytelling is inclusion and acceptance and tolerance and we can't lose that. Okay. In response DeSantis launches what feels like an all-out war from Disney's perspective on it that started with ending its special tax status which fine. I mean like there. Right well that's what I was gonna say to some of this like no I so I agree with I am of more of the Chris Christie bent on the government not getting involved with business. I don't actually know that that's where the Republican Party honestly is anymore so I you know what it means to be a conservative I think has changed but it not necessarily for the better in my own view but it has changed but but I don't think there should be like special carve outs for specific firms. Right so like I was gonna say if you have a reason a rationale to in that special relationship fine but it's very obviously not about a business decision a financial decision a tactical decision about how to keep an important company when it's Florida's biggest employers in the state it was about revenge and so Chris Christie's point that now we not only have that we have him now threatening to build a prison next to America's theme park it feels like the government using whatever resources it has to punish a business because it simply made a statement that doesn't that that doesn't agree with a state policy. Yeah and this is why I have ultimately said I think this is foolish and I have actually likened it to the jaw boning done by the government to influence social media companies to make speech related decisions that I don't agree with using ultimately the threat of regulation at many of these hearings where both democrats and republicans say do this or else and the else being we're gonna expand your we're gonna break up your company or we're gonna expand your your liability risk by changing section 230 whatever that's similar I think is this a smart way to fight you know now fighting wokeness obviously is important to republican primary voters yeah yeah you're laughing more at that than my absurd yes what look what happened in midterms is that it at some no I said it's a republican primary vote okay I didn't say to the broader necessary american electorate we're he's in a battle with Donald Trump maybe with Chris Christie maybe with Mike Pence with Nikki Haley with vivic rama swami who's made like anti-wokeness a crusade for himself uh wokeness what we're describing as is not popular for the kinds of people you gotta you're gonna have to turn out to be the republican nominee so maybe this fight makes sense from the you know he's the real person who fights Trump thinks this is kind of stupid because trump is ultimately trump is a New York liberal somewhat on on issues of sexuality and and identity and maybe not race stuff you can say what you want about i think that trump's kids make him i was watching i would not be anti-git i was just watching a video put it out by a conservative organization trying to say desantis is the if you're mad about woke transgender ideology stuff desantis is your guy not trump playing all these clips of trump saying yeah katelyn jennifer can use whatever bathroom a trump tower she wants to you because i think actually donald trump is much much what i was saying where where people are that's what i was just saying but he's not the king i don't think that he is the king he's literally like i said yeah but you said that he was basically a new or a new york uh liberal on social issues i think that that is not entirely true he bust the door open for what politicians were able to say that was anti-woke literally coming down as golden s glider talking about you know mexico's not sitting there best talking about uh hatie is a shit whole country i mean nobody in terms of what they actually say the words come out of their mouth on race on as far as trump on racial issues now i would say desantis for all they talk about woke woke woke woke is really this nice holding place for them to sit in or they don't actually have to say the thing that's anti-woke and this is a tell desamis will sit there and pass policies about being anti-woke and he will say you shouldn't have to do this and that and respect somebody's you know gender identity and la la la la la la is he gonna dead name someone on air well he could on tjor and white chump chump with his arm around katlyn jennor saying this is my friend would refer to her as bruce and nobody would know about that i mean like not like in a vindictive way but i i could totally say what everyone wants to say but that no one's gonna put chump in a corner okay right if you want the entertainment and the wild ride and the occasional coarseness and just totally unscripted insanity you're going to refer from every time but if you're a republican primary voter who wants to see actual government action taken against wokeness then this is you might prefer desantis or people are going to make the case for desantis i mean this is to my mind this is the issue with the crusade against wokeness is that if you're being a principled you know free market conservative or libertarian or like you know government leave companies or leave everybody alone person your frustration with wokeness cannot very effectively be channeled into political action because as christy said there we don't want the government to do things of that nature you can i've tried my best to redirect it to either actual government initiatives to accomplish censorship or to accomplish dei type stuff in schools and things like that that if it is you know publicly funded or publicly pushed and provided for that we can get rid of that's still consistent with our principles yeah let's focus there instead of you know trying to trying to jail micky yeah i mean look at look at the literally hey oh what a what a prison just uh happened right next to your theme park yeah it's a it's a it's an open threat and remember the posture of this uh he desantis passes legislation probably it's legislation to affect the way that would affect the way that lgbt people can live their lives in florida legislation whatever you think about it good or bad he does an actual law that infringes on people's ability to live the way they want disney says hey i don't like that law speech legislation followed by speech saying i don't like that legislation followed by the government using its will to threaten disneyland with removing a tax status status doing a bunch of other things and now putting a literal prison next to america's playground i don't know if it would have been throwing around words like authoritarian and who's forcing people to say what forcing the trans movement is forcing this and i have to believe in your fiction blah blah blah there's i see a lot of force in this scenario and i got to say it's not coming from the side of the trans community i will note and i learned this detail just yesterday apparently it's in desantis's new book him and his wife got married at disney world she's a big disney person and he kind of has a very passive aggressive i wasn't but she was so maybe this is personal revenge is a dish best of her cold yes we have a disneyland household oh boy more rising after this this is so bad it gets worse every day these signs have flipped 180 degrees with no new evidence produced a paper not based on facts and then may have used that paper to brief the intelligence community and suppress the lab leak to pathosys this is a how to manual and orchestrating a cover up by using some of the most powerful and influential institutions in our country if you ask me this will set in motion by dr fauci to hide us funding of gain of function research and dodge accountability for a virus that has killed more than one million americans this must be investigated thank you mr chairman and i you'll back now that was republican representative james komer during yesterday's second house subcommittee hearing on the origins of covid the biggest takeaway from the hearing was how politics ultimately led to the demise of any efficient investigations into what caused the pandemic at least that's what reporter at us writes no emily cop argues and she joins us now to discuss welcome emily so glad to have you with us hey great to be here so what has been your impression of this latest subcommittee meeting i know the former director of national intelligence we discussed this yesterday john ratcliffe gave his impression that it was a lab leak that that was the better supported theory and he actually mentioned um some classified documents that we've not seen yet that he's seen that indicates that he leans this way that certainly peaked my curiosity what did you think yeah i i think you covered it well there i mean i think this second hearing um by the select uh subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic under house republicans covered us intelligence and it gave a look behind the curtain as to why us intelligence wasn't acted upon sooner so if we rewind for a second to 2020 we now know that the director of national intelligence the cdc director and the secretary of state all believed that a lab origin was most likely in 2020 yet any meaningful investigation into that possibility has sputtered for three years now how could that be um and i think this hearing showed that there were two major reasons and those reasons are beijing and washington and as you mentioned robbie um former director of national intelligence john ratcliffe made sort of an explosive claim which is that the intelligence community in fact does have enough evidence to implicate a lab origin um but won't advance that assessment because of political reasons um more specifically there seems to be some intimidation about the enormous geopolitical consequences of that assessment as it relates to the us china relationship and ratcliffe also speculated that there is some antipathy towards donald trump in the intelligence community and a real reluctance to advance a theory that could help him politically or even be viewed as helping him politically that's interesting can you speak a little bit more to the geopolitical implications because it does feel sometimes like um it isn't argued rather i should say that some of the conservative appetite for investigating lab leak theory and you know pointing to china as a chief cause of the pandemic is related to ratcheting up of um an interest in conflict with china uh as opposed to as kind of sincere or maybe in addition to as sincere belief that lab leak theory uh is the likely cause of the pandemic uh what might be the outcome of proving as it were that lab leak really was the cause you know it's hard for me to say i don't have a crystal ball but i think the questions you're asking are extremely fair and are things that i try to be mindful of as i do this reporting but you know on the other hand we've lost over a million of our loved ones and it's also not acceptable to accept um sown walling from Beijing you know Beijing has destroyed viral samples disappeared coronavirus data jailed journalists for asking the wrong questions um and i think this pandemic has raised a lot of important questions about how we have a discussion when a novel pathogen emerges especially you know in this case there's so much circumstantial evidence pointing to a possible lab related accident as the origin of the this novel pathogen we need to be able to have some sort of mechanism where countries can talk about that possibility and have a transparent conversation and i think this pandemic has showed that the biological weapons convention um is really not equipped to keep up with the revolution going on right now and set the in synthetic biology specifically you know with regard to gain a function research and the ability to make viruses more transmissible and more dangerous in the lab with more ease than ever before you know the biological weapons convention um is from the 70s so they just couldn't have anticipated you know not only this new technology but also the way in that civilian programs devoted to finding new medical countermeasures can sometimes look like biological programs and how we distinguish those two um and so i totally hear you and i think that's a real concern um but at the same time there needs to be a conversation about when a novel pathogen emerges very close to a lab and when that lab has some sort of military involvement what is the next step for us it's like a global community let's react to a little bit more of the hearing let's play that working with odini we at state arranged to make this information public some of our colleagues warned us not to they said not to highlight china's gain of function research lest we draw attention to the us government's own role in such research and open a pandora's box it wasn't clear exactly what these colleagues feared but their seeming demand for non transparency was unpersuasive on january 15 2021 we published a fact sheet on activity at the Wuhan institute of virology in the months that followed the lab league possibility began to force its way into the mainstream by may 2021 president biden himself recognized the significance of the lab league possibility and ordered a 90 day review of u.s. intelligence unfortunately progress since then has been limited we now know that the fbi and the department of energy both assess that a lab league is most likely that's important but we don't need a running intelligence community straw poll as much as we need a transparent whole of government campaign to recognize the gravely high stakes of the lab league possibility and pursue appropriate policy reforms yeah i would add to that we need that and also we need transparency around the actual documents and intelligence from my point of view that is causing some of these uh people inside the government to make these conclusions the energy department reaching this conclusion the fbi reaching this conclusion a former cdc director having reached this conclusion and so on and so forth um it's interesting that they've decided after looking at at whatever materials or intelligence they have access to the lab league is more likely but when will the people be able to make that judgment for themselves right i mean i think the scope of this hearing was limited some somewhat in the fact that the public doesn't have access to the full scope of evidence here um and we know that the department of energy recently changed its assessment to favor a lab origin with low confidence um and uh david fieth mentioned the fact that there is some intelligence indicating that wuhan institute of virology researchers became sick in the autumn of 2019 but the public hasn't had the opportunity to evaluate that evidence for themselves and the chair of the committee brad wenstrapt talked about the fact that he had sent a letter in february to odni asking for the documents and evidence undergirding the 90 day intelligence review that ended up being inconclusive that biden ordered in 2021 he also asked hey what sort of experts were you talking about or were you talking to what sort of virologists were you consulting on this because um we know through four-year documents that some virologists were not fully upfront about the possibility of a lab origin and so there is concern that some of those same conflicted virologists and who in some cases had direct collaborations with the wuhan institute of virology were also the virologist tapped to advise the intelligence community and unfortunately you know odni hasn't produced a single document so um so very little progress there kind of not at the fault of the committee but um we also know that in march president biden signed a bill to declassify certain intelligence related to the pandemic including information about those wuhan institute of virology researchers who got sick within 90 days so hopefully we'll get some more information soon maybe not all of the intelligence but um certainly a bigger piece of the puzzle well we hope to have you back to discuss that information if and when it finally comes out thank you so much for your reporting here thanks guys appreciate it so in a recent sub-stack piece lee fong reports that back in january of 2000 msnbc host mehta has saan authored a column in defense of spanking children no harm in smacking that is nearly a word-for-word duplication of the article went to spank published two years earlier in us news and world report here to discuss is author and journalist lee fong welcome lee thanks for having me now this this is a wild one i look i remember the days when you me me metty glenn used to be all together under one christmas party roof at the intercept and now it sounds like fun times so much has happened since then obviously let's go back to the beginning of this dispute which would you be would it be fair to say happened around uh tayini's interview with mehta has saan over the twitter files uh then spilled out over inches of accusations that mehta has saan made about you as you defended matt tayini's twitter files reporting and now there's this follow-up reporting uh on uh mehta has saan's previous journalistic mistakes shall we call it how how do you see all of this as playing out look um i think there's a big focus on what on the tv interview between tayini and mehta has saan but the most serious allegation came after the interview on twitter after that interview mehta has saan accused matt tayini of perjury of lying under oath in congress you know that's a felony with prison time that's what michael cohen uh was uh convicted of with prison time that's what roger stone was convicted of um it's a very serious offense and you know mehta made this very scurrilous charge and claimed that tayini was wrong when he said that an arm of uh the department of homeland security was involved with a an NGO in contacting twitter during the 2020 election for censorship actions for you know content moderation policies and look i've reported on this even before the twitter files i've looked you know for weeks at this issue at you know hundreds if not thousands of documents and i simply corrected the record i said that matt tayini in his congressional testimony was 100 accurate i published new documents new emails i surfaced old reporting that i've done you know i did a very detailed response to this allegation that matt tayini be lied under oath that that meti uh lodged um rather than a uh a substantive response uh to my reporting um meti went into the gutter uh he started claiming that i was a careerist that i'm a liar and you know met that i'm a slama phobic bigot which is the most absurd claim possible you know absolutely base this claim uh and you know a lot of readers encouraged me to um look into medley's uh career and into his background that a lot of these claims against me were cases of projection um so and that's what i did you know at my sub-stack i went back uh into 20 years of medley's writing um you know finding lots of cases of i think very sloppy citation or straight up plagiarism and the exact type of career careerism that i think people find problematic in journalism that rather than having a principled approach to the news to journalism um meti has has switched his positions and taken whatever uh kind of value is convenient for advancing his career you know someone who claimed to be against abortion and you know uh against abortion rights suddenly flipped flops on that and now uh demonizes anyone who is anti-abortion as you know motivated by white supremacy and racism i mean it's it's a little bit absurd and i would just encourage anyone to read my sub-stack take a look at the allegations it you know there's a particularly intellectually lazy form of journalism that that meti kind of specializes in and i think the plagiarism example speak to that right and uh you know i think matt taiyvi and his exchange with meti a little bit tried to you know point out well well while msnbc was you know what what did you do to correct the record when msnbc was saying all sorts of things about russia gate for instance and he tried to say he did nothing to do with that and i think maybe you or matt or someone maybe was glenn someone found some examples of him doing um exactly that so you know we're not trying to to undermine the guy in a vacuum or so like go back 20 years ago to find uh something he did wrong but he was very much harping on matt for um for these you know couple errors that matt acknowledge and then correct it and then especially the thing you pointed out it's absolutely true is it from you know looking at what you've reported and and and others that that this um that the the the two uh agencies involved the the government agency and the non-profit and many tried to suggest that it was just well you you know transpose the two but both were involved in this project of flagging um tweets on behalf of the government no i i find this kind of all very despicable look we all get things wrong in our journalism i think what how we act as journalists is how quickly we move to correct the record and and really explain the truth you know i mean it's reporting on on this kind of complicated issues can be messy it can be difficult but you know matt tivy in one tweet uh mixed up one acronym and he quickly corrected the record many has engaged in many lives in this whole process you know lying about never talking about the hunter Biden laptop he did uh lying about you know never kind of like reporting on on this kind of some of these more scurrilous russia uh gate allegations he did and then the most serious allegation here is that matt tivy lied uh under oath to congress and this is a claim that meds repeated over and over again this again this is perjury this is serious stuff this is you know mattrameti made this claim aoc then retweeted and and and said you know look look let's kind of undermine all the twitter files reporting you know this this is kind of like very petty personalized attacks uh and that aren't true you know like this claim that uh matt tivy got it wrong i've demonstrably showed that tivy was right when when talking about sisa this is arm of department of homeland security that was highly involved in content moderation policies at facebook and twitter and other social media companies um you know really highly embedded in these firms and pressuring them on a regular basis and betty uh you know quickly claiming that this was a lie and this undermined the entire thesis of the twitter files look you know i've reported on the on twitter documents many other reporters have i think this is a kind of juvenile attempt to obscure the actual contents of the revelations though of reporting um this attempt to discredit all the journalism because of one error in one tweet and you know i i find it very distasteful. yeah lee i i got to say i found your reporting on the twitter files in particular one of my favorite reads it was so substantive and one of the most frustrating aspects of watching the interview with taybi and meti was the failure of meti to really engage in the substance and the value the broader value of the twitter files despite any mistake that might exist here or there so to that end i want to ask you you know very shortly after that interview of course uh meti ebe and elan must seem to get into their own dispute about the nature of uh sub stack and matt taybi's relationship with them and uh in a twitter live last week uh elan must say that all good things basically have to come to an end and that the twitter files is basically over i know that matt taybi was planning before that to hire journalists to continue the work on the files including erin matte and i believe you have now left the intercept and are working over at sub stack are there any plans to continue reporting on the twitter files? yeah i i have um a lot of research i was on i visited twitter for a few days in late december and early january and um i was able to write down and copy a lot of information so i have more stories coming you know i've reported on the pentagons on kind of covert ops influence operations that they had this gigantic network of fake accounts and fake news sites on the middle lease that were parroting the the pentagons line and trying to shape middle lease opinion with complete secrecy that and that twitter had full knowledge of this operation that even created a special kind of bot of this whitelist bot that um kind of amplified these accounts i had at the same time twitter was telling the public that they were doing everything they could to shut down every state back influence operation that you know any time any government does this they'll shut it down no they were working as a concierge service for the pentagon to spread the pentagons propaganda on on wars in and yemen in syria and beyond um and i've also looked at how um pharmaceutical companies were lobbying uh twitter for censorship that they that a pharmaceutical funded uh group had backdoor access and and were shaping some of the content decisions in terms of shadow banning and blocking certain counts that were critical of certain covid policies but i'm just getting started there's going to be more there i don't i can't really speak towards uh you know what elon must will or won't do it kind of doesn't matter for my reporting i'd love to have more access but you know we'll see tbd but i have more material and more reporting to come well we look forward very much to reading that lee thank you so much for joining us hey thanks for having me thank you i should i should mention that we did reach out to medley his son via msnbc for comment and inviting him on the show at any time we haven't heard back yet uh we'll see you later lee take care here are twitter files journalist matt tavie or maybe i should say former twitter files journalist matt tavie's latest thoughts on his relationship with twitter c o elon musk he is restricting you or from putting your articles on twitter because you're also putting them on sub stack who he sees as a competitor what do you want people to understand about that i think this is a misunderstanding i mean i was working at sub stack when i uh i was a sub stack contributor when i started doing the twitter files i feel like i'm caught in the middle of a dispute between two companies um i like elon a lot i think he's got um a lot of good qualities and i think he did a tremendous thing for the public and opening up the twitter files uh for for the population to see i hope he continues doing that you know if he's not happy with me there's and lots of other journalists who can do that job um but it's it's unfortunate because i think you know this this whole situation people learned a lot uh you know a lot of things that they would never have learned without um you know him to making that very very significant decision Fox News host Martha McCollum followed up with this if he's shutting you down do you think that he is the proponent of free speech that he purports to be well that's clearly problematic right i mean i i think that's one of the things i i feel saddest about is that it undermines the argument um you know that we need free speech across the internet when the person who you know identified uh initially as the proponent of free speech is you know blocking somebody because you know they're part of a commercial dispute um or for some other reason people see that i actually think the algorithmic censorship is much more dangerous and much more severe but these individual instances of sort of cartoon censorship are are what people are going to pay attention to yeah i agree mostly with what he's saying there um i think he's correct to point out that the twitter files were a very good thing and it was great to have more transparency about what the policies were under previous leadership and that elan musk should be credited for having allowed that and it is deeply unfortunate that this has happened that elan musk has chosen this course of action partly i think as taiybi said due to a kind of misunderstanding about how sub stack operates and what taiybi was because he was at sub stack all along and just posting like the articles go on sub stack uh and that and that certainly it is a it violates at least the kind of ethos of free speech that elan musk was articulating to do this and yes does make one self-look kind of hypocritical in their approach so this is not great yeah so this all has the whiff of i voted for the lions eating my face party not thinking that the lions were going to know about that this is so so matt taiybi wrote a sub stack post immediately after all of this happened last week in which he gave a rundown of how everything transpired and he acknowledges that his his fellow twitter files journalist berry weis made different decisions than him earlier on when elan musk chose to censor journalists that we're talking about not that elan jet's account itself but to censor journalists who are reporting on the elan jet's account berry weis and a moment that i thought was quite principled in fact it's articulated that she thought that that was hypocritical and out of step with the free speech um principles that elan musk had espoused and what that were ostensibly driving his purchase of twitter and his choice to release the twitter files at that time berry weis was kicked out of the twitter files project matt taiybi both on my podcast and elsewhere declined to say much about that in this this post that he wrote on his sub stack after he became the victim of elan musk's censorship he wrote berry weis decided the situation to man a public statement i absolutely respected the decision but i disagreed i thought the outcry coming from people who never said a word across the years of suppression of the type of people i wrote about in the censored series like the v6 videographer john verina canadian broadcaster paul j the world socialist website etc was a bad faith trap these people didn't care about the issue at all except in a self-interested way what i find with taiybi who i like and respect a great deal is that he often declines to engage with the substance of an issue by saying well some people who are mad or bad faith so i don't have to pay attention to it berry weis was not acting in bad berry weis was the one committed to the twitter files project but when she got railroaded by elan musk there was a choice to not say anything about it and be silent and over and over again we have talked about on this show instances in which elan musk has showed a great deal of hypocrisy and done things that were absolutely antithetical to his free speech goals and matt taiybi has declined to say anything about it to object to it to even softly opine that this is out of step with his goal or that he disagrees with it and now he's in a position where he personally is affected elan mus literally um ended their twitter files relationship did a complete 180 on the value of the twitter files apparently saying well i guess everything has to come to an end now and uh deep prioritized uh matt taiybi's sub stack links and basically throttled him on twitter because of a misunderstanding supposed to be a tech genius a misunderstanding of how sub stack works and the fact that matt taiybi is one of sub stack's most famous writers and so it's i value the twitter files but the idea that anybody including my uh taiybi to some extent is still trying to protect musk aura as any kind of first amendment vanguard is just beyond absurd at this point well i i mean i think you can let the perfect become the enemy of the good here a little bit like elan faces no shortage of criticism like do you have to i don't know that i would have made different i'm sure i would have made some different choices in taiybi's position but he wanted this he wanted to continue having access to this project this project is certainly socially valuable and you have to live with whatever compromises that entails until you can't and he reached the point where he can and now he doesn't do it anymore yeah when it would have been when he couldn't when it was his livelihood and his sub stack it became an issue and when it was other people's that wasn't an issue but everybody like everybody on fox doesn't sit around criticizing fox all the time everyone at cnn doesn't sit around criticizing cnn all the time right but it's not it's it's it's it's not just that he's not if it's egregious and you have to say something you have to say something but it's not just that he's not criticizing musk is that he's actively affirming the idea that musk has sincere commitments to the first amendment sincere commitments to session b using quotation marks was sincere commitments to speech if you say nothing about anybody there's stuff that i stay out of all the time not not my circus not my monkeys fine but it feels increasingly like like that although i think i would be as right wait a minute it feels increasingly that although taty is right about the important and the twitter files but the reason musk released those twitter files was that he was paying for what he bought efficiently with a reputation as someone who cared about this issue and unintentionally and wittingly perhaps mataebi has created that impression when he shouldn't have well and now and now he has he has because of these actions he has erased this impression that people had about elan musk and that's fine i i was i think some people i'm not you but some people like clamoring for for matt taiby to have more quickly estranged himself from elan musk might be people who didn't want that information coming out of the first place not you obviously not because i know you appreciate what was being done as well but i was i i was not demanding taiby put himself in the position of not being able to carry out this project any longer i just i wonder what would have happened if when barry wise and very respectfully and mildly said hey elan i disagree with your decision to censor these journalists if all of the twitter files people had said yeah like this isn't a great move would the twitter files have ended prematurely like it has ultimately ended prematurely but even earlier or would elan have backed down and said okay fine and not and not thrown barry wise under the bus what might of solidarity looked like in that moment i don't know for all of the discussion of journalistic integrity and standing up for leakers and whistle blowers and you know there's a lot of like hot air i don't know if they should say hot air and i think it's real principles that are important but that are only deployed in some context and completely ignored in others if i were barry wise i'd be p ode i gotta say because she she wasn't disrespectful you know the the problem here is that elan musk is it painfully thin skinned and if we're at a point where someone will ban you from a website will try to throttle people's access to your sub stack which is your livelihood which double shut down a journalistic enterprise that they've described as deeply important to the integrity of twitter and social media and our understanding of government overreach in the united states of america because you think that they work for sub stack and you're mad about a competitor and you don't even understand how competitor brands work as a ceo of multiple major tech companies we're in a problem zone and at very least i would like to see people in involved in this project who value this project acknowledging that the root of this problem is that elan musk doesn't actually have the commitment to this but he is there i think it's been acknowledged it's acknowledged now it's acknowledged and we're done no even tell you when i got that mike that he acknowledged it no he said that's what exactly what he said he didn't he said that he values that values the twitter files project the twitter files project wasn't important but he at no point cast any doubt on elan must own commitment to the project even as he's i mean he said he said what elan has done here makes him look hypocritical given what he said light touch well you you thirst for these major clashes in battles i know first for a major clash but there are a lot of people and we'll see them in the comment section of this who were saying no elan musk is still he still believes in free speech the twitter files he really he was genuinely committed to it even as there's thousands of documents that have gone get undisclosed taiyim is going to continue the project what he already has but elan musk basically wrapping it up with the bow because of an interpersonal dispute proves to me conclusively that you don't actually you're putting your your own personal feelings before the sum of that i know that must problem not mattaiyb's problem in my view it's to the extent that elan musk is buying a reputation and laundering it through good journalists like mattaiyb it becomes mattaiyb's problem that's my contention and i think that you'll see through the continued commitment and support to elan musk and um valorizing him as a first amendment figure that he it was money won't valorize who's valorizing him as a first amendment figure now we'll see what happens in the comment section if you even this very video all right we'll see about that tomorrow on rising we'll be right back here to bring you the special rising coverage we know you can't go
