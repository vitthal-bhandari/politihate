If you find anything in 60,000 don't see.\" I have a story there. the whole point. Interesting story up on Fox News now a former Obama White House stenographer has blown the whistle on Biden kickback scheme after Hunter joined barisma. So we'll discuss just in general also the whole Biden influence peddling the whole thing is so unseemly so obviously illegal. So we'll we'll get into some of that obviously also want to take your calls. 800-282-882. Oh, the Fed is projecting recession. So now they're basically telling you look, we've held this thing back as long as we can. But the recession is coming. That seems to be increasingly consensus even for people who don't want to say that out loud. We'll dive into that. But I mean, first, I got to tell you all the we were on the this morning. We joined our our new friend Patrick Bet David on his podcast is a very big podcast. So Clay and I, but joined him on that lot of lot of fun. But it is in the Fort Lauderdale area. And oh my gosh. Last night, Clay tried to get to Fort Lauderdale. I was I was in Miami overnight. Clay was trying to fly in clay. Have you seen this? There are our photos and video right now of the the entirety of the Fort Lauderdale airport is underwater. You have over 25 inches of water dumped on that city in 24 hours. The heaviest single day rainfall ever for the city of Fort Lauderdale. Up on drugs, they're calling it a one in a thousand year event. It was crazy last night on the highways. People were abandoning their cars. What was going on, man? So putting this into context right now. So we're down in South Florida. This yesterday in Fort Lauderdale is the most amount of rain in a day. Any place in Florida has ever gotten 10 more inches than Miami got a hundred years ago, basically. Key West got so 25.9 inches of rain fell in 24 hours. And I was scheduled Buck. I took off in in Nashville right after our show yesterday. And I was scheduled to land in in Fort Lauderdale to do this interview. We got a couple of other interviews to do to hang out down here with you for a few days. We got rerouted to Sarasota. So I had to get a rental car in Sarasota. I didn't really know what I was driving into. I got into Fort Lauderdale last night around 10 30 to try to get to my hotel. I spent and I'm not I've never seen anything like this as a driver. I spent the next three and a half hours in my car. There were roads flooded in every direction. At one point, I was sitting in the car for an hour with flooded roads in both directions. I thought maybe I was going to run out of the gas. I thought that I was going to have to sleep in the car. Every hotel in the vista shut down the airport. And when I say shut down, I mean, it was so flooded. You can still see today the runways literally have some of them. It looks like feet of water on them. And it was it was like a third world country in all of these different, all these different hotel lobbies, post midnight people just splayed out everywhere. Cars abandoned everywhere as wide as you can see that got caught in the immediate flash flood. I mean, they're showing right now the footage live of Fort Lauderdale airport and the airport looks like a lake. I mean, I've never seen anything like this at an actual airport. I don't think they're going to open today probably to be able to land any planes. And, uh, and I got eventually I found a hotel and got in around two AM. I've never seen anything like it. I have I lived through the Nashville flood. Some of you may remember that it was a monstrous huge 500 year event, but I wasn't driving around. There were virtually no cops. I imagine they were having to respond to try to save people's lives. And everywhere you turned, there were different, not just standing water, like water that if you drove your car, it would cover the top of your car on major streets, even downtown Fort Lauderdale. And as we're talking to you, I mean, I imagine this is turning into a pretty big national story. But there are people doing live reports from Fort Lauderdale airport. And again, it looks like their runways look like lakes. So if you have a trip to South Florida scheduled, I don't even know I'm going to be able to fly out on Saturday. The good news is guys, I've got really comfortable bunk beds down here. And I told Clay, because I'm a hospitable guy, he can have top bunk. So he's good. If you need to crash, I'm not kidding. At two AM, I had no idea where I was going. I actually pulled up your address. And I was like, maybe I should just drive to bucks place at two 30 in the morning and show up like outdoors. Cause I didn't, I mean, I had a rental car. I didn't know where to go. I thought I was going to have to abandon the rental car on the side of the road. The gas stations I should mention all ran out of gas. So I thought I was legitimately run out of gas. Phone was dying. I didn't have the right charger for the, for the adapter in the car. I mean, this was, I don't know. It was crazy. So anyway, I got to a hotel, got in bed around, you know, 330 or so. And I was felt fortunate to find a hotel anywhere. We already did a two hour podcast YouTube live show and hopefully we'll do a good job here. But I know we got people listening to us all over South Florida, certainly who are, who are dealing with the impact of this and a lot of people probably who were traveling to or from South Florida as well. This is an all time record amount of rainfall to fall in the state of Florida, a place buck where it's worth mentioning. They're kind of used to thunderstorms, kind of used to lots of rainfall. Never seen anything like this. Felt like a slow moving and then sudden, a sudden, like tropical storm or hurricane that nobody was expecting just because it's been crazy, windy for days, tons of water being dumped over the course of days. But then this, this flash flood that hit for Lauderdale, I mean, no one's looked. No one's ever seen anything like it because it's never really happened before in this way. So obviously, we're just hoping everybody out there, if you're listening to us, you know, stay safe, you can always go back to the car, you can always deal with the problems later. Just make sure your physical safety is the first thing that you are, are attending to. And by the way, but putting it in context, how unexpected this was, I mean, I took off in Nashville at like three 30 central time. So they clearly weren't anticipating this because while we're in the air, they said, Hey, we're having to reroute. I think Tampa got blown up Sarasota in terms of all the different things. But you know, even two hours before landing, they weren't expecting the airport to get shut down like this. So we're still thinking about that. And obviously going to be keeping an eye on it. You know, Clay, we got a lot of things to get into today. But one, one story that's obviously a big headline getting a bit of a surprise for a lot of folks is this stabbing this murder of Bob Lee in San Francisco. This is the tech executive who had left San Francisco because it had been it was just too disordered and too much anarchy, which we often talk about. And then he got stabbed early in the morning by somebody who was pulling along a rolling bag. It turns out that he knew the suspect. And so this is he was somebody that he would have been driving around with. They got into a they got into some kind of an argument and he any he'll them. And I think it's one of these moments where the mayor London breed has come out. You see this and she said, you know, everyone should wait for the facts to come out. It's like, all right, well, you still had a murder on the streets of your city at two o'clock in the morning. So it wasn't a crazy vagrant this time. That stuff is happening constantly in San Francisco. Anyway, it's it's amazing to me that there are people who because they think they get political advantage from it, they always want to minimize what we all know is happening and they look for it and they say, see, it's not really look at this. This doesn't disprove anything about the reality of what's happening in San Francisco or any major city right now. That's why we have data because data is supposed to give you the aggregate numbers and sense of what's really happening, which is why I just come back to and I think it's so significant. The big issue that San Francisco has is there's right now a 30% vacancy rate in their commercial real estate. That is office buildings are 30% empty and I bring this home because I think it really kind of epitomizes it well right now in Detroit, 12%. So everybody thinks about what a struggling downtown corridor Detroit is and they've made a lot of progress and Detroit is better than it has been historically, but San Francisco is almost triple the vacancy rate of right now Detroit and the crime we know is skyrocketing and it's only going to get worse because as those buildings are empty, the jobs that are designed to fill surrounding the people who would otherwise be in those buildings also vanish. And but you know, this is becoming an issue in New York City where there right now is substantial amounts of New York City that on a Monday or a Tuesday, they feel like it's Sunday, right, where people are still that there's just not that usual foot traffic that there would be. And there's just a major seismic shift, I think going on. And these left wing cities have still not recognized the extent to which they're going to have to change and just compete. We were talking about this that this morning, you know, when you grew up as a New York City guy, you were like, I would not choose to live anywhere else in the world. That was a pride of place that New York City had. And so many other people would say, the first chance I get, I'm moving to New York City, it's the best place to live. I don't think that same vibe exists in the national consciousness anymore. Well, we talked to Patrick about it on his show the early this morning, the same idea about New York that something like 30% of the residents are expressing a desire to leave. And this is where you would think that that New York City and other large cities that are losing population right now that are all it's not just that they have Democrats in charge. They are Democrat enclaves, right? When you're talking 80 90% of an urban area is one political party, you have one party rule. There it's not like Republican ideas are being taken into account in New York City. I mean, yeah, you know, Staten Island, you got a city councilman or two, you know, my friend Joe Borelli's out there. I mean, there's people that are not completely nuts who are in the infrastructure in the political scene in some way. But overall, when you get to that level of, I would even say over 70% in a city, there is no corrective mechanism because you just keep passing power back between Democrats. And no one's ever really held accountable because the whole city just decides they're going to keep voting for the same thing. And we talked about this man. I found what happened in Chicago and the choice to go with the choice not to elect valus and john Johnson right brain and Johnson, Brandon Johnson. I found that just it was sad. Made me sad for the city of Chicago and for the violence that is going to occur because of bad policies at a higher level than would have if they had made a better decision. I mean, Democrats are now voting for some of this stuff that we're seeing. That's the problem. It's one thing when you haven't suffered the consequences. There are places where Democrats are saying, well, we're still going to do this. Even if it means all of the following bad things happen. That's not a good place to be no doubt. And it's going to have to evidently get worse before they consider making a change and going with a Giuliani like direction in so many of these cities, whether Chicago, whether San Francisco, Atlanta, New York City, Philadelphia, which is in the grips of of of great despair related to crime, setting all time highs. We live in a digital age. And with that comes the risk of a data breach, a cyber thief hacks into a company's computer steals their customer data. When that happens, you're at risk.

It's not so sacred. All I was just a blicksome hoping that the person will go over. Yeah, that's what I had for all of four right and four day. Welcome back in clay Travis. Buck Sexton show we are down in South Florida where 100 year flood basically has overwhelmed much of Fort Lauderdale not as impactful in Miami because it was one of these like crazy kind of flash storms that settled itself basically over for Lauderdale. Buck was down the road had almost no impact on him in a day to day basis. I did see Buck and I'm glad that things are that things are going well. That Riley Gaines interview that we did got a lot of pickup and has bounced around and ricocheted across the entire internet space and certainly in social media and beyond. And I was thinking about that as I was sitting in in the flooded traffic and I had a lot of time to kind of sit around just contemplate things. I do wonder how much of this sort of left wing insanity is cutting through. Does that make sense? Like do you think obviously our audience knows about this crazy trans agenda that's requiring women to compete against men who decide to identify as women. Do you think if you're sitting in Michigan right now or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, you're one of those Midwestern swing voters. Do you think a story like that is penetrating into their social circles or do you think it's mostly still isolated in universes like the people that would be listening to us? I don't think it really moves the needle. Unfortunately for a lot of people that would be in the persuadable category, not because they don't care, but because for the people that the transgender ideology that are favorable to it, it's very important to them to a lot of other people, unfortunately, I think they don't see this as the left is completely insane. I have to do anything I can to stop them. They think, Oh, I don't want to deal with this. You know, this is craziness, but I'm focused on the economy, the border, you know, other things that are affecting their day to day lives. But I think that is starting to change. I think that has been the case. I think when you see these massive campaigns by whether it's Bud Light or Nike or, you know, Disney to push, it's really not we call it transgender ideology. It's really just gender ideology in general. This notion that there's all these different, you know, sexualities and genders and you can change and it's multifaceted and all this stuff. I think there's a recognition that this is lunacy and that this is actually taking the country into a very, very dangerous place in a lot of ways as a society, a very sad place as a society. No, I don't, I don't think there's any doubt at all. So I'm continuing to look at this. We'll get into more here coming up in in just a second.

Live Biden administration based on the actions of Biden and his vice president clearly think that the temporary several day expulsion of those two lawmakers in Tennessee and the Tennessee state legislative body state house, they clearly think of this Biden White House. That is a more important issue than actually going and trying to comfort and bring together the national community after a mass shooting by a transgender terrorist. Like why the first the the the transgender terrorist shooting does not require an immediate White House visitor response or even within the last couple of weeks, but the expulsion of these two guys for a couple of days does think about that for a second. No, and that's an important part of this story. The only reason this story emerged at all was because these guys took over the main vestibule, the debate area of the Tennessee legislature with bull horns while leading a protest associated with Tennessee gun laws. And the protest for Tennessee gun laws was based on the six people who died in the religious elementary school, three nine year olds and three adults who worked there. And their deaths have completely vanished. It would be an interesting story Bach to compare the amount of words that Democrats have spent on these two guys being expelled for effectively a day or two. I don't believe the Nashville guy even missed a vote. And maybe we need to pull the audio because I heard from a lot of different people who couldn't stop laughing about how ridiculous the audio was between the guy from Nashville who went to Bowdoin College in Maine and elite $60,000 plus a year liberal arts private school and how he sounded when he campaigned for the student body presidency there compared to when he spoke at a church on Sunday and what that reflects in terms of the dishonesty of politicians in general. I will say this though, when you look at the political calculus, these guys were gone for a couple of days and they were turned into martyrs. The Tennessee Republican Party got chastised as being like I got more than chastised got harreigned attacked for days for being racist because they decided not to vote out the white woman who as you pointed out begged not to be expelled. The moment she avoided expulsion by one vote buck, one vote and she would have also been kicked out, she ran outside and said, Oh, why did I not get expelled? It probably has something to do with my race, which was such a strategic blunder. Having said all that, these guys will raise a ton of money. This or I think this will be a little bit like what happens sometimes in Texas. There'll be all this talk, the left wing media, New York and LA are going to come in and they're going to pour money into Tennessee. It's worth mentioning Governor Bill Lee won by over 30 points in Tennessee. Tennessee is a red state that is becoming redder in the wake of COVID, but one of these guys is going to be running for a Congress office, congressional office or statewide election at some point probably and they're going to get smoked, but they will get laudatory coverage now in the left wing media because they've been turned to and the story now is not even about the shooter. It's about these three, these two who were expelled and the woman who avoided it. They are now the central part of the attention and not the fact that this was a trans shooter or buck that the protesters were chanting and I can't believe this didn't get more attention even on the right protesters in the Capitol were chanting seven victims. Yes. They were counting the trans killer as a victim of this violent act. You have seen in the last, what is it? 17 days as we've talked about, you have seen the apparatus on full display, the way that they initially did the we can't, you can't know what happened here. You haven't seen the information. You haven't seen the data. Let's actually work through this for a second. What happened in the immediate aftermath of the Nashville trans terrorist mass murder? What happened? They say, meaning their voices in the media and the Democrat party. Okay. They say, well, you're just jumping to conclusions. You don't know even things that are very obvious, but I guess technically haven't been verified by a signed confession. You can't say that. You don't know. But then they also started introducing right away. Well, you know, the, the trans person may have been responding to anti trans genocide and, and then they started running these news articles. I remember because it was appalling about basically sympathy articles with the mass murder who was shooting small children in this school. They were trying to make it seem like, well, you know, it was very difficult and the mental health issues and, and the whole time, if you say, hold on a second, what is the motive here? Let's go to what actually happened. We're going to talk about, you know, the, the, the trans policies in different states that so did this person because that's a terrorist then clear, correct and simple. So can we say that terrorists? Oh, no, you're not allowed to say because you don't have the manifesto and they delay and they delay. And then the issue becomes, as you point out, these members of the Tennessee State House and the racism against them for, I mean, what they did was clearly against the rules and they were punished for it. That's what happened. But all of a sudden, you notice who is even asking for the manifesto anymore, who's even paying attention? If you try to have basically, right, if you tried to have a discussion, debate now about, hold on a second, are we radicalizing people who are already mentally unstable in society at a percentage that is concerning, very small percentage overall, of course, this is clay. I was there for all the talks about, well, at the CIA and then in the media debating this stuff about radicalization of jihadists. And the left did the same thing, by the way, the left would say, you can't know the motive. And you say, well, hold on, I think there's, I think there's already pretty clear evidence and there's also, and they would delay and delay. Then the narrative would be Islamophobia. This is what they used to do. And after you had about four or five days of, oh, it's Islamophobia, and even talk about it, because you can't know because they would suppress the information, then all of a sudden it disappears. This is the playbook. They've run it on that. They've run it with the Nashville shooter again. And I just think it's noteworthy for everybody that these are the kinds of people that you're dealing with. This is the level of dishonesty. And on an honestly, the level of radicalization among people that are in the news media, the Democrat party, this is how they talk about these things now. Yeah. And again, note what happened and how skillfully they pivoted the story from six innocent people at a Christian elementary school or slaughtered by a crazy trans woman and 17 days after that slaughter, after what may well have been a hate crime directed against them because of their, because they're Christians by a trans woman, they have pivoted to our democracies under attack because these two state legislators were not in office for a couple of days. They didn't even miss a vote. Yet that is the predominant storyline. And you probably not even going to hear anything else about that trans manifesto, except on a show like this, everybody else has moved on. Don't miss out.

Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. We are rolling through the Thursday edition of the program. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We've got a bunch of callers who went away in so far based on the way the show is going. We certainly appreciate all of you. Let's go to Francisco out in Utah. Francisco, you're a Guatemalan immigrant. That's correct. So when you see what's happening in the United States, I think this is such an important storyline and certainly buck we're down in South Florida where you've heard and seen a lot of American Hispanic support for Republicans because people in those countries actually know what socialism represents. Francisco, when you see what's going on here and you know what has happened before based on being from Guatemala, what is your analysis here? Well, first of all, let me just say that I am so grateful for this country. The way that it came to pass, the Constitution and everything that makes this country what it is. And it's sad for me to see all of these things happening because I can see the writing on the wall and I am totally surprised that people are not waking up and seeing what's going on. And my concern, the main concern is this, you know, all across the board, you know, from politics to global warming, transgender, all of these things happening. Most of us are in disagreement with all of these things going on. And we're a part of what's going on. But why does the left seem to have so much power? Why is it that Trump's a great question, you know, come to the front and liberal things, you just pushed in the background, Biden, I would say, I would say thank you so much for calling in. I would say there's a structural component to this and a mindset component to this. Exactly what you're saying, which our caller just for everybody was bringing up. Why is it that the left is able to even went out of power, by the way, even when they're not necessarily those who have won the most recent election, why are they able to advance the agenda and have been able to do so so effectively, particularly over, I'd say the last 10 years or so. And it feels like it accelerates a little more with each passing gear. On the structural side, it's because they have seized the commanding heights of culture. They've seized the platforms. They've seized the institutional power that exists in this country. So that's go down the list, right? Academia, Hollywood, social media, you know, big law corporations. You see, they have infiltrated and now control so much of this. And that's, that's obvious, I think. But also, there's a mindset component of this clay, which is that the disadvantage, the advantage that conservatives have in life, but the disadvantage that they have in politics is that ultimately, we just want people to leave us alone. Yeah. And so we are less by our nature, activated and mobilized in politics because we see it often as, you know, it's as if you leave me alone, I'll leave you alone. So many conservatives, conservatives, I don't feel that way. We've now woken up to there is no, there is no standing aside in this fight for the country. There is no, I'm going to go live in my cabin off the grid and not deal with people. They're going to come knocking on your cabin, hand you a mask and say, here's shot number seven, like they're not letting you go. I think their 10 to 15% of ideologues are more committed and more powerful. And it doesn't take that many people study history. It doesn't take that many people who are committed to anything if they are true believers. So the Soviet revolution, I think is such an interesting comparison and such an interesting point with what Clay said there, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, people, this is not taught really in school, the Bolsheviks were never popular and never even a majority among the socialists in the early days of they call themselves Bolsheviks, which is effectively the majority or majoritarians as a marketing ploy. They're like, well, were the majority? The Mensheviks actually had greater support in the early days of the Soviet revolution under Lenin. But the Bolsheviks were the 10 to 15 percent or whatever the number is. But to your point about 10 to 15 percent, who were just the most committed, we will make it happen. We will get our way. We will crush any dissent. That can get you very far. We have Bolsheviks in a very different capacity operating in this country right now. They don't when you look at Bud Light, Bud Light employees are like, yes, sign me up for this program or Disney, but if there are enough people in HR, enough people in the C suite, enough people who control the levers of power and therefore have the leverage to influence a whole lot more than any one individual would, that's where we see the agenda being moved. I was talking with a friend who works at Disney, big picture Disney. And he was saying that people in positions of power on the woke side are so powerful that when he talks with his coworkers, they're afraid to speak out because and I think this is so important. They got mortgages to pay. They're trying to put their kids through college. And that's why these people are so powerful because they can threaten. This is why cancel culture works because it's not just canceling people, right? That's a small part of it. It's putting everyone else on notice that it could be you and terrifying so many people from speaking out. That's what they're doing every day. Genghis Khan didn't have to burn down and massacre everyone in every city to get compliance from a lot. Only had to do it sometimes. And then a whole lot of other people said, you know what, we don't want to fight these guys. Let's let the Mongols just take over. We'll pay our tribute similar attitude with the woke in this country. They, you know, they don't have to burn down all the village to get the same effect. They can burn down one. That's why I give credit to the Elon Musk's of the world that are finally fed up. But what I would say to all of you out there that are fortunate to have resources. If you have enough money to take care of your family for the rest of your life, what are you waiting for? Who are you afraid of? You know, Phil Knight is a Republican. He runs Nike. Why in the world wouldn't Phil Knight come out and say, I'm sorry, we're not putting a frickin dude in a sports bra to sell sports bras to women. What is he afraid of? Speak out. You've got the money and the resources to be able to last forever. What are you so afraid of? Coward is his little contagious play. Unfortunately, people just decide that they're going to put their head down. They're not going to get into the fight. Meanwhile, we wake up every day. We're like, let's fight. Where are they? Show me the commies. That's how we do it. Next hour, by the way, we've got some important stories to bring to you. We'll talk about this Biden extravaganza of corruption. That's"
