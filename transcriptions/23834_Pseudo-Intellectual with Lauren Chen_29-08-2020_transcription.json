    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Hey guys, welcome back to the show and thank you so much for tuning in. If it's your first time here, my name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. So we have a lot to go over as always. First up, Bella Thor and a bunch of other celebrities. Apparently they are making sex workers angry by daring to join only fans. We'll talk more about why then sports has gone full political. I'm going to let Liam take the lead on this story because I don't know what I'm talking about what it comes to sports ball, but then Trevor Noah covers the Jacob Blake and Kyle Rittenhouse fiasco and you can probably already guess what his takes were. Then finally, this week earlier, it was women's equality day and feminists in the West were very concerned with things like the made up gender pay gap. Meanwhile, a Galitarians in India were talking about actual issues like sex based abortion. So we're going to be comparing and contrasting the two movements. First up, let's let's talk about Bella Thorne. So she's apparently one of the newer generations of like Disney star turned very provocative actress. I'm not really familiar with her work, but I know of her from social media and stuff like that. That does seem to be the fate of so many Disney stars. It's the trend. Yeah. If you are a parent out there who aspires to have their child be some sort of Disney star, I would just I would look at the legs of Miley Cyrus, Bella Thorne and maybe reconsider. But honestly, the parents that want that kind of lifestyle for the kids, the ones that put them in beauty pageants and that kind of thing, those are typically weird people that want to live vicariously through their kids in some way, at least show parents is what they're called. Show parents. Yeah, there's something like mentally off with someone. Sorry, but it's true. It's one of them. You know, yeah, like there's a difference on your child, please. Yeah, there's a difference between supporting your kids in their endeavors and their dreams versus, you know, trying to, I think, turn them into a cash cow and exploit them and stuff like that. Yeah, or even just have them live out your own dream. Yeah, very much so. But we've kind of covered only fans before on the show talked about it for people who aren't familiar with it. It's kind of like Patreon in that you can, if you're a creator, you can give your fans extra content and things like that, but it's become more infamous specifically for, I guess, sex workers and camgirls using the site is apparently not exclusive to that. You can be like a fitness person, even a political person, and use only fans, but it's kind of mostly known for for the nudes. So Bella Thorne, she was making headlines this week for opening up an only fans account. And we have this story from Rolling Stone covering it says since the start of the pandemic back in March, most companies have taken a tremendous financial hit. But that's not so for only fans. A subscription platform where creators sell content directly to fans that has since its inception in 2016, primarily been used by sex workers, only fans has seen a tremendous jump in membership since March with a 75% increase month a month in new signups. That's like, that is insane. And that's actually really sad when you think about it. The reason why all of these new people are signing up is because they have no other choice. Or they think they have no other choice. There's always another choice, but it's feels exploitative and greasy to me. Well, I think the sex worker industry is exploitative and greasy. True. Like it's like, yeah, I respect that they do hard work, but I really like it's us. It's the men, mostly that that created demand for a lot of this stuff. Yeah, I think it's a give and take. I would never like talk about problems with the industry and only blame the sex workers or only blame one. It's like they're feeding off. Oh, of course. Yeah, it's just a cycle of immorality, I guess. It says a plug from Beyonce in her savage remix compounded with mainstream celebrities like Cardi B and Black China joining the platform. I was not aware of this has only added to its popularity to the degree that starting an only fans account to make easy money has become something of a meme and actually one that's not included on there is Tana Mojo, one of the biggest YouTubers out there popular with the use. She also started only fans a couple months ago, I think. She's the one that briefly married Jake Paul, I believe. Yeah, but that was like a whole thing. Like a pay-per-view event. Yeah, but it turns out it wasn't actually a marriage, like it wasn't even legal. It was just for publicity. Yeah, but they just made a lot of money from it. I feel like you and I need to do something about like we're not like getting enough drama from our relationship and the views like clearly these people haven't figured out. I don't know. Maybe one of us needs to have some sort of secret other family that's revealed in a pay-per-view event. We'll see. But it says now the platform is set to become even more popular after announcing that actor and singer Bella Thorne had become the first creator to make $1 million in a single day by selling exclusive content at $20 per month. Thorne has made $2 million on the platform in less than a week. Oh my goodness, people are thirsty for Bella Thorne. Honestly, I don't. I couldn't, if someone like gave me catalog of female celebrities, I wouldn't be able to pick her out. Yeah. I don't know how she looks. Maybe she is beautiful, but she's a pretty girl for sure. I, to me, I don't understand first of all, from like a like the morality aside, I don't understand who's really joining these things because once that photo is put on the internet, you can find it for free. That's how it works. Right? Like it's not hard either. But I guess like then we get into the whole debate about pirating nudes and things like that. If you're going to want the photos, at least support the creator. Okay. But the people that are looking up that stuff, like morality now we're taking into account. Yes. There's a minority of them that are like, I'm doing this for women's rights and respecting. Yeah, I want to support her artistic endeavors with nude photography. Right. Exactly. The rest of the men, like they're, their forebrain isn't active. Yeah. They're doing other things. It's just the all hind rate that's working right there. So but apparently Bella Thorne's friends may be happy, but a lot of the sex workers who already were on the platform were not. And we actually did, I think, an entire segment about how the mainstreaming of only fans is upsetting existing sex workers because these sex workers, they're kind of like cab drivers, in my opinion. This makes sense. I will explain cab driver, like driving people around. It's not really a hard thing to do, but they had a corner on the market because of all of these externalities that granted them some sort of exclusivity. And it's the same with sex workers. Like every woman has the capacity to be naked, but it's only because of the stigma that sex workers have any type of poll in the market, right? Because other women aren't doing it. But now since only fans has kind of mainstream pornography, for the worst, in my opinion, it's not a good thing. Well, it's like your what little sway you had over market competition is kind of depleted if you're a sex worker, because guess what? Everyone's news are on the internet now and it's like you don't have any any type of competitive edge, especially if you're not a celebrity like Bella Thorne, who people already know of, you have a fan following who wants to see you naked. So Rolling Stone spoke to some of these salty sex workers. It says the perspective she'll gain won't be representative of what most people experience as content creators on the platform says sex worker Elle Morn. I am certain she'll deal with some of the same issues, fans crossing boundaries, scammers, etc. But at the end of the day, she uses a celebrity and wields a large amount of privilege unless the intent is to drive the conversation toward decriminalization of sex work I'll be disappointed. So essentially you have sex workers gatekeeping sex work right now, which is kind of funny because it's like anyone could do this and it's not it's not their fault they just happen to be I guess more popular at doing it than you've been so far continues. The accolades for Thorne's financial windfall were particularly offensive to some sex workers in light of the fact that by POC or by POC, I don't even know how you're supposed to say that, celebrities such as rapper Ruby Rose were shamed for joining the platform. When Rose joined, everyone screamed scam says OnlyFans content creators Savannah solo. I didn't even hear about that. So I guess I don't know who these people are and I think I'm better for it. Yeah, same. But Bella Thorne does a four quote research and she's a goddamn entrepreneur. Sex workers are concerned that coverage of Thorne and other celebrities who make a great deal of money on OnlyFans will deceive people into believing that building a brand on OnlyFans is easy when it is more often than not an arduous and thinkless process. People think it's easy quick money blah blah blah but it ain't says sex worker Ali Eve Knox is a full time communication full time original content creation full time being on and it continues by saying these celebrity users never have to face the stigma that we do says sex worker writer and co host of the peep show podcast Jesse Sage. They can just profit off of platforms we have built without enduring any of the backlash that we have to endure to witness a celebrity gentrifying a platform. Yeah, that's a good one and making obscene amounts of money without acknowledging the plight of sex workers is truly a slap in the face says Aussie Rachel a sex worker and OnlyFans content creator to me that just this just sounds like bitterness and gaming. Yeah, no, absolutely. And you know what? I'm willing to believe that it's actually hard to make an OnlyFans fan base work. This goes it's saturated right now. Well saturated even if it wasn't saturated, I don't think it's easy because you're not doing anything particularly amazing. Yeah, and there's I mean, not that I'm condoning it but there's free porn out there. Yeah, of course. Most people know this by now. But not only that but we we have a YouTube channel right it's similar and it's all your content creator. You start from nothing. You build an audience. You build an audience. Yeah, there's a lot to it and it's not easy. But sure, it's like, yeah, celebrities come on YouTube all the time and they end up with millions of subscribers. We don't make like a social justice article about it. Right, you know, it's not it's not it doesn't hurt us anyway. And it really doesn't even hurt frankly, they're complaints to me are I don't understand you're just complaining. Yeah, you are. And I mean, if nothing else, like she's bringing awareness to the platform and maybe you didn't want to make an only fans for just, you know, sex worker ex but hey, if Bella Thorne and these other people on it, maybe you want to support all of them. I don't know. It just seems like a very strange complaint to have. And in this world of like, let's not always just bring down other women. You're literally just shaming someone else for doing something with more success than you are. But I mean, moving on in this story, it would be unfair me to say that there are no legitimate complaints about Bella Thorne because apparently fans are now actually mad at her for kind of scamming them. So we have this screenshot here from an unfortunate person who was, I don't know, swindled by Bella. So on only fans, apparently there's this thing called pay per view messages or like posts where someone can send you a creator can send you a photo and you need to pay to see that specific photo. It's it's different than the other subscription content you get. So Bella Thorne had this post that she was allowing people to see for $200 for a single photograph or whatever it is. That's a lot of money. I think it's her account saying naked naked yes naked to which one of her subscribers asked how naked is the question for $200 to which the reply was no clothes naked. So she was baiting people into paying $200 to see her naked no clothes naked. And apparently she was not naked and she later went on her Twitter to say no I'm not doing nudity. Now people are angry because there are people who paid this money and were under the impression that they would get naked Bella Thorne and yeah they did not and that's actually worse as a result of all the fan backlash from this. Only fans has actually gone ahead and changed their terms of service and this is what the sex workers are really mad about. So we have a post here from someone explaining the situation. That's gone viral. This is what they describe the situation as being so basically she scammed her subscribers and sent out $200 pay per view a message you have to pay to view claiming it was a fully nude photo set. It was not so many people requested refunds that now only fans won't allow us to charge over $50 for pay per view or get tipped over $100 and this morning we were all told that instead of waiting seven days for our payouts we have to wait 30. The theory is that only fans can't afford to pay her her cut. So now our funds are being tied up. It's BS. She's single-handedly effed so many sex workers and I just want to add in here. I mean I'm not sure but I think another reason why they extended the period that creators have to wait before they receive their payouts is perhaps because if they are now issuing refunds they just want to make sure that the time before a customer can request a refund has passed before they actually pay out their creators just so there's no back and forth of funds being that makes sense to me. I think other platforms have operated on a similar basis. $30 a day payouts is actually the way YouTube works. Yeah and Patreon I think as well if I'm not mistaken. Yeah so that's that seems like pretty industry standard to me but I also want to point out that in that complaint they say quote she single-handedly effed so many sex workers and to me that's like buddy that's part of the job. But I'm sure yeah no pretty much so again not that I'm condoning any of this only fans behavior these young girls joining it these men and I guess women who are paying for it but I do have to say it was a crappy thing that Bella Thorne did if she did actually and it seems like she did scam her fans into giving her money for a false advertising and I think people were mad at 10 amojos only fans as well because she had promised like all of these nude photos and there wasn't. Belledorf thing as well. Do you remember that Belled but like I think that this person did worse than all of them. Yeah like that. That was the seem like literally saying yes and then it wasn't the case. Yeah and it's kind of weird because there are celebrity and they were scamming people for money. That's a whole other level of greed. Yeah that I can't comprehend but I also but to reiterate I don't understand the people that paid $200 for an image. Yeah. We are not the same. Yeah and I mean just if you were a guy who's kind of being lured into this just know like you giving these girls money they're not going to love you. They might give you attention momentarily but it's really a financial transaction for them. They would be freaked out if you showed up at their place of work or like try to meet them every day on the street and it's like invest time and resources into actual relationships I would say and I mean I feel bad if you got taken in by this Bella Thorne scam in a way but also I don't know buyer beware. Don't trust these these scam girls and these thoughts would be the moral of the story in my opinion. But next up we have sports ball talking talking about sports. You know it's very hard to get Lauren to talk about even if like there's a topical thing happening in sports like related to politics or anything like that or just social events it's not possible. It's really hard for me to get Lauren to be remotely concerned about it but this is this is different though because it's such a scale that you pretty much can't ignore it. I mean I I would love to but it is it is trending right now so we will cover it but before we get into that though I want to think our amazing sponsor Bull and Branch what do millions of Americans and three former US presidents have in common. I'll tell you they all agreed that Bull and Branch sheets are the softest and most comfortable pure organic cotton sheets on earth. Bull and Branch cotton is rain fed pesticide free and carries the highest organic certification. That's why it is so soft and I can actually confirm this myself. We have a set of Bull and Branch sheets. We have the blue ones though like the cotton bamboo blend and they are amazingly soft. It's like sleeping on a blend of teddy bear angel wings fabric. I mean that's the only way that I can honestly explain it and they don't only have bed sheets. They also do things like towels. I think they have pillows as well just in general bedding and things like that for your house and since they sell direct to you Bull and Branch sheets start at just $160. They're a thousand dollar quality for a fraction of that price. You spend like what a third of your life sleeping. Yes. Sheeds are not something you want to skim out on plus you can sleep on them for a month risk free. So right now you will get $50 off any sheet set at bullandbranch.com with the promo code CHEN spelled B-O-L-L and branch.com promo code CHEN restrictions may apply seabullandbranch.com for details. I almost had an unfortunate slip up with sheet set but I made it through. All right. So tell us about what is happening in sports Liam. Well I guess it was on Wednesday that it all began when the NBA started striking. There was a basketball team which by the way for full disclaimer. I'm basically in the Lauren zone when it comes to basketball. I don't care about that sport. It really doesn't interest me in the slightest. But basically a team didn't show up on court and they started striking in order to support the what's his name Jacob Blake arrest shooting by police officers that happened I guess a few days ago now Sunday. So after that a bunch of teams a bunch of leagues have joined in and we have more on that here. So Fox Sports reports and this is the only time I visited this site on Wednesday the Milwaukee Bucks made the decision not to play game five of their playoff matchup with the Orlando magic. I understand those words individually as a sentence not quite sure but by the end of the day teams and players in multiple sports had joined the boycott then following a series of meetings Wednesday night and Thursday morning the NBA players decided to resume the playoffs. Meanwhile in the NFL several teams canceled practice on Thursday including the Jets, Colts, Packers, Bears, Titans, Broncos and Washington, Post-Poments, the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins. Post-Poments also continued in some Major League Baseball series and the National Hockey League press pause on Thursday's Stanley Cup playoff games too. Yeah. So this seems like almost every sport. Yeah actually MLS also the Major League soccer they they pressed pause as well. At first I was proud of hockey because they seem like they were they kept going right. They played Thursday I believe but now they've announced their postponing I think four of their Stanley Cup playoff games and I'm a hockey guy by the way. I played hockey for a little bit over 20 years now so that's like I don't care about basketball but hockey I enjoy. So I was just wanting to see that they have now also started a social justice initiative stuff but yeah it's huge it's widespread in sports and you'd be surprised at how much political pull people like LeBron James in particular like a bunch of these players have over the political conversation over a certain group of I think typically American males that spend a lot of time watching sports. Yeah I mean it's kind of like for some people they are the pop stars the actresses of you know their entertainment world so you know when you see someone like Taylor Swift speaking about politics for some people LeBron James is their Taylor Swift. Oh yeah no for sure I know so many guys that are like that when it comes to like I grew up with a lot of people that just didn't like politics in fact I was one of them I probably still one of them if I didn't have to deal with politics I probably wouldn't but that's you know I realized that's impossible just as a responsible adult but yeah where hockey is the only thing you know you know you dress in the way that hockey players dress with flip flops and socks on and you look like it's awful and you have to if you miss if you lose teeth you gotta you gotta make sure you never get them back in as part of the look but that's a great image of Canadians right now by the way yeah well that's what it is but that you know these people are super important and you've seen it spread across like they don't have boycotts in sports of this level right yeah you had covid shut things down and there hasn't been anything like this for decades so it's a really big event yeah but I what I wonder with this is that of course sports has a lot of pull but I wonder why when we ever we have some institution taking a political stance it's always a leftist stance have you noticed like any time a big company and now even just it seems sports as a whole comes out with some political message it has to be a left-wing one why I mean I cannot fathom that this represents the majority of football fans or even necessarily the majority of let's say hockey players right and I feel like they've cultivated this environment and this is just me from the peripheries trying not to pay attention to sports but sometimes I see it on twitter um I really do feel like anytime an athlete comes out with a message that isn't just overtly pro BLM hate trump whatever um they get demonized and I think there are probably a lot more people in these sports who don't agree with these messages but they've kind of been bullied into silence which is the case for so many other professions as well but now we also have the NBA they've come out and actually released a list of things that they're going to be doing differently in order to try to involve more social justice in their industry so we have this from ESPN it says the NBA and national basketball players association released a joint statement friday announcing that the NBA playoffs will resume saturday and that the league and players will work together on several initiatives to promote voting access combat social justice and racial inequality and advocate for police reform what why why like who out there aside from these crazy activists was we're looking at the NBA and thinking you're not doing enough for police reform yeah you need to do more I mean to me like this ideology is it's first of all emotional based so it's very accessible to everybody I think it's very easy to use some of the arguments that black lah's matter uses and leviate against someone who is just an average dude yeah right because you're not gonna you know it's you're very susceptible to that kind of thing and if you just say I mean and these people are just saying black people are being gunned down in the streets isn't that bad like yeah that is bad shouldn't everyone do something yeah of course like that really is the level of rhetoric that we're we've reached in some places and no it's not based in fact it's purely emotional it's completely wrong too but yeah that's that's the narrative they've painted I agree but I also think it is the ideology of the elite because it's so easy to virtue signal once you have all this money right sports you know I know Americans don't follow hockey but even hockey players make millions you're gonna have American hockey fans now in the comments yeah there will be some dozens of them but yeah it's just so it's so much easier to go and speak out about this one for social political pressure but I just think that it it is the virtue signal that's it it is the virtue signal ideology and when you're in these positions what else do you have to do you know the alternative is you look kind of greedy you look kind of bad that's the way it's socially seen in fact one of the things I wanted to mention was the other day there was a story about Logan Couture who's the captain of the San Jose Sharks the hockey team and he in Canada was soccer punch because someone thought that he said he was supporting Trump which I don't even think was the case but you get the idea yeah if you're remotely right wing even in sports which is a male dominated institution typically men are more likely to go vote right if I'm not mistaken so but even in sports you could still get sucker punched if you're an elite athlete that's pretty crazy people think might support Trump so here we have the joint NBA and NBA statement the things are gonna be doing says number one the NBA and its players have agreed to immediately establish a social justice coalition with representatives from players coaches and governors that will be focused on a broad range of issues including increasing access to voting promoting civic engagement and advocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform I mean some of these are nonpartisan right if you want to like have as part of the NBA charity initiative like it get out the vote initiative that's fine but I mean like these are like explicitly political right police and criminal justice reform what kind of reforms do you think they're going to be pushing for right and then it says in every city where the league franchise owns and controls the arena property team governors will continue to work with local elections officials to convert the facility into a voting location for the 2020 general election to allow for a safe in-person voting option for communities vulnerable to covid so apparently we're back on the idea of in-person voting it's hard to keep track that's a good thing though I don't have a problem with the voting centers I mean the thing is I could already predict right now that if male male in voting does go through by the way uh republicans are gonna get gas lit if trimp ones and they'll say that they're the ones that did scam me yeah that's a prediction and then it says the league will work with the players and our network partners to create and include advertising spots in each NBA playoffs game dedicated to promoting greater civic engagement national and local elections and raising awareness around voter access and opportunity I mean based on how that's written that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're like hey you know support local government get involved blah blah blah these are going to be left wing political like I already know it it's already going to be a thing and it's too bad I think if you were a NBA fan you're going to be having to listen to lefties virtue signal now throughout your games it sounds like not even sports is safe it seems and then we also have these WNBA shirts oh I see it seven times in the back that must have been very meaningful for their several viewers yeah that's the thing I mean I think that the WNBA is basically a political organization that sometimes plays basketball yeah that's the way I see it I'm pretty sure that this is like this is actually perfect for them because they're gain revenue through all this stuff right people actually might pay attention to WNBA which basically nobody ever would besides that yeah essentially so we have kind of pretty much every major team sports league bowing down to BLM not MMA though at least not not the individual players it seems we have actual athletes speaking out against the prevailing left wing narrative Colby Covington who is an MMA fighter he just fought for the welterweight belt in the UFC so he's actually a contender a very high level contender expected to fight for the belt again probably after another win um so that was enough of okay fair enough so he said in response to all of this NBA stuff oh wow you postponed your games want to prove you're really about change quit your multi-million dollar jobs and soft privileged lives playing a kid's game take a massive pay cut and perform the toughest job in America become cops that's a pretty pretty spicy tweet yeah that was mostly directed at LeBron James too I think but yeah I mean Colby the one thing I will say about him is I didn't tell Lawrence beforehand but he is first of all mega train all the way you might have seen him on Candace Olin show he's been to the White House he's met President Trump in fact Trump jr goes to see him fight like that he's really in there but he also plays heel a lot and this is part of his whole which is like he likes being the bad guy he likes people to root against him because he still makes money when they go see him fight and then he wins um so it's part of a personality I don't know how authentic it is I think that he is definitely of the the conservative nature but I don't know if you know that some of the MAGA stuff is definitely over the top that's all the UFC as a whole you said that it was individual fighters but I think that I saw a video a few months ago called commander in chief and it was actually about Donald Trump by the UFC and they were very pro-Trump but wasn't hang on but wasn't that because historically Trump has supported the UFC like as a entertainer and like business owner not necessarily because of his policies yeah well it's both Dana White spoke at the last Republican national convention as well and he is friends personal friends with president Trump but Donald Trump was one of the first I think it was a Trump hotel it was one of the first venues for MMA in North America when it was very hard to get athletic bodies to sanction the fights so I know that this is very interesting for everybody speaking given a history of MMA but ultimately yeah this MMA UFC in particular came out openly as pro-Trump and everybody was mad at Dana White for this speech that we're about to play now hey everyone I am Dana White the president of the UFC many of you know who I am what I do and that I am friends with the president I spoke at this convention four years ago and I'm back because I believe we need president Trump's leadership now more than ever before the pandemic president Trump built the greatest economy in our nation's history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him financial markets hit all-time highs unemployment was at an all-time low and we weren't facing the lawless destruction that now is occurring in a few of our great cities it blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society police departments and other law enforcement even some fire departments have faced opposition from many in this country but they are always the people who are asked to step up when things are at their worst and put themselves at risk that has certainly been the case during this ongoing pandemic come on America defunding these vital positions is not the answer so I was not familiar with Dana White before this but he is I guess the former owner president of the UFC but he just starts at 100 intensity and just from there I mean apparently he's like a fight promoter so that's his stick but yeah I mean I felt like he was yelling at me to like Trump more but I already like him a lot so it's like I don't well I think he knows me to give speeches he's not normally that that like brutish in the way that he delivers like to stay like like a Q&A sort of thing but yeah he came out all he came out like that but that's kind of the way Dana does business and he's kind of like that Trump-esque businessman you know very brash at least very brash so you know he's definitely at having Trump supporter he's one of the guys that Trump goes to actually the UFC was the first sports venue to open up post covid so he definitely has appreciated a lot of the support from the president and it comes across in some matches but not many people were happy with that yeah and it's it's too bad because I feel like we're kind of in this lose-lose situation as people who are on the right are remotely conservative I would love for things to not be political but at the end of the day if you don't say something then you're just gonna get steamrolled by leftists who are very vocal but if you do say something then you're gonna be demonized it's a tough thing because you know the left is telling themselves the exact same thing right they're like well they control the White House is their systems of oppression we have to speak up it's just weird how our our two worlds seem so disconnected both both groups think we have to use our platforms to speak out we're in dire situations to me it seems obvious where the power is just based on the social the social stigma and who's allowed to speak and who isn't allowed to speak but that's obviously not so evident to the left and the backlash that that the UFC got for this at least on twitter that we saw Dana White was trending is evidence of that now to me it's this one of those things where it's like there was a lot to boycott the UFC there was a lot to boycott the NHL actually because they were a day late to support the boycott do you think that these boycotts actually manifest into any meaningful change in viewership either way if they did the thing or didn't or do you think they're I mean I I've heard people say that they're fed up with politics and sports even with things like the NFL the kneeling they're not gonna watch and I think we I think there has been some manifestation of that in views with stuff like the WNBA or woman's soccer I mean it's hard to tell if there was a decrease from like I don't know five to three perhaps but overall I think this is just the new reality of what we're living with and I think it's only going to get worse if Trump wins the second term actually regardless I think it's just going to get worse but uh next up let us talk about Trevor Noah so he is of course the new host of The Daily Show he is South African he is unfunny in my humble opinion we have a video of his that he put out in response to the whole Jacob Blake and now Kyle Rittenhouse situation we're gonna be responding to that but first I want to tell you all about our

here we have this video from Trevor Noah and it was released I think gosh the 26th so there are some things that he says here that aren't necessarily up to date news but considering that he hasn't released any sort of retraction or clarification or update to his viewers I'm going to assume that this is still his opinion so he starts off by reacting to the original footage of Jacob Lake that was released. No matter how many times I watch these videos I'll never get used to how quickly police go from issuing commands to using deadly force like whatever happened to warning shots or tackling a suspect like are we really meant to believe that the only two options a cop has is do nothing or shoot somebody in the back seven times that's all we have. Hopefully you folks have seen the episode we did specifically about the Kenosha riots and things like that there is footage out there a second angle of the incident that shows that before Jacob Lake was walking around the car to reach into his vehicle and was shot cops had actually tased and tackled him and the reason why he got up was because he pulled a knife out on them. Yeah I mean to me I'm not an expert in this stuff but I think that cops I see this happen like this isn't the only video I've seen this happen in but cops I would like to see them be a little bit better trained in grappling personally because I've seen this happen a lot where the man being tackled if you choose us to resist is effectively able to get up actually we saw that recently in that shooting at Wendy's I forget the gentleman's name but who grabbed a taser if you recall he also was one that escaped two cops in fact so I would like to see cops be a little bit better at controlling a man when he might be resisting he's resisting I would like to see them be better trained in that I do think it's an unfortunate situation obviously when a knife comes out the game changes quite a bit and I'm really not claiming to be an expert there or talk like you know be too patronizing but ideally he shouldn't be able to grab that knife right if he's down you should have full control over where his his hands are and things like that I agree but then that kind of lead us into discussion like right now there's this push for things like more females on police forces and of course you can't expect a woman I don't care how well trained you are to be able to grapple and wrestle with you know a 300 pound dude perhaps so I mean that's a person or someone that's drugged up you know exactly and that has that basalt string something like that so I mean that's this whole other conversation but I thought this was kind of it cut it illustrates how a lot of times in media and I've been guilty of this too we're so quick to react without knowing what the actual facts are he's saying why wasn't there warning why didn't you try to tackle him what was your first instinct to shoot and kill no that is not what happened and so many of these times when we have these videos of police officers you know apparently brutalizing suspects once there's more information a lot of the times not always sometimes cops are in the wrong but a lot of times there is actual proof that oh they were resisting there was a struggle beforehand and it just seems like Trevor Noah was not interested in waiting for the facts or learning the the full story yeah and I find this one particularly sad because you know if you are right now a black criminal a black male criminal and you want to resist arrest and fight a cop you could do it no matter what because this is a situation that when you look at the background information as to what he was doing he was harassing allegedly allegedly harassing sexually and holding the key back from a woman right a woman of color probably too yeah I think it was and then he gets tackled and is reaching for a weapon as it was confirmed either yesterday I guess the time of this yeah he still is getting literal riots in his name right you know he did everything wrong he was a criminal that was resisting arrest it was very clear situation yeah he had an arrest warrant out for him and I in our video I mentioned he had an arrest warrant out for him and I had people saying well that doesn't justify the police shooting him and it's like no but I mentioned that because the police were out for him specifically he wasn't some random bystander the cops just wanted to pick on they were going call for him specifically he resisted arrest they tackled him he fought back he had a knife he ignored orders to stop one around and was reaching for another weapon like this was he was in the wrong here and I've when we release that video I heard people saying oh well seven shots in the back is too much when police have someone who they are fearful of that they think might endanger their lives they're trying to drop them then so I think we have to be careful to not place undue burden on police officers who are in fear of their lives if a suspect is reaching for a gun and you shoot them once but they're not dead there's nothing that says that they're not going to shoot you back right so it's like how much risk should police officers have to take with their own lives when there's some doing a violent suspect yeah it's a hard conversation it is and I think that being a police officer in America is probably harder than being a police officer in any other first world country at least I would say so because I mean listen the second amendment is great but the reality is there were more guns in America than people so when you're in a situation when someone is reaching into their vehicle and they're resisting arrest at the same time you're in a very very precarious situation as a police officer right and you as the person being arrested you can't do that because you're forcing them to make some very drastic assumptions and we've seen this time and time again I mean conservatives I would say that's I I live in Canada where we don't have guns and I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I get pulled over for a speeding ticket yeah it is what it is like I'm I'm not messing around I don't there's there's no real threat probably but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna entice the situation when the man has a gun and you know anything that happened right I mean think about it even when wild animals are loose on the streets they don't always shoot to kill they have tranquilizers they have nets I never thought I would wish for black people to be treated at least like a wild bear but here we are this I just thought was super dishonest very bad faith because again I mean he was they were trying to arrest him they tased him they tackled him he had a knife on them usually wild animals you don't have to worry about them stabbing you about them pulling out a gun so I thought this was just a very divisive very exaggerated thing to say and like who who are you helping by saying stuff like that you're feeding your base you're feeding into the narrative that no police treat black people worse than animals are like there's this the exact story you're talking about doesn't even support this yeah no I agree but I also want to say on a letter note though at the same time people have placed a lot more value in animal lives in the recent years than than historically some people will value the animal's life over any human's life I've seen I've seen people like that that would prefer in a questionnaire a starving child over the idea of a starving puppy so to me it's like I would like to be treated as well as some animals jelly bean here gets the immaculate treatment so I don't know the argument for many reasons in addition to just being completely hyperbolic and false and inflammatory race baiting let's be honest that's what it is you know still there are animals out there that I'm like you know I would like some of that please and I know people are questioning why Blake didn't just follow the police's orders just listen to the cops and you'll be fine and look I don't know why he didn't I don't all right maybe he was worried because he had outstanding warrants maybe it's because he knows what happened to George Floyd when he did follow the police's orders maybe he just wanted to get his sunglasses it doesn't matter to the police because they jumped straight to this black man is gonna try kill us if we don't kill him first okay so no the cops did not jump straight to this black man is trying to kill us right they did not show up to the scene and think oh black man gotta be careful they're they're a dangerous bunch no okay he resisted arrest he pulled out a weapon right he he got up after being tackled did not listen to orders that so frustrating I could say this till I was blue in the face he's not gonna hear it no and listen even if even if this guy has sensitive eyes and he was like guys just wait up on the arrest I need to go get my sunglasses in the compartment oh no I just we just went over this you can't do that you can't resist arrest took a good sunglasses in your car or anything in your car right it's ridiculous and even the George Floyd thing it was like you know yeah he's just resisting arrest because he saw what happened to George Floyd when he tried to comply okay like again there hey there is now footage of George Floyd actually resisting arrest then he was like in the car and he was asked to be brought out so it's like you're feeding into so many false narratives here and it's like as someone whose job it is explicitly to talk about the news it boggles my mind that you so you know so little about the news like honestly then next up Noah decides to cover the whole Kyle Rittenhouse development and that of course is the person the teenager who was open carrying in the Kenosha riots and who ended up killing two different people and then injuring a third there's this ongoing debate over whether it was self-defense or he was just some crazy white supremacist far-right terrorist domestic shooter in my opinion from what I've seen it does look like this was self-defense although it was a little bit he seemed a little bit over eager to insert himself into the situation but here is what Trevor Noah had to say about it that's right last night some guy decided to drive to Kenosha with his militia buddies to protect a business and apparently ended up shooting three people and killing two but don't worry the business is okay and let me tell you something no one drives into a city with guns because they love someone else's business that much that's some b**** no one has ever thought oh it's my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx they do it because they're hoping to shoot someone this really upset me and this type of rhetoric of how dare you place more importance on someone's property like just a business than an actual person's life um this is how you know that you are dealing with someone who if not being an outright communist has communist sympathies and no I'm not over exaggerating um you have a right to defend your property you do you have a right that is your god-given right it's not a constitutional right that is just kind of given to you by a piece of paper it's that as well but no just innately as a person you have the right to protect your property if someone is killed trying to steal damage or whatever your property it is not you who placed more value on the property than that person's life it is that person who placed more value on your property than their life because they are the one who aggressed upon you and your property they are the one that escalated the situation like the person who is merely defending themselves or their property they are not the one that started the confrontation and I've seen so many like marxis on twitter saying how you care more about this business than you do this person's life like no no it's this person the person who thought it was a good idea and we thought they had the right to steal or loot or destroy whatever they're the one who made this this moral choice choice it's not the the person who's simply defending themselves so that that was frustrating but also in regard to this Kyle person a lot of people are calling him a vigilante and you know what as a 17 year old I don't think he should have been out on those streets I think you know that's really young and you know you don't you want to be careful to not escalate any type of confrontation or violence or anything like that but I also want to say like for all of the people who are condemning that kid really really harshly he is a 17 year old the adults in the situation they're the ones who actually I think carry most of the blame right the people who are out riding the people who have told police to stand down I mean I can understand being a 17 year old and seeing all this happen and thinking why can't I do something yeah no I agree and and probably he and his militia friends probably have good intentions in terms of defending freedoms and property rights of americans they probably have some kind of idealism towards that in terms of responsibility of adults I might say that his parents probably should not be letting a child I would agree with that with a gun and a riot I don't care what his intentions are my my child will not be in that situation I agree with that yeah so yeah I am sometimes very hesitant with people that are over eager to branch firearms that I find if you've watched the show I find it just concerning just because you create a lethal situation immediately but unfortunately it is just the reality of of america it is it is the reality people have guns and that is the only way that you can defend yourself right and actually in regard to this coyote person now there's footage out saying or showing that he may have not been the first person to shoot no well you saw that in in the footage you could see that one of the men that when he fell in the second sort of altercation when he was being chased by the mob and he fell one of the men that attacked him and shot him the arm and got shot through the arm that was holding the pistol and he was trying to bring it around which may have yeah exactly that may have been a saving grace for kyle's life what clear instance of self-defense in that in that circumstance for sure um but I mean overall I I just I wouldn't be too harsh on the people who are out there who are trying to protect people's property I mean wouldn't it be great if we had some sort of specially designated force that was specially trained in order in how to handle these situations and who had the actual authority to be there yeah ideally yes but apparently we're trying to defund those people so I mean you know I I'm not a fan of vigilantism I'm not a fan of escalating things uh you know if that were mine could I'd be like stay home but like in general it's going to be really hard to keep telling people no stay home when they see their neighborhoods being burned down when they see all of this craziness happening someone I mean people out there they're going to get tired of it and they're going to try to take things into their own hands and it's just yeah if we don't shut things down we're going to keep seeing more of it well if the cops don't defend the property then yeah you know naturally there is no other choice I'm not even going to donate vigilante sort of stuff but you know that is what will happen for sure and you know in that circumstance it does make sense to me to some degree that you just take up arms and try to defend what is yours or your neighbor is even but I do find it sad I do of course I would like to see the cops doing this the state should have a monopoly of violence that's the way I see it I guess it's not the American way I guess because the citizens have a lot of things but that is what makes the state a state um I I just wish that you know with our their instances of police brutality that make it difficult but to me when there's a riot like this I'm perfectly fine with the police being fairly draconian yeah like at a certain level that you need to have mass arrests right it needs to be real consequences for these rioters in order to stop this civil unrest and the cops are hamstrung right now I guess for a variety of reasons and that forces people like this to some I mean I don't want to lay the entire like he's got no agency to not put himself there but this is what will happen definitely it really made me wonder why some people get shot seven times in the back while other people are treated like human beings and reasoned with and taken into custody with no bullets in their bodies how come Jacob Blake was seen as a deadly threat for a theoretical gun that he might have and might try to commit a crime with but this gunman who was armed and had already shot people who had shown that he is a threat was arrested the next day so I mean we're just making stuff up now yeah I guess uh again Jacob Blake he had a knife he was resisting arrest Kyle Rittenhouse even if you don't believe he acted in self-defense he was not shooting at the cops right he was not resisting arrests and he approached the cops with his hands in the air yeah clearly um he walked right but he told him that there was a shooting in fact after the first event he actually called the cops right um and and alerted them via 911 that there was a shooting um so he did just about everything right except for I legally going home that was that was that is he should have done it he will have issues with that especially just because his home happened to be across a state border yeah and people keep bringing that up but I think it's like 20 minutes away or something yeah well it's Wisconsin and Illinois right and they're they're they're bordering states they're very close I believe that his house is something either 15 or 30 miles away it's very very close right um if you're a 17 year old and the cops walk by you like they did to go and investigate the situation you might not know what to do but it is still your legal obligation to know what the law is I guess right especially if you're planning on inserting yourself in a situation like that um but I I just thought that this was such a gross way to feed and really exacerbate division by Trevor Noah Trevor Noah you're kind of concocting this narrative that says white people can walk around and shoot people with impunity and face zero consequences they're they're gonna be allowed to go home whereas if you're just a black guy who wants to reach into a car cops gonna pop out out of nowhere and shoot you in the back seven times I mean if you know nothing of the case aside from what Trevor Noah tells you that may actually be the takeaway that you have and it's just simply it's not true and I know I've even had this conversation with my father he was like yeah can you believe that the cops and I was like well actually look at this footage actually listen to the nine-year-old call that was the reason the cops were there on the first place and there is so often more to the story than what the left-wing media tells you and I guess that would be the the main takeaway from this segment but moving on a lot of you probably were not aware of this but this past week it was actually women's equality day and I think it was to mark the anniversary of the 19th amendment and women getting the right to vote which is you know cool thing yay you know versatile suffrage etc etc but uh it seems from what I saw online that this has also become a way for brands to not just signal their support for good job women you can vote vote but now all of these other feminist issues example of this Ben and Jerry's notoriously woke company they released a post saying today is hashtag women's equality day but we have a whole lot more to celebrate if women in the US didn't lose a combined total of almost one trillion dollars every year due to the gender pickup oh the monolith that is women entirely yeah right and I love how they're framing it now women lose out like yes you're a woman you are losing money men are stealing money from you every year like that's such a weird way to phrase it one thing that I like about these these like marx us kind of like proportionality kind of things right where it's like 50 percent or women we you know we need to make 50 percent of the overall income of the country yeah it's like once the numbers go the other way the other way they don't care right it's like the NBA we were just talking about earlier it's like blacks are really overrepresented in the NBA you don't see many Mexicans in there because their average height is lower right something like that but there's no push for more white people yeah it's no push for more white people that win men which have for years now had a lesser graduation rate in post-secondary education you'll hear nothing about it right and there's a whole bunch of metrics that you could visit like in addition to things that the MRI might complain about uh MRI activist um mentored activist activist yeah yeah fair enough ATM machine yeah um that they complain about like divorce rates things like that suicide rates all these things they don't care about these things when they're disproportionately not impacting the groups that they are concerned with yeah and I think it goes to show that this isn't about equality for a lot of the feminist activists who are around today it's it's about power right that's why they don't say anything when women are overrepresented in a nice cushy field like teaching or nursing they're fine with that they're happy with that that's why they aren't out there pushing to get more women into roles like I don't know welding or hard labor or they're not out there trying to uh balance out the workplace death gap that's not a thing it's a boomer argument but like the garbage men argument is like the you know I've never heard once garbage men get paid actually fairly well considering like the skill level for the labor but you'll never hear any complaints about well we don't have enough women garbage men yeah again it's because they're not concerned with equality it's about power and we also have this tweet from twitter together this hashtag women's equality day let's remember to trust women just in general trust women yeah uplift women accept women believe women support women respect women fight for women listen to women stand with women there's this concerning trend in our culture to associate women an entire gender with morality I love it like with the moral good isn't also like in some ways some of that message deeply like chauvinistic oh absolutely like uh and you know to some degree I don't mind chauvinism but you know like I hold a door open but yeah you might get a dirty look from a pink-haired one but you know you still do it but yeah that stuff like fight for women and say what does that mean you know believe women was because they're morally perfect I don't understand support women I mean there's this one quote from george r martin that I really love and he was being asked about how he's able to write women characters so well and he says something along the lines of well you know I've always believed that women are people and that is but it's it's such a true concept that I feel like the far left forgets women are people who um just like men experience the full spectrum of human morality some are good some are bad some lie whatever when you say stuff like believe women support when blah blah like you're not asking to treat women equally because you would never say believe men you would never say that you're asking for them to be coddle like the special class and I just want to say by the way twitter together it's like this verified twitter account that I think is for their diversity initiatives it says hashtag black lives matter on their banner it links to like twitter's diversity and inclusion report is this the type of company you want being able to control political discourse in your country just an aside that I wanted to make I don't but that is that is how things work now next up from mlizabeth warren we had this hashtag women's equality day is bittersweet as our nation faces down a pandemic and economic crisis that's disproportionately impacting women okay that's like just not true though like most males or sorry most deaths from coronavirus are men so also I think most men are disproportionately in first responder roles as well yeah well though there will be some kind of stat where it's like oh nurses have to work more over time yeah it's like well all women are slaves I guess you're right the problem is there's so much information out there right now like this is this goes across everything that we talk about the chara nova stuff all the stuff there's so much information accessible that you can cherry pick and make a plot line you know you can but it's why even try to make it the pandemic uh gender thing like why well you set it before it's about power that's what it's about and they're not going to stop until they have another attempt at communism that's the truth of it I actually communism was trending on twitter the other day yeah unironically i'm sure yeah it's uh crazy stuff but she continues especially women of color because she gotta get the intersectionality of course like herself women of color exactly while administration steeped in misogyny and racism looks the other way we've got work to do donna and mam then she says there's no independence without financial independence there's no equality without financial quality hashtag women's equality day you're just like asking for money like what unless I have as much money as you i'm not equal i mean that is what communists believe but what yeah i don't get it i mean the first part of it could be libertarian though i guess without financial independence but yeah the equality stuff again equality is um is a loaded word now yeah you know it doesn't actually mean equality by the way it has and has very little to care about equity yeah yeah exactly and then just to mix things up i have what is actually a nice post tarry erwin steve erwin's wife steve was always an awesome advocate hashtag women's equality day and there's him with a their crocodiles not alligators uh well i can't tell from here but they're probably crocodile so there's him with a crocodile and then her with a crocodile i just thought that was nice you know yeah uh rest in peace yeah he was a good man uh okay and then what was really interesting online was seeing the i guess division between how western feminists talked about women's equality day and you know feminists in developing countries talked about women's equality day so here we have this post by lambda legal hashtag women's equality day is a perfect day to remember that trans women are women abortion is essential health care as is a sicid reproduction as is birth control okay lesbians are powerful bisexual and queer women are valid lgbtq parents deserve equal parental rights along with the pay day when you have stuff or sorry along with the pay gap when you have the stuff about abortion you're kind of painting a very very first world vision of what women's problems are nowadays which is actually kind of a good thing because it goes to show how far we've come but when you look at the feminists in places like india who are tweeting tweeting about national women's equality day it really it illustrates i think how western feminists have lost the plot right so here's this post i'm not even going to try to pronounce them because unfortunately i would butcher it so sorry but it says hashtag women's equality day millions have pledged not to kill unborn girl child motivational source by this other user and there's an infographic saying women's equality day to promote gender based equality millions have pledged to not kill their unborn daughters and i think there's yeah they have laws around i've read studies on that i've done work on that and yeah they have laws actually about like doctors in certain areas in the country particularly rural areas and they can't disclose the sex but they'll still get around it by saying oh you guys should celebrate you know but things like that because if they have a girl uh they're very likely to abort it because they work on a dowry system and there's a whole bunch of reasons around it all right and it was actually a similar thing when um especially when china had the one child policy yes a lot of chinese girl babies i mean the ones that weren't end up just abandoned they were aborted before they were even born because you know chinese girl baby is not going to carry on the family name you know be less likely to be able to take care of the parents and things like that and it's actually it gets a real problem in a lot of developing countries yeah of course there are other problems that end up down the line like you know men not having enough women first of all and uh what do you mean have women liam having access to marital partners i guess is probably yeah you're right i mean uh fair enough um getting by the way yeah yeah but i mean the point is i mean it would suck to be a man in a situation like that where it's like there's literally no women yeah you're competing for like a very small like you maybe got like a half chance of getting married in fact in that area in india i was talking about i remember this now it just came to me they have what's called um sometimes they have i forget the exact term but it's it has the word for fraternal in it and you might your eyes like widen a little bit as you might have understood that has to do with two brothers having a wife that they share like as a family um so yeah that's like actually you could just abort me in that yeah there's yeah there's definitely problems to doing that but i thought it was striking because here we have these western feminists who are complaining about things like an imaginary pay gap trans women are women and then you look over to india and the femmes are literally like please don't abort us yes like don't murder us before we're even born and actually the whole sex based abortion thing that's not really an issue i've heard pro-choice people touch on very much because if you are someone who believes that oh it's just a bunch of clump of cells it's not a person well then there's no reason to not abort this girl clump of cells even though the idea of it just being a clump of cells but also having a sex is kind of i don't know how they would reconcile that but yeah i think there is maybe a uh a disconnect in being able to say something like it's wrong to limit abortions anyway but also don't abort your girl babies that's that's yeah that's a very good point this might this feminist stands of saying don't abort female babies might be incongruent with modern-day feminists right exactly because you could abort whatever you want for whatever reason you want why not yeah i mean it's not even a girl right yeah yeah but yeah i i hope wherever you are you passed a good national women's equality day i don't know i don't think there's i know there's international women's day and international men's day i don't think there's um national men's equality day though i don't think that's the thing that has both genders represented so i'm sure some mr's are going to get onto that but i think that's pretty much all we have to say for now uh is it yeah yeah i guess so i mean we definitely butchered that second segment earlier hopefully that turns out okay in post uh we hope you enjoy sports talk you'd have to lead that i told you you'd have to lead anyway uh yeah um thank you so much for tuning in and we'll see you next time take care"
