    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast third hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show gets going right now one thing that is a constant as you all know That the democrat corporate media lies to you all the time constantly pushing an agenda journalism as a profession Is something that people don't view the same way they used to and that's a good thing Because it really is warring propaganda machines out there. They're pushing agendas. They aren't bringing you just facts You all know that And I actually saw today that the most regretted above even gender studies and sociology and Communications there was some pull that was circulating some data out there this morning that the most regretted major was journalism Because you know what journalism is Reading and writing and communicating You're not getting a leg up on everybody else by studying journalism in school. In fact, I even know people who have taught at Top J schools journalism schools And they will tell people quietly it's a waste of time and money don't do it But the journals clay are relentless. They are true believers in their first of all They're they're this really noxious combination of incredibly arrogant and condescending but also deeply insecure and aware of the fact that they're all very replaceable So it's it's a difficult personality type to hand it to handle to manage But we have yet another instance of the fake news Great term that president trump gave us the fake news showing us what they're really all about nbc news reporter Miguel al-maguer I think that's right Was suspended over his Now retracted paul polosi story So he reported if we all remember the paul polosi story that got so much attention God was attacked it was uh vicious attacked but people were asking some questions as I said clay just on a security basis How does this guy just walk into the home of I mean I would assume their capital police had cameras they were There they were asleep at the wheel not not ask any questions though. It was a right wing trump supporter They said that it's I mean which this guy is just clearly completely out of his mind but so Miguel al-maguer uh reported that Nancy Pelosi's husband paul didn't let on that he was in danger when the police were at his home right away And so there were some questions about this And clay This is early stage reporting. I mean think about all the reporting on something Far more serious and horrific than this like this shooting at uvalde clearly So much reporting that was completely wrong Now in this case al al-maguer it's not believe he didn't fabricate it This is just what was reported to him by either by law enforcement sources I would assume at the time And they are suspending it. I mean he is getting and this is now public he's getting an official punishment For this and we all sit here and go oh, okay So you you upset the libs you upset the democrat narrative in some way clay or make things even more difficult for a news cycle for them And there are professional consequences But you lie about russia collusion for four years you get a Pulitzer that's where we are. Okay And I would just point out they could easily have eliminated all of this uncertainty By releasing some of the body cam footage The police officers have body cams on them If they wanted to get the full story out there They have the charges that they have brought against this guy At some point they could have just released the body cam footage How often do you see body cam footage out there from police in? tumultuous controversial cases all the time And your point on uvalde is a great one Everything that we were told Initially on the uvalde school shooting ended up being a lie everything Just about and so every reporter got it wrong because they were lied to It's really really amazing. I mean this was a today show report That they pulled off of the nbc website That they took completely down And now they are castigating and chastising this reporter because he said something we still Don't know 100 percent what the story is here because we haven't seen the full footage or the full details come out They just he said something that upset the democrat party and as a result nbc news the same We can't have this have you heard it's just a good question for everybody out there Have you heard of any journalist at nbc cbs a bc washington post new york times M s nbc and n have any Journalist been suspended for any russia collusion report at all you mentioned this but I mean just one I haven't seen it publicly that anybody has been suspended. They got everything on this They got the Russia collusion themselves rewards for fake legitimate fake news And I just think this is instructive. I mean it's all about the narrative. It's just service of the narrative We all know it. It's very obvious We have to keep hammering it though because You you should not ever lull yourself into thinking or allow yourself to think Well, maybe the journos are going back toward the center and you know, they've realized the air of their ways you kidding me I mean president trump is Likely announcing his run for the presidency tonight right to be president for four more years I've been saying this as you know clay and everyone listening for quite some time The media is just waiting for this and then all the anti- trump machinery kicks right back into place CNN's talking about the insurrection 24 seven. I mean this this is what many of them think they need really for for raiding So it's not like they've actually decided that what they did in the past was partisan dishonest and and wrong But I will say on the on the upside of things you do have this uh elan musk takeover of twitter Still playing out there's a couple of bugs, you know, there's a couple of little Issues here and there just as the site goes because clay and are both very active on it Um, and this may mean that we'll we'll have a site that has true free speech and real Free speech implications going into the next election cycle that we really didn't in this last one Um and everyone I know i'm sure you've seen the same thing clay all of a sudden all these conservatives You know, you're your engagements up 50% your follower count Going up more than it has everything that we said about how they were throttling and it's all true They were doing all kinds of shenanigans behind the scenes at twitter The psycho woke libs were playing every game they could to help their side and make it all seem like it was on the up and off It's a free exchange of ideas site, but this is pretty amazing elan tweeted out. Uh, this was actually on on november 13th I'd like to apologize for twitter being super slow in many countries app is doing Over a thousand poorly batch rpc's just to render a home timeline now to be fair. I have no idea what that means They were do I yeah, I mean like I'm not pretending to know about any of this stuff I mean I sometimes carry has to help me like switch from the smart tv to the old tv, you know I'm not great at this stuff people like you were in the CIA. I'm like, yeah We had smart people who did that stuff in the CIA too This guy though eric fronofer Response to elan musk who is his boss apparently at twitter I have spent six years working on twitter for android and can say this is wrong gets 102,000 likes And then some guy who goes by the moniker money nerd techie Well, I think probably does know about this stuff I have been a developer for 20 years and I can tell you as the domain expert here You should inform your boss privately Trying to one up him in public while he's trying to learn and be helpful makes you look like a spiteful self-serving dev for developer mr Eric fronofer writes maybe he should ask questions privately maybe using slacker email And then elan just tweets in he's fired And he is it turns out Messing with the richest man in the world who is also your boss and the new ceo of your company Is a bad idea Wokesters I love this Let me also just I said this on fox news earlier today because we were talking about this story a little bit You cannot believe that elan musk is going to have success at twitter But there are a lot of blue checks running around like oh elan musk doesn't understand twitter he has no hope This guy is better at spend it sending rocket ships to space than nasa is And he totally remade the way that we power cars Both of those things if if you told me right now buck like 20 years ago Hey, I think I can send rockets to space better than nasa cheaper more efficiently and I can return them Most people would say that's a that's a really tall order And if you also said simultaneously and while i'm doing that I'm going to redesign cars So that we don't have to rely on gas and i'm going to electric power them and all these other things A lot of people would say that's really difficult to do Figuring out a social media app and configuring it and analyzing it and and compared to that Compared to sending spay rocket ships to space better than nasa and designing cars without the combustion engine This is not very complicated So i'm not sure whether the business of twitter is going to be a success because I think there's certainly Bet you can place on that But the idea that elan musk is not going to be able to understand the mechanics of twitter Which this uh little software engineer developer whoever he was was sniping at elan musk This is one of the most brilliant people on the planet and he's already succeeded in literal rocket uh ship making And also now in the car business By redesigning the combustion engine. I think he's probably going to be able to handle twitter I'm just placing my bet down on this guy can figure it out I just also, you know, I don't do the hero worship thing But I do live in reality And I think when someone is the richest man on the planet because they've done the things that you've laid out there Like maybe maybe show a little respect, you know what i mean? Maybe don't be like oh mr. idiot elan doesn't know anything about the back end machinations of the I can't even know what you call this thing the software once you start getting a computer science I mean it is a totally might as well be speaking mandarin. I have no idea what's going on I'm like you in terms of tech. I mean I run a media company and uh, we've got a lot of tech Obviously involved in that media company I mean when I want to watch thursday and i football on amazon I have to call in my wife or my kids to figure out how to get on amazon streaming as opposed to a traditional cable Like I hate trying to find sporting events now on my television because they're streamed so many different ways But you know, I I still think i'm gonna tell you this now I think i'm gonna be able to beat my kids one day in video games. I feel like old school Nintendo got us very primed for this. I see everyone saying all their old digital natives sorely mistaken I think like fiefa 2035 is gonna come out on playstation 19 or whatever and i'm gonna i'm gonna be schooling my kids I think that you know the gap is not as big as people I will say they have gotten me to play fortnight against them They've gotten me to try to do the minecraft building and I grew up on the uh, I grew up on video games now You may have played video games longer than me right because uh when I Started having kids like they got years of advantage on me like I play you that they use something called a pinball machine That was the that was the state of the art, you know and clay was coming up the ranks I'm real. I could beat him in tech mobile. You know, you want to play tech mobile. You want to play rbi baseball You want to play uh, you want to play the old school and then detendo eight bit games. I'll wreck these kids Uh, but uh, but when it comes to the modern day madden, uh, they let dad have it pretty bad Yeah, well there you have so i'm just i'm just saying that your prediction may may actually be If somebody if somebody gunned your head says greatest for you at the time greatest video game that you ever played What would it be? Techno super bowl greatest video game ever created. Um first one with 11 players like it's the best game ever What are you? Myers original civilization for me even though now is that a computer game? Yes Very nerdy. What are you are best game ever was a computer game? It was amazing. Yeah, I used to play as montazuma and then just end up nuking everybody. It was phenomenal Uh blades of steel baseball stars rbi baseball Um the original tech mobile all of those would be in my contra back in the day remember I love the contra video game. I also on n64. I remember the golden. I video game multiplayer Oh, everybody was was revolutionary in its time and mario cart There were some people who would imbibe illegal substances and play the mario cart. You say mario not mario Isn't it mario you say mario When mario just i you might have just caught me be doing the weird pro I might have just pulled the clay there with my pronunciation. No, I'm just isn't it super mario brothers You would say super mario brothers is that the way you would i think it's mar I think you're right.

I read the print newspaper When you finished that article about the transgender The surgeries and also the puberty blockers There was an article about a 10 year old who got a tattoo And in that article about a 10 year old who got a tattoo They quoted several experts have said as saying how in the world could any parent let their 10 year old get a tattoo Kids who are that young don't have the ability to make life altering decisions. I'm paraphrasing Yet there were many experts in the article about the puberty blockers saying well if a 12 year old decides They don't want to go into puberty. We should definitely do it and the overriding story year buck Was that when you get puberty blockers Your bones don't develop like they normally would and many of these kids are facing osteoporosis issues Where their bones are brittle because puberty is when many kids I didn't know this but your bones strengthen to a large degree To support you being able to handle an adult body And many of these kids getting puberty blockers are having issues with their bone strength In addition to all the issues that might arise obviously from changing your gender while you're still under 18 years old So there's something you know called body integrity identity disorder Which is when somebody wants to amputate a healthy limb. Yeah, this is a real psychological condition Uh, I believe it is still in the dsm. I think it is still something that uh, the medical community psychiatric medical community will We'll talk about There was a story class since we're discussing this yesterday In on vice which is a very left wing so-called news organizations like a left wing blog Trans people are seeking non binary bottom surgeries.

It's inappropriate We all know this well not everybody but everyone listening to this knows that And this was new i had never heard of this before And now i want to point out this is reported on in vice which is it's essentially like the The place for very far left wing hipsters with Yeah, you know this is like a very far left wing website i'll put it to you that way a lot of a lot of nose rings and blue hair and You know black lives matter and announcing pronouns and get your six vac shots. That's kind of the vice vibe So it's their reporting on this trans people are seeking non-binary bottom surgeries is the story here Across the gender spectrum. I'm quoting everybody Some patients are looking for mixed sets of genitals or none at all And actually receiving this affirming care isn't easy. Okay, a couple things here clay before I let you let you get into this Situation First of all, you can tell by the subhead here the subhead line That the problem here is oh my gosh. We're not letting people easily get mixed genital sets or no genital sets I want to be clear in this article. They go into there are now transgender self identified individuals who want surgery to have both a penis and of a giant simultaneously because that is their gender identity journey Or i'm not even sure which is I mean this this I think this is probably the more strange one to have all genitalia removed entirely and have only You know a urinary tract effectively in that area This is a thing that is happening and some doctors are being told by their patients that this is the surgery That they want I would I would wonder within the trans left wing activist community On what basis could this is their truth on what basis will they tell them they can't do this Yeah, this is all crazy um and My general belief is if you're over 18 years old and you want to make crazy choices for yourself You can do it. I think it's unlikely to lead to you being happier I think many of these people are psychologically broken and they feel like they need to take Gray the action in order to make themselves happy and I suspect Very often after all these surgeries They think oh if I just did this I would be happy if I just fed and then they aren't right But this is next level crazy. This is just At some point There is a difference between I mean the analogy on halloween Which is if your kid dresses up like a cowboys and indians then it's totally unacceptable But if an adult decides that they want to change their gender and they Demand that you use the pronouns of their choice. It's permissible the line I think matt wall shaded in his in his what is a woman? Peace, which I thought was really good is you don't get to pick your adjectives Right so take away the pronoun thing like i'm gonna share my pronouns with you or whatever else But I don't get to say you can only refer to me as handsome You can only refer to me as brilliant. You can only refer to me as a genius like You everybody out there can make their own determinations about how you see me or you or anyone else This idea that you can demand your pronouns Is is crazy and I don't know where the trans agenda goes But it feels like Many people increasingly are saying hey You wanted to change your gender or whatever, but you you you've gone off the crazy training So what would be fascinating to me and remember We we can call this and I do think this is mental illness I'm not a doctor, but I would I would make the argument as a layperson that that's what's going on here um That that clay what we it keeps getting crazier and they don't stop I think we need to be very cognizant of that meaning that the more You know it was oh just use my pronouns And now it's oh I get to compete against the opposite gender and use their locker rooms or else You're a bigot and the by administration by the way may go back to giving title line protection to transgender athletes Which means the whole thing then is just a free for all for anybody who wants to compete against the other gender You have people demanding that they are put in a woman's prison even if they are a man with a penis They just say I'm a woman so put me in the woman's prison. It keeps getting crazier This is the nature of this movement of this situation. It never stops and this is Oh, and I would say the most recent manifestation we have seen is The we got to get the kids to do this. We got to get 12 year olds to take the puberty No, that's then that's and now a level beyond that is individuals who are saying I want to have No genitalia. I have a right to have a medical profession remember this is a serious surgery with all kinds of come I mean you're not you know this is not uh, this is not growing your hair out and putting on lipstick I mean this is something you got to be put on general anesthesia You got to have a surgeon all this stuff. They want doctors to remove All genitals so sort of like, you know, ken and barbie doll situation here That is what they are demanding and what's fascinating is that they're getting pushed back from within the trans community according to this article For making it seem too crazy That's what so interesting. So finally wokeness has now turned on wokeness and they're trying to figure out Can we make this next step happen? I'm gonna tell you something they're gonna keep pushing this You know what they tried for a look there are a couple of articles one thing they tried for a little while is Um, you are a bigot if you are a man who is not attracted to a trans female because trans women are women You're a bigot. They actually like huffington post had some articles about this that didn't work I think they're gonna try this one next which is that hey if you want to have both sets so to speak It's fine. It's fine And and by the way, joe biden will have some influencer to the white house And they'll say oh god bless you. You know you got the two sets He's fine with this the white house goes along with all of this I just don't know where we go from here I I almost by the way clay almost flabbergasted with this one which i've almost never seen I can barely speak I just when you told me about this like basically the way to think of it is like if you've ever seen a barbie Doll or a kin doll people are just wiping their entire genitals out I don't even know Like this is clearly psychological like they are they are like clearly like Mentally ill right body identity integrity disorder is something that the that people that are critical of the trans Agenda and activism have been bringing up for Years because people realize that you're asking a surgeon to I don't like my left arm remove my left arm That is essentially, you know boiled down what we're talking about here This is that now basically remove everything down there This is body integrity identity disorder which the trans activist community was always saying well we would that's totally different This is about living your truth. It's actually not that different It's just crazy and I don't know how we get back to not being crazy honestly spend a lot of time thinking about that We'll close out donald trump is making his announcement tonight at nine What do we hope that he says in this presidential announcement at mara lago tonight at nine? Buck and i'll discuss certainly we'll be talking about it tomorrow as well in the meantime Getting kids to read not easy If you have kids and I do I have found it to be very difficult at times to get them to read and Also, what they read can matter a great deal you want to entertain and also inform them But understand what they are learning and that's why i'm such a fan of Total radio.com and the total twins books to help get your kids to read they're written for kids They take great topics for conversation around the dinner table with you and your family They focus very often the total twins do on our nation's history They tell good stories and they weave in themes about self-reliance and self-initiative History lessons are great.

That's total radio.com Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show we were talking a little bit about yellow stone Which i'm trying to get buck to watch most popular show on television right now. Oh, hold on. Hold on I'm like on season three. It's not like i'm just making my way through it. It's very good Season five started monster audience. Uh, I watched that first two episodes on sunday night Kevin costner It's a it's a show. I think it's fair to say that if you are tired of woke programming out there By and large yellow stone is anti woke. I think would be a way to describe is it? Is it an anti woke or is it just what everybody thought was kind of normal, you know 15 or 20 years ago It's like to build mar line about don't say gay bill It's like I read it. It's basically what everybody considered to be normal about school five years ago Which is totally true and I know many of you out there feel like you're in a head spinning universe Where things have gone so crazy so quickly so Uh to say we've got an announcement tonight from donald trump 9 p.m. Eastern mara wago expectation is I mean you heard him on the show donald trump with us last Tuesday a week from a week ago and he said hey, i'm going to be announcing down at mara lago But we talked a little bit about this earlier what I would want to hear from trump is nothing about 2020 I would like for him to eviscerate the decisions that joe biden has made and my biggest concern about trump Is that biden is a disaster and the democrats are a disaster We need to prosecute the case about why they are doing a bad job And i'm concerned that trump makes everything about himself And so we're going to let biden and his administration wriggle off the hook for what otherwise is the worst presidency of our life Donald trump needs to be a prosecutor here He needs to go directly after joe biden and the democrats and not focus on 2020 or anything associated with that in my opinion if he's going to put together a strong candidacy in 24 The left wing apparatus Knows how to run against trump now we could argue whether or not that means they know how to win against trump again But they know how to fight against him now day to day I think this was just I tried to remind everybody of this trump in 2016 caught them sleeping Trump was they thought it was a joke CNN was airing his rallies because it would they thought it looked hilarious to their audience and it was all such a carnival and so ridiculous And he got billy the acquit they did his analysis of this It was like a billion dollars of free advertising From non fox networks that were running his running his speeches They would cover because it was the most entertaining amazing thing on tv and jeff zucker and the rest of his uh of the you know CNN quizzlings Were thinking ha ha this is hilarious hillary is gonna win They Realize what a mistake that was it's also why they booted him off of social media folks. Yep They don't want they don't want him. They so keeping it's not the same situation as it was then So to clay's point if you get a trump that's focused on the mission That wants to bring back the coalition of 2016 that voted for him and is is essentially going to show um, I I think some degree of discipline in that focus um, that's I think that's the pathway forward for for trump to to make a real go of it here and and to to go forward and Be able to remember it's not just about beating the democrats in 2024 It's also going to be The day in and day out battles that we have in the meantime Trying to convince the american people of what's really going on here You know and trying to make sure that wins can be racked up in states with republican Legislatures and governors and trump is going to be the if he is the nominee let's just assume let's just assume That he announces and that he is effectively unchallenged So we're not you know people right now talking to santis There are a lot of people saying they think pompeo and niki haley and all these other names are good Let's assume trump runs and ever goes. You know what? It's his race. It's his race and uh, i'm gonna stay out of it Um Were that to happen trump would be the de facto leader of the republican party for the next two years And there's a lot that comes along with that Right, I mean every word every utterance that he makes is going to go into the new cycle in a way That will have an effect on policy have an effect on perception so I just think that's we you'd have to see a trump that was On board for all of that And uh, and we'll see i mean i don't know i'm actually going to talk to some of his people See if i can get a little bit of a preview in the next couple hours of what he's going to be saying Um, but i'm i'm very curious very curious to see how he how he comes out of the gate I just want him to take the attack to biden what we cannot allow We cannot allow Their feliures not to be the primary story in 2024 And so my concern is if trump turns this into a relitigation of 2020 Then it's letting biden Of the way of responsibility for his dog Don't you think he has to go beyond i mean we did the biden sucks and the democrats are horrible thing for the last Well, he saw it for the last two years obviously wasn't enough in the mid-term So as a messaging going forward, I mean, I think trump need to put his reagan hat on here and inspire people Which by the way, he did do in 20, you know, he was he was pugnacious, but that was part of the 2016 run Yeah, and I think you're right. I think republicans need to let people know what they're for Because I talked to a bunch of people and they said hey inflation's awful the economy's a disaster crime Border everything else, but when you just point out things are awful and you don't say and we're going to fix it this way We need not only to diagnose the problems. We need to have a solution So I would also like for trump to start to put forward solutions to help cure the malaise that exists in this country As a result of joe biden having put together so far the worst presidency in any of our lives So we're going to have the after action assessment of trump's Big announcement tonight for you tomorrow plus a whole lot else to talk about here. We'll have New focus. I think clay. We've got to think about how do we make sure her shall walk or wins this senate race It's going to be determined in a few weeks. No doubt"
