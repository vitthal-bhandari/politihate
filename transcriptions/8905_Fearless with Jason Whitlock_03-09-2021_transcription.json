    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock. Happy Friday to you and yours. Uncle Jimmy's here. They took your welcome back sign. You're not doing this like a birthday. It's not your welcome back week. No, no, no. We only welcomed you back for two days. That's all I need, man. That's all you need. I had a lot of people call and ask me about you. And I told he's fine. He's made it through the web. You said, nope, you can't have his job. He's fine. I have heard from Jay Flake. But hey, we got a fantastic, fantastic show planned. We're going to go out to Washington, D.C. and talk with the smartest man on the show, Professor D Delano Squires. He's written a column about the war being waged on American children by the real American Taliban, which has some good synergy with the fire I'm about to start. But also we're going to go out to a Chicago talk with our man, Fearless contributor Greg Couch. He's written a piece about COVID and the unvaccinated, I say, unvaxxed or the new black. I think he says the unvaxx are the new minorities. He tries to be politically correct, I think. I'm not politically correct. And Greg said it. I'm signing with him. I know you are because you're an idiot. Your grandkids are idiots. But Uncle Jimmy also has a parody song that I think incorporates Bobby Brown. He's got a parody song. We got you around for that. I've seen a little preview of it. I'm trying to throw you off the trail, but it's pretty funny. But you guys know what I like to do at the beginning of a show. I like to start a fire. We're losing the mold war to China. Did you get that M-O-L-D, the mold war to China? The Asian superpower and America's economic and military rival is molding its culture in masculinity. America is doing the reverse. With the gentle nuts from China, we're leaping into our feminine energy. We're leaning into our feminine energy. On Thursday, China's lawmakers announced a ban on television programming with the incorrect political positions, including shows featuring a feminine man. Jim, I don't know if he could work in China. The Chinese Communist Party is pushing back against the feminization of men. Meanwhile, here in America, we're celebrating it. Also on Thursday, the rapper Little Nasty X-rated, or Little Nasti X, partnered with People Magazine to promote the fallacy that he's having a baby. In an extravagant photo spread, Little Nasti was pictured pregnant. His new album, Monteiro, is slated to be born on September 17th. Little Nasty X put out over social media. Surprise! I can't believe I'm finally announcing this. My little bundle of joy, Monteiro is due September 17th, 2021. Yeah. See, over here in America, we have birthing people. Did you know that, Jim? We don't have pregnant women. We have birthing people. Men can have babies here in America. I know many of you think we should ignore Little Nasty X-rated. He's a troll. The maker of Old Town Road is a one-hit wonder who is constantly courting controversy for relevance because his music is no good. I wish all of that were true. Little Nast is important because he has the support of our cultural puppet masters. There's a reason People Magazine supported his pregnancy photos. Little Nasti is bait for the minds of young people. He's a tool being used to feminize little boys. Old Town Road made him an icon among grade schoolers. Now that he's an influencer of the young, he's putting out music to influence young boys into the LGBTQ plus direction. Every other month, he executes an attention-grabbing stunt connected to a sexual taboo. When he's not giving the devil a lap dance, he's torquing necky in a prison shower or pose in a satin-white dress with a huge baby bump. Just a few years ago, we were, perhaps falsely, led to believe that three to four percent of Americans were gay. Now, when you turn on television or open a social media app, society is presented as a narrative centered around alternative sexual identities. Transgenders make up one percent of society, maybe less than that. But 50 percent of our conversations are sitting around transgenders. This is by design and manipulation. If China is attempting to build a more masculine society, what kind of society would it love for its chief rival to adopt? America is ruled by toxic femininity. The pleasing of emotions and feelings is our highest priority. We take so seriously the protection of feelings and emotions that thought crimes are judged more harshly than actual crimes. January 6 is a great example. The rioters at the Capitol have been labeled and treated as insurrectionists, even though the damage they cause at the Capitol pales in comparison to a typical Black Lives Matter and Antifa riot. The real crime of January 6 is wrongthink. The rioters wrongly think Donald Trump was a good president. Supportive Trump offends the sensibilities of feminized Americans. Man can never please, can never really fully please a woman. It's not in her nature to feel fulfilled. There's always more, something better. I'm sorry if that offends. It's my belief. It's my belief that we're building a society that makes laws and rules based on feelings. A fleeting, flighty, and filthy emotion. Emotions and feelings drive the behavior of weak people. Modern culture says men are weak when they don't expose their emotions. The truth is men are weak when they don't control and tame their emotions. So are societies. Human beings are capable of feeling a lot of things. Biological boys feel like girls. Biological girls feel like boys. I have sympathy for every human who suffers identity confusion. But we can't make laws focused on satisfying the feelings of confused people. Where does it stop? There are human beings who feel like dogs and cats. I'm not being Philippi. I do not doubt that Bruce Jenner felt like a woman trapped in a man's body. I don't doubt it for one second. But we can't make laws based on people's feelings. Feelings change. A fair society presents challenges for all of us. Should airlines be four stakes changed the size of their seats because I feel uncomfortable in a standard coat seat? There are consequences for untamed feelings and desires. I feel like Edie McDonald's five times a day. There's a price for that. There's a price America's going to pay for its emasculation of men. China's taking steps to collect that debt. Little Nas X is just another maxed out credit card in the mold world. You like that, Joe? I kind of heard what you did there in the mold. That's M-O-L-D. I checked you out. I like that. That's my fire for today. Delano's got some more gas to throw on this fire with his column. But I think we're losing a major war, cultural war, to China. I'm not saying China's going about it the right way with their government banning effeminate men off TV basically. But I get what they're doing. They're trying to make their society more masculine and they're trying and succeeding in making our society more feminine. There's a price we're going to pay for that. Delano, welcome to the show. Do you think I've made a decent point here in terms of China's leaning into its masculinity and we're leaning into our femininity and there's going to be a price to pay for the directions we're leaning? So if I could add to your point, Jason, I would say this. In our country, it's not just that we're leaning into our femininity. I think we should put a finer point on it. The culture wants to convince men to lean into their femininity while they encourage women to be more and more masculine. I touched on that in my piece and I know we'll get to that later. But feminism, I'd say probably at least since the late 60s and early 70s, has told women that the best way to be a woman is to be more like a man. So reject everything about yourself that makes you uniquely feminine, which is why abortion is right up there at the top of the list in terms of feminist priorities. We want you to have the sexual appetites and proclivities and orientation in terms of no strings attacks, consequence-free sex the same way men do. We want you to strike your power poles and to be aggressive the same way that men are. Because at the end of the day, our cultural elites say that they care for women and they care for children, but they really don't. They hate both because they take, as I said, the things that make women most unique and they tell them to throw that to the side because the best way to be a good woman is to act just like a man. And China's going in the exact opposite direction. They're cutting with the grain of nature and we're cutting against the grain of nature. And I think to your point, we're going to see the long-term effects of that in the decades to come. You know what Delano yesterday, I think it was Jimmy, you made a heck of a point. I thought it was yesterday or the day before. No, I think it was on Wednesday about Steve Harvey's book that they turned into a movie. And I actually shocked how much I enjoyed the movie, but now I understand it on a different level. Things like a man act like a woman. Act like a man, think like a woman. No, it was think like a man act like a woman. That was the name of the book. Am I right, Delano? Yeah, I think it was him and that. I think it was think like a man. I think it was think like a man. Yeah. Things like a man act like a woman. And that had much, much more consequence and meaning behind it than I interpreted at the time. It because we were laughing at it. It was a good, I got it. It was laughing. So do the fact that it was, we laughed at it. It was acceptable. Now that it doesn't happen, we're like, whoa. Yeah. Yeah. And because that is think like a man. And you know what? He, the first half of it was right. The real point of the movie was probably think like a man and act like a man. Because once you start thinking like a man, how are you going to act like a woman? Right. Exactly. Exactly. And go ahead, Dee. I was just going to say, I mean, going back to your point in terms of, you know, Lil Nas X, right? At least, you know, we, all three of us could say, you know, we watched the Steve Harvey movie, think like a man, we got some good laughs out of it. We didn't really take it seriously. It served its purpose at the time. But what the media is doing with Lil Nas X, right? In the music industry, in Hollywood, in corporate media, introducing him to young children early through Old Town Road. And he even said, hey, if you listen to that song, I was telling you guys who I was back then. You just weren't listening. Right. Because a part, a big part of this is the American public, which has gotten so used to doing that we don't think anymore. And we're willing to hand our children over to anybody, as long as the beat sounds good, or the colors are flashy, or everybody else thinks that it's cool. But what we're doing, right, on one hand, it is telling, you know, women to think like a man. But as I said, it's also telling boys to think more like girls, because we're at the point now, it's not just that Lil Nas X, you know, has a photo shoot where he, you know, shows himself as pregnant, right? And of course, he's trolling. And he knows that people are going to react to it. And in a certain, in a certain, you know, extent, we don't want to play too much into it. But it's the reaction from the cultural overlords. And they're the ones that are encouraging it. And I've said this before, as a parent, I know the things that I encourage, I'm going to get more of, and the things that I correct, generally speaking, I'm going to get less of. And we're, our culture is at a point now, we're at a cultural reflection where the people who criticize Lil Nas X are the ones that get corrected. And the ones that praise him are the ones that get rewarded. And part of the issue, and this is the sort of the natural evolution of feminism, right? It's counterintuitive. The feminists went from, I am woman here, hear me roar to, this is a man's world. And they are about to erase women in the name of diversity inclusion. And there are a lot of women who are starting to wake up to that. They see it in terms of athletics. You know, they're starting to push back, file lawsuits, make a ruckus, make a noise. But there are a lot of other women who will say, no, this is, this is good. This is, this is great. This is the next frontier. And part of that, and, and Jason, I know, I know you would agree with this, part of that is because the LGBT movement has cloaked itself in the language of blackness and racial justice. So there are a lot of black women who are on board and will defend Lil Nas X to the death. But eventually what's going to happen is this, they're going to start to see that the people like Lil Nas X, the people who say, you know, I was assigned male at birth, but I really identified as a woman, when, when those color scholarships, when those employment set aside, when those government contracts start going to people who identify as women, because if all, all it takes to be a woman is just to say, I'm a woman, then what would stop guys who can't compete on an even playing field from just saying it? And once they get pushed out of the market and they're left on the sidelines, and now America has a new class of women that it prefers, then they'll realize the folly of their ways. I want to tell you what's interesting is, Lil Nas X, this whole week has been basically trolling Drake. Drake has an album that I think came out today or yesterday, CLB, Certified Lover Boy, and here's Drake pretending to be on the other side of like he wants beef with Drake and Drake's audience. And I think it's, it's all a choreographed game and that the dichotomy between Lil Nas X being gay and Drake casting himself as the ultimate player, playboy, whatever, Certified Lover Boy, I think they're actually both on the same team. And in terms of Drake is an icon for promiscuous sex, guiltless free sex, and so is Lil Nas X, but it's just different packaging or a different way to have sex. It's just, you just a few inches away and you in a different literally zone. Yes. And so it's front door, back door. That's where you want to put the money, shall you? Literally. And so I see all of this as, it's choreographed that they're working in tandem. The music industry are pulling both of their puppet strings and we have this, Drake is the sexually promiscuous swipe right, swipe left on Tinder guy and Lil Nas X is on the other side for the gay movement, swipe right, swipe left. It's all the same thing and it's all a gimmick and a stick and I think Lil Nas X is intentionally being allowed to use Drake to elevate himself. I think a lot of people are predicting that on the 17th Lil Nas X's album is going to disappoint. I don't. I think it's going to be very popular. I think Lil Nas X is the most influential rapper going right now. He's figured out the art of trolling and keeping his name in the spotlight the way that Kanye West used to be able to do. Again, I'm willing to be wrong on this. Disagree if you like Jimmy or Lil Nas X. I think Lil Nas X right now is the most important artist in rap. Just if I could say something that you just said that I'm going to agree with you all. Hey man, you'll be surprised to how many these brothers out here really be feeling Drake. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? You know what I mean? You got a lot of brothers out here. Oh yeah, I rock with Drake and they might as well be rocking with Lil Nas X but you ain't you ain't man enough to come out like Nas X. Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Lil Nas. Yeah, I tend to think there was a time in my life where I would see incidents like this and I would just think that they were disconnected, happenstance, coincidence. But now I'm starting to feel like most of this stuff is being coordinated. I don't know about whom but it just it all fits way too nicely. And the backdrop, right? Think of culturally this week we had the state of Texas pass a law that says that would prohibit doctors from performing an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. And in the same week we have our cultural overlords pushing Lil Nas X as a pregnant man. Now I guarantee you they wouldn't want to hear anybody say that he should have bought his baby. If you understand what I'm saying, right? Because when it comes to black men they want to encourage us to get pregnant, get pregnant and encourage black women to kill their offspring. So I'm starting to see this as and to be quite clear and as you know we've talked about this on the show, I'm equally disgusted with the type of culture that Lil Nas X is pushing and what commercial hip hop has been pushing for the better part of 30 years. I think all of it should go in the trash can and we should start new. If we want to talk about defunding dismantling tearing down something, I would much rather tear down that stuff than our current whatever system that people want to talk about capitalism or education, whatever it is. I'd much rather tear down the type of culture that we have come into our house collectively as as an American people and specifically in the black community. I'd much rather tear that down and start with something else because ultimately as a Christian I'm thinking how do the things that are being pushed in culture? Whether by again the media or by the government, how are those things squaring with what I know to be true about human nature, about God as a creator and about the nature of his creative beings? And these things this is a clash of worldviews and the question is is Caesar God or is God God and ultimately the American public is going to have to answer that question because right now we're being pushed in a direction where the culture, people and CNN and social media and our institutions and our professional leagues, the NFL came out of the closet a couple weeks ago. All of the institutions of the culture are using their power, their might to tenderize our children right, to soak them in the marinade, to loosen those fibers, the things that parents try to put into them, they're trying to break all that down, to get kids to accept things that they would have never accepted 50 years ago. And then on top of that, the institutions of government through our laws and our policies want to pulverize any parents that push back, call them bigots, docs them, try to get them called racists and lose their jobs and it's up to us as parents, as other concerned allies to pressurize both parties because if not, we're going to lose a generation of our kids. That's a perfect segue and I don't even know if calling it a segue is, you kind of preview your column but I kind of want you to expand and explain your column today about the real American Taliban waging a war against our children. I excellent column, I suggest everyone go read it at theblaze.com, but expound on your point even more about the column you wrote today, Delano. Sure. So, I mean, this column came together from a couple of different incidents. One, we talked about earlier this week with the teacher and the teacher's union president in Los Angeles who said, you know what, it's not a big deal that the kids didn't learn multiplication this year because they know the words riot and insurrection, they know the difference between a coup and a protest. And to me, that was just so indicative of the direction in which our education system is going in this country, right? They're all about partisan activism and indoctrination, not the shaping of minds and morals. And that's why I mentioned in the piece, a generation ago, kids took Latin high school and now they need remedial English and college. I just goes to show you how far we've slid in terms of being able to educate our children. So, that was one piece of it and I started with that mind. But after seeing the reaction to the Texas law and seeing the type of weeping and gnashing of teeth, if you were an alien that came to this country and you saw the way that people were protesting and the people on CNN and MSNBC, the male feminists and their allies in all the different protest movements, you would have thought that Texas passed the bill to kill children once they're born. The bill will literally save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children from now on millions of children if you want to extend it out over the decades if it stands. And the people who claim to care about women, claim to care about children, the marginalized, the oppressed and particularly black folk were the ones pushing back and saying this is an injustice. The Texas legislature is infringing on the rights of women and even the president himself said that this law is going to disproportionately impact low-income women and communities of color. And I just, the part of my reaction is this, I wish they had the courage of their convictions to come out and say we want a world with fewer poor and black people in it. At least then I could respect them as men because they would be open about their intentions. But they hide behind euphemisms and weasel words. They use words like reproductive justice and health care. They talk about people who may become pregnant. And this is why I linked it, the term American Taliban was trending and the people who were making a trend were trying to say that the Texas legislature was acting as a theocratic body. But to me I see it a little bit different because the United States government funded gender programs in Afghanistan in the tune of about $787, I think it was million dollars. And I saw one video, I started a column with it where a British instructor was trying to explain French impressionist art to a room of Afghan women and she showed a picture of a urinal and she told them that this was really high art in the early 20th century. And you can see one of the women just shake her head and say what is this? And that to me represents the failure of western style cultural imperialism. And you saw part of that failure play out over the course of a couple of weeks with the Afghan government which received millions of, if not billions of dollars from America over 20 years talked and ran because even though they said this is our country we want to lead it, they didn't have the courage of their convictions. And when met with an opposing force that actually believed in something, right, they ran out of there. And I think that should be a lesson for American parents today. You know that your child is your son is not a girl just because he likes to wear pink shirts. So don't let anybody tell you that he is and tell you that they're caring for him by calling him Janet when he's at school and then Jimmy when you come to pick him up. And that's really what I wanted to talk about the fact that the left promotes a deaf culture and I said it and I meant it. They hate our children. That's why they want to kill them in the womb. Once they get here they want to confuse them and indoctrinate them in schools. Once they, before they hit puberty they want to get them hooked on hormones and puberty blocking drugs. Once they pass puberty they encourage them to cut off healthy breast tissue in their genitals, right. Even while America condemns genital mutilation in other countries we subsidize it here in the name of you know gender affirming care. They want kids to come up and they want to dismantle the nuclear family even though they know that the nuclear family provides the best life experiences and environment for children. They want to dismantle that. They promote sex work and prostitution, pornography on only fans. They promote drag queen story at publicly funded libraries and even drag kids on TV. Jason and I actually cut that part out of the article. There's a young kid named Desmond is amazing. Anybody wants to look it up? Google Desmond is amazing and Good Morning America. They had him on GMA three years ago and they introduced him as a trailblazer who was inspiring and you know who the person that did the leading Michael Strahan. The 200 and some are pound Hall of Fame defense event who that day was playing the role of cultural gilding because if he still had his parts he would have said there's no way I'm bringing out an 11 year old and trying to promote him to our youth and and and not ask his parents why it's okay for him to perform in gay clubs in front of grown men who toss ones and fives at his feet. That's that's the left agenda. So to me you know I'm willing to go on this cultural kamikaze mission with you because if we're doing it for the culture the culture that we have right now is worth taking down. That's a fire Jim. Wait a minute. We don't say nothing about the Wayne Waze, can you? Jim I don't you almost get it this off court. I can't go there right now. That's too much to unpack. That's too much to unpack. He does unload it on Strahan and and I we'll get to it. Not today but we'll get to it. I want to one thing your writing has helped me understand Delano because you've brought up abortion several times and coming on the show and and I've I respect I have you've helped me clarify my position on abortion and and I was all you know I was already there but now it's like I'm crystal clear on it and I understand the support of of abortion rights. I understand it on a much deeper level and just listening to you talk today here was the thought that that ran across my mind is that really what abortion is a giant symbol to me that has been imposed and instilled within American culture is that kids really are not that important and and one of my firm beliefs ever for a long 40 years even when I was a kid I came up with the philosophy and the belief that like God's going to judge us on how we handle and develop what we create. There's no more important assignment than that God gives us than the raising and the development of our kids and I look at over the last 60 years all the messaging and the biggest one is abortion is that kids aren't really that important I mean they stand in the way of your career. We got that second car don't have a kid you want to have that second home and take that vacation don't have a kid sacrifices that people used to make for their kids or you know what I'm gonna stick in this really hard marriage I don't think there's anything in the Bible or anybody's ever said you know what marriage is easy no one's ever given you that false advertisement anybody I know that's been married any ministers I've heard talking about it's hard but it's rewarding and the greatest reward from a marriage generally speaking is the development of great young people who will turn around in your old age parents and will will basically be your parents and I say this in all respect to my mother and my father before he passed me and my brother became their parents and took great pride and take great pride in taking care of them that's the cycle that God intends I believe and we've sold like kids just think that important and we're looking at a generation of kids who have no respect for elderly people and the generations before them because we've been derelict all of our messaging everything that we believe we built a culture that has said they're not that important they really just stand in the way of your hedonistic pleasure of the moment and so cut corners do whatever you have to do to disconnect from your responsibility of development of these young people and if that means sticking a plunger up a woman's vagina to end that thing as quick as possible that's exactly what we'll do and if that means you know work that second job so you can get them that designer purse or that sports car that you want and ignore your kids just give them give me Xbox or a PlayStation sit them in front of that that'll take care of it that's I just abortion and abortion rights are just a big giant sign that says well I don't really care about no kids that's exactly take away from your writing exactly and and again I try to I try to come at it from a from a biblical perspective because in that sense again I'm I'm trying to bring in everyone right abortion is not just a black issue even though it disproportionately you know impacts the black community part of it to me just it goes back to the fact that you know I believe that God created man male and female in his own image and every life has inherent dignity and worth I don't think kids are are less worthy of living because they are you know born to to low-income parents I don't think they're less worthy of living because they have a disability right or congenital you know disease or defect but sometimes what you'll hear on the left they'll start to inch in that direction but as I said these are people who gain who get their strength from the fact that all the people with the right views quote unquote agree with them they don't have the courage to say yes I think more poor black women should abort their children because those kids could have difficult lives and for me in my mind I always ask myself well how many black folk would be in America if the only people if the only black people who could who could have children were middle income at the time you know and you can actually see over the course of decades the black percentage of the American population in 1970 was about 11 percent and right now it's probably a little under 13 percent so in 50 plus years it really hasn't moved at all and part of that is because since Roe v. Wade approximately 20 million black children have been aborted and as I mentioned in the article and people noticed they you know I've been on the show they've heard me talk I focus a lot on New York where I'm from in DC you know where I live and in New York City the home of Planned Parenthood where Margaret Sanger started her first birth control clinic about half of all black children are killed in the womb before they can draw their first breath and New York City is the city with the largest black population in the country and about half of black babies are aborted so I'm and and let me be clear I'm not saying the only solution to this is government because this actually comes back to to one of my central positions and we talk about it all the time if America had the as low and out of wedlock birth rate as Korea you'd have way fewer abortions but our cultural norm has changed to the point where we've completely unhitched marriage and child rearing right there was a time where like a buffet when you pay one price you get everything but now it's all a cart well you know we don't really we're not really in a relationship but we just want to have kids or and and that's become the norm and in particular in our community and especially in low-income black communities it's probably closer to nine out of ten kids who are born to parents who aren't married so I don't care what policy positions who you elect school choice any of that stuff if black forget reparations there's in my mind there is no way forward in terms of progress in the black community if we don't rebuild the the black family and while our cultural elites our intellectuals quote unquote our town to 10th is busy talking about destroying white supremacy they don't say a word about rebuilding the black family and that's that's really what I'm after and that's why when they say do it for the culture this is not a culture we're doing anything for except chopping it down and putting in the wood shipper and then we can see you know once we spread it's you know the the the I don't know what you get out of a wood shipper but the remains on the ground we can see what what we can fertilize and what the mulch thank you uncle jimmy um we can see what what we what we can fertilize and what we can grow because right now Jason as you said our priorities and this is as America our priorities are in the wrong place and that's why our kids are doped up on drugs more anxious and more depressed than ever many of them lack purpose in direction and that's why they do everything they can on social media to get likes and attention from people who they don't know and that's how some of these young girls get drawn into only fans right they say well my body who cares I don't have any dignity why won't I show myself off to to old perverts you know who are willing to pay a couple bucks a month who cares and to me that's something that we we need to reverse and if I could I found a quote and this may not seem like uh uh it would go in this conversation but I think it hits it perfectly it's from Samuel Adams and it's a quote he gave at a height of the Revolutionary War right and because as I said I think we're in a war right now for our children and this is what he said he said if you love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom go home from us in peace we ask not your counsels or arms crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains set lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen and that's my that's my message to anybody that thinks a few extra bucks is worth trading in your children we're gonna end on that note Delano that was awesome that was excellent that's why we call him

Chicago and check in with uncle jimmy's a leds favorite sports columnist of all time i think great couch be your favorite sports columnist you've been reading my columns for 30 years exactly and and and and you know what and and on and our honesty your columns were the greatest columns that i had read probably for the first six months that i had started reading you you know and i just like the fact that Greg is coming in bringing some new blood into the industry and i just appreciate it he's just a breath of fresh air um the man what he's been around longer than i have okay and he's aging the hell of a lot better than you Jason come on man all right well let's let's bring in Greg he wrote something today about uh Corey's Indianapolis Colts uh although Corey claims to be a Bears fan uh the Indianapolis Colts got a little COVID controversy uh Carson wince their quarterback hasn't taken the vaccine uh i guess they got the lowest vaccination rate allegedly in the national football league and and they're the quarterback of their defense Darius Leonard the linebacker he hasn't taken the vaccine and i guess he talked about it Greg found all this very interesting as did i but i'll let Greg explain uh what are you griping about or what are you writing about today Greg I just thought it was interesting that i think that the the mob rule here has created a new form of a minority unvaxed Americans okay Carson Wentz is saying that you know he hasn't gotten the vaccine he said that he stays up all night thinking about it and because he knows that he's hurting the team by not getting it and at the same time he's not comfortable getting it and the media come back and the one i mentioned specifically in this column was Greg Doyle of the Indianapolis Star and he comes in and says well this is how selfish Wentz is he's not paying attention to help his team and if the Colts want to cut him right now i'll be glad to help him pack and drive him to the airport to get him out of here i mean they're not even listening to what Wentz is saying i mean he's not saying that he's not into worrying about his team he's saying that he stays up at night thinking about it so yeah i think Darius Leonard stepped in the stud on the defense and stood up for Wentz just by saying you know here's what i think here's why i'm struggling with having a getting the vaccine or not and i think that's what we need more of you know the media are supposed to be here to stand up for the voiceless and you know that's what you asked me once a while ago what did i do as a writer in Chicago that meant the most to me and i said it was about standing up for the little guy the Cubs used to have a ticket scalping operation that was basically illegal and they were running against Cubs fans and i was finding taxi cab drivers and showing how they were you know affected by it and i realized Carson Wentz isn't exactly a taxi cab driver trying to make a living but i mean the lesser players and and then even some of the star players like Wentz who are unvaxed are being treated like a minority with no voice and so i like it that Leonard stood up and said something and i wish the media would ask the questions and we'd be able to get more answers from the star players like that the thing i read the piece and i had previously read or heard about i saw something Greg Doyle put out you know basically attacking Carson Wentz you know he had some little quip about buying him a ticket out of town if he wanted to i i think Greg just mentioned and i got to be i it irritates and pisses me off because uh Carson Wentz is being mistreated and i know he's worth a lot of money he's made a lot of money in the NFL but this bullying of unvaxed players is bogus and BS to me and it's not what the media is designed to do and and they are be it's like the unvax unvaxed is the new black is that that should be the tv show that they come out with instead of what are they oiling just the new black unvaxed is the new black and and i like it and so i'm just Greg i'm gonna be honest with i i've had i've got a history with Greg Doyle it's not personal on my end but the guy used to troll me and hit the other iteration of himself since he left you know he was with cbs sports and he was this troll columnist for cbs sports and and he's kind of remade himself over at the Indianapolis star but he's still a troll because he's trolling Carson Wentz there's no proof no one has argued that Carson Wentz was selfish in Philadelphia they said he didn't connect personally with the wide receivers and they said he couldn't stay healthy on the field but now we got this little personal attack on Carson Wentz and and and he's allegedly selfish how can somebody be selfish about their own personal health you're supposed to be selfish about your own personal health right or wrong Greg of course i mean it's a personal issue and i don't expect Doyle to be standing up for anti-vaxxers if that's what he doesn't believe in but he needs to at least hear what the guy has to say i mean just listen and don't just like you said don't just troll or take a cheap shot that's what everyone's doing they're just barking at the moon here you've got the anti-vaxxers barking at the anti-vax moon and the vaxxers barking at the vaxx moon no one's listening no one's paying attention that's really why i liked what Leonard did darius Leonard i just thought i thought he really maybe opened a conversation that could be useful and and maybe can turn things around a little bit especially in the NFL well i what i like about what Leonard did is you know and look he's not a professional broadcast he's just a pro athlete he's not some writer but but there is a side to the unvaxx story and we're acting like there is no side like they don't have a right i get by by injecting the term selfish into this if there's one area where every human being has the right to be selfish it's their personal health we can't we your personal health isn't a group thing and i understand that we can all get covid and that perhaps there's an argument that Jimmy's vaccination status could impact course perhaps but there's all kinds of information flowing both directions everybody's acting like they're an expert on this and what darius Leonard said is like hey man i'm trying to figure this out i'm reading both sides of the arguments i'm taking that all into account but i don't need to be rushed into this decision i think that's a perfectly legitimate stance and this whole notion that oh if guys would just think about their football teams and take and take this experimental vaccine well hold on man these same football players are playing through injuries and taking toward it all they're doing all kinds of unselfish things and this should just be one more thing it shouldn't even be that much totally disagree with that gel i'm actually being a little bit no i can't tell what you've been the fact is we asked you to take all these other drugs now all of a sudden you don't want to take this little shot many many shots as we give y'all before the game now you don't want to take this little one well i'll say this and Greg feel free to jump back in here but i'll say this with tauterdoll or whatever else they're taking steroids whatever it is there've been major studies done over the course of those drugs that tell you the exact side effects we don't know about the side effects of these vaccines there haven't been major studies done so if a guy wants to do the calculation and say you know what i know what could happen to me if i take these steroids or if i take this quarter zone shot or whatever i've talked to doctors i know all the side effects i'm willing to take that risk i think it's perfectly logical for them to say i don't know the side effects of these vaccines i'm not willing to take that risk yet i mean i can say something before Greg before Greg because i want to ask Greg this question it goes to what you're saying Greg all these athletes say that you know anytime they fail a drug test all these athletes say it's our duty to make sure that we know what's going on inside our bodies can these athletes or it's our duty to know what we're putting inside our bodies can these athletes truthfully say that they know what's going inside their bodies with these vaccines i mean i don't think we're at that point yet but the FDA has approved it i mean at some point you're going to have to trust somebody that that this thing is safe i mean i don't know how long it's going to be experimental to you but i just wanted to say and i'd like to hear your answer to that but i just want to say too that i think some there's an issue here where football teams are wondering whether the players bodies are belong to the players i mean the football teams have been given these drugs to these players since you know god knows when remember north Dallas 40 the movie from like 1971 or something like that where they're just injecting things all over maybe the teams are just so used to the players taking whatever the teams want them to take that that think this should just happen come without any argument let me say i think that's a good point that they are of that mentality hey we're paying you all this money we'll tell you what to take you do it and look the movie north Dallas 40 was basically an objection to that culture and we have been objecting to that culture and supporting people and try do it allegedly taking all kinds of steps to make the game safer uh but in terms of the FDA approval can i yeah i did that uh i don't want to show that but so what and in terms of two people from the FDA high ranking people resign over the way this covid vaccine deal is being handled that you don't have unanimity and of agreement within the FDA i'm just two days ago i think high ranking executives within the FDA like hey they don't like the way this is being handled the way the the booster shots are being handled all kinds of protocols are being broken operation warp speed all the protocols have been broken to rush this experimental vaccine and it sounds like i'm hyper anti-vaccine i'm not i think there's a group of people that definitely should take it they're mostly over 40 years old they're mostly overweight and have other medical issues i'm a prime candidate to take the vaccine what's right for me isn't right for Carson wince or Darius Leonard and for Greg Doyle or any other idiot that needs some clicks and some traction to try to paint Carson wince as a bad guy or any of these un-facts people as bad people over some personal decision that they're making it's not Greg Doyle's body it's Carson wince's he and his wife get to make that decision not Greg Doyle and the Indianapolis Colts or football i i was offended i and i really i'm offended by what what Doyle is doing and he's he's just a symptom of a bigger issue that's going on with the rest of the media and i'm gonna write about this next there's this god complex going on where everybody thinks elects themselves god and they know what's best for Greg couch for Jimmy Dodds for Corey Smith for Jason Whitlock and and and you know what i'm going to impose my point of view on you it's a god complex that that i just completely reject and and you know you mentioned about the media being a voice for the voices we've totally abandoned that we're a voice for the establishment and the establishment the NFL says everybody gets a vax and everybody jumps on board like sheep and start bullying people like Carson wince and shame in people like Darius Leonard it's all they're a bunch of cowards that you know Greg Doyle loves to run around play the tough guy this is cowardly behavior i guess i'd just ask one thing though i mean when when will you feel confident that it's not an experimental drug anymore i mean the people who are saying that it's not experimental are the FDA the government the media i mean all these institutions are no longer respected i mean i i'm not saying that you're being unfair but i would just like you to ask yourself when what has to happen before you'd say okay this is a legit safe drug to take Greg i and i don't i don't want to give in you do i think it's Pfizer you know Pfizer doesn't have to turn into results of their testing until 2025 i didn't i need something before 2025 they can't be held liable the pharmaceutical companies can't be held liable if this thing skids off the road that was built into the deal they're not responsible and so great uh there's a lot of drugs that i've taken believe addville spanish fly there's a lot that i would prefer not to take and i don't trust and so it's never going to happen in turn me trusting in me drug is never going to have will i take some because i think it's in my best interest or because i haven't done the proper things so that the system that god created within me could handle some of these issues yeah yes so there are drugs and at at some point you may you know any drug but i don't take the flu vaccine i there's a lot of things and it has to do i there's no drug there's no man-made thing that i fully trust that will never happen i'm a skeptic and acidic about everything man-made because man is flawed and man will do anything and woman will do anything in pursuit of power and and in pursuit of money we've seen that i you know i talk about this all the time i don't know if you're uh again i've made this reference before i don't know greg if you've seen the tv show game of thrones or if your kids watch game of thrones but the entire purpose of game of thrones and it was a great show for a while but the entire purpose was to try to show you that men and women in pursuit of power money and fame there are no rules they will kill steel and do anything and i've said it before you haven't seen the show but but i'm to you should watch it and get past all the sorcery and the fantasy stuff and just look at what they're trying to tell you when i'm telling when the guy stannis baratheon burned his like 12-year-old daughter at the state i was like that's humanity and that's what again if you don't submit to a higher power if you don't uh humble yourself before a guy there's nothing you won't do and so i've looked at this covid thing be completely politicized it's all political now if you if someone says they they don't want to take the facts oh they're a trump supporter and they're an idiot and they don't we just had discussion who would die on lemon yesterday talking about uh you know go to the emergency room yeah don't go to the emergency room if you haven't been vaccinated great you do understand that the whole covid thing just like everything else has been poisoned by politics of course i mean yeah i mean everyone takes sides on everything but i mean the vaccines have been out there for close to a year now or three quarters of a year and i think i would like to think there's enough data to show that there's not a lot of people who are dying from the vaccine and i realize what you're saying about people aren't dying necessarily at a fast rate for young people athletes you know but you know when i was a little kid i was running across a busy street in chicago and my mom you know let me know about it later that i wasn't supposed to be doing that and i could have said hey well i didn't die when i was doing it i mean yeah but i could have i mean the there's a greater chance that i wouldn't be in trouble if i if i had just done the right thing so i mean i don't know i just think people look at the numbers in a skewed way but to your point they're looking at him in a political way too so i guess you just have to go with your gut on this which is sort of the point about the whole karsen wince thing he want he's got a gut he's got an interest in it and someone needs to be able to hear what he has to say about it almost all human behavior all human activity there's a calculated risk to it i can sit in this chair for the rest of the day or i can take the risk of standing up and possibly walking to my office and tripping on the way and dying it happens there cars crash all the time there are more people dying in car crashes than from covid we don't we're not outlawing cars and anybody that drives is being selfish you know i mean people die in car crashes you should walk you should walk instead walking is much safer we should walk everywhere and people used to walk across continents and so let's do that again instead of drive because there's some risk to driving there's risk in everything because of politics we've pretended like this virus is something the world has never ever seen before and we must eliminate all risk of it even though less than one percent of the people are dying from it that's how it's going you make the argument that no one's dying from the vaccine ain't nobody died we're gonna come from the virus not many fat people are you should be worried about me greg don't worry about cars and wince don't worry about dairies Leonard that's my point to the nfl and everybody is worried about me make sure i've been vaccinated triple vaccinated but these young people that are in great shape lead them the hell along i'm gonna be honest with you if i get you in y'all for sleep again i'm a jab yay street nanny first chance i get i got a violin i right there mauve let me get you sleep sorry great go ahead i just want to say you know there's that's no reason why not to try to mitigate the risk i mean we still have speed limits on the road so people fewer people will die or in the cars you're supposed to wear seat belts so people fewer people will die i can't remember which one it was but there was a player in the cults in the summer who said that he had gotten the vax just because he lives with his grandparents or he sees him a lot and he doesn't want to make them sick in case he he gets the virus he wasn't even really worried about whether he was going to actually be physically sick he didn't want to make other people sick so i i think there are other things the fact or yeah there's a risk for everything so let me just say this i have a mother she'll be 82 in december and i go around her and around other members of my family and i have whether whether i'm vaccinated or not i have the same opportunity to pass my mother the covid or yeah covid the virus as anybody else my mother's double and triple vaccinated you know how i take care of my mother i put her in a nice house in a gated community uh car furniture allowance i was gonna say i do all kinds of things to make sure my mother's good and other people in my family are good uh you're not going to convince me that this vaccine is some debt that i owe my 82 year old mother um i just i just i'm just not going there there's risk to life the damn car i got her she can't see at night she could she die in a car wreck because i got her a car you know there's risk to anything you do i get resplending money she loves to go gamble she can get robbed out gambling somewhere uh all right buyers from chicken she can choke on the chicken bone there you go so all right i gotta go i gotta keep moving i'll call jimmy's got we gotta do a parody song i little something for you you
