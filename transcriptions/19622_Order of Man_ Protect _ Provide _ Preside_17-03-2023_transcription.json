    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler. I'm the host and the founder of the Order Man podcast and movement. Welcome here today and welcome back. If you've been with us for any amount of time, you know this is a podcast and a movement dedicated to helping all of us, myself included, become the man that we have a desire to be. Men for ourselves, men for our family members, for our communities, and every other facet of life. So today we're going to talk about what is a real man. Now obviously as I share this, this is coming from me. I know the difference between fact and opinion. I know the difference between my perception of situations and my truth, if you will, which is a term I don't like and absolute truth with a capital T. And what I'm sharing with you today is my perception, my opinion of it. It's not just my opinion of it. It's also the opinion of millions and millions of human beings who have come and gone before us with regards to what does it mean to be a man because every once in a while, you'll hear things like a real man is or a real man does. And every time you hear, see that? There's going to be people who say that I'm wrong or their definition of what a real man is different. So I thought we'd all get on the same page. And then if you are, of course, on the same page, we can talk about what that looks like and how we can develop more of this in our own lives. Before I get into the meat of the discussion, I do want to let you know that we have the Iron Council, which is our exclusive brotherhood is now open for enrollment for a very short window, a very brief moment in time. So if you're interested in banding with us and connecting with other like-minded men and walking through life shoulder to shoulder with other men who are in your corner, who have your back, who want to support you, who want to give you feedback and accountability and the tools that you need and are required to win and to thrive and to be the best that you can be as a man, then check out the Iron Council. You can do that at orderman.com slash Iron Council. All right, guys, let's talk about what a real man is. Whenever I have this discussion, there's always a debate about what it means to be a man. So I thought we'd start there and I want to be precise with my language because if we look at the definition of a man, up until, I guess, relatively recently where people are trying to change the definition of man and man and woman, male and female, let me just tell you what the definition would be traditionally. That a man is an adult male, an adult human male. That's what that's the definition. That's what a man would be. I'm going to take it a step further. And the reason I'm going to take a step further is because I know many adult human males who are not acting manly. Now they may be men according to that definition, but they're not acting like men. So what I'm going to say is that it goes above and beyond your anatomy and your age, obviously anatomy, because we have young boys. I have three boys and I have a little daughter as well, but I, but I do have three boys and they're not men. We don't expect them to be men. They have the anatomy. They have the biological makeup, but they're not men. They're boys. They might be young men. My oldest is a young man. But they're not men. They're boys. They might be young men. My oldest is a young man, but they're still boys. Okay. It's not just the anatomy and it's not just the age. As I stated earlier, I know of plenty of adult aged males who I would not consider men. It goes deeper than that. It's how we show up. It's how we perform. It's what we do. It's how we engage with experiences around us. It's how we lead others. And so what I would suggest to you is that a man is not only an adult biological male, human male, but a real man is somebody who is on the path of making himself a protector, a provider, and a presider preside synonymous with leadership. That's what it's been throughout thousands and thousands of years of human history. And that's what it is today. And it isn't until the relative ease of modernity that we've even been able to call into question. What is a man? What is a woman? Because every other culture before this knows exactly what it is and knows the roles and knows what men excel at generally and what women excel at generally and have not had to call that into question because we needed to step into these roles respectively in order to secure the human race. In order to procreate in order to keep ourselves safe from dinosaurs and saber to tigers in order to hunt and provide for the family in order to ward off predators and warring tribes and neighbors in order for women to bond collectively together to be able to turn houses into homes and make the community and environment that is nurturing and supportive. Everybody throughout all of history is known this. And now because we have it so easy and we do. That's not to discount challenging times that people are going through, but the challenges that we struggle with are significantly less than the challenges our ancestors did. The odds of you having to ward off a dangerous predator to stay alive or significantly lower than they were 1000 years ago. So that's why we're calling it into question now. But here's what I've found. Is that in moments and times of challenge and strife and turmoil and danger men and women naturally and inevitably will fall back into their default roles and responsibilities based on not some societal construct, but a biological construct that is supported society. When there's wars to be fought men go fight those wars. When there's danger or an emergency, it's men who go into that calling into that battle. That's what the men do. Now, are there women who do that? Sure. Absolutely. So it's not exclusively true, but generally those are the roles and responsibilities. So a man, according to me, and again, I want to be precise with my language is an adult human male, but above and beyond that, somebody who's learning to and on the path to become a protector, a provider and a presider and not just for himself, by the way, a man is a man when he learns to be able to take care of himself, but also in such a great capacity that now he can use his, his excess, his resources to turn around and provide for his wife and his children and his neighbors and his community members and the people that he loves and cares about. And even people who can't do it for themselves. So I would suggest that if you can take care of yourself and provide your own path, but you're not doing it for people around you, that's not what I would consider manly behavior. I mean, great that you're taking care of yourself and you're a self sustaining member of society, but unless you're learning to turn that outwards and serve others, I don't think you're acting the way that men behave. So let's talk about this. We'll break it down into segments. We'll talk about protect, provide and then preside last with protect. Here's what a real man does. A real man knows that he's a protector and in order to be a protector of not only his things and his boundaries and his home and his community, but also his people, his family members, his colleagues, his coworkers, how many times have we heard of the potential mass shootings where you have two opposite ends of the extreme, a man who charges a would be murder and subdues or kills that would be murder. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, how often do we hear of adult males who run and hide and cower in the corner when confronted with danger and violence? What is the bigger man? All things equal. I would say the one who runs towards the aggressor and is the protector. We would all absolutely say that that is the bigger man. It's the one who can protect protect himself, protect his property, protect his boundaries and protect his people. How do we do this? Number one, guys, we got to get on the path to health. Why not to be as a judgmental here? And I don't know people's situations when I see them or interact with them. I see what I'm presented with, whether it's their physical appearance or a brief conversation that they decide to share or something that I see on social media. So I can't accurately judge and I don't even want to be judgmental, but I will say that unless we're working to get healthier, we're not being as manly as we could otherwise be. So a man has his health in check. He's losing weight. He's getting in shape. He's building stamina. He's building strength. He's fueling his body correctly. Why? Because if push comes to shove, I want to be the kind of guy that can handle myself in a physical confrontation. And I can protect what's mine and what deserves to be protected. What I honor and what I cherish and what I find value in. And if I'm 50, 60, 100, 150 plus pounds overweight and I can't run a mile, let alone 100 yards. And I can't fight and I can't shoot. And I'm weak and I can't fight my way out of a wet paper bag. That's no way that a man shows up. He's going to find himself wanting in that situation and he's going to put others in danger. Remember when I said that a man not only takes care of him provides for himself, but for others. That's being an asset to other people. The antithesis to that is being a liability, meaning that not only is your presence neutral, it actually is more dangerous having you around. Now, I can't tell you that I've always been the epitome of health and I'm not even right now. There's plenty of men out there who are stronger and bigger and faster and more equipped and more skilled than I am. But again, you don't have to be 100% proficient on all of these things, but you should be on the path. You should be on the path to becoming a man. Now, I'm sometimes cautious of using the word should, but in this case, if you want to be a real man, then you should be doing these things. You should be going to the gym. You should be training some form of martial arts. You should know how to use a firearm. You should be aware of your surroundings. You should have provisions in place. You should have plans should something go wrong. When's the last time you have an emergency preparedness plan? I'm actually sitting in an Airbnb right now and in every one of the rooms I see an escape plan printed up. That might be for some legal reasons, but that's a pretty good idea. So everybody knows in certain situations, whether it's an earthquake or a fire or an intruder, what you should be doing. Are you doing that? Do you know what you would do? Now, granted, as a man, we often pretend like we have it all figured out. Oh, you know, if I ever dealt with a violent encounter, this is what I would do. How do you know? How do you know? If you've never been confronted with violence or you've never been in a violent situation, even in some sort of controlled environment like training, how do you know unequivocally that that's how you would show up? We tend to think more highly of ourselves and our performance, but in the environment, we find ourselves less than worthy of being able to deal with it. So guys, what I would suggest to you is maybe get out a piece of paper, a notebook or on your phone and write this down as a checklist and under the heading protect, ask yourself what you're doing for daily training, physical training, lifting weights, running, swimming, biking, whatever your thing is. What skill sets do you have? Do you know how to fight? You know how to throw a punch? Do you know how to take a punch? Do you know how to wrestle a grapple on the ground? Do you know how to shoot? Do you have a knife? Can you use a knife? Can you defend against a knife attack? What about natural disasters? What if there's a fire in your house in the middle of the night? What does everybody do? Does everybody know? Quiz them. Ask them. If they don't know, you got to figure that out. What about an earthquake? What about an intruder? If somebody broke into your home in the middle of the night, would your kids know what to do? Would your wife know what to do? Don't assume that everybody knows and don't assume that you're going to have it figured out in that moment because I can assure you that that's a variable in the middle of the night, dark, intruder, surprised, element of surprise that you just can't handle to the degree that you can if you're more proficient thinking about it ahead of time. When you get out of the car, the parking lot of Walmart, do you look around? Are you looking for oddities? You're looking for things that are out of the ordinary? Potential danger, potential risk. Are you teaching that to your people, your coworkers? What if there's a an active shooter situation? If you're an employer and you haven't gone through an active shooting situation, shame on you. We should do better in this department. Are all of your employees medically trained? I'm not saying they have to be EMTs, but do they know basic medical life-saving skills? Do they know CPR? Is that something you could provide to them? Does that make a better environment for them and the people around them? Absolutely. And it makes you a better man. All right, let's talk about point number two, which is to provide. Provide. Now, when I say this, we all know this. You hear it all the time. Man are protectors and providers. We know this. What am I talking about here? Well, I'm not just talking about physical provision, although that is an element of it. Financial provision, home, shelter, food, the necessities on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the necessities of life. But the things that we often overlook, and I have been guilty of this probably more so than most of the men listening to this, is the emotional and mental support that our family and our friends and our community needs. And I would also add the spiritual element of it as well. Are you providing these things? Or are you incapable of dealing with them for yourself? Are you in emotional turmoil? Are you emotionally immature? Are you a ticking time bomb? When confronted with challenging and difficult situations, does your mind break? Because you've never been confronted with anything difficult and hard before. Because if you can't do it for yourself, I assure you, you're not going to be able to do it for other people. We can't. Now, we think we can. In that moment, in that moment that people need me or the situation calls for it, I will step up. No, you won't. You may have a desire in that moment to step up, but you will cower and you will break and you will not step up because you are not trained to do it. And you do not have the capacity to do it unless you're training, unless you're building out skill sets, unless you're doing difficult things, unless you're confronting your emotions. I talked about that on last week's Friday, Field Notes, I believe emotional intelligence one on one. If you're not doing these things for yourself, you're not going to be able to provide them for other people. And I want to do that. When my kids are dealing with something difficult, I want to be the rock. I want to be a beacon of stability emotionally and mentally for them. When hard things are presented, I want them to know that, hey, dad can do it. Dad does hard things. I want them to be able to turn to me and see a man who's not only doing difficult things, but confronting and facing his fear so that I can draw upon that and they can draw upon that. And they can use that as fuel to do the same thing in their own life. I want to make sure that I have food on the table. I want to make sure there's a roof over their head. I want to make sure that they have the financial means to pay for their sports programs, for example, or to go on incredible trips or to take them hunting, which I'm doing with my children this year. That's important. It also means that I'm actively and always working to develop and build out my skill sets. Now, what's the skill set? I don't know. See, there's a lot of misconception and I don't think so much anymore, but for example, that the arts aren't quote unquote, manly. So that's a painter or photographer or a musician. You might hear or think that cooking. Look, I'm not here to judge what you do to provide as long as it's more illegal and ethical. I would say good on you. It's not about what you do or how you do it. It's about the fact that you are providing by doing it. So if you're a photographer, I don't consider that less manly and you're putting food on the table. I don't consider that less manly than a guy who's putting food on the table by fighting. You're both putting food on the table. You're both using a skill set that you have to provide for yourself and the people that you love and care about. That's all that's meant. That's that's the definition of manly, not that you fight, but that you provide. So develop and build out your skill set in your chosen chosen career path. Whatever that career path is, if it's painting, if it's artistry, if it's cooking, if it's hunting, if it's fighting, if it's a mechanic, if it's podcasting, if it's sports, if it's radio, journalism. I don't know what it is, but with whatever it is, there's a skill set that you can work and develop. And what happens oftentimes is we either become complacent. Or we think we have everything figured out and there's nothing else to learn and I can assure you that there's always something to learn. I would also say this with regards to physical provision is the discipline to do what is necessary to provide for your family. I hear from a lot of guys who are like, man, I hate my job and I find no value and satisfaction in it. And while I can understand and I think we can have that discussion and we have about how to find meaning and purpose and current work and develop new work. That provides different meaning and significance in your life. What I would say is that I commend you and I honor you if you get your butt out of bed every single day and you go into a job that you hate because you care enough about your family to do it. There's ways to build out a different kind of life that will be more meaningful for you. But in the meantime, I commend you for that. I think highly of you for that. Guys, we've all done things that we don't like and can just think about that. Think about a man who just is so miserable at his current work and where he spends most of his time and yet he does it every single day, day in and day out because he wants to make sure that little Timmy can be on the football team this year and has to pay that $200 registration fee. That's manly. Now, again, we can talk about how to build out a different life and we will, but doing what is necessary is the work of men. Having emotional stability by confronting and dealing with your own emotions so you can help your people do the same is manly. Building out your own mental fortitude by doing hard and difficult things, challenging things and making yourself capable, improving yourself worthy of accomplishing your life. So you can teach your family how to do it. That's manly. The last one guys I want to talk about is preside. So this is leadership. Your job is to lead. You are called elite. You are built to lead. It's in your DNA. Now, whether you'll do it or not, that's a different story, but you are called elite. And there's soft skills and there's hard skills that you need, but at the end of the day, I would say this. Your ability to communicate effectively. Your ability to have a vision. Your ability to communicate that vision. Your ability to create a plan. Your ability to communicate that plan. Your ability to hold people accountable. Your ability to read people so that you can understand what they're experiencing or what they need from you as a leader so that you can motivate and inspire them. And also our level of integrity. Now, all of us fall out of integrity from time to time. And that happens. I'm not going to say it's okay. It's not okay for me to be out of integrity, but it would be lying if I said that I always am. But our job is to be in integrity. And what I mean by that is leading by doing what we expect our followers to do. And when we mess up, admit those faults, admit those failures. Even as a leader. Yes, believe it or not, we can admit those faults and those failures as a leader. And then realign ourselves or get back in integrity. That's how we build influence, credibility and authority. And by the way, the more you do that, the more it makes up and allows for times when you do diverge from the path and you will. Not purposefully. Not deliberately. Maybe sometimes. But it happens. Life happens. We falter. We mess up. We screw up. It's not okay, but it's to be expected. What's for scene is whether or not we'll get up and dust ourselves off, get back on the path, and get back in integrity to do the right thing. And if you can do that, you can communicate effectively with people. Then you are being a real man. Being a real man doesn't mean you don't ever falter, that you're perfect. It means that when you do, you get back on the path quickly and you adapt and you adjust and you get better and you improve. And then you help other people do the same. So contrary to popular belief and these modern times that we so often hear, there is such a thing as a real man. And I believe that it's objectively true. It's not subjective. Protection, provision, presiding. That's the work of men. That's not subject to interpretation. That is what we are meant to do. It's not up for debate. And we can talk about how we do that. How we protect. How best to do it. What's the most proficient way to do it? We can talk about how to best provide and how to best lead. And I'll have that conversation with you all day long. In fact, we should be having those conversations. That's what this podcast is about. How do we do this to the best of our ability? How do we make ourselves better? But there are real men. That's the kind of man I want to be. I think that's the kind of man that you guys want to be because you're listening to this podcast. And if you do, as I do, you can do that. I'm going to be because you're listening to this podcast. And if you do, as I do, then we need to constantly be working to make ourselves more capable of protecting, providing, and presiding for ourselves and the capacity to do that for our loved ones and people who can't do it for themselves. Let me know what you guys think. If you agree, awesome. If you disagree, that's fine. Tell me what you disagree with. Let's have it out. Let's talk about it. Let's discuss it. But more importantly, let's go to work on doing it. I think it's Marcus Aurelius. He says, waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one. Guys, we know what a man should be. We don't need to get tripped up over the words and all this kind of thing. I think it's important we'd be precise with our language. But at the end of the day, you all know that there is behavior of men just as I do. And I'm not always in alignment with that. Just like you are. But we should always be working towards improving ourselves and making ourselves better. Okay? That's all I've got. Leave me a message. Hit me up on Instagram. Hit me up on Facebook, wherever. Email, whatever. Let me know what you think about the podcast. Let me know what you think about this episode. Let me know what you agree with. And even if you disagree, we can talk about that as well. All right, guys. We will be back next week. Until then, go out there. Take action. Make yourself a man. Come the man. You are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
