    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome and everybody to the Monday edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show We have always so much to talk about after the weekend and play and I are recovering from a bit of celebration the end of last week the one-year anniversary of the show at a big party in New York and Appreciate all the nice comments people put up on the photos and everything else also. Hope you all had a a very happy father's day This place pointed out apparently I look exactly like my dad did at my age the photo is right I mean, I can't but I can't believe it. It's it's it's you guys look like your twins Yeah, so you know the hair jeans my friends. What can I tell you? We got a lot to get into here? We got the I mean, we'll talk about it just because people seem to be fascinated by This moment where Biden had a little stumble on his bike look I'm obviously not a big bicycle guy, you know those bicyclists they they sometimes Throw a little a little glance the way of us e-scooter people So I'm not a bicycle guy per se but Biden had a little fall and he's okay He's fine But people are looking at this more seriously and and saying this is the leader of the free world this guy who there's already so many questions about his cognition his energy his health and The way that any Trump any Trump stumble was covered even the most minute thing versus the way they do for Biden Look, we know they're lying and they lie because they think they can get away with it But we still point it out it's a reminder It's not gonna change their minds But it's a reminder for all of us that we're right and they're wrong which is always worthwhile so Biden on the bike We also have The mother of that police officer shot last week or two police officers shot but one of them Is openly blaming George gas scone and also on the law enforcement front There's now video showing that the I mean this was you read this and said you I mean this can't be true But apparently it is you've all day cops never even tried to enter the classroom for 77 minutes according to a new report based on video From the surveillance video from the hallway. So this hole the door was so well locked. They couldn't get in They had to get the key it may the reporting keeps changing and obviously none of us were there So we didn't see exactly what happened but as of right now We'll talk more about this and look like they didn't even try to open the door But but a broader theme for today I think is what they want to focus on the Democrats what their priorities are and what the priorities of the American people Maybe in this moment should be in this moment We have people still dealing with the the very high gas prices We have parents who still cannot find adequate baby formula and for parents for whom baby formula is the only option because a special dietary needs I have celiac disease for example that can actually manifest very young now That's not an issue necessarily for somebody on the baby form this side, but there are certain Dietary restrictions as I understand it plays correct right about about infants I've never had an infant yet, but my understanding is that sometimes babies can only have formula for certain reasons and And that's still happening right now all that's going on and you still have the focus on the trends gender agenda and a whole range of of other issues that people are saying we're getting into election high season here folks They've got to be kidding and now you're seeing clay people like Margaret Brandon over at CBS Some of the ultra establishment journos are starting to say hey Biden team You guys have to come up with better lies because we can't help you if you were this incompetent play clip for here's CBS over the weekend with one of the Biden economic advisors It's like that we can move forward in the near future It will not only help in lowering prices But it will send a signal to the markets and the global economy that the United States is really deadly serious about taking on Hiking taxes isn't going to change the price milk when and how are you actually putting forward this package the package has been debated it's been worked through it failed back when build back better's version of it So if inflation is in one priority right now, when are you scheduling a vote to do the things you just laid out? We're working very closely with congressional leadership with Senate leadership on that they got nothing clay. Yeah And and I think what has happened You mentioned Biden falling on Saturday morning at Rohebeth Beach in Delaware I'm sure most of you have seen that video although Compared to Trump walking down a platform I think at West Point and the raising of the glass that turned into such a monster storyline There hasn't been as much discussion in the left-wing media of Biden falling off his bike But to me that was a really significant moment because When you have in the public's mind the idea that you are in competent and that you are aging they put him on a bike in the first place so they can try to counter the idea that this is an aged man who is not Physically competent so they put him on a bike I don't know why they let him ride around on a bike it seems dangerous in and of itself But they dress him all up in his athletic gear and he even had biking gloves on No, he's going really slow. That's a super expensive bike evidently and The way that he fell we have a a great guy who does tremendous work analyzing sports Injuries for us dr. David Chow who used to be the team physician for the Chargers back in the day And he wrote a piece at Outkick buck. He said if That Joe Biden was very lucky he didn't break his hip The way he fell the angle in which that he hit the ground and I know Biden popped back up But they're those still image photographs of Biden in competent looking to crepit laying on the ground and I don't think you can come back from those kind of clips because it just provides further evidence of What most Americans already believe which is Joe Biden is too old for this job And I think it ties in with the questions you're seeing Suddenly emerge aggressively on CBS and CNN and NBC and all these places that would otherwise Typically be providing cover for this administration They've turned on Joe Biden and the goal even though Biden wants to run again is to make it impossible for him to run again in 2024 and I believe when we see this red wave or this red tsunami It's going to be increasingly difficult for Biden to wait They say he wants to wait till like March of 23 to announce his official run I don't know that that's going to be capable possible and and back to the the narrative that they're trying to Formulate of why you should think this administration's doing well I think there is a little bit of pushback now from as I said the establishment journos The the democrat apparatus propaganda pushers And and that means people that are supposed to be covering the White House asking tough questions Think about the kinds of tough questions if you wanted to I mean we sit here and we drew in like, you know Steve Ducey or Peter Ducey pardon me highlight reels from just being able to ask real questions We want to ask real questions in the White House. I mean you had you had the Brennan asking How is raising taxes going to help with the price of the fantastic question the obvious answer is it's not and only an idiot Would think otherwise so why are they even talking about that? But it's like the the the talking points. It's mechanical for Democrats I don't know what else to say but Janet Yellen to our point about how you're you're always supposed to be able to point to some people In the administration of the opposing party and say at least that guy that gal is really competent You would think the Treasury Secretary in a moment like this you'd hope that would be the case here is Janet Yellen Lady who was pushing forward transitory inflation what she said on ABC News again regime media over the weekend play clip 5 I expect the economy to slow It's been growing at a very rapid rate is the economy is the labor market is recovered and we have reached full employment Clay the economy contracted last yes quarter how is she saying it's growing at a rapid rate she's lying and I believe and I think you're with me buck I would at this point be very surprised if we're not in a recession at this exact moment and for reminders out there You are in a recession when you have two consecutive quarters of declining GDP the first quarter was down I believe 1.5% and the latest forecast that they are now putting out there is that we are going to have a Completely flat second quarter in terms of growth basically right at zero percent to avoid Having to predict the fact that we're going to be in an inflation and lots I mean sorry in a recession and lots of times you know this and a lot of our listeners do as well You are in a recession before the data Confirms that you're in a recession and I think that's where we are right now because April May we've almost finished June I would be surprised if we had positive GDP growth when those second quarter numbers come out I think they are going to show that we are in inflation. I was reading the Wall Street Journal yesterday 44% of economists now look economists are typically awful at telling you what's going down Three out of four are Democrats by the way yeah But 44% of those economists now are saying that we're in a replace Sorry that we're in a recession and and or that we are going to be in a recession So I think we're there almost half of economists degree I will be surprised in the second quarter if we aren't negative again And that would officially put us back into a recession and yet with all of this going on I think clay one reason why the January 6th this goes back to one of the priorities And the principles in a sense on display from the Democrat elites the Democrat Power apparatus what really matters to them? It should be if they were rational and if they were doing things intelligently to try to not just fix the economy But help themselves in the midterms Everything to figure out the economy and and just say sorry sorry to the left wing radical green energy base or whatever We gotta just turn things around here folks or else we're gonna get annihilated That would be the reasonable thing for them to do but instead they retreat into these these ideological cocoons around issues like January 6 or pushing even more the You know trans agenda for either its kids in school or now of course I know you're gonna be talking about the the new swimming regulations about transgender swimmers which clay will break down first I mean that's obviously something that's getting a lot of attention From the activist community and people people can't put gas in their cars can't afford their groceries can't find baby formula recession on the horizon negative GDP growth last quarter and does it sound like I mean this is really if the Democrats had a plan you and I would know because we would be critiquing the plan. That's right This is right. That's wrong. This makes sense. That's dumb We don't even have a plan to critique clay and we all should remember why because the plan was billed back better Which is now clearly so insane because of inflation that they don't have they actually don't have a plan The plan for the first two years buck was we're gonna demonstrate that we beat COVID Thanks to this remarkable COVID vaccine which we should play some audio for you because now six month to five year old kids are technically eligible for this vaccine In vaccine is in quotation marks, but solve COVID and once they solve COVID they were arguing We were gonna have a massive Biden boom as everybody rolled back into work as everything got back to normal Where COVID's not going away. They didn't solve cold COVID in any respect instead what they did was destroy the economy and now frankly, we're in an awful spot where I don't know about you buck But I'm just sitting around hoping that Joe Biden and the Democrats are not going to be able to pass any legislation of any substantive impact for basically the next two and a half years until we have a 2024 presidential election there is big news in a sense for some on the COVID from which we'll get into in just a little bit here as Well, the excitement over over vaccines for very small children among some lives. I sat by the way clay I know people always that's so unfair because if I take a photo of somebody then I'm shaming them right But whenever I say this is what I saw you get all the libs in your car You did know you did making it up. I sat next to a N95 double mask not to any 95's but an N95 with a cloth mask on the on the plane ride down and the beautiful Miss Carrie next to me who was not wearing a mask Thank God, but the the person the other person next to me was wearing an N95 double mask situation So folks if you think if you think people have normalized they have not we'll talk more about this They'll come in up in just a moment, you know whenever I use my phone these days I just see this little thing up in the corner that says pure talk See I'd use pure talk for a work phone before but I made the full-on switch the phone that I'm sending all of my Text and phone calls to family members working so much of my business talking to clay talking to producer Ali and the team That's a pure talk phone now friends and the service is perfect It's absolutely exactly the clarity that you think you'd get from one of the big guys out there, but $20 folks That's right $20 is the plan that you can get on with pure talk pure talk cell phone service is every bit as good As the service that I had before but now my cost is down actually over $70 a month at this point the coverage is so good and the savings are incredible Plus this is a company that shares your values and has great customer service all based here in the US $20 a month for pure talk for great cellular service act now you'll get a month free But all you have to do it so easy is dial pound two five zero and say clay and buck with pure talks No risk money back guarantee you're not gonna regret this. I did it. I'm a pure talk user day in and day out I trust so much of my business my communications to pure talk do it now join pure talk All you have to do is dial pound two five zero and say the words clay and buck Welcome back in clay Travis bucks, Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We are having a fantastic Monday here as we roll through Get you ready for what is officially for a lot of people the start of summer I know kids officially getting out of school and One of the big topics we've had by the way encourage you as always go subscribe to the podcast 17.5 million of you downloaded clay and buck podcast shows in the month of May we want June to Continue to set that number. It's crazy to think about we're gonna be well over 20 million downloads as we roll into the mid-term season but a lot of you out there as you are Paying attention to the insanity that's been going on in the larger United States universe have recognized that one of the things that you never would have thought whatever be an argument Would be that men shouldn't be able to decide they want to compete against women and that's because we basically create massive potentiators for competition in sports because we recognize that there are all sorts of things that make competition unfair for instance kids play against other kids their own age when they are growing up boxers Box against people who weigh around their own age because a heavyweight boxer shouldn't be fighting a flyweight People who are bigger and stronger in boxing and combat sports shouldn't be competing against each other This is not controversial But this past year What has been inevitably? Forecast and all the people told you would never come to reality began to come to pass in great magnitude which is men biological men Decided they were identifying as women and they would start to compete against women and this happened in a big way in college athletics with a transgender swimmer from Penn swim on the men's team for several years decides that he is a woman begins to compete as a woman and wins one of the women swimming championships at the NCAA event that was a Man who decided to now call himself Leah Thomas and so this is really the first real punch back I've seen against this and I want to read some of the details here for you buck and get your reaction the world swimming governing body Has effectively banned. I'm reading from the Associated Press transgender athletes from competing and women events this happened yesterday members voted 71.5% of them by the way in In favor of a new policy that only permits Swimmers who transitioned before age 12 to compete in women's events and so This situation that just happened in the NCAA in theory Under this guideline would not be able to happen now Here's this is a 24 page policy Analyzing all of this Here's the challenge buck and this is why while this is the right result. I'm actually troubled By this exemption that they put in which is if you begin to transition before the age of 12 Then you would still be eligible to compete as a woman My concern is this is going to be used as evidence of those in the transgender community That children being given puberty blockers transitioning all of those things Should be encouraged to happen. So how do you assess this? On the one hand yes Biological men shouldn't be able to compete against women The downside here though is they've left open a loophole in exemption as it were For people who transition or begin to transition before puberty before the age of 12 Well one thing I think we'll be fasting to watch us play out is Who that? transitions before the age of 12 is going to want to without the benefit of Yes, all of those years of testosterone therapy because really what are we talking about biological men also known as men swimming against Okay, yes, so who is going to say well? I Essentially was chemically castrated at a very young you know at age 10 or 11 whatever Which we both agree by the way is child abuse And should not be happening at all and and it's interesting to see all these people say well list look at this Practitioner or that practitioner. I'm pretty sure what we've seen in the last two years is that blue check MDs on Twitter Who have lots and lots of Ukraine flags and vaccine needles and mask emojis on their profiles right are not too trusted on matters of policy or judgment and certainly not with your kids But I so I wonder if this is even you know effectively you won't see the same kind of dominance That's the positive that you see the same may not even arise as an issue under this under this auspices You know it's it's about what's it's about what's fair And so if you don't have the biological advantage as like Leah Thomas for example has roughly 10 years of Testosterone therapy natural testosterone therapy that has changed muscle bone structure heart size all this is 6 foot by the way 6 foot 4 as well hashtag science, okay, so that's reality What we've seen is the Democrat Party now wholesale embrace this standard of We used to be a society where we would say although is that male genitalia or female genitalia and You and I and everyone listening would say pretty sure we can tell the difference When you ask though when you're when you pose that question as a Democrat now the answer always must be it depends It depends not sure we could this is what they say about babies clay remember they say doctors get it wrong Sometimes when babies are born and they say it's a boy or it's a girl They are they are forcing people to up to abandon their own most basic objective reality and sensibility in favor of a political fad and fashion right now and That is what is happening all of the country. It's happening in the school. It's happening in the board rooms number Or else they are demanding this of people and it all started you know years ago. It was oh let's just be Let's be courteous to each other. Let's be let's be civilized everybody with which conservatives completely agree right you treat human beings with dignity decency and kindness Irrespective of whatever the you know the gender spectrum issues or whatever it may be But somehow that transitions pardon the phrase in the last ten years to now when you see a six foot four guy Dominating NCAA female swimming your you better clap in cheer or else you're a bigot so we've gone all the way now It's doctors don't know if a baby's male or female. They're just making an educated guess I guess this is crazy that that is what they say by the way I know you know this but for everyone listening. I'm not trying to like that's not how perbole this is They say doctors get it wrong and they're basically guessing when a baby is born and they say what the gender is and I and I insist on my right as a person as a sentient being as a Rational human being I insist on my ability to say I can tell the difference between male and female genitalia I can tell the difference between a man and a woman They can they can argue with me as much as they want they can but you see they want you to concede This is you know, I'm always glad I've been fascinated by the history of totalitarian regimes of the last hundred years and It's the more aggressive lies that they want you to because if something is a close call of the judgment call if there are things On both sides you could sort of see that doesn't break your spirit That doesn't make you give in your rational faculties and say fine I'll just do anything the whole point is to get you to affirm that which you know to be untrue Because they degrade you in the process they degrade your ability to make your own judgments on other things too And that's part of why this is so important to the Democrats to the left in this moment in time They seek to remake and break society and one of the ways they do it is by telling you you Fundamentally cannot tell a difference between a man and a woman you can't do it and they're wrong and that's a lie And that's why on the swimming issue finally one organization saying look You know if you've been a man until until last year you have a physical advantage because of reality I'm sorry if that hurt some people's feelings and it's amazing to see the left-wing Freak out about this and act like we don't see what reality is but clay I mean saying but what do you think the crossover is to do people say it's so big It did not to let Lea Thomas swim against women under under this under these rules the crossover between that and people that are going to be so excited If they have children to get their two-year-old not one not two But I think it's a three-dose vaccine that's right three doses a huge overlap And what's also intriguing and fascinating to me buck about this entire story is there's almost no one Almost no one out there who is involved in the world of sports at all that will argue in favor of this They either pretend the story doesn't exist or they say something like Well, you know, that's for the governing body to decide no one will say Even at far left wing and you know now how far left wing the sports universe is there's nobody out there Who's a strong advocate for this and and here's another one that I saw you see Hillary Clinton came out and got asked about it And we think Hillary even though she's saying she won't run Hillary did an issue doing a lot of things that would suggest She might be interested in running. She did an interview with the Financial Times And this was the quote she was asked Democrats seem to be going out of their way to lose elections by elevating activist causes Notably the transgender debate which are relevant only to a small minority What sense does it make to depict JK Rowling? Of course the Harry Potter author as a fascist That's the question she got asked and she said, you know, of course we're standing on the precipice of losing our democracy and She basically said this we don't need to be focusing on transgender related issues in the Democrat Party Even Hillary Clinton which it by the way the trans community is not happy about this answer but Hillary is saying something that the vast majority of the American population agrees with and Most Democrats won't even go there right most Democrats Joe Biden certainly doesn't I would love we I know about Peter deucey listens to this show. I would love Whenever Joe Biden is in front of the media again for Peter deucey to say because this story is out there Do you believe that biological men? Should be able to compete against women like what happened with the pin transgender swimmer Or do you think this governing body got it right? Joe Biden 1 billion percent. He's 78 years old He's a sports fan. He's not in favor of guys being able to identify as women and compete against them What would he say in response to that question though? How how handcuffed by the transgender community? He'll do the he'll do the good old Joe by the fireplace grandpa routine that you know, unfortunately idiot still fall for some house going It's not about you know, it's not about that. It's about you know, it's about middle class and you know, it's about, you know, de And that is that is this guy's entire political career effectively He won't but he certainly won't say what everybody knows which is that this is absurd and this is outrageous You know one thing that I thought about recently clay is as as this transgender sports thing You know that they they used to play the game of why are republicans so focused on this? Why do you even care so much which is always that's when they know their argument is bad They don't want the american people paying attention. That's always a tell. Why are you? Oh, there's like two Distraction Yeah, that's all they say this is a huge movement folks. We all see it They want to you know, they want to drag your kids Uh through this agenda in school as well too But as all this is going on I used to think you know what needs to happen The only way this comes apart is if you were to have somebody who is like a let's say a male basketball player of the You know of the physique of the ron James deciding to play in the w and the amazing You know six foot eight to seven feet tall And you know can you know 40 inch vertical whatever right? I mean just one of these guys who are or physical phenomenon are phenomena and and have them play on the wmba and score 100 points a game. I mean this is kind of a joke that um that uh James shapel made that got him into trouble that labron James and score you know 800 points a game But what you see now is that actually what the democrat media would do If that happened is stand and clap and say it is stunning and brave That labron labronna James in this example Is scoring 130 points a game This is what it means to be a good person in america today They would actually do it. They would mouth the preferred slogans like the little marionettes of the apparatus that they are I also wonder how long could a labron james play in the wmba until he's 65 I mean think about how big and strong and fast he would be Even identifying as a woman and by the way some of you out there who are esteemed uh brilliant scholars of Well, I think late 90s early 90s Movies may remember this was the plot of a daman wands film juanaman Do you remember juanaman buck at all? Yeah, it's an esteemed member of the cannon, but the concept is i don't think the rotten tomatoes were very high on that Yes, but the concept is it was played for laughs a NBA star gets banned from playing in the league and so decides to become a woman and disguise himself and It was played for laughs then now I guess juanaman would be a heroic film about the struggles of a man inside of a woman's body Uh or vice versa.

Make sure you go back check us out on the podcast on demand the clay travison bucks X and show Does man we got a lot to get to this hour? Haven't had a chance to talk about yet Um and our friend tommy laren joining us here in just a matter of minutes bottom of the hour around 230 eastern time So please stick around for that got a new show launch with an out kick plays site Which is gonna be fantastic So you can tell a lot about this biden regime by what they focus on obviously and what they don't Meaning that they're showing you more than they intend to I I believe a lot of the time Um, don't don't spend as much we shouldn't spend as much just on what they say, but where are the resources going? And what's being done at the federal level to tackle real problems We know they were asleep at the wheel in the baby formula Crisis and that's still going on at worse this month than last month in terms of how much baby formulas on the shelves So a couple of photos of a plane coming in from germany with baby formula may have been Good optics, but it certainly didn't solve the problem But beyond that You can just look at the focus that they have put on january six and all these other distractions uh the way that they have Been doubling down even on the need to teach children about gender identity all these things in the white house has been weighing in on But then there are genuine crises that seem to get almost no attention from this white house and the drug overdose Pandemic and I do think it is fair to call it that in this country is something that deserves a whole lot more attention And I think there are some reasons we should uh, we should Explore as to why the media seems so much Less interested in this Uh, I mean first of all if you're if you're curious and I think all of it should be not only was last year Was the highest year ever for overdose that overdose deaths from drugs in the united states over a hundred thousand people And unlike clay and i were just talking about the covet numbers where a lot of people who are either hospitalized Uh or died and listed as covet as the cause A lot of those those instances were not actually from covet when someone dies from a drug overdose They died from a drug overdose. So that's over a hundred thousand people who are also Overwhelmingly in the age range of you know 18 to 35 Maybe 18 to 45 And so you're losing a lot of people who are you know early in their lives And there's a whole Series of of problems that have all come together here the wide open border for example So last year was the worst ever for fentanyl and general drug overdoses in this country over a hundred thousand people died The first five months of 2022 according to the department of justice clay More fentanyl seized Which people might say oh that means we're doing better law enforcement That actually to anyone who understands the the drug trade means there's more fentanyl coming meaning more of it's getting into the country too You're not actually stopping the flow. You might be catching more of a larger flow More fentanyl seized the first five months of 2022 compared to I'm sorry the first five months of 2022 surpassed all of last year So we are already in terms of fentanyl seizures Um beyond where we were so you can think that that's because of really aggressive law enforcement Or you can think that that's because the drugs are flowing in a greater numbers And you look at a city like Oregon Where we talked about this briefly last week the democrats city of Oregon run by democrats democrat voters Made drug Made drugs effectively legal fentanyl cocaine heroin For personal possession wouldn't arrest people for using this stuff out in public People were shooting up in downtown porland with heroin needles clean needle programs decriminalization all this All it has led to is more people dying more people using and more destruction of their downtown What do you think it takes for democrats to realize that you know permissiveness is not kindness It's not the same thing that allowing people to destroy themselves is not the same thing as being As being considerate and sympathetic to your fellow human being Yeah, and it's just part and parcel of the rampant lawlessness that we are seeing and and I like to discuss Years of life lost When we are setting these records over 100,000 people dying of drug overdoses fentanyl Overwhelmingly the cause of most of those You're talking about people in their 20s and their 30s and their 40s with their entire lives left to be lived that are dying and The lawlessness is our southern border is also contributing to the lawlessness that exists all over the country I'm looking right now at a fox news headline. We've talked a lot about Homicide increases since 2020 you went up 30 percent in 2020 up again in 2021 We got a lot of cities out there where people are listening to us la Washington dc Baltimore milwaukee and in atlanta halfway through the year are all setting pace for Record homicide increases again. That's a wide scope of the country right east coast all the way to the west coast The south the midwest I'm headed to atlanta here for a braves game as soon as this thing is over People in atlanta are terrified with what is going on in their crime rate We know but we've talked a lot about all of the issues in la including two cops Who got murdered and I think we have the audio Associated with that from the mom who is furious over The situations that have been allowed to exist in these democrat cities and states and what is going on In terms of the danger to everybody as a result and I mean it's it's overwhelmingly difficult to listen to What these people are saying in response to all of that all that violence I mean it just is brutal on an absolutely epic level This all relates back to bad ideas ideas that were Pushed very heavily in 2020. I mean ending and this I think there's also just a broader tie in here clay where A lot of the the ideas of a left that end up having catastrophic Consequences for really everybody in society just making everything worse Whether it's a defund the police ending mass incarceration legalization of the most hardcore drugs a lot of it starts with An appeal to conservatives decency sympathy and and I would say innate kindness Come on guys. We don't want to lock people up forever for drugs And that then all of a sudden turns into yeah So what if we found a gangbanger has been arrested 15 times with drugs and illegal firearm And maybe he's been threatening to kill arrival or kill an ex-girlfriend But we want to end mass incarceration so you know we're gonna let him go And we see what ends up happening and this is tied in of course to the shooting list to brave officers officers who did answer the call Who did go into the gunfire and exchange fire with that with that That gang member who had his gang literally tattooed on his face, right? I mean just so everyone understands It's not really a tough call for gas go the district attorneys this you know This isn't a an honor student who you know got caught up with the wrong crowd one afternoon and did some graffiti somewhere This was a hardcore gang member who killed two police officers But I just I bring it off because The the democrat appeal and you hear this them either in the beginning come on. We don't you guys want to be nice Don't you want to do the nice thing and it's actually not nice In portland to allow people to do heroin out in the open and to overdose and to you know choke on their own vomit and die That's actually not a kindness for those people We should be looking at what actually the results of policies are and we should be trying to promote that Yeah, the general welfare, but also the individual welfare You're not doing people any favors by letting them destroy themselves out in public and make their communities A nightmare for everybody else and and then then you even get into clay These drugs are different than other drugs in the past I mean that's I think another part of it that people need to understand the cartels make fentanyl pills to look like pharmaceutical grade Percocet to look like fun to look like things that are made by pharma companies that you've actually heard of that doctors would prescribe people And so a kid you know a 16 year old that 18 year old will take one dead Yeah, that's happening all over the country and that's happening day in and day out The numbers are vast in every community large and small How much time is the Biden administration put into tackling that problem versus how much time had the Biden the democrats put into january 6 for example But our democracies in peril they shout Yeah, how much attention have we even seen at the border period The only time we've seen a story at the border that the Biden administration has commented on or the media has been willing to press the Biden administration on Was the ridiculous made up story about the border patrol agents who were whipping Haitian immigrants Even though that clearly is not true We talked about it last week that there are some sort of consequences that are trying to be brought to bear on that issue But it speaks to the media's failure to address issues that directly impact massive amounts of the american public on a day to day basis Again, if you're in your 20s 30s and 40s covid was virtually zero risk to you But the fintenol A massive amounts of drugs coming across your cross your borders and the number of people who couldn't go to their AA meetings or couldn't go to church Or couldn't have their normal social encounters that would have helped to Keep maybe so much of this depression and anxiety and and drug use down It all got taken away from them and we're still not even discussing all of the long-term consequences of The worst american public policy decision in most of our lifetimes Which was to shut down and allow all of these drugs to run rampant in our streets And you see the democrats now in this in the city of of portland Including a candidate for mayor Are are recognizing what has been done as a result of these these were decisions that were made This isn't just a thing that happened and it's true in many other cities when you look at the crime and the crime in san francisco They have similar issues with the open-air drug use Uh clay there they're now talking about putting all of the homeless encampments into These uh these tiny homes essentially these almost like a like a a shack a prefabricated shack And now that so they're going to just create these massive open-air homeless encampments with little with little houses Um, and then they're going to still be dealing with a lot of the same problems though I mean, this is they they have created an approval of people doing this They've said okay, you want to be doing fenthadol remember and it was using fenthadol in these places is going to be often selling it That's how they that's how they get the money to buy the fenthadol themselves They're going to be a part of that chain of transmission And they don't arrest them and they don't say enough is enough and communities are being destroyed by this You know these are ideas that the left has pushed that have been wrong yet again And I just think there needs to be accountability for it. I think that joe biden. I mean you brought up the border clay The border is wide open is a problem not just because of illegal immigration It means that it's easier than ever to get fenthadol across the border Which is which has killed people that members of this audience are related to no very well taught in school All over the country. Yeah, I mean we're and and there's no sense of urgency from this white house whatsoever to deal with this Such a great sense of urgency though on you know climate for example 100 000 people are you're dying for fenthadol overdoses Look at how much more time they spend talking about the green new deal than about the drug epidemic we have in the country So, you know, I think it just it shows you what they care about and the the generally um Well, actually it's all I was gonna say you can't even generalize about where these overdoses are happening. It's all over the country everywhere simultaneously And the failure of the media to hold the biden account uh, the biden administration accountable for this in any way or even write about it or even care about it especially because of its association with the border is biased in confidence that's directly costing tens of thousands of lives Come back to more in just a moment here including our friend tommy laren joining talk about her new show launch and what she sees going On with this biden regime a lot of celebrations this time of year my friends No, sure.
