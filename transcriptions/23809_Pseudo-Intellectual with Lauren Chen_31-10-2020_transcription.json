    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show and thank you so much for tuning in. If it's your first time here, hi, my name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. And as always, we have a lot to talk about. So first up, our lead story, Joe Rogan versus, I guess, the establishment, the media, he's had several guests on land that have really challenged the people who usually control the narrative into his credit. He is stuck by the idea of being able to talk with different people about different concepts. Then the internet's favorite troll, Jessica Yaniv. Yaniv, I don't know even what pronoun to use. I just, I don't want to get banned off anything. All right, don't get mad at me. I just work here. Yaniv is in the news again after suing a beauty pageant who didn't allow her, him, whatever to compete because Yaniv has not had actual gender reassignment surgery yet. And in France, tensions are high as another attack recently occurred, resulting in more deaths after a teacher showed infamously a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. And now there are cries of, of course, not, not, not just the need to confront Islamic extremism, but also Islamophobia, because obviously Muslims are the real victims here. This Tuesday, election day, we will be at Tim Poole's election night stream party or whatever. And his stream and also maybe doing some streaming of our own on our own YouTube channel with some different guests that will also be there. So I guess just, you know, if you want to be involved with that, follow us on social media so you can see what we're going to be up to. But this isn't a very election heavy episode, but don't worry, the election content is coming. Yeah, for sure. And he's coming on Tuesday. So first off, let's talk about Joe Rogan. I am not the most rabid Joe Rogan listener. I knew, I know you are, you know, along with protein. He's one of your interests. No, I mean, listen, I like his show. Most of it, well, I don't even watch most of his episodes, but it's, I like a lot of the guests he has on. He's willing to talk to just about anyone, maybe a little bit less so than he was in the past. Yeah. I do feel like he's had fewer conservatives on lately, like actual, just straight up. Yeah. No, no, well, back in the day he'd have on people like Stefan Molinu, which now is Gavin McInnis, like a crowder. I think that he will not have on again. Yeah. But this week was kind of an exception to that rule in a big, big way. And he's kind of like, this is almost like two or even three, maybe even four stories together, lumped into one. Yeah, all surrounding Joe Rogan. So he's really been, he's been making waves in a lot of ways, like doing, doing things that a lot of people are not too happy with him with. But I think it's great. I mean, even though, like, I don't watch his show every episode, but he is kind of like the only person right now that's able to in a meaningful way stand up to these big tech platforms that are trying to silence certain voices by having them on his show. Right. And yes, he gets flocked for it, but at the same time he's so popular right now that, I mean, what can they do to him? He's freaking Joe Rogan, most popular podcast in the world. Yeah. I think it's, and I think in terms of like listeners, viewers, just like an audience, he reaches more people than I think any program in the world and TV, anything like that. He's got a huge audience now. And it's kind of important, as before we get into these stories, to just preface it for those of you that don't know with his deal with Spotify. Right. So there was a big change in the Joe Rogan experience announced earlier in the year in that his show would become exclusive to Spotify on the audio platform. Right. And so, in the podcast, it would only be available on Spotify and he signed a big deal, strictly a licensing deal, apparently, with Spotify. And that's prompted a lot of discussion, I guess, with regards to Spotify as a company. And I guess if they're going to moderate him or not, or if they can, and what the deal with that was. Because keep in mind, Spotify is also the platform that banned Alex Jones. Right. There was that it seemed concerted to me. There was this, like, when one fell swoop, he was gone from like Spotify, iTunes, Twitter wasn't far behind that, correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah. So, I mean, now Joe Rogan talks to a lot of these people that have been banned. But again, he's popular enough where I guess Spotify still sees money in hosting his show. So it's interesting to see how they're kind of wrestling with that. The first story that we're going to look into specifically is that recently Joe Rogan had on, gosh, what's her name? Abigail Schrier. Abigail Schrier, right. So she is, I actually watched parts of that episode, at least I do not find her transphobic in the slightest, but she is someone who talks about, you know, the issue of like, I guess, rapid onset gender dysphoria. The idea of gender dysphoria is kind of like a social contagion. And apparently that is enough now to make you transphobic. So we have this article from vice Spotify CEO defends keeping transphobic Joe Rogan podcasts online. Don't you love that framing? Isn't that amazing? That's how it always is now. Yeah. So this article reads, in a Spotify all hence company meeting on Wednesday's Spotify CEO, Daniel Eck defended keeping transphobic content from hugely popular podcast or Joe Rogan on the audio platform. Who earlier this year signed an exclusive license and deal with the company likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Some staff inside the company feel alienated by Spotify's hosting of certain the Joe Rogan experience episodes. According to copies of some of the questions presented to the meeting obtained by motherboard, the news signals how Spotify as it moves into the podcasting space beyond music is facing content moderation decisions more commonly associated with social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Spotify has already removed GRE episodes with some right wing figures, including Alex Jones and Gavin McKinnis. So something I want to note here is that there exists this group of activists who like they just they love to censor, right? They cannot stand the idea of people being able to freely listen to someone like Alex Jones or Gavin McKinnis. So you know, we saw them first, they were kind of harassing Twitter saying, how could you dare platform these people? Then it was YouTube. How can you dare platform these people? And now that Joe Rogan and by extension, kind of Alex Jones are on Spotify. Well, now all of these people are going to say, Hey, Spotify, why do you support white supremacy? And I think like the only way to really stop the onslaught of censorship that we see and that's becoming increasingly serious is just to stop listening to these people. Right? These people are such a tiny minority of people. Yeah, they're loud on Twitter. But Twitter as we know is not real life. So these companies, they need to stop listening to them. I mean, it sounds like at Spotify and I think places like YouTube and Twitter, they do exist like within the company. I say like, look, if you're in charge, you say, this is how it's going to be. We're going to be neutral. And if you don't like it, you don't have to work here. Like how hard is that? I really want these like tech CEOs to sack up if they really do believe in like free speech, like a lot of them like Jack Dorsey at least pay lip service to. Yeah. And honestly, I think that most of these employers are probably replaceable. Yeah, seriously, I don't see any reason to allow them to dictate things. But yeah, I think it's interesting the amount of internal turmoil that this has caused in Spotify. It's been, they've been trying to keep it under wraps, I think, but this has caused like a huge, huge kind of discussion internally as a company where they're wrestling with these left wing progressives and what to do with something like the Joe Rogan experience. This vice article continues in the case of Joe Rogan, a total of 10 meetings have been held with various groups and individuals to hear their respective concerns, ex said, according to three sources. And some of them want Rogan removed because of the things he said in the past. Others have concerns specifically over a recent episode, ex said, and Joe Rogan and the episode in question have been reviewed extensively. The fact that we aren't changing our position doesn't mean we aren't listening. It just means we made a different judgment call. So they're still trying to be like, no, we hear your concerns. Maybe we're not against the, you know, the issue, the concept of censoring him, but it's just not in this case. But I think it's like, it's not a strongest stance for, you know, open discussion I was like to see from Spotify. And you know, with this episode specifically, I can't help but feel like this is just Spotify is more doing this because Joe Rogan brings them a lot of money than any actual concern. They had a variable bump in their stock when there was announced that they would get that licensing with Joe Rogan. Right. So there's a lot of money on the table for them. And especially now, like I think they are, gosh, I don't, I haven't looked at Joe Rogan's episodes on their platform, but I have heard that they want to roll out a video aspect as well for certain podcasts. So I mean, I think eventually they might want to challenge YouTube for like podcast video supremacy, but unfortunately, for the time being, I want these companies to compete against each other. And hopefully, you know, Spotify ends up undermining some of Google's monopoly there. I'd be pretty happy with that. Assuming that Spotify is a better version. Right. But that's like, that's the only caveat. I would like it if it meant that one of them would be better, but it seems like they're just equally bad right now. But imagine how much money Spotify could bring in if they were to say we are the only place kind of like, aside from info or directly where you can get Alex Jones content with video. Imagine how much of a draw that would be for some people. Yeah. No, I think it would be, there is a market for a platform that is genuinely free speech right now. Yeah. It's tough because we have seen platforms like try to just, that is their only brand. Right. There isn't, the market isn't big enough that that's the only thing you could go with. Yeah. You need to have at least to be established to some degree or have someone with a huge audience that's using you and maybe using you exclusively. But anyway, speaking of Alex Jones, so Alex Jones is not on Spotify. You can't find his own content on there. But Joe Rogan recently had Alex Jones on his podcast and correct me if I'm wrong. He's also planning on having him back for the election, right? Yeah. I think the, the announced people for Joe Rogan's election night special, what you shouldn't watch because you should watch an hour. Yeah, exactly. He's going to be having Alex Jones, Kyle Kolinsky, who's very much on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Right. And I think Tim Dillon again, who's comedian, who's just, he just makes everything better in that circumstance. That's your opinion. I don't find him that funny. But anyway, I don't want to get in trouble over my views on comedy again with you guys. So yeah, BuzzFeed news, which sounds like that's kind of a misnomer. And in, in, in. Yeah, actually, you're going through the articles for this segment. I was like, Oh, wow, like it's kind of depressing that BuzzFeed news had like kind of the best, most succinct article on this stuff. Yeah. Touchdown, all the things that in the appropriate way. But that's, that's what it was. Yeah. BuzzFeed news. So they write in public Spotify is staying quiet about an appearance by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones yesterday on its flagship podcast, the Joe Rogan experience, despite banning Jones's own podcast last year. But an internal email sent from a top executive, the company is defending the booking. Horatio Gutierrez, the company's chief legal officer and head of global affairs, wrote to team managers on October 28th about the episode of Joe Rogan's podcast that featured an interview with Jones and podcast host Tim Dillon. If a team member has concerns about any piece of content on our platform, you should encourage them to report it to trust and safety. It's always these trust and safety departments like they're so dystopian. It's such a dystopian. No, just get rid of that entire department. You don't need it. You don't need it. I like that comes straight out of Orwell. Yeah. I know that that's like Orwell's totally tripped about too much, but this is. Yeah, that's that's trust and safety. They all have all of them. Twirls of trust and safety department. YouTube as well. Facebook and it's they're all like just these like sensors that want to. And it's like, do does anybody have any trust or feel safe with these things? They feel like quite the opposite. Yeah. Very much. They have no level of entities. So it says they are the experts on our team charge with reviewing content. GTR is wrote in email obtained by BuzzFeed. However, it's important that they aren't simply flagging a piece of content just because of something they've read online. It's all too common that things are taken out of context. I agree with that. But again, it's just it's hypocritical to hear them say this about Alex or about Joe Rogan, who they've invested like a lot of money in versus not giving the same opportunity to Alex Jones because I guess they didn't seem as lucrative. Spotify has always been a place for creative expressions. The top bullet points said it's important to have diverse voices and points of view on our platform to a certain extent, I suppose. We are not going to ban specific individuals from being guests on other people shows as the episode slash show complies with our content policies and closing. We appreciate that not all of you will agree with every piece of content on our platform. However, we do expect you to help your teams understand our role as a platform and the care we take in making decisions. Okay. So again, like I appreciate what they're saying here, but I feel like they're still pandering way too much to these activists within their own companies. Like, if there's this much dissent, this much complaining over a huge deal, just get rid of these people. Stop trying to like they're replaceable. Joe Rogan is not. So stop trying to. But what I love about what Joe did here, which like, you know, he's really impressed me this past week, I think in particular. But what I love about what he did here was as soon as he saw him with Spotify, they started having problems, particularly once the abgales Shrier episode went out. There was a large backlash within Spotify internally, right? As we mentioned already. And there was like potential censorship of the show coming out. And he didn't comment too much on it. And then boom, released on Alex Jones episode, like within a week of the election. Yeah. Like, so I thought that was a pretty impressive thing to do there. And by the same token, Spotify, Spotify was kind of hamstrung in this situation. It was like, because he basically said, okay, you know, I'm doing this and, you know, take it or lose it. We have it. There's probably a contract in place that. Where he has like editorial controllers. Right. Exactly. I'm almost certain that there would be. So there might be hamstrung here, but at least they complied. Like they they they followed through. And I think that's awesome. I think that more people who are in a position of power, like Joe Rogan, if they actually do believe in like open dialogue and stuff, well, put your money where your mouth is kind of like do what Joe Rogan is doing. Like you have the power to give these people a platform, even if you don't. They're sure. I rarely agree with anything or everything they say. Like don't just pay lip service when it directly affects you. Like actually be willing to spotlight these voices if you have the power to do so. And yeah, on that note also, one of the reasons why we're going to Tim Poole's election night coverage is because, you know, he's he is a genuine guy who's actually interested in talking to people. Right. He's got him come under fire recently for having Vash on the platform and is a potential eventually going to be having Nick Fuentes on. I don't know if that actually happened. But he I think they are trying to get Alex Jones themselves. We had Alex Jones on the show. He was a very courteous guest. I thought that was a great interview. That was a good interview. Yeah. And like regarding the flack that Tim is getting for having Vash because usually we see people on the left complaining about a right wing figure now with the whole thing with Vash is I do see a lot of people who are either more center or center right or even just conservative attacking Tim for speaking with Vash. And I have to say this. I don't like Vash as a person, like just personally, I don't like him. So I understand that a lot of you probably just don't want him to be platform because he might gain popularity, whatever. I think we need to be really careful that we don't start just becoming the left wing equivalent or sorry, the right wing equivalent of social justice warriors. And like with Vash specifically, it's I I dislike his political views, obviously, but I think I might dislike his personality more than that. Like it's a heart. It's a toss up, right? I've seen him call people that I respect really bad names that I'm not going to repeat. And you know, I think a lot of people just from an emotional place of anger, they feel betrayed when someone like Tim is talking in a civil way with this person who's like arguably quite dislikeable. Don't take it personally guys. I think for Tim, and I think I can vouch for this, this is about ideas, right? He's not condoning Vash like as a person, as a buddy, he just wants to be able to talk to him like he does a lot of other people. And I don't think attacking Tim is the right thing to do here. You know, if anyone should come under flag for this, like if you if you hate everything that Vash said and thinks he's on the path, then that's that's what you need to direct at Vash specifically, not at Tim. I also want to say that when the right wing engages in censorship in 2020, it's like that's if you're even promoting the idea, like we shouldn't have these people on our platforms. You are sending to defeat because they the left controls everything. So as long as you ascend that that censorship is somehow viable at all as an idea, then we lose because they they're like, okay, you agree with us that censorship as an idea is okay. Yeah, we have all we pull all the levers there. So you know, right now that's definitely not the argument we want to say if you want to be pragmatic about it, at the very least. Right. For sure. So I think of just I guess like no platforming and censorship, Glenn Greenwald, who is a journalist writer who we've we've referenced before on this show, specifically in our Barry Weiss piece. That was one of my favorite segments that we've done recently. So he was recently on Joe Rogan show. You know, they were talking about what journalism means to Glenn. And I thought he made some I mean, honestly, there was like a little bit of a like padding yourself on the back as a journalist, I thought there. Yeah, they were talking about what journalism is supposed to be. And it's supposed to be about criticizing the people and power the people who control the narrative, things like that. And I didn't watch I didn't listen to the whole episode. You listen to a lot more of it than me. Yeah. But what's interesting about that is that essentially the next day, Glenn Greenwald also announced that he was resigning from the intercept, which is the publication that he actually co founded. That's right. The reason being that they were according to Glenn, because now there's like a back and forth about this, trying to censor a piece he wanted to put out that was critical of Joe Biden and not only did the people at the intercept against Greenwald's contract, which guaranteed editorial freedom, not only did they want to censor the publication on the publication of the article on their own platform, they also didn't want him to be able to publish it on another platform, which was a like another, I guess, protection that his contract allowed. So he, he resigned and he released a pretty scathing letter on social media. And we also have this post from him. He says, I won't do a tit for TAT with the intercept. I get the need to defend themselves, but just note one, ask Betsy Reed why they won't publish an accounting of what happened with reality winner and who that cover up is protecting and two great journalism that nobody reads isn't great. He says, given their claims, I'm going to publish along with censored article, the emails about it so people can decide for themselves if it was censored for, I understand that the intercepts editors will slam my journalism as changed. I wish they had the courage to do it before today. So that's all kind of, I mean, this was blowing up because it was almost like a Barry Weiss ask when she left the New York Times, like he is leaving him saying, you're not letting me say what I want to say. Yeah. And actually, like I actually read because he published the article within the past 24 hours of filming this, right? He hasn't released the emails as of yet, but I went through the article. It's a pretty long piece and it's not fully completed yet. Like he hadn't had done the final draft yet. He's keeping it as the final, the exact state that yeah, in the exact state to send to them. So it's definitely not perfect. But to me, the article, it was critical of Biden definitely, but it was almost, it was almost a meta meta thing because it was critical of journalism with regards to the Biden scandal. Right. It was saying that like, look at all these journalists who are covering for Biden who are giving him literally providing him excuses to not answer these tough questions and never giving him these tough questions on their own terms. So by writing about all these journalists problems with regards to Biden, the intercepts response to that is, well, this is kind of critical of Biden. Let's censor you. Yeah. Right. So, I mean, to play devil's advocate, according to the intercept, I don't know how much credit you want to give them. They say, oh no, he wasn't censored. We just provided like we just edited him, which again, that in and of itself is Orwellian. Like no, no, your opinions aren't being censored. They're being edited. Right. So it's they like to play games with language. We know this. I'm very interested in seeing exactly what those emails entail. At the moment, I'm inclined to believe what Greenwald has said. Same. Yeah. Especially just looking at everything that, you know, there are some intercept employees have commented on this. I mean, none of them seem to be very favorable to the idea of freedom of expression or freedom of speech. I've also seen a lot of progressives right now accuse Greenwald of being a Russian sympathizer or operative and just crazy stuff. It's like, all right, I see how things are. But yeah, I guess the essence of this segment is that man media, like they have a tight and by they, I mean, you know, progressives, leftists, I mean, the establishment, they have a tight control over what can and can't be said right now. Either through big tech platforms or different publications. And it's like, if you actually, if you believe in the concept of democracy and elections, you need to have a free a free and open press. Otherwise, it's like the elite is just controlling everything basically. No, absolutely. And I think the main, like the way we tie this whole segment together is that at least Joe Rogan this past week, which is just before the election has had these whole series of guests on between Jones, Greenwald. He's also just had Gadsad on. And there was a fourth one who I'm now forgetting, but was it the the R O, R O G D lady? No, that was that was prior. That was prior. But the point is just before the election, he's had a series of people that are questioning the progressive stuff, the status quo that the progressives tech giants and mainstream media are bringing about. And I think that this is one of the more virtuous things that I've seen Joe do with this show. Mm hmm. No, for sure. All right. So now we're going to turn to a total 180 because this is not going to be a virtuous segment at all. We're going to talk about Jessica Yene first, though. I want to tell you all about a new book, Not Free America, one of the most interesting books I've heard of in quite a while. It's written by Mike Donovan, no relation, someone who has fought tyranny for years as the founder of the nation's largest pro bono civil rights firm.

That is not free America.com to order your book today. All right. So Jessica Yeneave, everyone's favorite trends, predator, Canadian. I don't know where to start. It's an incredible situation to me because it's so so overtly using the tools of the left, like just in the crudest way possible to just wheel like, like bring law cases against businesses. People. It's super dangerous, but at the same time, at the start of the show, we're like, you know, I don't know what to call them. And at this point, I genuinely have to comply to some degree because the law actually support this person. Yeneave is litigious above all else. Yes. And it's just, you know, I don't agree with what Yeneave is doing, but at the same time, I also feel like Yeneave is maybe doing better than a lot of conservatives that illustrating to progressives how ridiculous some of these laws are, right? And how easily exploited they can be. It's true. So we just have another example of this. So this is from New York Post. It says, a Canadian transgender woman is suing a beauty pageant company for refusing to allow her to compete in its contest, according to the Justice Center for Constitutional Freedom, which represents the business. Jessica Yeneave, a transgender LGBTQ rights activist. Actually, I was going on Yeneave's Twitter profile the other day. Yeneave identifies herself as a trans lesbian. So yeah, that's anyway. So Yeneave filed a human rights complaint against Toronto's Canada Galaxy pageants alleging it is in violation of the Ontario human rights code. Oh, I thought Yeneave was NBC interesting. The conservative legal policy organization announced Monday in May 2019, Yeneave, whose biological sex is male. I think I think anyone who's who's seeing the picture in this article can tell that. Okay. I don't want to know. I'll be allowed to say that anymore though. Yeah, because that like biological sex is male because they have dead naming where you're not allowed to say their previous name. Maybe they're going to have like your dead gendering them. Yeah, to even acknowledge. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there were there were always a female right. I mean, May 2019, Yeneave, whose biological sex is male, applied to be a contestant in the pageant's 28 years and older division, but did not disclose she was transgender, had yet to complete gender reassignment surgery, the Justice Center alleged. Yeneave was tentatively accepted to the pageant, but the business had a formal policy stating only genetic females or transgender women who had fully transitioned. So I think they're talking about the snip there were allowed to be contestants. The Justice Center said when Yeneave was reminded of the policy, she filed a complaint alleging the pageant company engaged in discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression, and sex. She is seeking $10,000 in damages for injury to dignity and feelings and wants Ontario's human rights tribunal to rule that organizations cannot refuse service to someone based on their genitals, the Justice Center alleged. So she's alleging genital discrimination, which if you're familiar with Yeneave, the previous lawsuits that he they were also filed also alleged genital discrimination. So if you have a keeping up with this, you need was the person who tried to sue like beauty salons, estheticians for not wanting to wax Yeneave's male genitalia. Because apparently that's transphobic. You either. Well, female penis. Yeah, you wax my balls or you're a transphobic bigot. Right. Yeah. And you need to not win that, by the way. Yeah. And I kind of suspect that you need will not win this either. Right. But I guess that are they making money from this? They must be right from litigation and attention. Like, I don't know. Is someone funding this? Like, where do they get the money for the lawsuits if they keep lawyers? Lawyers are expensive or is Yeneave representing herself himself? I don't even know. Yeah, honestly. But I think this is a good illustration of, you know, the fact that you can't just pretend that gender and sex are whatever you feel like it. And that biology is totally meaningless because that's just not true. And like most people, if you say like, Hey, should a female bikini wax or have to wax balls, they would say, of course, no, you can't, can't, that's ridiculous. But, you know, this progressive ideology that would say, actually, yes, yes, you can make that. And that is the feminist thing to do is make that woman that small business owner waxed those balls. So, I mean, I'm hoping that Ontario sees the light and realizes, hang on, this is ridiculous. Like, we can't make the beauty pageant, except, you know, throughout this case, but it is, it is Ontario, you know, the place where was it? Yeah, they don't have the. And was birthed. So we don't have the greatest track record here with our, we have a human rights committee in every province here in Canada, because why not? And yeah, we don't have a very good track record with siding with the reason in this course. The article continues for reasons of safety and security. It is imperative that biological women and girls and fully transition transgender females have spaces where they can associate free from the presence of individuals with male genitalias. This is particularly so in situations where women and girls are exposed or vulnerable. Alison kindle page pay of it. I don't know what attorney with the justice center said in a statement. You need didn't immediately return a request for comment and her complaint, which is confidential, was not readily available. The justice center accused the activists of being a serial filer of human rights complaints in 2019. And even as we just mentioned, filed a series of complaints against five Vancouver estheticians for their refusal to perform bikini waxes on her because of her genitals. Oh, so that was in BC. So maybe like maybe you need is now moving to Ontario to give their human rights tribunal a spin. See how progressive or woke they are. Who knows at this point. Yeah. So actually I did. So Jessica and Eve is still on Twitter. Her handle is at trusted nerd. And I was just going through the post to see like what have you been up to? A lot of the posts that you need makes are just complaining about being discriminated against because of gender identity. So there is this, uh, this one that I thought was pretty funny. The post says hi at Mark Patrone. Enjoy having to respond to this complaint. I am filing against you with the CBSC and the specific concern listed is statements made on this program were transphobic and fueled hate speech, inviting a person named Chris Elston to spew hateful remarks about gender identity and transgenderism. In addition, a caller called in named Donald who started to spew hateful comments without being immediately cut off. The broadcaster allowed Donald to continue spewing these statements and did not immediately cut off Donald from the line or apologize to the listeners. He told Donald he cannot save the things and then cut them off, but the statements were still made and are discriminatory and a fan of Tory in nature. So it's, I mean, pretty much Jessica and Eve is like the ultimate Karen, like activist Karen, just complaining to people about mistreatment. It's like, Oh, goodness. You didn't, you didn't like put them under the guillotine fast enough. So yeah. So I am now complaining. You must be sued. Yeah. I'm not going to be exhausting to be a person like this. Best of luck to this beauty pageant. And that's the thing like, aren't beauty pageant supposed to be like not progressive anyway, because they're a symbol of patriarchy and objectification. These people don't have a kind of a logical consistency. It's true. Yeah. It's kind of whatever. I don't know. I don't, I hope that they're not because there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on and beauty pageants. Yeah. So, but yeah, no, I have no idea. Yeah. All right. So next up, we're going to be talking about everything happening in France. Yeah. Before we do, I want to tell you all about our sponsor, Nutriful. So 30 million women are impacted by weakened or thin and hair. If you're among them and know you are not alone and there's a solution you can trust to deliver real results, thousands of women have taken back control of their hair with Nutriful with many users raving that the supplement not only transformed their hair, but restored their confidence to and neutral offers to targeted formulas for women that are clinically shown to improve hair growth and thickness with less shedding through all stages of life. And by the way, there is a separate formula, Nutriful for men as well, because as we all know, thick hair, it's just something anybody wants is not gender specific. You know, Jessica, you need would be, you know, I'm sure whatever their gender identity is, thick hair is important, right? So healthier hair growth does take time. You'll begin to experience thicker, stronger and faster growing hair in three to six months. In a clinical study, 86% of women reported improved hair growth after six months, more than 1500 top doctors recommend Nutriful as an effective and high quality solution for healthier hair. You can grow thicker, healthier hair and support our show by going to Nutriful dot com and using the promo code CHEN. New customers will get 20% off. This is their best offer available anywhere plus free shipping on every single order. Get 20% off at Nutriful dot com spelled N-U-T-R-A-F-O-L dot com with a promo code CHEN if you've dealt with kind of like hair loss or shedding before, you may have tried things like shampoo, but the thing with that is that that's really a surface level thing. Like you're, it doesn't really get to the root of hair growth. Unlike a supplement like Nutriful, which is actually, I think much more targeted in solving that issue. All right. So as you are probably aware of, if you watched, was it last week's episode, maybe the week before of our, of our long episode? It was probably last week's episode. Yeah. Recently in France, there was a teacher who showed a cartoon drawing of the problem of a comet when giving a, I guess, history or like free speech lesson. Yes. He was unfortunately beheaded by one of the students. And you know, this has really kicked off a debate in France and really worldwide of the issue of freedom of expression versus respecting religious wishes. And now we have another attack that has happened in France, another fatal attack as the BBC reports here. Three people have died in a knife attack at a church in Nice in what French President Emmanuel Macron said was an Islamist terrorist attack. He said France would not surrender its core values after visiting the Notre Dame Basilica in the southern city. An extra 4,000 troops are being deployed to protect churches and schools. In Nice, one elderly victim was virtually beheaded. Official said another woman and a man also died. The male victim was a lay member of staff responsible for the upkeep of the church. And he reportedly had a wife and two children, the woman aged 44 managed to flee to a nearby cafe after being stabbed several times, but died later. The male suspect was shot and detained. So Mr. Rickard said the suspect was a 21 year old Tunisian national who had arrived in France earlier this month. He had a document issued by the Italian Red Cross. And this is something that I want to note. Okay. So Emmanuel Macron to, I mean, this is a good thing. He's taken a very hard stance against, you know, Islamic extremism, been very pro like freedom of speech and all that for France. What I think we fail to see from Macron, who is a leftist is the, the addressing the root cause of the issue. Paul Joseph Watson recently did a video about this. You know, of the recent terror attacks in France, they have been committed by people who are not French nationals, right? I mean, it's all good to virtue signal against Islamic extremism. But if you keep continuing to import Islamic extremism, it's not going to get better, right? I don't know what you think, like all of these displays, these Charlie Hebdo solutions, this hashtag, just do whatever. Like if you continue to open your borders and bring in people who don't respect French values, like, what do you think is going to happen? They're just going to, they're going to arrive and they're going to see like these nice light displays and these hashtag campaigns are launching and think, you know what? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I do need to respect, you know, this other person's right to blaspheme against my religion. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. This mayor, Christian Estrosi spoke of Islamofascism and said the suspect had repeated endlessly a La Huwakbar. God is greatest. And, you know, there are reports immediately when this attack happened that the suspect was saying a La Huwakbar, but at the same time, there are media outlets saying that the motive was unknown. It's like, pretty sure we know what the motive is. Two other attacks, BBC notes took place on Thursday, one in France and one in Saudi Arabia. A man was shot dead in Mont Favey, near the southern and French city of Avingneon after threatening police with a handgun. A guard was also attacked outside the French consulate in Jetta in Saudi Arabia as suspect was arrested and the guard taken to hospital. Speaking after visiting these president Macron said, if we are attacked once again, it is for the values which are ours, freedom for the possibility on our soil to believe freely and not given to the spirit of any terror. Yeah. So this is a very unfortunate thing that is happening in France right now. And if you are in France, you know, I think so many people around the world are praying for your safety, but I think it's also relevant to note and, you know, Macron didn't really mention anything that this was specifically an attack against Catholics, what happened in Nice. Yeah. And for me, I'm glad this is finally getting some attention because although that there hasn't been so many overt violent deaths to my knowledge, churches being attacked all across Europe is nothing new. Right. And I think that's really in France. In France, it's been, I think, the worst in Europe where you're having churches being burnt on a regular basis. Mm hmm. And I do want to point out to people who are listening, like, don't mistake Macron coming out like firmly in support of freedom of speech and again, Islamic expression as him siding with Christians or Catholics in any way. Because like his thing is like he is a French secularist, right? Yeah. And know that he only cares about, you know, protecting churches when it's Islamic extremism that is doing it. So that goes for Christians everywhere. Like a lot of these like progressive really, I don't want to call Macron progressive. I guess he is. But, you know, there are a lot of people who are coming down against Islamic extremism. A lot of them just hate religion in general. So I wouldn't necessarily, you know, call them an ally with a broad brushstroke. But yeah, anyway, so now that this is really kicked off, predictably, we also have a lot of people saying like, yeah, beheading people for drawing Muhammad is bad. But also let's talk about Islamophobia. Right. Let's let's talk about how Muslims are the real victims here. Specifically, we have this one tweet thread from the former prime minister of Malaysia who, I mean, we'll just read it. He says respect others. A teacher in France had his throat slit by an 18 year old Chechen boy. The killer was angered by the teacher showing a caricature of prophet Muhammad. The teacher intended to demonstrate freedom of expression. The killing is not an act that as a Muslim, I would approve. Okay. Good. See, this is the I know, just leave it there. The killing is not an act I would approve of full stop. That's that's the statement. But while I believe in freedom of expression, I do not think it includes insulting other people. What? That's what does that mean? You don't believe in the freedom of expression. Yeah, exactly. You cannot go up to a man in cursive simply because you believe in freedom of speech. But you can though you should you could say maybe you should not. But you can, right? In Malaysia, where there are people of many different races and religions, we have avoided serious conflicts between races because we are conscious of the need to be sensitive to the sensitivity of sensitivities of others. If we are not, then this country would never be peaceful and stable. Actually, as someone who is familiar with all of the attacks against like the ethnic Chinese in Malaysia, it's not really fair to say that they're living in perfect harmony. We often copy the ways of the West. We dress like them. We adopt their political systems, even some of their strange practices. But we have our own values different as between races and religions, which we need to sustain. I got no problem with that, by the way. Like most of this stuff, because this guy is going to say something that is completely egregious at the end of this tweet thread. But the reason why we put in this whole tweet thread is that some of the stuff he says is reasonable. And I don't have a problem with some of the things he's saying here. Yeah. He says, generally the West no longer adhere to their own religion. That is very true. They are Christians in name only. That's right. That is their right. But they must not show disrespect for the values of others for the religion of others is the measure of the level of their civilization to show this respect. Macron is not showing that he is civilized. He is very primitive in blaming the religion of Islam and Muslims for the killing of the insulting school teacher. Oh goodness, it is not in keeping with the teachings of Islam, but irrespective of the religion professed, angry people kill the French in the course of their history has killed millions of people, many were Muslims. So that's that whole mixed bag of things for sure. But what's most important is the 12th tweet in that Twitter thread. Twitter finally after some time decided to do consistent of hate speech. Yeah. Here it is right here. So this is no longer up, but he said, Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past. Yeah. So I thought it's good. It's good to include the context for what he was saying there, but even with the context, that is a statement that just is unequivocally disgusting. Yeah. Right. You know, I think that it's good to highlight these these statements because, you know, I think we have the tendency to not want to paint more people as extreme than are necessary, which is a very good thing. You know, and it applies very much so with the issue of religion. Like I know a lot of Muslim people, I studied Middle East and studies and Arabic when I was university have a lot of great Muslim friends. But the issue with Islamic extremism, it's not as fringe as I think some people would have you believe. So that we've had some apologetics from the like Islamic world and also there have been riots against the what's happening in France. No, all over the world. I also want to say that I agree with what he was saying in the sense that you shouldn't say these things. You should have the, like, you shouldn't be killed if you do say these things, of course, or even assaulted. But I think it's disrespectful to do these things. Showing the cartoon, I think in class is different, by the way. I don't think that's disrespectful. I mean, I don't think they'll like it, but it's to show that because it's meant to show what freedom of expression is, it's a different context entirely. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm of the belief where, like, again, I believe you should be able to show Muhammad absolutely without getting beheaded, you know, without kicking off like an international conflict or anything like that or without the threat of genocide. Malaysian and X prime minister, but at the same time as someone who does have religious beliefs and think that religious beliefs are very important, I would not out of respect for the Muslims that I do consider friends and loved ones. I would not drama. And I know that in response, there have been a lot of people saying we need to have a national drama, homie day. And I understand the sentiment behind that because you want to, like, give the middle finger to these people who are trying to control your speech. I still wouldn't do that, though, personally. Yeah. I, I'm on the fence here. I mean, I definitely think that if you're a Muslim and you particularly you immigrate or to France. Yeah. You accept, particularly when you you take your pledge as a citizen, you accept everything in that constitution and you accept that there's free speech. You do not have to live in France. And if you really are that abhorred by this French practice of free speech, then no go there. Do not go there. Yeah. That's all. You know, they might do something like that that is insulting. It isn't salting to you unequivocally. I'll say that it's insulting. Yeah. But if you behave in a violent way in return, particularly beheading somebody, including a 70 year old woman in a church, you're an animal. Right. Right. So you have no high ground to stand on for sure. Now moving on to how I guess Pope Francis, I was going to say Catholics, but I think a lot of people who are Catholic would say that Pope Francis no longer represents their views. Don't put me on the spotlight. Yeah. Anyway, so his response to this attack was he said, I am close to the Catholic community of Nice morning, the attack that's so death in a place of prayer and consolation. I pray for the victims for their families and for the beloved French people that they may respond to evil with good. Now, I think overall, this is a very lukewarm sentiment. You know, your Catholics were attacked specifically for their faith. I would want the pope to come out stronger in defense of the Catholic state. And just retake Constantinople. Yes. But no, this is just kind of it's like a wishy washy thing. And it's, it's not as disappointing though as what he had said in the 2015 aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. So we're going to read this. Keep in mind this was, this is five years old, but I do think it speaks to what the Pope's view of this whole issue is says speaking to journalists flying with him to Philippines, Pope Francis said last week's attacks were an aberration and such horrific violence in God's name could not be justified. Okay. I like that a lot. Yes. He staunchly defended freedom of expression, but, but then he said there were limits, especially when people mocked religion. If my good friend, Dr. Gaspari, who organizes the pope's trips speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched. He said throwing a pretend punch at the doctor who was standing beside him. No, no, that's not what you're a pope. You're supposed to be like a spokesperson for Catholicism. That is a weird one from a pope. Yeah. Punch somebody that's, you can expect to get a joke, but there's like a, there actually is an undertone of a threat there. Yeah. He says you cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others. There is a limit. There's a difference between saying like you, you, you shouldn't versus you cannot. Right. Exactly. You could say it's a sin to do it. Yeah. And, you know, maybe we could get on board with that, but the whole like you see how backwards it is just by his new tweet where he says, you know, you shouldn't punish evil with, with evil. Yeah. You should like hopefully they respond with good, but obviously if you were saying, I'm going to punch you if you insult my mother. Then you believe you should respond with evil. Exactly. It just doesn't make sense. Yeah. I mean, it's, I would be kind of frustrated if I were a Catholic seeing that like, you know, the figurehead leader of the religion should be coming out stronger in defense of the practitioners. Right. I mean, just because your Christian doesn't mean you submit yourself to without, you know, any, any pushback get beheaded. That's not, that's not what it's about. Um, and also we have, of course, the mainstream media, New York Times here kind of playing the, oh, but how does this affect Muslims card? This article says French officials have vowed to crack down on what the hard line interior minister, Joral Dermain Darmanin has called the enemy within closing a mosque, proposing to ban several Muslim groups. The government considers extremists and even suggesting the elimination of ethnic food aisles in stores. All right. I don't know how much use that last one is going to be, but Mr. Macrom. I thought that was the point of immigration. Yeah. To have the food, especially if you're somewhere like England where it's like the native food is not a question. Yeah. So Mr. Macrom who became, who began a campaign earlier this month against Islamic separatism from France's deeply held secular values. Note here, they're saying secular values, not Christian values, secular values said recently that Muslims need to develop an Islam of enlightenment, which many considered patronizing. While these statements and others from French officials have in date have engendered a backlash in some Muslim countries, they have mostly caused bewilderment among France's nearly six million Muslims, almost all of whom condemn violence, but fear they are all being labeled terrorists. I mean, maybe this is just kind of my perspective, but I didn't see that many Muslims condemning the violence without also using it as a way to say, but also don't draw Muhammad, which I feel kind of like lessons because I mean, it does feel like victim blaming, right? It's like guys, rape is wrong. But that's short, that skirt. I mean, it was very revealing. You have to admit, right? You know, like you don't don't do that. I actually here in Canada, there was one is Islamic. I don't remember what they're called a teacher. Uh, and mom, I saw a video of this as two minutes long where he basically, he actually sides with with the attacker in this case, saying what a violent disgusting person, the teacher was in this case who was teaching that free speech lesson. Um, and, and seemed to be pretty much on board with what was happening. Yeah. Shocking. The article in the news after this attack, five or six million people have to justify themselves. Mr. Bella Bass said, but we just don't know what is expected of us. I mean, don't, don't try to, I don't know, become an apologetic for a like a blasphemy beheading, I guess. Yeah. You guys should be a red and these people out of your community. Yeah. So she'll be happening. You condemning them, taking a strong stand against extremists, standing with your fellow French citizens for the, if they do not represent your views, know that these people have extremely violent views that are antithetical to French views, you need to take action against them. They're not your allies. Yeah. Nazihah Mayufi, a member of LES Musul Ma, an association of Muslim groups and mosques said she felt dread and infinite sadness for the families of the victims for our Catholic friends. Okay. Perfect. Continues though, but see, it's always that, but, but she said that after the attack on Thursday, she feared politicians and commentators would feel even more entitled to label Islam and enemy from within as Muslims. She said we pay the damages of those two forms of extremism. Yeah. So I mean, best of luck to France going forward, but I just don't think that the people in charge are really actually ready to tackle the root of the issue. Right? I mean, you see this, like you can try to virtue signal for free speech all you want, but as long as you continue to import people who at their core oppose free speech, things aren't going to get better."
