That's because there is no crime at all. This is not about prosecuting a crime. It's about punishing a political dissident. We'll talk about that today. Also, the people of Chicago threw Lori Lightfoot out and have now chosen to replace her with someone who is even worse in every way. Plus, I had an interesting exchange with a trans ENT during the Q&A portion of my speech in New Mexico last night. We'll play the clip for it. You don't want to miss that. And new polling shows that 60% of Americans agree that Trump should have been indicted, even though none of them knew what he was being indicted for. In our daily cancellation, a new law in Canada would make it a crime to protest drag queen events involving children. I have a lot to say about that, as you can imagine, and much more today on The Matt Wall Show. Biden's plans to help struggling business owners in the wake of COVID lockdowns were to prioritize Black, Latino, Native American, and women-owned businesses.

Finally official yesterday in one of the most disgraceful and alarming scenes in the history of American politics, former president and current GOP primary front-runner Donald Trump was arrested and arraigned on 34 felony counts in New York. No president has ever been charged with a crime. And that's certainly not because no president has ever committed a crime in the past. Indeed, crime and corruption have been the norm in DC and among our political elites. And yet very few of them and nobody at Trump's level, the presidential level, have ever been made to answer for it, except Donald Trump. Now, as I've said before, the treatment of Donald Trump wouldn't be nearly so disturbing to me personally. If we lived in an alternate universe where politicians are so despised and so scrutinized that we always look for any excuse to charge them with crimes. I mean, imagine a bizarre world version in the United States where former presidents are constantly getting handcuffed and tossed behind bars where that's like the going away president, a president for a president is that we end up arresting you for something. And high-ranking politicians are made to live in constant fear that maybe they crossed the line somewhere and they're going to be prosecuted. That sort of world, that sort of country, I think would be very good and I would enjoy it. But that's not the country we live in. In our reality, the political elites are effectively above the law. They're so above the law. In fact, that's just as one example, a global sex trafficking pedophile can be arrested and then can quote, unquote commit suicide, big air quotes around that. In prison, leaving behind a detailed ledger of every prominent figure and politician he ever sold an underage prostitute to and none of them are ever charged with a single crime. In fact, the names of the people in the ledger are never released to the public. There is no accountability at all. That is how firmly above the law these people are, except Donald Trump. In his case, they've spent years and years pouring through his personal life, rifling through every document they can find, checking his financial records, scrutinizing every jot and tittle until they found something to charge him with. But the only problem is that they actually didn't find anything to charge him with. There's actually nothing there. It turns out that Donald Trump is perhaps the least corrupt politician in American history. And we know that because he's one of the only ones that the system has tried to find something, I was tried to destroy, and they haven't been able to do it. It was clear from the time that the indictment was announced that the Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, had nothing on Donald Trump. He was firing blanks the whole time. Yet the indictment itself remained sealed. And up until yesterday, which left open the theoretical possibility, a possibility that the media clung on to with desperate hope, that maybe there would be some major bombshell, some big surprise that Bragg hadn't yet revealed publicly. Maybe he was only pretending that this was a criminal case centering around Trump paying off some porn star so that she wouldn't go blabbing publicly about an affair during a presidential election, which definitely is not a crime. And maybe in reality, buried in the indictment would be the revelation that Trump also killed someone. Maybe he really did shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue. Maybe that was a confession. Maybe he organized a bank heist or something. Who knows? That was the hope that the left tried to cling to. But all hopes were dashed yesterday as Trump was arraigned and the indictment was finally unsealed and the truth was revealed. This case really is as frivolous and insane as we all suspected and as we all knew they have nothing on Trump. They have no crime. Now, I'm not a lawyer. I admit. I'm not a legal expert, but based on my limited legal understanding, I'm pretty sure that the whole point of an indictment is to lay out a formal accusation of a crime. That's what that's what indictment is. It's to outline and describe the crimes that were allegedly committed. But this indictment, this historic indictment of a former president leaves out that part. It is an indictment that forgets to actually indict. The document does not explain what the underlying crime actually is. And to top it off, the statute of limitations has already passed. And to top that off, Bragg is apparently trying to prosecute a violation of federal law. Though again, we don't really know which law. But even if a federal law was violated, Bragg, as the DA of Manhattan, likely has no jurisdiction to enforce it in the first place. So there is no crime. But if there was a crime, he can't even prosecute it. That would fall to federal prosecutors, but they already passed on this case because they couldn't find a crime to prosecute either. Now you may ask, if there's no underlying crime, how does this indictment have 34 counts? How can Trump be indicted on 34 counts of nothing? Andrew McCarthy, the National Review, explains in a piece that was just published. I'll read a little bit of it. It says Bragg's indictment fails to state a crime, not once, but 34 times. On that ground alone, the case should be dismissed. Before one ever gets to the fact that the statute of limitations has elapsed and Bragg has no jurisdiction to enforce federal law if that's what he's trying to do, which remains murky. Bragg's indictment charges 34 counts, just as we said it would, based on media reporting that clearly came from illegal leaks of grand jury information, a crime, you can be sure that goes in the overflowing bucket of serious offenses that Bragg refuses to prosecute. The 34 counts are arrived at by taking what is a single course of conduct and absurdly slicing it into parts, each one of which is charged as a separate felony carrying its own potential four year prison term. Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen in monthly installments during 2017 for the $130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels right before the 2016 election for her silence about alleged affair. That in reality is a single transaction, Trump paying back a debt to Cohen. Yet, because Trump paid in installments and each installment includes an invoice from Cohen, a bookkeeping entry by the Trump Organization and a payment to Cohen by check, Bragg not only charges each monthly installment separately, he subdivides the installments into installments as if the invoice book entry and check were independent criminal events. Voila, one transaction becomes 34 felons. Okay, this is not even weak sauce. There's no sauce here. This is also, you know, if a prosecutor is confident that there's a crime here and he's got a slam dug case, he's not going to feel that he needs to, you know, take one crime and separate it into 34 chunks. That's the kind of thing you do when you know you don't have anything. And so you're throwing everything at the wall that you possibly can. There's not anything here but a dumb, pudgy, self-promoting district attorney who will tear the country apart just to make a name for himself. And on that score, he's already succeeded. He is certainly nationally recognized now, except that he's recognized as a national disgrace. I mean, this case is such a joke that you can even turn on CNN to hear detailed criticisms of it. So just as one example, here's John Bolton, not a Trump fan to put it mildly, on a CNN panel explaining why the indictment distresses him. Listen, big picture. What do you think of the indictment? Well, speaking as someone who very strongly does not want Donald Trump to get the Republican presidential nomination, I'm extraordinarily distressed by this document. I think this is even weaker than I feared it would be. And I think it's easily subject to being dismissed or a quick acquittal for Trump. Just speaking, going back to the days when I represented Jim Buckley and Gene McCarthy and the constitutional challenge to the underlying federal statute here passed in 1974, I can say there is no basis in the statutory language to say that Trump's behavior forms either a contribution or an expenditure under federal law. The two key definitions at issue here. If it did, it would mean that every single expenditure a candidate made could be taken to have something to do with his campaign to a $1 comb to comb my hair or $10 comb to comb my hair. If you can construe the statute to cover this behavior, then I think it violates the First Amendment because you're deeply into territory that makes this statute absolutely federal statute to vague for enforcement. And as what I understood the district attorney to say that he thinks there's a New York election law involved here. All I can say is the federal election campaign act absolutely preamps any state or local law to the contrary. How could it be otherwise? You've got one law governing corporate finance and a presidential election at the federal level. You're going to have 50 state laws interfering with it. So he's just wrong on the applicability of the New York statute. He thinks there's a New York election law that he can use to prosecute Trump. Even by the most generous possible reading here, Bragg is searching for a law that Trump might have broken. He thinks there might be one. He's still not sure, but he arrested the former president anyway. That's the best possible interpretation and it's far too generous because in truth Bragg knows that there's nothing here which is why he couldn't explain the crime in the press conference that he held after the arraignment. Listen to this. Why did Donald Trump repeatedly make these false statements? The evidence will show that he did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election. Donald Trump, executives at the publishing company American Media Incorporated, Mr. Cohen and others, agreed in 2015 to a catch and kill scheme. That is a scheme to buy and suppress negative information to help Mr. Trump's chance of winning the election. As part of this scheme, Donald Trump and others made three payments to people who claimed to have negative information about Mr. Trump. To make these payments, they set up shell companies and they made yet more false statements. Oh, dear God. I mean, never mind. I take it all back. Forget everything I said before. You mean to tell me that Trump trying to suppress negative information about himself during a political campaign? You mean that as part of his efforts to get elected to public office, he tried to prevent embarrassing things from being publicized about him? I mean, well, surely he's the first political candidate in the history of the country to ever do something like that. I mean, it's not like literally every political campaign in the entire history of politics has also made efforts to suppress negative information. It's not like that's like an essential part of campaigning. That's part of what campaigning is. No, certainly not. Trump is the first to ever do it that much we can agree on. But still, what is the crime? Is that a catch and kill scheme to buy negative stories, purchase the rights to negative stories, negative information, and then kill it? Is that is there a crime? What's the crime there? Is there a legal statute somewhere that says you can't do that? Is it a crime to try and win an election? Let's say actual crime. Well, Bragg never explained, but he did say this. Listen. Thirty four false statements made to cover up other crimes. These are felony crimes in New York state, no matter who you are. We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct. The defendant repeatedly made false statements on New York business records. He also caused others to make false statements. Well, that's exactly the crux of it because it says, well, he's covering up an underlying crime. But what is the underlying crime? What is he covering up? And somehow that has still not been explained. Okay. So Trump has been arrested and charged with doing something to cover up some underlying crime. And no one has explained what that crime is. But Bragg says we're not going to normalize criminal conduct. Well, but that's exactly what Alvin Bragg wants to do. What is his entire mission? And it's the mission of every Soros goblin DA. There is no better way to summarize their strategy than that. They want to normalize crime and they've succeeded. Crime has risen sharply since Bragg took office and was already on the rise before he took office. So it's even worse than it was bad before. Now it's worse than that. Bragg is doing everything in his power to make sure that violent predators are released back out into the community as quickly as possible and with light as light punishment as possible so that he can spend all his energy trying to punish an innocent man. He is very much making crime normal. That's exactly what these people want to do. In fact, as we've talked about recently, they will tell you directly that this is a normal part of living in the city. What was it that Seth Rogen said? Getting carjacked. It's that's just big city life. It's normal. This is the way the system works now. We live under a regime that will punish the innocent harsher than the guilty because the guilty, the actual criminals are not a threat to the system. Far from it. Violent criminals are useful to the system because they terrorize and demoralize the citizenry and they break their spirits and render them bewildered and vulnerable just as the elites want and need them to be. Besides, violent criminals mostly kill and rob middle and lower class people whose lives have no value to the elites. Criminals are going after random commuters on the subway. They're going after people that work in gas stations and convenience stores. Well, Albin Bragg doesn't care about them. The political elites don't care about them. But Trump committed the real crime by offending and defying the elites themselves and that's why they want to take them down. I said earlier that trying to win an election isn't a crime, but actually it is as far as they're concerned. That in fact is the crime he's being indicted for. That he tried to win an election and he won it. If you're not on their team and you try to gain political power, you have committed the ultimate crime of defying them. And that is actually what they want to make Trump pay for. Now let's get to our five headlines. Pure Talk is the antidote to woke wireless companies. It's proudly veteran owned, employs a US based customer service team and absolutely refuses to spend money on fake news networks. Here's a look at what a future without Pure Talk would look like for you. For those of you who can't see what's playing out on the screen right now, I am currently texting with my producer Sean on a phone that's serviced by one of the big three wireless networks. Sean says, have you seen the post about the left trying to cancel you again? Which I reply in this very real conversation, you're always trying to silence me. It's never going to work. That's the kind of things I would say in a text message, you know, in real life. I would text that to someone. When are people going to accept that men are men and women are women?

We begin with the Chicago mayoral race where Brandon Johnson defeated Paul Valis and became the next mayor of Chicago. The lower light foot got the boot. Now, there were no conservative Republicans who had any chance of becoming the mayor of Chicago, obviously. That wasn't in the cards, but Paul Valis was a relatively moderate Democrat. But by current day standards, a moderate Democrat, which to be a moderate Democrat still means that you're far left. So, he's still, he's the guy that the residents of Chicago would have chosen if they had learned any lessons at all from Lori Lightfoot's disastrous tenure. So, he would have been an improvement over her anyway. And that would show that the people in Chicago, a little bit slow in the uptake, but they're finally starting to learn a few things. Turns out though, they learned no lessons at all or they learned all the wrong ones because instead, they went with a far left radical lunatic, somebody to the left of Lori Lightfoot. So, take all the bad things about Lori Lightfoot, who they kicked out, they don't want her. All the bad things about her, this guy is worse than that. So, he takes all those bad things and makes them worse. This is someone Brandon Johnson who's called for defunding the police, someone who defended the BLM looters, someone who ran an explicitly racialized anti-white campaign. So, to show you what I mean, here's an article in the Guardian from just a few days ago before the election. This is what it says. Brandon Johnson, who now serves as a Cook County commissioner, has joked in the past that he didn't become a pastor like his father or sister because they weren't unionized. But it's clear that his family's work in the church has shaped his commanding presence in secular spaces as it did on the day that they were profiling Johnson. Good job, Johnson now. This is about black labor versus white wealth. That's what this battle is about, Johnson said. This is about providing communities access to the very public accommodations, which black people fought for, especially after emancipation. It's what the descendants of slaves in this room are fighting for, public education, public transportation, affordable housing, health care, and access to jobs. So, he framed his campaign as a battle, a battle between black and white, and he won. Okay? So, if you're a white person in Chicago and you choose to still live there, well, that's on you. The guy elected said, this is a battle of black versus white, and the voters lined up to vote for. In fact, it's on everyone in Chicago if you choose to still live there. Because here's the thing, the people of the city, the absolute self-destructive morons who live in Chicago, they chose to elect someone who is worse than the mayor that they threw out. They are choosing to live then amid crime and violence and chaos and tyranny. This is what they want. They want racial division, violence, crime, and filth. That's what they want to live in. They want it. What else can we do except just let them have it and feel no sympathy for them? This is what you want. You can have it. All the hand-ringing that a lot of us do about the violence in Chicago, we should, you know, and oftentimes we accuse the media of ignoring the violence in Chicago, and they do. But we should just ignore it too now because that's your problem. You want this. You are literally asking for it. I mean, the very people who are, many of them, victimized by the violence in Chicago, they're lining up to vote for people who promise more of it, who want less law enforcement, who want less law and order, and they are saying it. And then these, these idiots are lining up and voting for that. This is what you want. I mean, at a certain point, we can't save people. We can't save them from themselves. And this is the hardest thing to, this is one of the hardest realities, you know, to accept really in modern political life. It's that the problems start with the voters. Okay. So we can talk about the corrupt elites and the Soros, DA's and all that stuff. Because I just did. We do all the time on this show. But it's also true that we still do live under a democratic system, which means that, you know, this guy is the mayor of Chicago because people voted for him. If they had, if they had overwhelmingly, if they had really overwhelmingly rejected everything this guy stands for, he wouldn't be the mayor of Chicago right now. People are getting what they ask for. There's something deeply wrong with many of the voters, many of the people who are voting for this stuff. And it's at a point, it's been a point for a long time where there's nothing for us to do except say you can have it. And so yeah, if you're a sane person, if you're a person in Chicago and you value your own life and you care about your children and all of that, then you just got to get out, give up on it. Let it, let it fall apart. I think that's our only path now. All right. I spoke at New Mexico State University yesterday. It was actually a great event. A lot of fun, I thought. And for the first time in a long time, I was directly challenged in the Q and A by, by several people, including several trans people. So this happens every once in a while, somebody will get up during the Q and A and they'll try to challenge me on this issue. But this is the first time in a while where most of the Q and A consisted of people on the other side stepping up one after another to try to debunk my points or challenge me. And which I think is great. It makes it a lot more fun. And this is also, this is mainly what the Q and A is supposed to be for. That's why we have the policy and the Q and A's at these college events where if you disagree, you get to go to the front of the line. Because that's, I mean, it's great to hear from people who are supporters and they agree and they can ask really interesting questions. But very often then I'm just in the spot of restating a lot of things I already said in the talk. It's more interesting to hear from people on the side. So that happened here. And I appreciated that. It's worth going to YAF's YouTube page to watch the whole event. And I think, but I want to play one clip. It's kind of lost by five minutes. But it's interesting because this is a trans person, one of a few that got it during the Q and A. Who begins by presenting his credentials as an EMT. So he says he's a medical professional. He's trans. So he's an authority on this, whereas I am not, he says. And the back and forth went on for long enough. I probably went on for about 10 minutes. But we'll pick this up about halfway through. Listen. How would you define a woman? Because you've asked other people up here to define how we would define a woman. How would you define a woman, Mr. Walsh? An adult human female. And how don't trans people, how doesn't a transgender woman fit that definition? Female. Because they're not female. They have, they have, you said that you are a biological male, correct? I said I'm transgender. I might be intersex for all we know about almost as many people in the world are transgender as intersex. And well, a lot of people don't know. Well, but that's a different conversation. Intersex, that's a genetic anomaly, that's a medical condition. So that's a completely different conversation. That's also not a, that's not a third gender. That's just a, that's a genetic anomaly that occurs within the sex binary of male and female. So what you're saying is that a quote unquote trans woman is a female. By the definitions I'm familiar with, yes. So how would you define female? Through my training in healthcare, there are several different categories. For how we define sex. People bring up chromosomes. People also bring up hormone levels. People bring up all sorts of other categories. Lots of people don't fit neatly into a gender binary. Even people we don't consider to be intersex. It's a complicated spectrum. It's not complicated, but you also didn't, you also didn't define. So what is, what is a woman? What does a female? What do these words mean? It's complicated and I know you're not going to like that answer, but that's because there are no simple answers in human biology. Let me ask you a question. You guys, well hang on, just let me finish. You guys like to bring up high school level biology classes a lot. I get that a lot, but people who go on to more complicated biology classes will talk about sex as a spectrum. It's not. It's not. Well, biological researchers would disagree with you. Well, and they're full of the ones that would say that. There's, there are, there are male gametes and female gametes. I had one last question. I said one quick, can we, can you come back for one second? Because this is an important question. You said you're an EMT. Yes. Okay, if you're responding, you're responding to a health emergency. A health emergency. Biological male. Somebody with a penis is, is having a medical emergency. And they say to you, I think I'm having a miscarriage. Would you, would you check them to see if they're having a biscuit? Would you consider that a possibility for them? Look. No, but that's because some people don't have body parts. Doesn't mean they're not a woman. Okay. Sounds like we've established there are some people who in principle can get pregnant. And there are some people who can't. So there's two categories, otherwise known as binary. Lots of women can't get pregnant either. Yeah, but they're still of the nature to get pregnant. The only reason. But they can't get pregnant. Yes, but the truth matters, right? It does. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. Truth matters and they can't get pregnant. That's the truth. So how are they still women? Because they are. For the, for the same reason, for the, for the same reason that I, that I can rightly say that human beings have two legs. And if a person is born with only one leg, that doesn't call into question the statement that human beings have two legs. Okay. A person being born with one leg doesn't mean that now legs are on a spectrum. And we can't say, we can't say anything at all about how many legs a person has. Who knows? They could, they could be a centipede. You know, they could have a, they could have a hundred legs. No, we know human beings have two legs. If a human is born without two legs, something went wrong. They were supposed to have that second leg. Something went wrong. If you, if you, if you meet a person on the street only has one leg, maybe, maybe they had an accident. Maybe they were in war. Maybe, maybe something, you know, maybe they were in a car accident. Maybe they had cancer. A leg was cut off. But you know that something went wrong because of that by their nature, they're supposed to have two legs. Same thing for a woman. A woman by her nature can get pregnant. A man by his nature never can. So if you meet a woman of childbearing age, say she's 28 years old and she can't get pregnant, you know automatically that something has gone wrong. And she can go to the doctor and find out what that thing is, even if they can't fix it. So that proves that women by their nature can get pregnant because the simple fact that she can't shows you that there is something wrong. This is what is known as the exception that proves the rule. Whereas if a male with a penis can't get pregnant, no doctor on earth is going to run tests to see what's wrong with it. Because they already know it studies a male and there's only male and female of those who get pregnant and those who can't. So, that's it. There it is. It turns out now, when you can be stumped on a rebuttal like this or a question like this, you know, a man, somebody with a penis says I'm having a miscarriage. Would you take that claim seriously? Would you actually run tests to see if that was really happening? And you could tell that this was somehow for this person, this is something that he never really thought about. But he realized he had to admit, well, of course I wouldn't. Because there are two categories of people. There are people who can get pregnant and there are people who can't. There are people who, as I tried explain, there are people who buy their nature, can get pregnant, people who buy their nature cannot. Those are the two categories. And you could call those categories whatever you want. You know, we say man and woman in the English language. In other languages, they use other words. So, the actual words themselves are, words are simply symbols that stand for something. They're verbal symbols. And so, it's true that the verbal symbols can change. They change over time, they change depending on your language. But the reality that they are symbolizing, the reality they represent, that doesn't change. There are people who get pregnant, people who can't. You know, as I was trying to explain there, the way, the way I phrase it is, you know, women buy their nature can get pregnant. And I think that that's a technically, scientifically, you know, a precise way of putting it. Maybe another way to put it, maybe we say buy their nature. Maybe for some people, it goes a little bit over their head. It seemed to a bit with the person I was talking to there. So, another way of putting it is a woman is someone who is supposed to be able to get pregnant. A woman is someone who's supposed to be able to get pregnant. A man is someone who is not supposed to be able to get pregnant and can't. A woman is supposed to be able to get pregnant, a man never can. So, those are the two things. And then that means that the comeback of what about women who can't get pregnant, yeah, but they're supposed to be able to, even if they can't, they're supposed to be able to. Which is why, as I explained there, a woman in childbearing, you know, in a childbearing age, they, a 28 year old woman can't get pregnant, goes to the doctor, says I'm not able to get pregnant. The doctor is never going to say, well, you're not supposed to be able to get pregnant. You know, you just belong to a different category, a person who doesn't get pregnant, so whatever, not going to run any tests at all. No, the doctor is going to know, okay, well, that's not how that's supposed to work. You're a woman, so you should be able to get pregnant. Let's figure out what's going on. And they will always find it. You know, that's the incredible thing. The doctor will know just based on the fact that this is a woman, childbearing age can't get pregnant. He will automatically know there's some kind of medical problem happening here. And they will be able to find it. Whether they can correct it or not, they can find it there. Two categories. That's what we call a binary. All right. The Daily Wire has this report, a new CNN poll found that more than half of all Americans approve of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Paul. The Democratic decision to indict former President Donald Trump. Despite the fact that no one surveyed knew the contents of the still sealed indictment when they answered questions about it. CNN anchor Jake Tapper broke down some of the results of the poll, which was taken between March 31st and April 1st. It showed that an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 94%, were in favor of the indictment. Majority of independents also supported it, 62%, followed by just 21% of Republicans. Overall, nearly two thirds, 60% of those surveyed said that they supported the decision to indict Trump. But as critics quickly pointed out, neither those asking the questions nor those answering it had any idea what specific crimes the former President was actually being charged with. And yet they answered it anyway. So 60% overall, so they support the indictment, 62% of independents. You know, I think that 21% of Republicans is the biggest concern for Donald Trump anyway. Maybe not in the primaries, but in the general election. And we know that they said they support the indictment without knowing what the indictment is. And now the indictment's been unsealed. We still don't know what the indictment is. We still don't know what the underlying crime is, except that it doesn't exist. We know that. All that means, obviously, is that 60% who were polled don't like Trump. That's all. Like every poll having to do with Donald Trump. But so do you support this thing that's happening to Trump or do you support this thing that Trump said or did? The details don't matter. Every poll is really just, do you like Trump or not? Because that's how people are going to interpret it. And they're going to answer along those lines. That's all. And so it shows the problem that Trump will face in the general election. And I'm struggling to see how it's not an insurmountable problem for him. That everything is baked in. Who can be persuaded at this point? Is there anyone left of all, you know, all the potential voters in America in a general election? Is there anyone left who's actually on the fence about Donald Trump? Now, I totally believe that there are people who can be swayed either way in the primary. There are tons of people. I talk to people all the time. We're going to like, I like to say this. I also like some of what Trump did. I think he should get a second shot. I don't know. So they're on the fence about it. There's also been because of what's happening to Trump now. There's been this rallying around him. His numbers are going up, which is very predictable. That makes a lot of sense in the Republican primary. But these are all people who they're going to vote for the Republican anyway in the general. In the general election. In that context, who can be persuaded? Like, is there anyone who in a theoretical general election between, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump? Is there anyone right now who's on the fence? I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I still got to hear these guys out. I got to hear Trump out some more. I might vote for him. I don't know. But I might vote for Biden. It doesn't exist. That's a category that doesn't exist. It's all baked in. There's no one left to persuade. And I don't know how you get over that. I don't know. No one has shown me how the math works. How does Trump in a general election, how does he win? What's the path to victory? I'd be very interested to hear someone explain that. And I haven't seen anyone explain. And for me, in the primaries, Ron DeSantis hasn't even jumped in yet. So maybe, I think 90% chance he will, but maybe he won't. Assuming he does. And I could talk about the reason I like DeSantis. It's his policies, things that he's done as governor. That for me is why I like him. But I really could put all that to the side. Because in the primary, I am a single issue voter. And I think that we all should be in the primary, a single issue voter. And the single issue that matters in the primary is who can win in the general. That's it. That's the only thing that matters. Because all the rest of it is irrelevant if the person can't actually win the presidency. Only thing that matters is who can win. Now, I don't have a question. I don't have a question. I don't have a question. I can't say anything that matters is who can win. Now, I don't have a crystal ball. I can't say it to the future. But that's what I'm saying is that's how we need to think about this. So when you're weighing the candidates, you know, looking at policies, you're looking at personality, looking at all those things. But really you put that to the side. Now you're running the math in your head. You're thinking most plausible scenario, who's more likely to win in the general. And that's how we have to make our decisions. Again, from the D.L.Y. representatives for the Bud Light brand owned by an has her Bush, confirmed a brand partnership with Trans Identifying Activist Dylan Mulvaney. After followers speculated the whole thing could be an April Fool's Day prank. Now, if you, by the way, if you were one of those people, we talked, you know, a couple days ago about Bud Light sponsoring Dylan Mulvaney congratulating him on his day 365 of womanhood. Oh, no, sorry, girlhood, because again, this is a grown adult man who was very specifically pretending to be an under age adolescent girl. So congratulating him on three of day 365 of quote, unquote girlhood. We talked about that and I saw even in the comments there are people speculating that, well, no, this can't be real. This is this is an April Fool's prank. This came out around April Fool's. It must be a big prank from Dylan Mulvaney. I don't. Okay. This is this is still the kind of coping that we have to put to the side now. We have to get past this. But if you're still in a position, if you still are like, it's hard for you to believe that Bud Light's would sponsor Dylan Mulvaney. That just shows me that you really haven't been paying attention and you need to clue into reality. There is there's nothing unbelievable about it at all. And he's a lot of the same people who still insist that maybe this whole Dylan Mulvaney thing is all one big prank by him. He's like, he's Andy Kaufman. It's a performance performance artist is all one big troll. I mean, this can't actually be serious. No, it is serious. Now, it's not he's not actually a woman, obviously. But he is seriously trying to identify as one. He wants to be taken seriously as a woman. It's not a prank. It's not anything like that. And yes, we live in an occult in a culture where the major brands are going to line up and they're going to fall prostrate to the ground and worship at the feet of somebody like Dylan Mulvaney. That's where we live. A spokesperson for the company told Fox News and has our Bush works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of the many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics and passion points. From time to time, we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and it's not for sale to the general public. So yes, this was a real sponsorship as we should have always assumed. Both any is partnered with multiple national brands for advertising campaigns on social media, including KitchenAid, Kine snacks, wedding dress brand ASOS, Mac cosmetics and others. This guy has he really has dozens of corporate sponsorships. Because again, that's the kind of culture we live in. We should probably clue into it by now. And we need to decide like when are we as conservatives actually going to make a concerted and real effort to do something about this that we complain about it. We complain about the fact that all these corporate brands are spitting in our face all the time. And they're like going out of their way to alienate their own customer base. And then some more cope. We say, Oh, go, go, go, broke. No. I wish it was that way. Okay. I wish it was that way where a company goes, welcome, then they go broke. That's not how it works, actually. In fact, they go, woken, they continue making billions of dollars. That's how we're go, woken, make billions of dollars. We have the power. We have the ability to make some of these companies go broke. We could do that, but we don't. That's what makes it frustrating. Okay. There is strength in numbers, especially in a marketplace. It's true that every major corporation is woke. They all are, right? And so we can't realistically boycott all of them. And if we did that, then you wouldn't even be able to watch this show right now because the phone you're using or the laptop you're using. The bidon is made by a Woke company. You bought it from a Woke company. You're using a Woke company's, you know, Internet service provider. You know, so we boycott all of them. And we basically can't live in the modern world. And we also have no way to even organize any kind of boycott like that because all of the mechanisms that we use to organize them are also owned by the Woke. So yeah, we can't boycott all of them. That's true. But we can pick some of them. Okay. This is something that we talked about this in the backstage episode on Monday. Something that the left is they're very good at doing this. Where they, they pick someone, they pick a victim and they make an example of them. Okay, they pick somebody out. Whether it's an individual or a company that has offended them has crossed to them. And they say, we're going to take you down. We're going to destroy you. Okay. You have become our personal project. Not because you're the worst as far as we're concerned, but, but just because you're the one you're the one we've chosen. And the left will do that and they'll stay on it until they care this, this victim down. Now on the right, we could do the same kind of thing. And the only difference is that we're choosing people and companies that actually deserve it. And we'd be wielding this power for good. So yeah, we can't make all the woke companies go broke, not, not even close to it. But we could choose one company that does something outrageous to alienate and spit in the faces of their own customer base. And we could say, okay, we've chosen you and we're going to bankrupt you. Because in reality, there are millions and millions of us. And you do need us to buy your product. And if we don't, you're going to suffer. Okay. And you got mass layoffs in your future and all the rest of it. We could do that, but it takes, it takes organization. It takes follow through. It takes a certain sense of kind of ruthlessness. Because yeah, if you do that, you take a company down, you, you, you, you, you, you affect their bottom line to that. You know, people that work for the company that aren't evil people, they just have jobs and they're going to lose their jobs. And that's, you don't want to see that. It's unfortunate. But these are, these are necessary casualties. So we have to have the willingness, the willingness, we have to have the ruthlessness, we have to have the organization, the attention span and the follow through. And on the right, we have none of that. Easily distracted. We move from one thing to the next. And anytime any one of us tries to say, let's focus on this issue. Let's focus on this institution. Let's focus on this thing right here and try to make something happen. You're then going to have, you know, 50,000 people who are also on the right come on and say, well, why then? This is, this is right. Yeah, sure. You'll do that. But then these people over here are just as bad. So what's the point of even trying? We allow ourselves to get distracted by these losers who have no interest in winning, don't know how to win. And we've got to stop doing that. All right, let's get to the comment section. Who makes Twitter mob fly off the handle with rage? Who's the blame? It's a sweet baby gang. Can Jourisou says, you missed the part where after the man was accosted, some woman screamed, get him, kill him. We're at war, whether you're admitted or not. Yeah, I actually did miss that. We played the video on a show on Monday of Chris Elston, known as Billboard, Chris on Twitter and his activism. He was he was at one of these trans rallies wearing a sign of wearing a billboard that said children can't consent to puberty blockers because they can't. And he was physically assaulted by a man identifying as a woman. And yeah, there were people. It wasn't just the one trans guy. It was there's people in the crowd. Of course, we're cheering it on. You know, get him, kill him. And, and they really mean it. They do. Okay, they, they, they actually do want us dead. Another tough reality that has to sink in at a certain point. But as far as they're concerned, as you point out, as far as they're concerned, they're at war with us. Have been for a long time. Question is, is it going to be a one sided. Guthrie says, this is actually a great point. You want reparations for slavery, but if it wasn't for slavery, you wouldn't be here in the first place and you're absolutely better off being here than any more remotely near the African continent. You can guarantee the colonialism or not. Africa would still not be a nice and prosperous place to be. In fact, just like India, Africa's probably better off for having been touched by Europe in some way. Yeah, that's, that's, I think it's actually worth, I played, I think it's about two minutes of the clip from Dinesh D'Souza back in what was a 2002. Well, on NPR, I still can't quite get over that fact. On NPR, 22 years ago, 21 years ago, you can make this kind of point defending. Well, no, talking about the benefits of colonialism, making arguments against reparations, saying things like the descendants of slaves are better off being here. That was Dinesh D'Souza laying that out on NPR. Only a couple of decades ago, that was the kind of thing that you could say on NPR. But it's worth going. If you can Google that, you can listen to his entire, his whole statement on this, because it is very interesting. It makes a really good point. Michael Brown says, way to bring it on home, Matt, with a fabulous, fabulous cancellation, I think social media has played a large role in this phenomenon of good or bad think. It's like people have become a bunch of zombies who only know how to hit thumbs or thumbs up or thumbs down. People seem to have fallen under the spell of false dichotomy that will now not allow their brain to have a thought that is original or nuanced. The perpetual insistence of scrolling through bumper sticker slogans and the erosion of the English language are all contributing factors in this way of thinking, I love listening, keep it the great work that you do. This episode is definitely going on my greatest hits list. Yeah, it's the inability. It's not so much because it is interesting that partly it seems like there's this black and white thinking that people do. But it's not so much that, because a lot of these same people, they won't recognize good and evil in the world. In any other context, they're going to be talking about, they want to make everything a gray area. Well, it's impossible to say what's good and what's bad. So it's really, it's the problem, as I said on Monday, is that there's one thought, there's one assigned. It's not even a position, it's just one thought, one statement that's supposed to apply to every issue. And sometimes the one assigned thought or statement is correct. So when it comes to slavery, the one assigned thought that we've all been given that we're all supposed to think and say, is slavery is bad. And that's correct, it is bad. But the problem is that you're not allowed to go beyond that. That's the only thing you're allowed to say about it. And if you say anything else about it, then you have begun excusing it. Which on top of leading to ridiculous policies like reparations, it also just, it contributes to making us dumber. So this situation comes about because we have become dumber as a culture and then it also feeds that, it makes us even make makes us all the more dumb. Because we're not allowed to have interesting conversation with you know slavery given the fact that slavery was a universal institution across the entire world for thousands of years. It's like a lot that should be said about it. It's just it's one of the critical facts of human history. And so there's interesting conversations we could have about, I mean why was that? How is it that for thousands of years, almost everyone in the world was basically okay with slavery. They might not have all own slaves, but that would have been determined by socioeconomic status. For thousands of years there really wasn't anything like an abolition movement anywhere. It was an accepted institution and now today we look at slavery and we automatically recognize well of course that's wrong. You know we recognize it as one of them it's self evidently wrong to us. And yet for thousands of years it was that was not evident to almost anyone on the planet. And that included some of the most brilliant minds in human history. So it's not nearly as simple I think for a lot of people on left they would want to say well it's because everyone who lived prior to everyone who was born before the 60s but 1960s basically was backwards drooling primitive bigot. They're all a bunch of morons. That's not the case at all I mean some of the most brilliant these people were in many cases again our IQ scores are declining right now. So if anything evidence suggests they're a lot smarter than us. And yet they they couldn't see what to us is self evident. It's a very interesting fact. And I don't have the exact answer for it but it's something we should probably talk about. But we can't because the only thing we're allowed to say is this bad. You could be argued with no great effort that the main reason we are where we are as a society is because we are spiritually bankrupt when you have no relationship with God you live a life in chaos but as bench peer it points out. In episode 13 of Exodus with Jordan Peterson it's not just a one way street God wants to have a relationship with us as well. Check out the trailer. The romantic and tremendous yearning that God has to be among his people is so clear from from this language right he specifically says it's not just I brought you out to the into the wilderness to the world. To serve me which is the language of a king to his subject is I brought you out here to live with you to dwell among you and it's repeated twice in the second section right here today I brought you out specifically so that I can dwell among you he wants the closeness with us he wants the romance with us. And that's why it's such a tremendous sin against him when the people end up essentially throwing him out right I mean what they're about to do with the golden calf and the language that you'll see God's response is okay well I'm with throwing from you. In this episode of Exodus Ben sits with Jordan and a round table group of esteemed scholars theologians and artists to discuss one of those most seminal books in the Bible new episodes are coming online every week and they're all great exclusively for daily wire plus members. But you have to join now daily wire dot com so subscribe to watch Exodus. Do it now let's get to our daily cancellation. Today for our daily cancellation we must once again cancel the country of Canada now may seem a bit excessive I acknowledge that every time someone in Canada does something that annoys me I respond by just canceling the whole nation. In most other cases I will simply cancel the individual offender but Canada gets treated differently. They're on a very short leash with me you ever since they reelected Justin Trudeau again. I realized that I have to adopt a zero tolerance policy with the entire country. Now if one Canadian does something cancelable they all get canceled. But this is only fair considering the Canadians in general have allowed their country to slide irrevocably into full on left wing brave new world tyranny and they've especially surrendered themselves to the LGBT alphabet mafia. A similar process is underway in the United States of course but in Canada the process is complete. The placement and worship of the LGBT called is the country's number one national priority which brings us to this story from global news quote Ontario's NDP urged the government Tuesday to create community safety zones that would protect drag artists and LGBTQ communities from harassment and intimidation at their performances. Drag performances have been targeted by organized protests across the United States but also here at home said Kristin Wong Tam who is putting forward a private member bill to designate 100 meter zones around. Show venues Wong Tam the NDP's critic on two SLGPTQ issues and who uses they then pronouns said their bill is designed to keep the community safe. The bill would also allow the Attorney General to temporarily designate addresses such as where a show is taking place as community safety zones and anti LGBTQ harassment intimidation and hate speech within 100 meters would be subject to a $25,000 fine. Yes of course Kristin Wong Tam is non binary identifies as they them you know eventually every politician in both Canada and the United States will be non binary because it's the easiest identity to tack on to your resume and give you a you know political clout without having to make any changes or do anything in particular to play the part. Non binary is such an utterly meaningless label that the people who claim it can't tell you what they mean by it can't explain how or why they decided that they have this identity and cannot speak about it coherently for even five seconds at a time. Kristin Wong Tam is I looked at up 52 years old. Now I don't know when exactly she discovered her inner non binary identity but I could already assume with absolute confidence that it was very recently. She lived her entire adult life in the binary until one day as a middle age woman she decided that she's actually some sort of mysterious human entity who in ways she cannot possibly explain actually exists outside of the male female binary that has defined all people who've ever lived since the dawn of humanity. But she just like every other non binary quote unquote person made this startling discovery about herself like 10 seconds ago. You know a whole bunch of left is all at once just recently at the same time found out that they were non binary. None of this was none of them were saying this about themselves 10 years ago for the for you know for most of them not even five years ago. So just now right now they've made this determination. So it's almost like this is a fat you know a social contagion and not an actual legitimate category of being almost. Anyway here's Kristin they them announcing her plan listen. This new legislation on Ontario is designed to keep the two S LGBT community safe drag artists their audiences the business and the facilities that host those drag performances have been put at risk. And unless we put forward a strategy to protect them Ontario social economic and cultural richness is under attacked we have to protect that the proposed legislation does two things and I will go through them. Firstly it enables the attorney general to create a 2 S LGBT QI plus community safety zone to prohibit within 100 meters of the property any homophobic transphobic active intimidation threat offensive threats. Offensive threats offensive remarks protest disturbance and distribution of hate propaganda within the meaning of the criminal code. It also comes with it a penalty of $25,000 if prosecuted successfully. Secondly the act creates an Ontario 2 S LGBT QI plus safety advisory committee to provide recommendations to the provincial government on how to improve safety for our community and to prevent further hate. Just a quick note here, none of that is true, none of that is close to true there isn't any rising tide of hate crimes against LGBT people, especially not in Canada of all places. That's like saying there's a rising tide of fat phobia cracker barrel just it doesn't make any sense. But I do believe that there has certainly been dramatic increases in LGBT people reporting that they are victims of hate crimes. But the increase in reporting is due almost entirely to two things. Number one, a lot of them just fabricate hate crimes out of thin air lie about it as we've seen time and time again. Number two, the category of hate crime is increasingly being expanded so that an LGBT person can claim to be a hate crime victim the moment they encounter any statement or opinion they don't like. And this point is proven in that very same clip when Kristen they then tries to prove that hate crimes are a major problem by launching into a list of cities where protests against drag queen groomer events have taken place. So this is what she means by hate crime. Any action or statement taken by anyone to oppose or protest anything that any LGBT person is doing is a hate crime. And this includes, I mean, especially includes anyone who protests the sexualization of children by gay men and dresses. Let's continue. Firstly, it enables the Attorney General to create a 2S LGBT QI plus community safety zone to prohibit within 100 meters of the property any homophobic, transphobic, active intimidation threat offensive threats, offensive remarks, protest disturbance and distribution of hate propaganda within the meaning of the criminal code. It also comes with it a penalty of $25,000 if prosecuted successfully. Now, I can help you with that. If you want to prevent further hate, what you could do is leave the kids alone. Just leave them alone. That's all you have to do. But you refuse to do it. You refuse to stop. You are addicted to sexualizing children and you can't stop. Because almost all of the quote hate that you're experiencing, the hate that you're not just making up anyway, is hatred directed at your actions, your behavior. Okay, that's what we hate. Yes, we are. If you are a leftist LGBT activist or you are someone like Kristen Day, then, and you have picked up that there is hatred being directed at you, you're right. You're right. There is. But the hatred is directed at what you are doing. People hate what you are doing. Specifically, in this case, they hate that you are bringing kids into gay clubs so that grown adult men can perform burlesque routines for them. We hate that. Absolutely. This is the kind of hatred that Kristen Day then is trying to protect her quote community from. Later, speaking of that community, later in the press conference, she brought one of these poor press groomers on stage to tell his story. These threats and intimidation tactics are very real and happening all around us to people we love and care about. Even in recent weeks, I myself have been victim to hate crimes and hate speech. I'm a professional drag queen who loves what I do more than anything in the entire world. Drag is all about supporting love and acceptance and allows people to feel empowered and special. First of all, why are they always dressed like the evil stepmother from a Disney film if the film was directed by Tim Burton? This is their idea of womanhood, obviously. And you also, we can't skip over the fact that they have made drag queen into a protected category. So drag queens can be victims of hate crimes now, which includes saying something at all. If you say something to a drag queen, you are committing a hate crime against a protected group. It's literally the same thing as making actors into protected groups. Or if you do something an actor doesn't like her, even if you beat up an actor, now you're not only charged with assault, but you're charged with a hate crime because they are an actor. That's what the drag queen is. And they don't deny that. They are acting. They're playing the part of a woman, which in and of itself becomes a protected group. He did say something important there. He said that the drag is all about making the drag artist feel special. And I don't doubt that for a moment. It's primarily about giving gay cross dressers an opportunity to act out their sexual fetishes. And some of them, as we've seen, are particularly excited about acting out those fetishes in front of children. But it's also about feeling special. That's the centerpiece of the LGBT agenda. It is to protect their right to feel special. I mean, as I explained during my talk last night, we live in the age of the psychological man, which means that people define themselves entirely by their desires and their feelings and their self perceptions. And so, in itself is an amalgamation of an individual's desire, feelings, urges, perceptions and so on. All that matters is how the individual feels. And the most important human right is the right to feel good to feel special. Drag queens feel special when they parade around looking like, you know, cross dressing Edward Scissorhands. And so they have the right to do that. It is their most important rights. And they say they have the right to do it in front of children because it makes them feel special. By this way of thinking, nobody else has the right to do or say anything that would make the drag queen feel bad about this behavior, which is why they intend to throw free speech entirely out the window and criminalize protests against these drag queen groomer events. That, of course, is the point of making a safety zone. The zone doesn't protect them physically because they were never in any physical danger. Instead of protects their feelings and their feelings are all that matter to them, and they think all that should matter to us. This is what the LGBT cult believes. And increasingly, countries are writing laws on the basis of this belief. Canada is not the only offender, but it is one of the worst. And that is why it is today. Once again, canceled. That will do it for the show today. We will talk to you tomorrow. Have a great day. Godspeed."
