For every lie they tell, we're going to get in their face and yell two truths. This is human events with your host Jack Vesobic. Deliver us from evil. Descentis is a failed candidate. And you know what, he's a failed candidate again. He's got no personality. Never talk because he's an infant. I know you'd have a lousy question. Why is that a lousy question? Because it's not true. You think about the inflation reduction that's going to help with the deficit. That's actually going to help make investments. We talked about you guys were talking about what was going on in Hawaii. Climate change is affecting so many communities. Wildfires spreading across Hawaii's second largest island. It is happening in Maui. There have been mass evacuations. Some people have had to jump into the ocean to escape. Special counsel Jack Smith has obtained warrants for Twitter to turn over former President Donald Trump's account information. The full Ticani grand jury will go back to work with the possibility they'll be handed the case against former President Donald Trump and allies. It is more likely that allegations of election interference will go before one of two grand juries next week. In Russia, officials have opened an investigation after a powerful explosion rocked an industrial plant near Moscow. Presidential candidate in Ecuador's upcoming elections was killed tonight during a campaign event. Fernando Villavicencio was holding an event at a school north of Gito when he was shot. Back to FBI agents shot and killed a man in Utah who they say has been making violent threats against the president, Governor Newsom and other officials. Agents killed Craig Robertson Wednesday morning just hours before President Joe Biden's plan visit to Utah. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard today's edition of human events with Jack Passobic. We are live here, Washington, D.C. Today is August 10th, 2023 anodominy. What you just saw there was a very confusing clip recorded by a man in Provo, Utah. 615 a.m. an FBI SWAT team shows up across the street at the home of his elderly neighbor in his 70s, banging on the door, pre-dawned raid, screaming. An explosion goes off. The video cuts off. We later find out that the man was wanted and had been under investigation by the FBI. They had a search warrant as well under arrest warrant. They were coming to arrest him for threats against the president and interstate threats. Yet if you continue to read more in the documents, they say the man was in his 70s. He attended church. He's been under surveillance since March of this year. And that the FBI in the past had gone to his home and spoken to him and he did not respond aggressively. What changed? Why did the FBI decide to go and launch this pre-dawn raid of Craig Robertson in the way that they did? I'd like to know answers and I'm being honest. Did they have evidence that Craig Robertson was about to leave his home with a sniper rifle and do something that he obviously shouldn't do? I've read the post that he made online. If you make posts like that, you better expect a knock on your door from law enforcement, of course. But the question is, was the pre-dawn raid by an FBI SWAT team the only way to go about this? Federal law enforcement, national law enforcement in this country, if we are going to have a serious conversation about this, if we're going to have a serious conversation about our relationship, then we need to understand exactly what it is that the government wants. Because to me, and it's just my opinion, this looks like a show of force. This looks like a message. This looks like a message being sent to the people of this country. Threaten us and we'll show up at your home at 615 in the morning and take you out. That's what it looks like, folks. I want more information. I want body cams if it's out there. I want every piece of evidence. I want to hear those voices. What happened? And more importantly, why did they choose this route when they had spoken to the man before, Reheem Dasam joined us next? I rolled with luds, and then boys had a saying. You can't be listening to all that slappy whack, trim out his outlets, a bam ship, nippy bam bam, like human events with Jack Passobic. Folks, as you know, our world can change at a moment's notice. We are currently on the brink of economic collapse. It's crazy.

Now, also for this episode, I wanted to bring in a good friend of the program here, good friend personally. Mr. Reheem Kasam of the National Pulse. Reheem, thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you for having me. And why are you darker than me? Well, I'm darker than you today because you've been sitting inside playing FIFA for the last three weeks. You're actually playing FIFA right now. He's playing FIFA during the interview. He's literally playing FIFA during the interview, folks. That just shows you the level of commitment from Heem Kasam to the great team. Here's the problem. Here's the problem, Jack. There's no football. We're in the off season. And they're trying to make me watch the Women's World Cup. And I'm like, no, I'd rather have a video games based on soccer than watch the Women's World Cup. So these are the daily problems that I face. The struggle is real, folks. The struggle is absolutely real. But Reheem, you were on the show here about two months ago. And you told us that in short order, something was about to happen. You made a prediction. And I remember being skeptical of your prediction. So before we get into the payoff, let's go through the setup. Let's show people Reheem's prediction from June 22nd here on Human Events. Because being anti-woke is just the bottom, like bar, the bottom rung of the ladder of conservatism. You don't get to be celebrated because you're not a communist and not a Satanist. And that's what he's going around doing. He's going around giving speeches and going, aren't I brilliant for not being a communist and not being a Satanist? And everyone's like, yeah, I mean, we do expect that from you, though, mate. Like, to be honest with you. And I think this is where it's all falling down. It's going to fall down further. Because I don't expect Rick Scott, and I don't expect Will Hurd to pull it more than 1% to 3%. And that's with the margin of error of about 3.5%. But they won't be taking from Trump. Those 1% and 3% they will be taking from Rhonda Santis. Maybe I'll make another prediction right here, by the way. Like the one I made when you played in the last segment, maybe I can make another prediction. Rhonda Santis to 10% midsummer. Rhonda Santis by 10% midsummer. You're wearing the same shirt right now you were in that video, weren't you? I haven't changed. You actually haven't changed, though. So you said Rhonda Santis to 10%. But let's go through this. Rhonda Santis to 10% by midsummer. You didn't say fall. You didn't say winter. You didn't ambiguously state this. You actually put a timeframe on it. Rhonda Santis to 10% by midsummer. Tell me, Rahim, as we woke up this morning, one of the big things that we always do, I've noticed that you've gotten to do it. I do it. Trump does it over on True Social. We go and check the polls. We go and check the latest numbers. What are the latest numbers today? Rhonda Santis on 10% midsummer. Okay, so Walker said, what is the poll that has this? Okay, we've got it up there today. And this poll, not only is it Rhonda Santis 10%, it's actually Vivek Ramaswami 11.4%. Rahim, how did this happen? And not only that, how did you know that this was going to happen? Well, look, there are a couple of things you need to bear in mind here. The first thing to bear in mind here is you always look at sample sizes. There's a 2,000 person poll which puts it about double the sample size of most of the daily tracking polls that you get. You then look at the margin of error. It's the margin of error, I think. I'm just going to look it up here. Very quick. Make sure I get the number right. 2.6%, which is smaller than most of your daily tracker polls, which have margins of error between 3.6, 5% sometimes even. But then the third thing actually takes away a little bit from the polls, you know, necessary credibility in this area. That is to say that the polling company that did this poll, I don't know how you pronounce signal, I guess, but it's spelled with. You have to bear in mind that signals VP, Brock McCleary, is actually a pollster for the Vivette campaign. So Vivette's numbers, you've got to take with a pinch of salt here. But in the grand scheme of things, the trajectory is correct. What we've been seeing in terms of the shifting of momentum really, really deeply away from Rhonda's hand. Since he announced his campaign tracks with this. And then the other thing you have to bear in mind is you're going to start seeing more data coming out like this. It's not remember we were mid 20s, then slipped a little bit, then into the teens, then 15, then 12. Now we're at 10. It keeps going further and further down. So, you know, you can have some skepticism about this as I do with every data set that comes out, whether it's attached to a campaign, a pack, or independent. And there's no real such thing as independent polling companies. Maybe, maybe, you know, you would say, Rasmussen is the closest thing you'll get to that. But you'll start to see this number creep up more and more and you'll start to see, I think, single digit midget wrong within, you know, within a couple of weeks, maybe a month's time. And this represents, keep in mind, and what's amazing to me is that you've seen this latest news cycle as the FEC deadline just passed of all the campaigns. So Trump's got this much money on lawyers, so they're moving around from this pack to this, but he's got a number of packs plus the campaign, so that money sort of goes back and forth. Rhonda Santis has done this as well. By the way, rolling over his governor's gubernatorial campaign money, putting some of that into a super pack, also taking money from, you know, that's moved from empower parents. Just a bunch of different packs moving back and forth. But I've noticed that nobody ever seems to tie the spending and fundraising with the performance in polls, because if we're sitting here as political operatives and strategists trying to understand, well, if you're spending the money, it's not just how much money you spend. It's what your conversion rate is. Okay, if we spent $45 million, what is the return on investment? Why do they never seem to tie these together? I mean, that would be a disaster for most campaigns. If you look to that, then the funny thing is the Trump. Yeah, if you look at the Trump stuff, I mean, if the argument is, oh, Trump is just spending his donations on legal defenses, which, by the way, translates to Trump is spending the donations fighting the deep state instead of giving it to DC based consultants. That is what you're really saying there. But if you have a problem with that somehow, then the counterpoint also to that is, yes, so you're saying he hasn't spent a penny campaigning, and yet he keeps going up and solidifying his support. You should be happy that there's a candidate out there that can do that. You should be happy like people were in 2016 that Donald Trump didn't need to spend $2 billion versus Hillary Clinton to defeat her. This is the kind of candidate that you want at the top of the ticket. And he's the kind of candidate that can drag other people who aren't so attractive over the line. Well, as we saw with Ron DeSantis. To be fair, there were plenty of Republicans in 2016 throughout 2016 who were not happy that that candidate was at the top of the ticket. To be fair, because this is, but you're right. I remember saying this actually in October of 2016 at the time, I've never seen the Republicans so upset about winning. I've never seen that you're spending a little amount of money. You've actually found a candidate who can galvanize not just low information voters or non-engaged voters, low propensity voters. We saw, we had a polling data point out yesterday that actually said Trump is out performing with non-registered Americans. So they were able to actually poll Americans who were non-registered and find this, these are your, who are they, they're watching UFC. They're listening to podcasts. These are all the things that Trump does. They're also people who are aware of Trump just because of his own celebrity an notoriety. Trump is winning with them as well. This is why a candidate like that on paper doesn't necessarily capture. If you're only looking at sort of a political resume, you're not capturing the full scope. Of what I think it is that you're talking about here. Yeah, that's right. And in response to your tweet from earlier on where you said that I came on the show two months ago and predicted the latest numbers that we're seeing now, I poll up of my own. We're going to poll up, which has 501 votes now. The most accurate question was, which was more successful. Ukraine's counter offensive or Ron DeSantis's reset. And I'm pleased to report exclusively here on human events that 77% of people responded that Ukraine's counter offensive was more effective than Ron DeSantis's reset. So, you know, we can laugh about it and I will keep laughing about it. The reason I will keep laughing about it is because I predicted all of this going back to last January, not this January 2023, January 2022. And I know you did a podcast about this and DeSantis world and how this would end up. And everything has come to pass. It's so obvious. Remember, the people staffing DeSantis's campaign are the people who couldn't get jobs in the Trump administration when the only person they were going up against for the job was Omarosa. So what does it tell you about those people? We got a minute left. I know you got to run. Where can people go to get your not just reporting, but how do they also get your analysis on the national polls? What's the next step that they need to perform? It's funny. You should ask Jack there. And it's actually an extra step at the national pulse.com. People will find that I do editors notes on stories where I kind of read people into this stuff. It is a premium feature. We call it the pulse plus. It comes with a whole bunch of other features as well on the site. But if you want to be weeks, months, sometimes even years ahead, as you and I both will, let's say on the Hunter Biden laptop staff, the nationalpulse.com is where you need to go. Folks, you got to go there. By the way, I'll give one for free for folks today on your editor's note on the article that you wrote about what we're talking about here was just, I told you. Two words. Told you. There you go, folks. Reheem Kasam there. What can I say? Called the shot, made the shot. Next, joining us here, Human Events, Ali London. It's got a new book coming out that you need to get. Hey, you know, you talk about influences. These are influences. And they're friends of mine. Jack, we're so big. Where's Jack? Jack, he's going to play Jack. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back here, Washington, D.C. Jack Posobic live in studio. Folks, I have a question. Are you tired of progressive corporations, exhausted, trying to keep up with all the virtue signaling when you're simply trying to buy a couple products for your family. Progressive corporate America continues to push messaging and further alienate conservative Americans all while eroding the future of the American dream. It's prominent all over the country. Companies like Starbucks, strong arming their customers to support abortion, financial services like PayPal, canceling customers for their political views, makeup companies like Maybelline, making a mockery of women by supporting transgender models and companies like Disney, forcing gender ideology on you when all you want to do is take your kid to a movie.

Folks, joining us right now live here in a massive Washington, D.C. The palatial human events, Real America's Boy Studio, Washington, D.C. We have commentator, writer, and now author, Ali London. Ali, thanks for joining us. Great to be here. Nice to see you, man. So you've got a copy. The last time we had you on, you were working, you were feverishly writing away. You're writing on a typewriter, right? I'm on a computer, but you just a little bit of typewriting. A little bit of typewriting. I mean, that's a bit old-time. Once in a while, I got the cigarette dangling, you know. It's a great night with the candle, right? Yes, that's a lot. No incandescent or none of that LED stuff. Just tell me in the studio. Tell us about, and let's put the book up so folks can see it. Tell us about your new book, Gender Madness, and I believe it comes out next week, right? It's out literally in four days. Four days. Oh, let's go. Yes, so you know, this book is actually exposing everything that's going on right now, Jack. So we have the gender ideology being pushed on children in schools, on social media apps like TikTok and Instagram, and it's being pushed really hard. Then this Pride season, we saw it pushed like never before the Target Pride collection for children with the Tuck Friendly swimwear. We had, you know, the White House had transacting for the top-less. Can I just say something about that Target? So my wife, who, and everybody knows Tanya Tej, she's on Twitter, et cetera, we've had her on the show a million times, but she doesn't follow the politics and certainly not these issues on a regular, you know, insane level basis like I do. You're on Twitter a ton by the way, you've got a ton of stories. I dig, it's a Twitter. No, no, yeah, she doesn't have that. That's what I'm saying. She's not a news junkie, right? She will not accept foot in a Target. She will not set foot in there. I'm boycotting it. I will not set foot in Target. And I said, until when? She goes, I don't know ever. I don't know ever. She has been completely turned off to Target in a way that I've never seen her really for any kind of, we don't drink, so Bud Light doesn't really come up, but I've never seen this Target thing has her switched off in a way that I've never seen. And yeah, I agree. I mean, I've seen, you know, thousands of parents go online and they're not normally vocal about these things. They say, look, this is the red line because you're pushing this on kids. And that's the red line that's upset everybody in the last few years because, you know, before people were just living their life, now it's being pushed in schools. You have kindergartners learning about sex education, LGBT books in school libraries. And it's wrong to push that on kids when kids are so easily impressionable. So the fact you have like Target and it was in the main section as you walked in the store in most of the stores. Of course. It was pushed in your face and it's pushing us in kids' faces and they're so easily confused. And then look at all the movies these days with all the non-binary characters you had, the Disney Pixar's elemental, the non-binary gas object or whatever. And you have the Transformers pushing non-binary stuff. It's targeting kids on purpose and it's wrong to do that because kids are easily susceptible to these ideas. In the domestic? Yes, it's actually correct. In the domestic, I'm fact checking myself in real time, domestic box office here. So that's just US. Sound of freedom has beaten both Transformers and Elemental. $166 million to $157 million and $149 million for Elemental. Elemental didn't even do that well here in the United States. It was beaten and Transformers, massive franchise. Obviously both beaten by Sound of Freedom, Sound of Freedom just edged out Transformers. It looks like just in the few days since I've checked this. So you've got, I think that ties into what you're talking about because we've talked about so many times the power of Sound of Freedom as a film. But I also think that because it came out on the 4th of July immediately after this crazy pride season, that it became sort of a form of protest of that for people to go see Sound of Freedom. And I know they're not directly linked, but I think in a spiritual and just metaphysical way, there is a connection there. Yeah, I think people want to take a stand and that's one way of doing it is supporting movies that are actually trying to help children and expose dark forces like child trafficking. And it's fantastic that the movie has done so well despite the mainstream media trying to pass it off as a conspiracy theory because it's not actually happening. So I think that's one reason. And the fact we saw Target lose billions, Bud Light lose up to $26 billion and who's a bush. I think it's showing that the consumer is trying to take back control because people don't want to cancel things, but we're doing it because it's for the kids. So showing support for Sound of Freedom as opposed to going to see one of these work films really does show you that people have had enough. They've had enough of this targeting kids and they want to speak up and make a decision as consumers. We all have the power to influence what brands do if we stop buying Bud Light, which is happening now. They're going to have to change their policies now. They're putting horses back in the adverts and trying to win back those consumers, but it's way too late for them. And I've got to say, I'm from the Philadelphia area. We grew up going to the Devon Horse Show. And this is one of the largest horse shows or just a question and exposition anywhere on the east coast. And one of the pinnacle of every horse show was when the Bud Wides or Clyde's Dales come in and everybody makes sure you, and even as a kid, we've been going to volunteer there, it benefits the local hospital, and we've been going to volunteer. And so you want to go and look at the collage. These beautiful, enormous Scottish horses, these draft horses, and Bud Wiser, they're flying the American flag, they've got the Dalmatian, everybody loves it. And so to take that and then turn it into this juxtapose it with all of this stuff is crazy to people, certainly crazy from a brand equity position. And even we were at the horse show again this year, and they had the collage sales and they did it, but we noticed it was kind of diminished. And then they were in a stable that was sort of like away from everybody else. And even they are clearly feeling the brunt of this. So tell us more about how do you break down in the book, the force, what is behind this? Why are people doing this when there's obviously an effect on their own bottom lines? I talk a lot about this in the book, so you have obviously the DEI Diversity Equity Inclusion, the Corporate Equality Index, which basically measures the company on how woke they are. So a lot of these companies have the same investors, Black Rock or Vanguard, so they are the ones pushing these policies. And these policies, something like Bud Light has the most ridiculous partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, which doesn't match with what the consumers want, right? Like you'd want a cowboy or something with a horse. So the fact that they pushed that and they took that loss, and other companies are still pushing this wokeness, shows that it's the investors behind this. So do you think, here's an interesting question that I've actually spoken to a few people about this offline, but do you think, so Larry Fink, right, he's the head of Black Rock, he's totally invested in ESG, even though he's publicly admitted at this point that there's been a backlash to it. Do you think that he actually believes it, or is it just about money for him? Because he's got money, right? So what is driving him? Is this a true belief, or is it something else? Because I've heard a good theory recently, and this is Neil Howe writes this out in the fourth turning, where he says that it's something where you get these liberal baby boomers, and they have a tendency to just believe in the goodness and the morality of their actions. Like how do you think about Larry Fink? This guy actually believes it. Well you know, if these companies and investors actually believed it, they would actually, you know, for instance, pride, they would actually try and make that a thing in Saudi Arabia, right? They'd actually, you know, because we noticed pride month, all of these companies, they all changed their logos at the price, for example, they fought, except in the Middle East. So, if they actually cared, they would actually go and invest that money in places where they needed these rights, right? Yeah, Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen, don't ask about what we were doing in the 1930s, no, no, no, no, no, no. Exactly, so you know, it's clearly virtue signaling, it's about, you know, trying to say, oh, we're inclusive, we're woke, but, you know, they've took it too far now, this DEI and CEI has took it way too far then, that it's actually turning consumers away, and we're seeing these brands losing, you know, billions and billions of dollars, and I don't think Budlights ever going to recover, they've just, you know, announced they have to lay off 400 staff, they have to close some distilleries down. I think they're going to recover, but I think, you know, these people in power have woken up, I know BlackRock said recently, they're going to change and look into their DEI policies, but they could just be saying that, and they might just try to push it covertly underneath the surface. But I think, thanks to the consumers fighting back recently, I think these companies have had an awakening, I think maybe we have taken this too far, because the end of the day, all they care about is money, right? Right, because you've got at some point, you know, Simon Schuster was just bought by Hedge Fund, for example, and that's another great point where book sales have been down, other than really actually conservative books have been doing great, I hope your book does very well, and everyone needs to go and preorder a copy of it right now, and then get ready for when it comes out in what four days? Yes, four days, yeah. But at the same time, you know, I would hope that a publishing house like Simon Schuster would start to realize that, you know, you don't have to just publish the books that your woke millennial, you know, agents want pushed, you can actually just push books to audiences that people will like, and you know what, that means you can publish liberal books and far-left books and right-wing books too, and the middle of the road books as well, it's fine, because there's going to be a market, and if you are a company and you're trying to make money, that's what they should follow. We have another segment with you, all right? Yes. We've got one more segment, all right, we've got one minute left, another segment here, Ali London joining us here, Washington, D.C., it's a major. I appreciate you being down on the street. Thank you. Thanks for having me. This is great to do it in person, and folks, really, we need to understand that this madness is truly a madness. And in the next segment, I'm going to talk to Ali about how this madness can affect people. I'm going to ask you about your personal story as well to explain what it's like when you were caught in the madness, because you might be out there as a parent, as a mom or a dad, a grandparent, and you might be or have someone in your life that's currently caught in it, that you're praying to get them out of it. Ali's got an answer for you. We're going to have it when we come back. I hear about the boring people at your office. I'm trying to listen to the new human events with Jack Visobic. We're back here, Jack Visobic, live in Washington, D.C., continuing our interview with Ali London, the author of the new book, Gender Madness. And here's the question that I have. So Ali, I'll just put it this way. I'm not even going to say we. I know someone who's not in my family, but in my extended orbit, who has a liberal relative that has chosen to raise their six-year-old little boy as a girl. I can tell you for a fact, and by the way, I don't care if she's listening, this is driven by the mother. This is almost 100% driven by the mother, but the dad has been so pushed down that he won't respond. He won't stand up, and they continue to do this. You've also got instances where, if someone's like a, I know you've done work with a Cole Cole that we've also had on the show, you know, talk about going through this as a teenager. What do you do with a situation like that when someone you know is caught in the gender madness? When someone is caught in it themselves, talk about your own experience, and when you get lost in those woods, how do you find the way out? Well, that's a great question, because a lot of people do get lost, and a lot of kids go through phrases. You get a lot of girls that might be tomboys. We had that 20 years ago, but we weren't chopping off their body parts or giving them hormones. So this is a very new phenomenon that's happening. My two-year-old spends half of each day as a cat to going around saying, no. So you don't give them a tail? No, I'm not giving them whiskers and ears. Yeah, and we do see, yeah, you've got a mix between parents that generally want to transition their kids, and it's often times white middle-class parents. It seems to be... How did you know? It seems to be a thing with them, you know, because they've got too much time on their hands. They've got the luxury. You know, they've got money. So they just want almost to be special. They want their kids to be special. So you have that. And you also have the other side where parents, generally, are confused. And you know, doctors or teachers might be saying, oh, your kid is trans, and the kid at the time may feel that way. But you know, their parents, like Chloe Coles-Prince, they took it to the doctor and the doctor said, you have to transition her. Otherwise, you're going to have a dead child, basically. She told us that. So that's a tactic that you use. That was a heavy and extremely heavy episode. But you know, I would just say, based on my personal spirit, struggling with gender identity, we all go through phases where we're trying to discover ourselves, especially kids and teens. You know, some days they might want to be a cat or a pirate or a dinosaur, but it doesn't mean we should be changing them or putting them on harmful hormones and puberty blockers. So the best case scenario is to, you know, keep an eye out for these warning signs. Maybe the school is indoctrinating the children, and suddenly they're talking about pronouns of being trans. So parents need to be aware of what's going on. And in a situation where you have, for instance, a mother transition to the kids and the fathers against it, the father needs to stand up and be a man and just say, look, enough is enough. This is our child. Regardless of what the mother might want, you have to let this kid grow up into an adult. And only adults can consent to things because kids can't consent. They can't drink alcohol. They can't smoke. So kids cannot consent to an irreversible sex change. So, you know, I think parents need to wake up and, you know, there are tomboys. There are boys that are a bit more feminine. And that's okay. But just let kids be kids. And so the idea, though, then is, so what do you do, though? So a Chloe Cole situation where the parents are being told by the doctors, they can tell something's wrong with their child. And I remember when I interviewed her, thinking about that as a dad myself, if I could tell there was something emotionally wrong with my son, and then the doctor's telling me, okay, this is what you need to do or he might kill himself. The idea of having a child commit suicide, it's horrifying. It's actually horrifying. And no, do I think I'd ever, you know, go in for that? No, probably not. But I can understand. And I can certainly understand for parents that are hearing this. What do you do then in that situation? Do you stand up to the doctor? Do you try to pull them out of school? What is the way to sort of, I guess, get through to the individual? Well, that happens a lot with parents, you know, because the doctors at the end of the day, they're trying to make money from this. So there's a lot of money to be made in putting kids on prescriptions for the rest of their life and surgeries. And, you know, doctors tend to use these coercion tactics to basically threaten the parents that your kids are going to commit suicide. And, you know, a lot of these kids do have severe mental health struggles. They have depression. Some of them already have suicidal tendencies. So, you know, if you're suddenly putting someone that's already got these pre-existing conditions and, you know, these kids are six times more likely to be autistic, you're basically misdiagnosing these children. You're basically saying, oh, you're trans. That's the reason you're feeling like this. Let's get you on some hormones. I mean, actually, if they actually helped these kids for treating the autism, the ADHD, bipolar depression, if they actually treated that and helped the kids with that, you know, you'd find a lot of these problems would be managed and much better. So I think it's a lot of misdiagnosing these kids. And parents just want the best for their kids, right? You know, most parents do, and they see this is a quick fix. Oh, if we transition our kid, they're going to be happy in six months. We don't have to worry about them. But really, doctors should be treating the pre-existing conditions that these kids have. So how about then, how about if it's someone like yourself, obviously, over the age of consent, over 18, have the ability to make these decisions, what would you say to folks like that that really are wrestling with this? Well, it's a really tough thing because look, I've grappled with gender dysphoria, and it's a really difficult struggle. And look, there are adults that may have felt this way their whole life, but there's also right now a social contagion. So we're seeing people suddenly becoming trans, and it's not something they thought about before because it's a trend because it's pushed on, you know, TikTok and through the entertainment industry. So, you know, I would just warn adults, you know, don't rush into things because we're seeing now adults just one consultation, like as the case with Elliot Page, who's, you know, Ellen Page, the actress. You could say it here, you're fine. Yeah, I guess I could use the names and pronouns and stuff. But, you know, they said that they had a psychotic breakdown and they had voices inside their head before they called the doctor. They called the doctor and immediately booked for a breast, you know, coming off their breast base. And that's an adult. So I think, you know, doctors have a duty to care for patients, and they shouldn't be fast-tracking even adults. You know, I think adults need to have a number of years of consultations and stuff. I don't think it's a good thing. Because, I think there's better ways of treating people that are struggling with things, but, you know, adults are adults at the end of the day. I think you can only advise them best, and I think a lot of adults are pushed into it without informed consent, without knowing the true horrors of... Well, and that what you said right there is perfect because, and this comes up with, within the vaccine debate, this comes up in so many areas, it's informed consent. It's an understanding, a true understanding of what the ramifications of some of these decisions might be. Some of these procedures that may be, and I'm not just talking about the hormones, but physical procedures that may be completely irreversible. And I know as strange as that sounds, it doesn't seem as though people actually consider that, because a lot of it, and I think you talked about this last time when I had you on with the special, where they're getting this, they're caught in this feedback loop on social media. Tell me about the social media feedback loop, and I'm sure this is in the book. Yes, so there's a lot of this in the book, because it is a social media generation we're living in right now, and we're seeing a lot of generations that are struggling with their identity, and they're thinking that this is a fix, their problems, or even a way to feel special and validated. So, you know, you see someone, for instance, on TikTok, when they're showing their transition, they start off maybe doing a little makeup, and the hair extensions. This is like the biggest thing on TikTok now, the transition stories. And, you know, TikTok's the one pushing it, and you know, every time they show an update of their progress, you know, changing their gender, they get more and more comments, more and more views, and likes. And you're getting that dopamine reward for this, but totally supported by the Chinese Communist Party, because if they wanted to turn it off, they could. But you end up putting out something like this, and it goes viral, and then what? And then you have to, because I've seen, for research purposes, Dylan Mulvaney's TikTok, right? And you can tell that even on there, she, he, I don't even remember at this point, is constantly doing, and I've seen, it's chasing the dragon. This is the same thing that addicts do when a terror runner cocaine, because you're chasing the dragon of that next dopamine hit from retweets. Look, I've certainly fallen into that with myself when it comes to social media, and you do some stunt, you do something that goes big, and then you have to think, how do I top that? How do I stop that? I'm going to jump into a river, I'm going to do whatever it is, right? But now, instead of, you know, just high risk activities, you're performing high risk actions to yourself. Yeah, and it's not just to themselves, it's actually projecting that onto their audience. So we have to think, yes. So true, yes. Around 30% of TikTok users in the United States under 18. So teens are seeing this and thinking it's normal. And like you said, people have to outdo themselves on social media. So, you know, Dylan Mulvaney one day, he'll claim to be a lesbian the next day, he's claiming to be pregnant or doing tampons. He has to have that shock value in order to retain his audience, and you know, keep the money rolling, basically. So we're seeing a lot of influences, they have to outdo themselves, and that's why you see them injecting testosterone, hormones, sharing their trans journey, because it is about attention. And a lot of these kids, they're just looking for attention, they're not getting it, maybe at home or at school or whatever, they just want attention and validation. So they're turning to social media and they're turning to their latest trend, which is being non-binary. Such as kids, even Wayne Brady apparently, Wayne Brady. They got Wayne Brady folks. Comes out as pan yesterday. Ollie London, the book is gender madness, go and pre-order it. Where can people follow you? Where can people get more information on your journey and your work? So I'm very vocal on Twitter. I, you know, I post a lot of research about these trans stories and detransitions on Ollie London TV, and the book is going to be really informative and educational. It's available on Amazon, Walmart, Barnes & Opals right now. And I just think, you know, the book and my Twitter is the way to kind of get the facts about the transitioning and why we shouldn't be doing this to kids and how we can find out for parents. Alright, I appreciate it. I know you got a run. You're heading out to Tim Paul for tonight, right? Yes, can't wait for that. So catch them on Timcast later tonight. Thank you so much for your work. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks. And that's for you as well. Alright. I'm always listening to human events with Jack Busobic. So, Jack Busobic, welcome back folks. We're here live Washington DC. Got a copy. Ollie was so nice to give me a copy of Gender Madness here. We're going to take that home. But I saw a tweet right now. Just this completely idiotic tweet from Philip Wegman. I think he's had real clear politics. Is that right? Yeah, real clear news. Just, he's at the White House. And Philip does great work, but this tweet, I'm sorry, it's so dumb. It's just so dumb. It's one of the dumbest things I've seen. And let me explain. So, it says the GOP primary front-runner on this day was Romney in 2011 with 5 plus 5, Giuliani in 2007 with plus 10, Trump in 2015 with plus 11. Today, Trump in 2023 leads by 39.1. Okay. So, let me break down what's wrong with Phil's tweet. And we're going to help Phil about because we like to help people here on the show. And then, we'll see, obviously, he's been through a lot, but he's trying to help people. And we're going to try to help people, too. This is a quantitative analysis of the primary as it currently stands. But there's no qualitative analysis here. And look, I get real clear politics is going to have the real clear average because that's what they do. But where is the qualitative analysis? Where is the qualitative analysis of the Mitt Romney campaign in 2011, Giuliani in 2007, Trump in 2015, or the ability of those voters to connect with their candidate? Mitt Romney was up, but he was not a widely supported candidate. He was just sort of the default candidate in 2011. I didn't vote for him in 2012. I didn't have a firm account in 2008, either. So yeah, was he up? Sure. But what's the qualitative analysis? Giuliani, 2007. I think I voted for Giuliani in that primary. Now that I think about it, yeah, I did vote for Giuliani in that primary in Pennsylvania. Well, I know it. And then you have, then you had Trump in 2015 as an insurgent candidate, the quality of an insurgency. So I guess what I would say is we look at the numbers a lot. We had Reheem Qasam talk about the numbers. But then Reheem also told you where the numbers were going to go. And he was able to predict it with specificity and give you a timeframe as to exactly when we would start to see these numbers for DeSantis, for Trump, everyone else. But why? If you are not conducting a qualitative analysis of candidates, of the candidates connection to an audience, of the candidates connection to the base, of what the base wants, of where the bases priorities are, then you're going to lose. So this is a great example of Iowa right now, because I saw a poll this morning, Trump up by 43 in Iowa. Or excuse me, Trump up by 26 in Iowa, 43 was New Hampshire. Blame it last, up by 23 in Iowa. Almost 30 points. 26, almost 30 points. Why? Why? And we had the question yesterday with Richard Barris. And he's had these evangelical leaders like Bob Vanderplatz, Never Trumper, Bob Vanderplatz, who was against Trump all the way through the election in 2016. Why? If he's out there saying Donald Trump is not an evangelical, he's not a good guy. He's used bad words. He's got mean tweets. And yet he's winning poll after poll after poll. Why? It doesn't make any sense, right? If you look at it that way, because he's got his priorities out. Because this country has gotten to a place where we are not looking for a moderate centrist to be president. We are not interested in having a policy debate right now. That's not where the people are. Where the people are, people are upset. The people are angry. The people can feel the system crashing all around them. Every system, whether it's the economy, whether if you just want to go on an airplane ride somewhere and then your flight gets delayed and then you can't rebook it and then you miss the trip and you're out in thousands of dollars, et cetera, et cetera. Why does it feel like we are in a state of collapse? Here's a clue, because we're in something called the fourth turning. Wars are breaking out. There was an assassination in Ecuador yesterday of a right-wing candidate. Why is there so much instability? Why are so many of these things falling apart? Because we are entering the crisis phase. The crisis phase is now. And when you are in a crisis phase, it is not time for the Marquesse of Queensbury Republicans. It is not time for the peacetime Roberts Rules of Order conservatives. You need wartime conservatives. You need people who understand that this is not about sitting down and having an argument over your talking points on a tax policy. You've got one side that's willing to use political and legal warfare against their opponents. Republicans are arguing about whether or not the Joe Biden, Hunter Biden stuff is real and Democrats are locking up their opponents. They've arrested Trump three times and they're going to do it again tomorrow but next week in Georgia. Fannie Willis sitting down there. Understand what time it is. And if you understand what time it is, and you respond to that, if you respond to that by meeting the moment, by giving people an understanding that you are the fighter that will step into the arena, do what needs to be done and move forward as a country, then maybe we can hand the reins over to a policy guide. Then you can rebuild because whichever side wins in this crisis period will set the stakes for the next 40 to 50 years, the next generation of America, the next regime, the new American republic will be run by the side that wins in this crisis. Now, who do you want that to be? It's a simple question because the FBI is rolling up, no knock raids, predawn raids, pro lifers, seniors, locking up if you are anywhere in air, if you sneeze too hard on January 6, you get locked up. That's where the FBI is at. That's federal law enforcement breathing down your neck. If you're too Catholic, you're praying a little too hard, they're sending informants into your church. And then they're going after the nuns. L.A. The Sisters of Perpetual Insanity. Why are they doing all this? Because it always starts with the churches. They always come for the churches first. That's where the left's at. That's where the left is willing to go. There are you willing to go. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay ashore."
