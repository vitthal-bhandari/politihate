    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaisetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fereless with Jason Whitlock, a special Saturday edition of Fereless with Jason Whitlock. Jill Savage is here with me. She was here with me yesterday as we talked about the abortion issue. She's returned for this special Saturday edition. We got Michelle, Michelle Tafoya coming on to talk about her controversial, contentious interview with Dan Levittar. I have a lot, a lot that I need to say about this, but I want to first frame it up and get you guys up to speed on what happened so that you can understand my conversation with Michelle Tafoya. We're going to first skip ahead to, and again, if you haven't heard, Michelle went on Fox News. She went on a gut-fell show and talked about getting ambushed during an interview, and it was during her podcast interview on the Dan Levittar show. I want to first play you how Dan Levittar introduced Michelle Tafoya. This is the second clip, the Levittar in his introduction of Michelle Tafoya. How is it that I think I'm in the middle and you think you're in the middle and I'm looked at as far left and you're looked at as far right when all I look at is, man, our leadership everywhere stinks. The Republicans seem ruthless to me and the Democrats seem weak, and none of them represent me. That's how Michelle Tafoya was introduced on the Dan Levittar podcast. She's not introduced as, hey, this sideline reporter on America's number one TV show. You transition, you've stepped away from the number one TV show in America to more enter the political lane. Michelle, tell us why you did that. That's not how she's introduced. She's put into a box, Dan pretends to put himself into a box. Then after that introduction and Michelle's response, then about two minutes in, two minutes into this interview, Dan lets Mike Ryan, his jack-off producer, take over the interview, watch this. This starts around two minutes into the interview. He takes over and starts talking about Jack Del Rio and accusing her of being a conservative. Mike Ryan takes over the interview. If I may, you led with your approach choice libertarian and your fiscal conservative, and then you said, I don't want to believe that one group is a press and another party is oppressors. That is a shoeing just, I'm a fiscal conservative. Sociologically speaking, I am a conservative and I believe in law and order. These are all platform issues and slogans of a party that is not just fiscally conservative. Yeah, so she's committed the crime of being a conservative. He's brought the evidence and now he wants her to defend herself. Michelle actually does a great job of like, oh boy, this is not going to direction. I want it to go. She starts fighting back. Then so Mike Ryan, this jack-off producer who has nothing to do with her being on the show, he then turns to the assistant black jack-off producer Roy Bellamy, I think is his name, and invites him into the conversation. Let's play that. For those that don't know and are just listening to the audio, what you seized on his confirmation when I extended my arm was I was bringing in my fellow producer Roy Bellamy who feels very passionately about critical race theory and might be able to speak to it a little bit better than I. So I was just welcoming him to the floor. I guess, thank you for the vine, we'll just welcome him in. Yeah, basically critical race theory is policies. This country is built off of racism, like slavery and what not in policies that are built to, that have built this country is basically built off of slavery and racism and how it has affecting today's life, basically what is what CRT is. They brought on a football sideline reporter, America's number one TV show, and within minutes, they've dragged her into a hostile political interview, three different guys, Levittard and his two jack-off producers. Then Michelle Tafoe realizes what's happening and talks about, and this is a very quick clip where she's like, holy cow, I've made a bunch of enemies instantly, let's play that. And if you deny that you're racist, that just underscores the fact that you are racist, and if you accept that you're racist, then you're just, again, underscoring that you're racist. So there's no win there. I'm sorry, why are you shaking your head? I've barely spoken three minutes on this program, and I feel like I've made three enemies. So she's now eight, nine minutes into the interview. It's clearly hostile. It's clearly three on one. It's clearly a hot mess. Levittard has disappeared. He's hiding off in a closet on the show. He's brought on Michelle Tafoea. He's used it. I think, let's show the invitation. Michelle shared with me the invitation, the confirmation of the invitation of her email that they sent confirming her on the show where they talk about, they want to address her amazing career and her new sideline, what's called a sideline, sanity podcast or whatever. That's how they frame up the interview. That's what she was given and what she thought she was going to be talking about. Ten minutes in, Levittard has disappeared. He starts the first two minutes, then he disappears for ten minutes, turning it over to his little jack-off producers, and they begin to do what jack-off producers do. They're in over their heads. They can't deal with Michelle Tafoea. She's a seasoned, experienced person. She starts fighting back very politely, and Levittard sees that it's going badly. Then Dan jumps in with a half-hearted BS apology. Let's listen to this. The beginning part of this, let's go back to the beginning. When I was joking about the caricatures that people become by making myself the wokest, and then if I'm the wokest of the wrestling characters, then you must be on the dark side. It was a joke. I was not walking you into a trap. I have not talked to you in a long time, and the last experience I had with you was lovely. I was not looking for this to become that. I am sorry, genuinely, that upon introduction, I was awkward, and you misconstrued the entry point. I knew you were joking. Honestly, I didn't know you were joking, Dan. Michelle's playing nice and doing a little bit of a rope-a-dope strategy, giving them it. Before she came on, I want to play this clip. This is before she came on. It's about 15 seconds of how Dan framed the interview. He's, oh, I had nothing but the best intentions. Everything was lovely. Blah, blah, blah. But let's play the very first clip where he puts out a poll and prediction on how this interview is going to go. Michelle Tofoya is around the corner. Put on the poll, please, Roy, at Lebitard Show. How's Tofoya going to go? Chaos, inflammatory, awkward, or cordial are your choices. Michelle Tofoya will be here in a second. He's lying. He's clearly lying. This is a group of beta males, three beta males trying to ambush a woman, trying to ambush a political conservative, and they're in over their heads. She starts kicking her ass all over the place. He gets embarrassed, offers up an apology. Then he walks her through the typical left-wing talking points. Oh, they're whitewashing textbooks. Oh, abortion is a problem. They're taking women's rights away. Oh, there's a, don't say gay bill in Florida. What do you think about that? And then, eventually, and I want to play the very last clip, he plays the St. George Floyd car. This is the go-to move. Michelle Tofoya is white, Hispanic, or, you know, but she ain't black. And so, when the left get in trouble, they play the St. George Floyd car. Here's Lebitard playing the George Floyd. Michelle, that teaches, though, critical race thinking, you know, that would teach how the systemic police brutality that you find is built by police orders that come front, that descend from the slave system and treat whites differently than they do others. Like, that's, that's the, that's it, the soul of the facts and the history. She's a Sunday night football reporter. And again, I know she's stepped off and said, you know, had some comments about critical race theory and what her kids are experiencing in school, whatever, but they debate her about, don't say, yay, they just debate her about police brutality, the Tulsa massacre incident. This is three cowards. This is one of the most cowardly displays I've ever seen in my life. Dan Lebitard and I used to be friends years ago. It was one of my best friends in the media industry years ago. I've never seen anybody descend into this level of cowardly, cowardliness, as I've seen from Dan Lebitard and his treatment of Michelle Tafoei. Michelle Tafoei is going to come on just around the corner and we're going to go further into this. But I just wanted to give you all that framework so you could understand if you hadn't heard of this story, hadn't followed we're going to do a complete and full deep dive on it. The Lebita show versus Michelle Tafoei, it was a knockout. They did not get the knockout they were looking for. They got knocked out. Three beta males, three male cowards got knocked out by one female reporter. It was embarrassing. All right, don't go anywhere, Michelle Tafoei. It's my obligation on hate. The discrimination isn't up. Don't dance for freedom. All right, welcome back to a special Saturday edition of Fearless with Jason Whitlock. You get more of me on a Saturday. Everybody's got to be happy. We're going to roll out to Minneapolis and bring in Michelle Tafoei and continue our conversation. Michelle, obviously the former sideline reporter for Sunday Night Football America's number one television show. She left Sunday Night Football. She left America's number one TV show because she wanted to get involved with Save in America and the Culture War and just I don't even know if she wants to call the Culture War but she just wanted to have her voice heard on more important issues than what to do on third and long. And so she started a sideline sanity podcast. She's helping. Why am I forgetting the man you're helping run for governor? Well, because he's no well it was Kendall quals. He's no longer running. He did not get the Republican endorsement. It was an ugly, ugly affair that you would have been disgusted at. And anyway, so that's passed. Well, Michelle, I left you out of the open of this show because I think you have too much class for how angry I am at Dan Levittard and his show. And so I didn't want you to be a part. I'm going to mock this guy and I wanted to mock him away from you. And what his show did, the La Beta show is what we're calling it because that was you beat up three beta males. I got to say I was offended by the podcast and inspired by the podcast. So I was like, look at Michelle, beat up these three men who thought they were going to ambush her. She went in and stood toe to toe. They couldn't knock you off your feet. When I heard you say you were ambushed and then I went and watched the video, I was like, yeah, they did try to ambush you, but I think you ambushed them. Well, I'm happy that you see it that way, Jason. It sure didn't feel like it in the moment. I've had I haven't watched it back because the experience was was disgusting and I don't want to relive it. But people, friends, family who have watched it back are saying, hey, you held your own. I wish I had known what they wanted to talk about. I may have still gone on, but I wasn't prepared at all to talk about these things because that wasn't their invitation to me. So when out of the gate, I just started getting pummeled. I was really I was a little shocked, a little thrown off and and realized I had stepped into a trap and it was and that made it all the more distasteful to me because it wasn't a conversation. It wasn't a civil debate. It wasn't any of those things. It was, hey, let's hammer this person because her views differ from ours. Well, the accusation was, oh my God, Michelle Tofoy is a conservative, defend yourself. That was the idea. How dare you be a conservative, defend yourself. And first of all, you establish very quickly, like, hey, guys, I'm not some I'm not George Will. I'm not Georgia Will. I'm a libertarian that's pro-choice. And so you didn't want to be put in any sort of box, but they certainly wanted to put you in one. Yeah, they they countered that with, well, if you're those things, then how can you possibly be in support of these things? What they don't understand about libertarianism is you really are sort of following a doctrine of just leave everyone alone, you know, and but being pro-choice, I think that that takes me to one side socially. I'm a fiscal conservative. That takes me to another side. I feel like I'm pretty average middle-rode human being, but they jumped on stuff. One of the things that really bothered me, Jason, I don't know if you remember this moment. They asked me, for examples of critical race theory. Yeah, I unfortunately do too. And when I tried to give examples of where I saw CRT infiltrating my kids' schools, the producer who I don't even want to name his name said, yeah, yeah, we know about your son and the little lunches. They were separated and it was so demeaning and disrespectful and unprofessional. I was I was stunned because yeah, this is my kid and he is being separated from his friends at lunch because of the color of their skin. I just don't dig that. Well, Michelle, what they did and what is so shocking is and I talked about this at the beginning of the show is I used to be Dan Lebertard. I considered my best friend in the sports media business. We were very close. Noah's family. I Dan and I and our girlfriend at the time, we vacationed together. The guy was my best friend and what I saw and what really bothered me is like your humanity was completely erased. Michelle Tafoya, a mother, was erased. No, this is Michelle Tafoya, a conservative, a political opponent. And so yes, when you tried to talk about your kid's experience, there was no recognition of that because you weren't a human being. You were just a political opponent that they were there to defeat and none of them. And I don't mean this in any kind of sexist way possible. None of them man enough to take you on one on one. They invited you to a gang initiation and and and Lebertard, the leader of the gang, and two minutes in, he brings you on air and two minutes in, he checks out and turns you over to his little vato, Mike Ryan, who now pretends because it's popular. He's going to pick up his the name Ruiz as well and put that in parentheses and tell you I'm a Latino man. And then I'm an independent and you're like, hey, hey, hey, what's all these labels and all this other stuff? Yeah, it was crazy. I want to play for you because you haven't rewatched it. I've watched three times, I think now. Okay, I want to replay one of your first comments. It maybe was your afterdance introduction, which tried to cast you guys both into little boxes. Here was your first comment, your first response to them. Well, that's then I wouldn't say that you're on the far left. So and I wouldn't, I don't know who sees me on the far right. I mean, I'm a pro choice libertarian. I don't know how that makes me far right. All I am is a fiscal conservative who really wants America to come together and for people to be able to realize their potentials and not be told that they're oppressed or that they are an oppressor. That's that's kind of boils it down for me. I'd like to see some law and order so people don't get hurt. Okay, but no, but let's let's just stop there for a second, right? Because I think one of the things that gets launched here and to me what I struggle with specifically where we earn our living, you know, you on the sidelines of a very big event where we are capitalizing on black bodies and my history in this sport and my talking about race relations for a long time is part of what ends up making me unpopular or or different like some of the ways that you talk about race feel make it feel to me like like the cry for equality feels too much like a threat for my liking. Cry for equality? Yes. Well, what have I said that makes you feel that way? No, I'm not right now. I'm saying things that I have read and what I believe about perhaps things I assume about your viewpoint, but I can't check all the boxes with you because again, I don't know how you feel. You have said your pro your pro life that does not I'm pro choice pro choice. Excuse me. Let's be careful here. Pro choice that does not fit with with the checking of the box is so this is comical. Those were her first comments on the interview. And he jumps to all these conclusions and assumptions and somehow Michelle being a sideline reporter for NFL games were capitalizing on black bodies and somehow your cry for equality or what is she saying? What are you talking about? And that's where I give you credit. It's like instantly you were like, Oh my God, this isn't what I'm expecting. And like Mike Tyson walking across the room against Michael Spinks, you hit him with a knockout blow in the first few minutes. That's why he checked out and turned you over to everybody. Yeah, we didn't hear from the guy for another 10 minutes. I had an interview that it was in there. Jill, I want Jill savages here with me. I'm gonna let her jump in. Hi, Jill. You had to be proud of Michelle. Yeah, absolutely. Michelle, hi, nice to nice to meet you virtually here. I also left the sidelines to jump into the political realm. And I think much like you, it's passion and purpose coming together and in saying that there is a fight that is a little bit bigger than like Jason said, third and long on the sidelines. But for me, when I watched that interview with you, like like Jason was saying, when Dan Levittar let that go on for 10 minutes before he jumped in and he said, Oh, I'm sorry. No, you're not sorry. You let that go on. And then for people that that haven't seen the whole thing at one point, it is an ambush because they not only had the three people on the microphones, but there were about six or seven people within the room. And they would mute those microphones, cut to your camera. And you could tell that they were all trying to get together to figure out what their next question was going to be for you. Yeah, yeah, at one point, I said something and the one guy who was really coming after me again, I'm not going to say his name, he I could slippery because I can see them right on the zoom. And I could see him going, Oh my God, oh my God, I had barely gotten two words out. And he had already decided that whatever it was that I was saying, which he wasn't listening to clearly, was so abhorrent that he turned to the rest of them, like jump in here everyone, what do we need to say next? And it was, it was crazy, crazy is a good word because I felt like I was standing there talking to people who weren't listening. They had their, you know, I was just a pinata, a political pinata, and they were swinging at it. And so it was really uncomfortable, really gross. And again, the reason I felt ambushed was the invitation to me was we'd love to talk about your long, great career and your new podcast. And they did it through a booker. And I'm not going to name her either, because she was absolutely mortified after this happened. She was the one that booked me. She was the one that went through my my channels and found me and found a way found a time booked it. And Lynn later said, can we confirm we want 30 to 40 minutes? Because you've had such a great career. We want to talk all about it. I'm not kidding. I think I sent Jason the the the no, we showed him. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it was, that was the impression I had now shame on me, because I should have done more due diligence on my part. But I was trusting sort of the go-betweens. And and my previous relationship with Dan Levittard, which wasn't at all like yours, Jason, but I had worked with him. He and I co-hosted part in the interruption once together long ago. And there was nothing even close to this. So I was sort of basing it on that, trusting the whole process. And and then, bam, you know, it was like running into a brick wall. Well, I want to go back to the fact that where my disappointment stems from is just the erasure and this whole political divide we have where and again, maybe it's only my experience. And I'm just speaking anecdotally, but I have friends who are leftists, who are atheists, who are who disagree with me politically. I absolutely still adore and love them and would do all the same things I've done my entire life for them and with them. They don't, many of them, I'm not saying all, but many of them don't have that same feeling towards me. And they have completely distance themselves and somehow I'm the enemy. They don't communicate with me or whatever. And that's again, what just so disappointed me is like, this is a colleague, a very respected colleague who your footprint in the political world is so tiny compared to your footprint in the sports world. I don't understand how anybody could see you as some sort of political opponent that needs to be assassinated. And so I was sitting there watching this going like, okay, let's say I had someone on here who on my show that I completely disagree with. And I'm gonna give I'm gonna give a female example, Katie Nolan. I don't think much of her as a but I promise you this. And I've written bad things about Katie Nolan. If I brought her on this show, I would ask her questions, let her talk, ask her more respectful questions, let her talk. It's not about me. It's not about beating her because what they could have done is interviewed you, Dan could have done a whole 30 minute interview. And then they could have discussed the interview afterwards. He could have brought his little his his minions. Well, yes, he's made. Yeah. Well, you know, the other thing that could have happened is they could have asked questions instead of saying it seems like you do not want equality. I mean, where in the hell he ever got that idea? I just don't know. Maybe he's read tweets about me or, you know, people's perspectives of me. But wasn't the point then to ask me and let me clarify my positions, but I never got a chance. You know, I never really got a chance to to answer his questions because they were so certain of who I was and what I stood for that, like you said, my humanity didn't matter. It didn't matter one bit. So I wish that there could have been an actual conversation and a listening a two way conversation. But that was never their intention. And so there I sat. Well, just because I'm a former journalist and no dams work so well. This guy was a great journalist. He made his career interviewing and putting into perspective people who were misunderstood, people who were vilified. If you go back to the 90s and 2000s and study his writing and how he became popular, it was because like, oh, no one will go talk with these black athletes or controversial athletic figures and actually hear their side of the story and put them in a proper framing. I'm going to do it. That's how he elevated. And so I'm looking at, well, how come Michelle Tofoya doesn't deserve an opportunity to define herself and to have open minded people listen to her response because your responses didn't matter because one of the one of the things you did that I sort of disagreed with, but it was a great rope a dope strategy, you actually agreed with several of the things that they said trying to diffuse the situation and say, Hey guys, you got me painted all wrong. I'm actually this and I agree with you on that and blah, blah, blah. And that was, I thought it was, I get why she's doing it because and and I got to say this, Michelle, you should rewatch the interview because I'm you'd looked brilliant and and anybody with a daughter or anybody with a son should go, Hey, go watch this, Michelle Tofoya. This is what strength and intelligence actually looks like under fire. Well, I appreciate that more than you know, I'm curious and I just want to turn the tables a little bit and ask you how where you and Dan Levittard stand today and how a friendship that manifested itself through travel and social and all these different ways that you guys hung out. What happened? Dead spin started attacking me in my second employment with ESPN 2013 to 2015. And dead spin at that time was at the height of its power and bullying people and I was being bullied by a dead spin and Dan, this is my opinion, he'll have a different narrative. But my opinion is that Dan was the sports media personality, probably most attached to me at the time. He needed to decouple himself or he could get hit by the collateral damage, the shots being fired at me, could end up turning on him. And so he started doing little calculating things to distance himself from me. And and to some degree, I understood it and wasn't bothered by it. It got to the point where it was just a bridge too far. And so he started talking about on his show one day about Tommy Craggs, who was the editor at Dead Spin and had written, been involved in writing some really negative stuff about me. And Dan said something celebrating him and Dan knew all the details of what dead spin was doing and how inaccurate it was. But he just didn't have the courage to stand up and stand in the pocket. And and eventually he just backed completely away from me. And I was good with that. Not everybody is built for the kind of fire that I go through. And I understand that it's tough being my friend in this business. You're going to get asked about me. You're going to Whitlock says X, Y, and Z and blah, blah, blah. And so and then he went down a completely different path in terms of that's why he's surrounded by his minions. And it's all calculated again, the the Mike Ryan now pretenses some kind of Latino. And again, I'm not and he I'm sure he is half Latino, but that's not the way he had been presenting himself until it became popular. He got the little black dude Roy, who you know, little suburban black dude that you know, he ain't from the hood where I come from. He you know, he but again, I'm not gonna there's no blueprint for being black, but that he's a black guy that white people are very comfortable with, and he's comfortable being their black guy. And so they they put a little cast of young people together that represent the woke point of view. And they needed some distance for me. And so I gave Dan that distance. I've never been hyper critical of Dan. But I gotta say, I'm just telling you this, this interview has me so far. I just I find it repulsive. That's not the person that I knew. It's not sound journalism. It's not fair. It's unmanly. It's it's it's unmanly. Three guys interviewing one person, let alone a woman. It took three of them to take you on in a secret attack. If if they put in the email, hey, there's gonna be three of us that are going to interview you, you're going on to talk with Dan Levittar, because you're Michelle Tafoya, the sideline reporter on the number one show in America. You're not, oh, I'm giving up this 30 minutes to engage with some producer and another jack off I've never heard of. You know, I know, you know what, that part of what you just said, I want to point out, I really appreciate because later I thought to myself, I don't have a lot of extra time these days. I've got two teenagers. I've got a job. And so when I do these kinds of interviews, I generally assume they're going to be professional. Even if I disagree with the person on the other side, that's fine. I can handle it. But I expected it to be a professional conversation. And it was the furthest thing from it. And I think that's what was so heinous about it and so ugly about it. And I guess there was even another person on their show. I'm hearing this that didn't even think I was worth their time because of my stances, because of my opinions, like why are we having her on? And you know, that is so problematic today that we are not looking at each other as human beings, that we're looking each other as like these these commodities of hate, you know, these these these little blocks of like he said, checking boxes. I mean, it's so disturbing to me that that's where we are. And I like to believe in, and I talked to a guy the other day who writes for the dispatch who told me there is a huge chunk of people that are called the exhausted majority. And a lot of them are just stepping out of the conversation because they are exhausted. I can tell you my husband's one of them. He has been for a long time. And he does take, you know, he's got to be married to me. And so if one of his clients doesn't agree with my decision, you know, he's got a sort of tip toe around that. And you know, he but he supports me because he knows me. And because he respects me. And because I'm human. And so for it to go that far a field was just staggering to me. And you know, thank you for acknowledging that I gave them I gave them 30 minutes 45 minutes of my day for them to just attack. Michelle, you made the mistake though of talking while conservative. And so they had to come at you for that. And this to me is one of the biggest problems that we see everybody knows that the media is leftist. The sports media is more leftist than the overall media. And they never have any checks and balances on them. So if there is one or two of us that do step out, this is what's going to happen. And it's so it's not fair. It never should happen this way. But we're we're this hopefully will be the first instance where we actually see some pushback on this. That that that is why I left my job. I was speaking to a young woman the other day who basically thinks I'm crazy for leaving what is arguably the most coveted sideline job in sports. And I made this decision years ago. This wasn't this year that I made I made this decision in 2018 that I saw a country starting to fray. I wanted to be able to talk about it. I wanted to be able to be open about my thoughts about it. But I respected the image of Sunday night football. They didn't want to court controversy. They asked me if they never stopped me from doing anything. I've spoken conservative events. I've emcee conservative events. They never quashed that. I want to make that really clear. But when I started entertaining the idea of a podcast, they asked, can you just hold off? We agree with 95% of what you're saying. But we just don't want to bring this on to Sunday night football. You know what? I respected that because that's a that's a company with a product which is Sunday night football that does extraordinarily well for the company. And I'm part of that product. And I didn't want to bring shade to that. So I said, yes, I will hold off. Here's my notice. And that was 2018. I thought 2019 was going to be my last season. They asked me to get them through 2020 with the Super Bowl. Our Super Bowl got pushed to 2021, the 2021 season. So I hung in there, I hung in there. And so, but this is what I've wanted to do. I feel that we need some sane voices. I don't think of myself as what those people think of me. I think of myself as very common sense, middle ground, representing a lot of people who are afraid to talk. They're afraid to post on their Facebook page or Twitter, because they're afraid of that backlash. I'm not afraid. I've been through it. I'm not afraid. And someone's got to stand up and say, I'm not apologizing for this opinion. I'm not afraid of you. You can bully me all you want. You can try to silence me. I'm still going to talk. And until more people stop apologizing. What once you apologize a little? Oh my gosh, they'll keep coming after you and keep coming after you until you shut up. That's what the the real left. I'm not just talking about I'm not talking about actual liberalism and all Democrats. I'm talking about the left really wants they want us to all shut up. They want to bully us and scare us into shutting up. Instead of engaging in actual debate with facts and values and things that really pertain to that debate, they don't want to do that. It's either because they're too lazy or because they don't have the facts on their side or combination thereof. So they just show up with bull horns and they yell until you shut up. They yell until no one can hear you. I that's not America. That is not America. And so, you know, look, my dad was in a span is family immigrated here through from started in Spain down through Peru came up. He always taught me I lived in the greatest country in the world. And I still believe that with the faults and imperfections that every country on God's green Earth has and we've had hours and we still have hours, but we're still the freest nation and and and unless we keep apologizing and being cow by this left heavy handedness, we have to stop. We need more courage. We need more courage and less apology. And and so I just wanted to participate in that courage. I'm gonna I gotta keep hammering this because there's a couple other points and I'm sorry for being this passionate about this because I do want to talk about your passion, Jason. Don't apologize. All right. So again, this is somewhat personal for me because again, I know Dan, brother, both parents, the whole his parents are fled Cuba. His parents fled Cuba. They're not leftist. They're not. This is a money play that Dan's not a leftist. This is about money. Wet finger in the air. Everybody in sports media is getting paid for their leftist point of view and he's he's cashing in on that with either DraftKings or Fandall or whom ever him and John Skipper or whatever are doing that. But but here's my when when you're these pretend leftist and these pretend woke people and and the whole rigged up cowardliness of the whole thing. I just and again, because I know Dan and I know his career so well, Charles Barkley does not have one opinion that's any different than Michelle Tafoya. Charles Barkley does not. I'm friends with Charles Barkley. Dan's friends with Charles Barkley. Dan loves to have Charles Barkley on his show. Charles Barkley thinks virtually everything Michelle Tafoya thinks and says so publicly. Dan Levittard would never allow two little jackoffs to browbeat and try to bully Charles Barkley. It would never happen. Dan would have even I've seen Dan snap on these guys. I've said Dan would have said what shut up what are you doing? Take the camera off and take shut that mic off. This is Charles Barkley. This is not how we talk to Charles Barkley. Jim Brown, friend of mine. The all-time great football friend of mine friend of Dan Levittard. Jim Brown doesn't think anything different than Michelle Tafoya. Jim Brown comes on Dan show. Dan wouldn't let two little jackoffs talk to Jim Brown the way he allowed these two little jackoffs to talk to Michelle Tafoya. Dan Levittard wouldn't hide in a corner while two little jackoffs try to browbeat Jim Brown or Charles Barkley. This is sexism. Oh wow. This is sexist behavior. It's it's clear anybody and I'm not going to drag any of Dan and I's mutual friends into this but there's some of the highest profile people in sports media. They know Dan. They know all of this that I'm talking about. Dan should be embarrassed. His friends should be embarrassed for him. They know everything that I'm Charles Barkley believes everything Michelle Tafoya believes. Go find me the tape and they've had Charles Barkley on their show 50 times in the last 10 years. Find me the tape of them trying to do Charles Barkley this way. This is sexism. sexism does exist and I know I get accused of it or you know because I'm allegedly conservative because I have a biblical worldview I'm supposed to be the sexist pig. Find me the tape of me doing this to any if Maria Taylor came on this show and I didn't like the way Maria Taylor exited ESPN and I wrote critical things of her. If she came on this show I would treat her like she was my mama or my sister. She would have plenty of time to talk. I wouldn't allow someone else or contribute or anybody to talk disrespectfully to make little mocking faces to try to embed. Michelle Tafoya is a grown ass woman with a decorated career and he led two little children try to mock her on his show. This is sexist. You know I hadn't even thought of this until you brought it up and it's amazing and the reason your view of this holds water with me is because you know him so well and you know you've watched him conduct these other interviews. I should have probably done that a few times before I went on but even then as you said if he talked to people like minded people like Barkley like Jim Brown and gave them the curtices that he gave them I probably would have would have still talked to my would have expected the same thing I would have expected to have that courtesy extended to me. That is an amazing thought and you know I I've always said I'm not going to use the woman card I'm not going to use the sexist card because I mean that's how I've approached my whole career. Everyone said to me how are you going to survive in a man's world? How have you how have you flourished in a man's world? And I've always said who says it's a man's world? I didn't say that. I walked into it saying I'm a journalist and I'm going to go compete against other journalists. I don't care who they are where they come from or what their gender is or their their biological say I don't care I'm going to do a job and I'm going to work really really really really hard at it until I'm as good as I want to be and so I never ever wanted to play that card but you make a compelling point. I would absolutely agree that this was a sexist play because they would never come in and do this to a man and just let it go on like we've been saying throughout the show time after time just the muting of the microphones getting together huddling up what are we going to say to her next and when you are giving your points and they would take you from one topic to another and really when when you're a conservative they just want to call you a racist bigoted sexist homophobe and if they can get there in any way they will and they will not want to hear your argument because they don't believe that what you have to say is of any value they just need to get their talking points in let you be the dummy that is taking the body blows and get as far down this road but what are they even accomplishing when they're doing that right like speaking to the choir that's a perfect question to ask to what end was this interview conducted to to prove a point to prove that I am some sort of devil was that there was that their goal to what end does does that have any productive contribution to the world to what end and that's the question I asked too about you know when they have these affinity groups at my kids schools where they separate kids out because of their race or their ethnicity and have these little powwows and kind of make the other kids go why why is this happening to what end who does that help wouldn't we be better served by keeping all these kids together to discuss their different opinions different experiences different world views and find some common ground I mean that to me and exchange of ideas is what education is what school should be about but we've divided into this tribalism and they were trying to hit me on everything their Florida law the don't say gay bill which again to what end what do we accomplish by teaching kindergarten through grade three by integrating into the curriculum of those precious valuable years anything about gender or sex or sexual or anything about that what to what end I mean I want my kid to learn to read add you know let's have some art time let's have some music time let's talk about history let's talk about things that pertain to K through three and you want to call that homophobic that sorry well here's what I'm going to do because there's another name I'm going to drop here that's involved in this john skipper who you know is partnered with Dan on metal ark media I know john skipper john skipper hired me and worked with me for two years at ESPN and eventually fired me john skipper loves to purport to be this great friend a female journalist particularly ones that he can flirt with but I'll leave that alone for now but I'm going to put this interview in front of john skipper and and I'm going to ask him as you know he and Dan oh you an apology and I'm going to put this in front of john skipper and and I'm going to put it in front of Dan as well uh and just say hey man what are y'all doing seriously because again you're after what in I'm going to tell you what the it what it feels like looks like to me is that when you have a guilty conscience when you're when you have sold out for money to this degree when you have betrayed all the values that you use to build your career and again Dan lebotar for many years 15 20 years was in the conversation for the best sports journalist working in america at that time he intentionally sought out the misunderstood and explained their story sought out the reviled and explained their story was a friend to people that the rest of the media treated poorly kind of like how you're being treated poorly and others that anybody that sticks to any kind of conserved value he used to be the guy that would come in and say hey i'm not going to treat this person like a pariah i'm going to treat them like a human being they're one of you know i don't know if he was religious or not but they're one of god's creatures as well let's hear them out let's let the world judge them based on what they what they say and again lebotar john skipper in particular pretends to be a friend to female sports journalist i'm not trying to feed you gas but if someone spends a decade on america's number one television show america's number one sporting event does it is such a high level i can't for i've never heard anyone say a disparaging word about michelle tafoe and i've been in this business and i'd love to hear disparaging comments about anybody i i seek it out i can't find anybody that's ever said anything about michelle tafoe so this is an accomplished and before i knew michelle tafoe you can go look at because i don't know michelle michelle that well uh but before i knew i was say it's like this is this is great this is the epitome of how you handle the sidelines and and so if you can treat someone like that the way they did john skipper i need to know what's going on with john skipper what's going on with dan lebotar where where have they pivoted or are they sure they're being consistent with the values they built their brands on and built their names on this is not how you treat oh anybody at the top of their profession but certainly a woman at the top of her profession in a field that have been dominated by men there should have been the utmost respect she should have gotten more respect than Charles barkley it's easier for barkley to do what he does than for michelle tafoe to have done what she did and i'm just sorry it's easier uh for barkley and for me again i say it all the time find me the woman as fat as me who's had my career find me one find me one one who's had my career it's easier for us even as a black man if you can be my side and there was times when i was on esp and i was nearly 400 pounds find me the woman that that gets that opportunity gets the paychecks i got from esp and fox sports who get to be a hundred and fifty two hundred pounds overweight and this is what we're doing i it's uh it's so interesting you're looking at this from so many interesting perspectives that i hadn't even considered and it this is enlightening for me and and even though i was the one that that lived through those really uncomfortable moments and minutes and what seemed like eternity and i will tell you this too there was one moment in the whole thing jason in both of you that i thought should i and this this is stupid should i end this but in that split second while i was making that decision i knew what would happen if i did i would be called a coward i would be called all kinds of things for back you know for oh she couldn't handle the heat and so in that split second it was it was a split second that i had this inner monologue going on i said you just take a breath and hang in there because they would love it if you would stomp off angry and you're not going to do that so it it really was a decision in the middle of it that you know and and i've listened i talked to another friend of dan levittards and i'm not going to mention this person's name because i didn't ask to i didn't get permission but i called this person later and i said this is what happened and the person said to me you should have called me before you went on there the last time i went on there was about seven years ago and i told dan i'd never do it again i told dan i wouldn't work with him i told dan i would if he were my employee i would fire him but there's still there's still friends but this human being that told me this said yeah i would have told you not to go on hmm now i'm not as familiar with his content as i used to be when he was a radio show in miami and so dan and i disconnected probably around 2015 2016 somewhere and so i'm not as familiar you know i would occasionally catch what what they were doing and i could see the the pivot to the left uh hardcore and i'm sitting there a little man the family fled cuba fled this progressive communist marxis the whole day i you know maybe i don't know maybe maybe they all voted for uh jimmy carter and i i don't but that's not my impression i got from meeting his family and engaging with his family the the values that i saw him implement that made him great again i jmichael you have no idea to know this but again this is where i'm just sitting here his demonization of you dan lemeter once wrote the heat we're playing the the new york nicks in a playoff game and dan basically called petri you in a monkey and gotten all kinds of trouble he in a column and not he didn't didn't slip out of his mouth to blah blah in a column he basically called petri you in a monkey it set off all this controversy and uh me and a few other uh black people jumped to defend him and be like again because it wasn't those exact words but that was the inference and he gotten a lot of heat forward and the people you know defended him at the time so he he's he's faced the vilification of right the left and being taken out of context and and having an inappropriate moment try to use to define all of you uh he's been through that and so to see him turn around and join the whole lynch mob is is just embarrassing and and i just the to not give you the respect don't be offended you know i won't be don't be offended but like if if if he had invited Jill Savage on the show and let mike ryan and roybella me start throwing in questions i don't know i i kind of get it okay yeah Jill Savage is is you know she's a cut below dan levittar but michelle tafoya is a peer of dan levittars their same aid set same level of accomplishment she's coming on the show specifically to engage with dan and and and michelle i don't know if you know this i want and just and there's a clip the very first clip i asked for is dan's original introduction of you as a guest on the show this is 15 minutes before you came on the air and so i want to play i want to play that clip just to say this is intentional what he did they were trolling you and using you to court controversy and chaos i just don't see how you do it to michelle tafoya but do we i think we have that clip justin uh if we could play that your michelle tafoya is around the corner put on the pole please roy at levittard show how's tafoya gonna go chaos inflammatory awkward or cordial are your choices michelle tafoya will be here in a second do you think they recorded that clip after after the interview i just wonder if they recorded that after the interview i really do because by then he no no no they did they did they did yeah because one he's wearing two different outfits he's got a different hat on in that interview than the hat that he wore in yours but again this goes back to intent and then reveling in hey we're gonna treat michelle tafoya disrespectfully here in about 15 minutes guys hit the polls and wait till you see what we do to michelle tafoya you're gonna love it you know i i don't believe it you don't well i know i do i i can i can see that that is the way that it goes but to jason's point of they should have never treated you with this level of disrespect like internally in my mind the fact that you could go on their show and be just cast aside like this the the fact that they would just attack you the way that they did i just in my heart i don't want to believe that that's even possible yeah you and me both chill now we both know that it is you know i have a friend who is an author who once talked to me about twitter in this way and he said it there is a sport out there of who can i get who's the most famous person i can get to retweet or get angry with me about my tweet and it's i think they called it fishing or something i don't remember what this what they named this but this feels kind of like that in retrospect and with this conversation and with seeing that let's see how badly we can beat her up you know thinking if they think that i am a big name which i i i don't know it was that their mission just to say who's the the biggest name we can get that we can we can absolutely throttle i don't know well i wish they would try Charles Barkley next that that would impress me or you know what give me a call uh you know after watching after watching you beat him up i i'd love to get a piece of of that group of idiots that was molaria and curly uh and and what what's what's comical is they weren't even aware that they had gotten beaten up that's how stupid they were you know and i kind of as you said i was doing this rope adobe and to a certain extent yes i guess i was i think sometimes when people are that convinced of their opinions and and and even stupid or ignorant ones i kind of think you know what am i missing what what memo didn't i read what book didn't i get in college that that taught these guys this where they go with this but i've had i've had a lot of people reach out to me and say these guys misspoke there was misinformation there was disinformation there were lies there were they don't understand what is being taught what isn't being taught yada yada so the bottom line is they were just spewing crap and i i was trying to make sure i didn't go down a rabbit hole that was going to reflect negatively on me i wanted to be true my values and i think that i was but i also didn't want to get so much in the dirt with them that i looked as bad as they did they live in a bubble and they are never questioned about their beliefs the way that conservatives are questioned on a daily basis everything that they hear from culture and media reflects what they believe so then when they actually have somebody that they can go up against they say oh you know like let's attack but they they don't think that anybody is ever going to see it from the viewpoint that the three of us are sitting here talking about but so i i do want to i want to i want to pivot a little bit and give my my small little criticism or i'll take it okay yeah at one at one point you let them talk you into basically saying america was founded on racism and slavery and and i completely reject that and don't think it's a factual interpretation of america in america started in let's say in 1619 the country's founded in 1776 slavery was a global phenomena yes at that time yes it was a global phenomena so it it was a continuation of what was going on around the globe it we didn't come over here and let's start this country so we can have slavery they had slavery in england until 1833 right and they ended anyway we were 30 years after england in abolishing slavery our bad we're a new country they're a much older country and had a lot longer time to deal with and correct that than we had so we're 30 years behind them hats off yeah our our leaders by the way listen by having a i don't know 300 years start yeah go ahead and i agree with you no i i don't mean to interrupt i agree with you and i think you know i i i the notion that we were that there were slaves yeah people love to ignore the fact that this was a worldwide phenomenon they want to make it a it was an american thing we hate america because of it we should still punish everyone in america because of it all of that and and i i don't agree with that i think in that moment and i and i'm not totally clear on every word that was said but yes we used slavery to build a lot of the the institutions that we had in have in america so i i don't agree that the country was built on slavery and i don't believe it was built for slavery and some people even go that far that it was built purely to be a slave nation that's not true so i'm on the same page with you and yeah i probably stepped in it there i think it was roped them yeah well i think i was i think it was a brilliant strategy i really do because i'm watching in the moment yeah you're in the moment and you're like oh my god these guys want to fight and so and they're coming at you from all the and so i'm gonna give them this one just so to see if i can because again you you weren't there to fight and so you know let me give them this and maybe this will end the fight and we can actually have a productive conversation i saw that going through your head i'm gonna give you another little tactic to take just in case this ever happens to you again another little tactic they love to do and it's uh the roy bellamy when they brought him in roy come on in here and brought and this dude uh they didn't even tell us that the movie the watchmen had to tell us about the totsomasticer and and they don't teach that in history and and i'm just like hey guys every incident every thing that happened in america is not going to be taught in us history or your kids will never leave us history class there will if we taught everything and so here's what i'll say here let me give you another example of what's never taught in us history the guy in a tragedy Jim Jones no no and this is what people don't understand that was predominantly black people that Jim Jones a Marxist communist hostile to god he's a former minister he talks these people into joining him in guy and mostly black people gets them to disavow their christian views adopt this marxist views and these communist views and get some to kill themselves that was a black tragedy more traumatic than Tulsa more dead black bodies in guy in american dead black bodies in guy in a trick by a progressive leftist marxist teaching the same ideology that they're now trying to subtly sneak into schools that's a tragedy that they are not teaching in u.s.a there's all kinds of things and black people we've been convinced and their little liberal friends have been convinced that you know what black history is it's a series of tragedies that must be taught and i reject that because nobody no country no other ethnic group teaches their history as a series of tragedies and things that were done to them people teach history about what they accomplished and what they overcame and what they did and so to sit here and to get the roy is a young person and maybe he's an idiot maybe he does no research on his own but america has not hid from its racist past it has not no anytime the number one television show basically in the history of america is roots and i would suggest if you haven't watched it everybody needs to go watch it everybody in my generation did watch it other than a super bowl the final episode of roots is the most popular thing i think in the history of american tv we haven't hid from it at all we've not not only have we not hid from it we had a civil war and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives addressing it we had a civil rights movement where people died addressing it and so some history some of these little details of what happened in individual cities you got to go find out for yourselves and do the research yourself if that's what floats your boat there are a lot of people and and this will never be told or taught but doug Williams and i are still friendly we used to be more friendly but doug Williams a great NFL quarterback he used to talk to me about eddie robison in his philosophy as gramley's coach and you know i'm not sure if doug would repeat the story now but he used to tell me this all the time eddie robison never talked to his players or his kids about racism this is what doug Williams told me and he said because eddie robison wanted those kids to leave gramley university feeling like they were king kong and could take on the world and feeling like nothing could stop them and so he never wanted to convince them that there were these forces out there that were going to stop him so he never talked about racism because he wanted him looking in the windshield constantly because there's more opportunity in the windshield than in the rear view mirror the left and people like jim jones that talked a bunch of black people in the commitment suicide and people like dan lebertar who who have no legitimate interest in black people moving ahead they want us constantly looking in the rear view mirror and say oh you didn't tell me that happened in my rear view mirror oh you didn't tell me this therefore you're my old presser people looking in the rear view mirror often crash into the opportunities instead of seizing and taking advantage of the opportunities in front of them they crash and never get a chance to accomplish them and that's what this obsession yeah with oh my god you got to know every tragedy that happened or you've been denied your history i wonder how many of i wonder how many of the no and and by the way one of my favorite books of all time and i know i'm getting people are gonna go oh she's wanted to say this to make herself look virtuous no one of my favorite books of all time is book or tea washington up from slavery because he did exactly that he looked ahead of him he constantly looked for opportunities no matter how small and worked his tail off to accomplish so many so many amazing things i wonder how many people know about his history i i i just wonder you know if we're going to talk about all the bad where's the recognition of all of the tremendous stories out there and uh yeah it's i feel like this is kind of people hang on to this issue because it is contentious because politicians can fundraise off of it and because if we all just said hey let's let's get along there wouldn't be that opportunity to fight about other things and so we name call and we label people and it's constant right now and and you know if you're not racist you're white supremacist if you're not that you're homophobic or you're anti lgbtq if you're pro life even if you're a woman who's pro life you're anti woman i happen to be pro choice with exceptions and you know i i don't think that if you're eight months pregnant it's probably a good idea to have an abortion that's just me but uh this this this constant battling over these hot button issues and you know today as you and i are talking rovey wade was overturned and instead of getting to work if nancy polosi wants this codified so badly then get to work and write a law instead of calling supreme court justices names potentially making them targets as we've seen they have been that's not leadership that's not leadership i we're dying for real legitimate leadership i i don't know where it is jason i don't know where it is i don't know when it's coming i'm not sure if it's if it's coming uh the whole system seems rigged to pit us against each other and yes to see the worst in each other and again you can get sponsorships and you know just i i don't i i'm sorry for being this passionate about it that you know we spent a whole hour talking about but i'm damn just this because i know damn i know what he used to stand for i know what to see a great journalist pivot like this and to treat you a human being a good person it i disagree with you on the pro-choice thing that make you a bad person right doesn't make me a great person or it you know uh it it but my god if you can't see the humanity of a mother coming on and talking about what her kids are experiencing in school and just let her talk about that and even if you want even after you let her go and say well that's just one story and that's her take but again how come a parent voice can't be heard because that's what you were you were a parent not some political operative coming on his show it just uh so anyway what what's going on what are you doing on sideline sanity we're trying to bring sanity into the conversation we are treating guests with respect and listening i'm doing a lot of listening and a lot of learning and i think people are along with me and we bounce around from topics my first guest was Bob Costes he and i have a lot of political differences a lot but we're friends we're friends you know we are we remain friends um and and then you know we'll we'll we've had a really great array Tony Dungy we've had on we haven't just had sports people on we've had a lot of writers a lot of really just interesting thought leaders and you can find us at sideline sanity and we're all the all the podcasters are found and it's brand new you know i think we're three four weeks in now and it's going great and i'm just enjoying it because i'm enjoying having deeper conversations than what 30 seconds on the sideline can allow me and i'm enjoying having civil conversations and demonstrating for people that they are possible and that they are productive and that they can learn something from someone who has a different point of view from them so that's that's what i'm trying to do and i am just so grateful you took the time to talk to me by the way Jason Whitlock is appearing on sideline sanity next week so that'll be good and i can't wait to talk to you about a lot of this stuff it's your perspective is unique it's valuable it's important you're you you are courageous and we are we are experiencing a huge dearth of courage in this country we need more we need more we need more people to just it's and we need people to have arguments based on facts when people after Roe v. way get overturned said abortion is now illegal in the United States that's false that is false that is not what happened with this decision not at all so people need to take a breath and understand and of course while we're all begging to be taught American history what about civics so people do understand this stuff uh trying to explain it to my 13 year old daughter today was was interesting because there's so much involved and it's not easy but it's it's the country that we live in we need to understand the constitution and what what we stand for michael thank you so much um just for going out on a limb i know you know we are we are doing very similar things you're at a much viral level myself but don't say that don't say that i but i i love that you have the courage right and that's what it takes it's not going to be all of these other people over there that are going to save this country it's going to be Jason doing his show it's going to be you doing your show whatever i can do we all have to look at ourselves now and say what are we going to do about this yeah yeah it's very easy to just float along with the tide whatever tide whatever direction it's going i i don't want to float i don't like the direction the tide is going so even if it means swimming against the current which is hard work is worth doing right Jason it is worth doing uh michael i got to say this and we're gonna i hope i don't get in trouble i didn't realize you had such athletic arms i can't when i come to sideline uh sideline sanity i'm gonna are you a former athlete i'm i'm still a bit of an athlete but i'm not like a basketball player or i just i just i work out man i work out thank you thank you michael great to see you thank you very much thank you all right uh that's tomorrow won't see you tomorrow that'll be sunday i'll see you monday Believe me by My Wall Free i forgive cheersM footwear Look at all the parts I'm looking like inside of you"
