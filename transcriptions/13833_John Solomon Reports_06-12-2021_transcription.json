You're thinking oh man We just got done with the 2021 let me celebrate the Virginia election Well guess what the 2022 election is just around the corner and Republicans already jump started their efforts to take over Congress Both the House and Senate leading the efforts is Congresswoman Elise Stefanik the House Republican Conference chairwoman and founder of elevate back E-pack is as it goes by on the street Her mission is to get more women elected to Congress now. Let's take a step back after the 2018 election We heard from the polling we heard from the pundits we heard from the media experts that Republicans were in trouble with women Particularly in the suburbs while that concerned Congresswoman Stefanik She jumped into action and she began a recruitment effort and in 2020 all those concerns that were lingering from the 2018 race They were evaporated 36 women three dozen Republican women so elected to Congress the largest number in the history of America and Congresswoman Stefanik is not done yet. She wants to beat that record in 2022 The Republicans need only a half dozen seats or so on the house to take back control And she has her first eight women that she's picked to challenge Democrats in key election races This is going to be one of the big storylines in the election next year Republicans women Latino voters all coming back And tonight you're gonna get to meet those first eight women They come from great backgrounds from being helicopter pilots in the Navy to volunteering With a foreign aid on the ground in Afghanistan to running private companies large companies health care policy They've come with incredible background incredible zeal and you're gonna see why Elise Stefanik is So excited about this group of eight now We're gonna take you inside and talk to each one of the candidates tonight But first we had a chance to go over the Republican National Committee earlier this week and watch the press conference where Congresswoman Stefanik Rolled out these eight candidates. She really talked about why she thinks 2022 is the year of the woman Listen to the soundbite in 2022. We are going to build on EPAC success We're going to double down and we now have a record-breaking number of over 200 Republican women who have filed to run for Congress That's more this cycle than it was at this same point last cycle We know that when strong Republican run for office strong Republican win and they flip districts These women that are here with me today are the first slate of EPACs endorsed candidates And as I said they will lead the way in firing Nancy Pelosi once and for all Yeah, you really get a sense folks that Stefanik is very high on these lawmakers these future lawmakers some of them are ready in Local races. They've won state Senate seats. They've won county commission seats A real battle tested group, but they are ready to go to the next level now during the news conference my colleague Nick Balasie here at just the news he asked a couple of these candidates why they thought this was their year Why would they jump in from the work they're doing now as moms and fighter pilots and and jag lawyers? Listen to what they have to say. So first I wanted to ask you for the candidates What are the top issues that you see? Will most likely drive suburban voters to the Republicans in 2022 specifically suburban women voters? Sure, I'll let some of suburban districts want to pop up great Sure, I'm happy to directly answer that so as I mentioned earlier Kansas 3 is a largely suburban district in the south of Kansas City And I will tell you that in my district there are two drivers first It really is about the economy and it really is about the pocketbook when it comes to voters in our district inflation Consistently I've already had driveway events since last summer consistently comes up as a top issue for people because they're feeling the pinch At the gas pump, but they are at the grocery store too having you know, everybody just experienced experienced it last week at Thanksgiving When we actually did the math and we looked at what is the differential if you take into consideration? Rising wages, but then the impact of inflation. It's still somewhere between $1,500 to $2,000 in the negative for people in our district so that is the Overall issue that is driving a lot right now But related to that keep in mind people are people recognize that a lot of that is due to Federal spending and an influx of money that's in the system So they are very very frustrated by the overreach of the federal government and by all the spending so limited government The cycle is going to be a huge huge issue. I'm finding and Jeanine Thank you, that is a great question I can tell you in northern Virginia, which we all know is a blue area We saw a ground movement of suburban moms coming back to our party because of two key issues The critical race theory that has shoved down parents and kids throats They are rejecting that and also just the nonsense of soft on crime Obviously they care about public safety and they certainly care about what their kids are learning in public schools and Glenn Yunken highlighted how how key those issues are so I I'm excited that the idea of taking Education and winning with it because of our common sense policies and we are about you know Uniting America not dividing us certainly on the color of our skin and that's what the four left is all about today So thank you for that question. All right. Well if that doesn't get your appetite started for some politics I don't know what well we're gonna take a quick commercial break when we come back We're gonna start off with our own exclusive interview with Congresswoman Stefanik and why I mean she's gonna answer the question Why did she set out to pick these eight women?

Where did that change occur? How did that change occur? Well when I ran for office in 2014 There were a number of women's groups that invested early in my race But it really wasn't an overall effort for the party since I had been in Congress in 2018 Which was a very difficult year for Republicans? We lost a number of seats and we were down to only 13 Republican women that was at a crisis point I mean it was a historic low when at the same time in Congress there was over 100 women in total And Democrats ran a number of very strong women candidates during that cycle because it was a problem I made an EPAC's mission to invest and recruit and endorse Republican women to help change that and 2020 was a proof of a successful model We went from 13 to over 30 Republican women and there were a lot of naysayers of my effort when I announced it But these women are extraordinary. They are incredible candidates and success leads to more success John So I think you know the word has been out there that there are organizations like EPAC that will invest early recruit and endorse women who have the strength of candidacy to win and flip these districts and today we had our EPAC launch I endorsed a number of our first slate candidates from Virginia to Pennsylvania to Texas To Kansas so all over the country and we think they're going to lead the way to fire Nancy Pelosi once and for all You look at the slate You've got fighter pilots get women who worked on the front lines it could bow women on the front lines of the healthcare industry lawyers People making a difference disrupting politics What excites you about this group of eight the first group that you've endorsed this year? Well, it's so funny I was just saying to some of our supporters that I get so excited to hear their personal story So as you pointed out, you know, we have a former veterans. We have our former military officers We have health care experts. We have lawyers. We have successful business women We have women who are very involved in combating addiction So they have incredible personal stories that inspires me because I want to work hard so that they can serve as my colleagues Because I know they will be tremendous voices for their districts and that they have what it takes to flip these really tough districts In a year that should be a strong year for Republicans and almost all of these women are in districts at Biden one Just a few just a little over a year ago Then you have the young can revolution show and you can swing the state ten points very quickly What gives you a confidence that these districts are gonna flip? Well, if you look at the polling We've never been in a stronger position the generic ballot for Republicans has never been stronger and I don't take that You know, we're not measuring the drapes. We're not taking this for granted We are making sure that we are speaking to the issues that matter to the American people What I hear from my constituents and what many of these women candidates are hearing from their future constituents Challenges of inflation government overreach this war on parents and students that we saw a play out firsthand in Virginia a Crisis of crime the border crisis that really is a national issue It's not just a southern border issue These issues matter to the American people and Joe Biden has failed again and again and again and Nancy Pelosi and her Democrats Have failed as well. So I think on every issue that matters to the American people Republican pull better because we opposed the far left agenda that unified Democrat government is pushing on the American people and we present solutions for example supporting our law enforcement Investing in border security raining in our federal spending supporting parents We've introduced a parental bill of rights and that's gonna be a big part of our agenda going into next November When you look out at what will the question that this election turn on every election has that moment in the question is What do the American people want? What do you think the 2022 question will boil down to I? think the 2022 question is a Grade on Joe Biden Joe Biden's failed presidency This was a candidate who ran on bringing the nation together who gave his inaugural address on being bipartisan And we have seen everything but that we have seen the most partisan far left president In our nation's history if you look at this reconciliation package the quoted build back better Which is actually build back broke. It's going to bankrupt America It has more far left provisions than any other piece of legislation in our nation's history Whether it's taking over childcare whether it's numerous tax increases the largest spending bill in our nation's history So I think this midterm elections is really going to be a grade of Joe Biden And I think he's failed and the American people believe he's failed Well, we're gonna be able to see that play out over the next year congresswoman Thank you so much for inviting us here today and also for giving us these insights. Thank you All right, folks, we're gonna take a quick commercial break when we come back more from the candidates that are gonna try to make history in 2022 All right folks, you know what I love the shredded lettuce and a double double and the fruit filling in a donut But well, they're great tasting and they're awesome.

Field of greens is my explanation All right, our first candidate is joining us Esther joy King from Illinois. You're running from so great to be here Yeah, your second time running, but you have an amazing Career in public service. You were an aid worker on the front lines in Kabul You came back your army captain in the Jad Corps, which we're very grateful for You watched our withdrawal from Afghanistan this summer How did it resonate personally with you with all the time you spent there and then also with your constituents? Yeah, so John it's a really personal question for me because yes I spent time in Afghanistan as a woman's rights worker, but beyond that my parents my mom and dad I was raised as a Christian missionary in Mexico That's what they how they served when I was growing up But when I was in Afghanistan my mom and dad came to visit me and they said you know what Afghanistan needs support and love and so they moved to Kabul and started a school in Kabul Wow, so when everything was happening in August with the botched withdrawal by the Biden administration I watched my parents thankfully were safely in the US, but the their students their teachers I said I've got to do something so I jumped into action and yes I'm a captain in the army. I worked my military networks. I started calling everybody I know hey, do you know anyone that's at the Kabul airport is do you know anyone that's on the ground can do you know anyone that can help? Running for Congress. I worked my political networks as well and Thankfully we were able to get 51 young girls the high school students and teachers out of Afghanistan It was like the Wild Wild West and it gave me a front row seat to the chaos and the negligence of the Biden administration of Lincoln and Even the Secretary of Defense and I will say all my opinions are my own. They're not endorsed by the Department of Defense But it it I was already inspired to run and was running for Congress, but after that experience I just lit on fire because what is happening in Washington DC under the Biden administration is So Negligent to the American people and that is what I hear every day on the ground with people They're embarrassed about what happened in Afghanistan and it's we're seeing crisis after crisis after crisis Afghanistan is just one example we have inflation the most expensive Thanksgiving we've ever had in the history of our country I mean people are mad and so you asked me ultimately what I'm hearing on the ground is people are not okay with what Washington DC is up to Right now and they want to be heard they want to matter in the political process And that's why I'm running for Congress such an important point listening to constituent Washington seems So detached from that. I know exactly when you look out now you ran in the district to stay The last election you were an earthquake because no one saw that district coming as close as you came four points at a very blue district It's now been moved to toss up. What is the dynamic on the ground and what are the issues that are resonating with your constituents? You're exactly right We just went through a redistricting process and man oh man is the Illinois Democrat process corrupt they control the whole gerrymandering redistricting process in Illinois and they tried to do their worst to my district in Illinois 17th But even in they're very worst the problem that they're up against is we are trending Republican in Illinois People have known at the state level were extremely corrupt in Illinois at the federal level we're seeing the failure of far left progressive policies and Democrats in Illinois are saying no more and they're turning Republican so the the dynamics on the ground is When when I as a Republican candidate show up. I'm willing to have the conversation like you said listen People want to be part of this movement this effort to bring a voice to our part of the state and not just be Be destined to whatever the blue Chicago vote whatever way they go We want to have a voice of our own in this process people know what one party rule feels like and they're looking for that alternative Right, yeah, well, we're gonna be watching this race very closely and I really appreciate the time I said today, but then also all your public service Yes It's really my honor to serve our country in the US military and then this running for Congress is a step beyond in service to our country And I'd love to have anyone that wants to join be a part if you want to give or volunteer You can go to ester for congress calm. It's esth For Congress calm. It's pretty easy to remember. Thanks. Thanks so much for your time All right, we're so lucky to have joining us right now Amanda Atkins She's running for congressional seat in Kansas a mom an entrepreneur Someone who's on the ground helping everyday people and now running for Congress Amanda welcome. Well, thank you so much You look at Kansas. It's struggling with inflation We see prices up and they talk about an inflation tax. How is that playing on the ground as you start your congressional? Yeah, well, I'm as many people know I've been a business leader for 15 years work for a large health care business So I know the difficulty of what it means to go and build the economy And because I'm a mother too, you know, I've I've spent a lot all my time making decisions for my own family So when it comes to those hidden taxes, which to me, that's what inflation is when you're in the state of Kansas Our inflation increased actually been higher than the rest of the country. We're greater than 7% right now So when I've been out in neighborhoods talking to just regular people about what's important to them They immediately the first thing that they side is the cost of gas They know home energy prices are going to be higher this this winter and and groceries too having just passing Thanksgiving so inflation is definitely a driver like the economy that really drives everything in our district people are frustrated right now When they hear people in Washington say all inflation is just passing. Oh, it's an elitist problem or problem only for the wealthy What do you I do not hear that? I because I came out of the business community I have very strong support from business leaders So the first thing that I would tell you is business leaders do not believe that it's going away anytime soon And it's having a really big impact on their day-to-day work But the same thing consumers just individuals in the district I think people believe that it's here to stay for a while And they understand completely that much of it is driven by all of the federal spending and Shreece Has been right there supporting all of it inclusive of the recent build back better better mess and i'll call it that the build back better mess It is a mess for a lot of people When you look out now, what's the issue that's going to turn your election and turn this district? It's it is it is really largely the economy I mean, that's what's central for people But I would say outside of that the second thing would be national security and border security There is a lot of frustration I mean the easiest thing that I could say is that people in my district, it's very educated and business driven They expect a plan and they expect results and they look at what's transpire down in our southern border and they're frustrated because it's a mess So they want border security. They want improvements I think a lot of them also think of immigration as a workforce issue So they they want our country to have an opinion about the skills we're looking for and when people don't have them and they come here How we help them to get those skills quickly so that they can contribute and be a part of this great country essential It really is well, Amanda. We wish you a lot of luck. Thank you for the time today. We're gonna be watching this place very close Thank you. I appreciate the time great to meet you All right, folks. Welcome back. We're so lucky to be joined by someone I got to meet when she worked in the White House at the Trump White House at the press office now running for Congress If she succeeds, she will supplant her former boss At least the phonica was just out here as the youngest Republican woman in congress joining me right now is carolyn Good to have you here good to see you again, john You are a young generation millennial generation. We see all these polls talking about socialism is popular with young people How do we change that narrative in america? Well, I must correct you. I'm actually generation z I would be the first generation z member of congress now Madison cawthorn might correct me on that he likes to say he's gen z but I believe it starts in 1997 So I will be the first you gotta be I do yes, and I will break elisa's record So honored to have her endorsement here today But you mentioned socialism and it's one of the reasons that drove me to run for congress as a young person You know I live amongst a generation of young voters who truly believe in socialism and a lot of them believe and even worse I mean marxis is what we have on our hands these days in america They have weaponized every institution in our country against conservative values and principles that we know make america great, right? Mainstream media not you of course john, but many others in our corporate media the higher education system has been hijacked by leftis Our entire federal government now is run by democrats. You know we have the hollywood just our entire culture is really slamming Socialism down the throats of young voters and they're eating it up And so as a young person I felt very compelled in my heart to step up to fight for our great country that allowed my family to live the american dream And so we are changing minds of young people on the campaign trail. You asked me how so i'll mention two ways first It's in person events. I've spoken at nearly every college campus in our district already Yes, and uh much for the dismay of the liberals on campus Dartmouth college was uh, we had a bit of a fiasco there with some of the liberals, but that's okay We love peaceful protests. Yep, and then secondly my campaign invests heavily in digital marketing We have to target those demographics and we've seen the results We had an event in manchester, new hamsher over half the crowd was young people They saw our ads and they decided to come out in a 10 So there is hope and it's going to take young candidates to do it You know I spent a lot of time uh covering campaigns in manchester as a young reporter and one of the things that always come to mind Fiscal sanity all this spending is three four five trillion whatever the final numbers How is that playing in the good people in the hamster? Oh, it is the utmost priority of mind to reign in the spending when I get down to washington next year And people are really hurting in new hamsher right now. We're seeing small businesses mom and pop diners I was reading a story this morning about why not in my district, but in our great state that had to shut down due to the labor shortages And so we have the highest inflation in 31 years It's killing our small business owners across all of our industries And then we also have these labor shortages, you know my family's a small business We own a car dealership and we have just 12 employees They've been with us for years and they work their butts off But now we're being forced to compete with mcdonald's and these corporations down the street that are offering to pay them 18 An hour and we can't afford that it's very unfair what's going on into your point in new hamsher We have true fiscal conservatism Conservatives across the board no matter how they identify politically And so I think it's going to be a red wave in new hamsher and definitely across our country next year Raining in spending rating in socials and two big missions. We're going to be watching this race coast of carolent Great to have you on the show today. Thank you john. Good luck to you Folks for taking a quick commercial break when we come back more from the eight women who intend to take republicans to control of congress So All right folks welcome back so lucky to having joining us right now is april becker from the gray state of navata running for Nevada three as I remember Your first time in politics, right? I ran in 2020 in a state senate race first time for congress What is motivating women like you to come forward and run this is a remarkable slate We've seen we saw historic numbers in the last election now even larger numbers this time around What's driving that? I think we're just fed up and I was always told as a kid when you want something done right you do it yourself And I think a lot of women have that attitude And uh, what's going on right now? I know I can do it better And when you look out, uh, navata so dependent on the service industry. It's one of the great states for all the great hospitality, but inflation workers shortages all the economic policies that we've been in put in place How is that resonating with everyday people in Nevada? Well speaking as a bar and restaurant owner, we've had to shut half our dining rooms down. We can't get anyone to show up to work We're apologizing Profusely to our clientele because the service has gone down somewhat and I think that every restaurant Service industry business owner is filling this It's it's a failed policy out of dc that is you know, it's uh Giving people reasons not to show up for work because they're getting paid to stay home They make more money staying home almost unimaginable earlier when you think about it Uh, what are some of the other issues that you think will motivate voters and turn the vata red in the next election? Well, obviously the economy security, uh, we've got uh administration that wants to defund our police We see crime going up in these areas This is not what americans want We are having issues with our education and know if you know, navata We're ranked almost lowest in the country and you know, their answer democrats answer is to dump more money Well, the money's not working. So we need something different. I think people are waking up They're paying more for their gas. They're paying more in the grocery stores And you're every day person that never cared about politics is asking what is going on Has an amazing dynamic and we're going to be watching this race. It's one of the real bellwethers of 2022 April great to meet you and best of luck to you. Thank you so much All right folks, welcome back and i'm lucky right now to have joining me Lisa shallower from the great state of pennsylvania running in pennsylvania 7 Lisa welcome to the show. Thank you so very much for having me when I think of pennsylvania I think that's the state that gave us this extraordinary energy independence just a few short years ago and in 10 months of the bidemistration All of that is gone. How do people in pennsylvania react to that? People in pennsylvania right now are furious the first place they see it is when they go fill up their gas tank I mean, it's the highest prices in decades Thilling up that tank, but not just that pennsylvania's number five in our entire country when it comes to energy production And right now biden's policy has us shutting down our energy our fabulous Natural resources in pennsylvania and seeking to buy energy from russia and even other hostile nations like china All that's going to do is kill pennsylvania jobs and wreck our economy Not to mention the overall national security risk of having to buy energy at a higher cost from other countries One that I may not have our best interests at heart A lot of union workers particularly in the energy industry. Do they have some buyers or more with this administration? I think that they do. I mean there there's hundreds of thousands of jobs in pennsylvania that are at risk And i'll tell you my opponent susan wild is right on the forefront of that last year She said to me personally I want to take money from our military and spend it on climate change She is co-chair of climate change task force and she wants to make sure that pennsylvania's lose their jobs Wow, that's going to be a big issue. I'm sure in the race Sometimes policies have a personal connection and I want to talk a little bit about the border fenton all the things coming across Tell us about what motivated you to create the hop open coffee franchise So i'll tell you one of the values that i've learned from my family is that you should always try to find a solution If you have the ability to give back and i've been very blessed in my life to give back So I was in recovery for more than 36 years. It's now over 39 years from addiction and continuous recovery And I watched the opioid epidemic unfurl and I saw Friends family every book co-worker Everyone is affected by this epidemic and so I decided to become part of the solution founding this coffee shop that employs addicts and early recovery With the mission to both end the stigma of being in recovery and to help folks get back into the workforce living productive lives What incenses me about what's going on in our southern border right now? The border is just completely open and fenton all is coming through in record numbers As of now, enough fenton all has flown has come through our southern border to be a lethal dose for every man woman and child In the entire united states four times over we have We have record overdoses going on with more than 100,000 americans have lost their lives to drug overdoses It's very disheartening and very personal to me And that's why it's going to be one of my first prerogatives as a congress person To make sure that we secure our southern border so that we can help put a stop to this Inflow this unabated inflow effect and all in drugs into our country. It is it has an enormous cost Um, Lisa, thank you so much for your time table. We wish you luck We're gonna be keeping a close eye on this race energy the border lots of big issues That's amazing. Thank you so very very much. Have a great day and merry christmas. Yeah, happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. God bless you We'll see you soon.

What should every day of americans who don't live at the border know about it? Well, first of all what i'd like to share with people is that it's not just affecting our local border communities But this is just a pass through area where it really affects is the entire country These people are being dropped off as far as chicago new york dallas, california So this is an american Crisis not just a border crisis border city crisis Are you frustrated that the by administration won't even release where the illegal aliens are being moved here? Is that a problem for people that not to kind of be blind and where this is happening? Absolutely. Look the american people should know where these illegal immigrants are being dropped off They're being dropped off in the middle of the night in cities where we don't know where they're where they're at and what their intentions are This could pose a dangerous threat for american communities. Yeah, there's a lot to learn that we don't know yet Um earlier this year you saw the by the administration demonize the cpb You've been there you've seen the custom in border patrol for a long time What do you want americans to know about the brave men and women that serve on the border? Look those brave men and women the border patrol the custom agents are putting their lives in danger on a daily basis To keep you and i and our kids in a protected environment And so they deserve our support and that's why i'm honored to have The endorsement of the national border patrol council because they know when elected I will stand up for them and stand up for our communities along the border A lot of inroads in the republican party women has spanned its young voters seem to be coming back What's going to be the key message in 2022? Well, it's going to be law and order and it's going to be about fiscal responsibility Yeah, a lot of people talking about that well monica We're going to be watching your race very closely very important one great to meet you today and thank you for spending time with us Thank you. All right, we'll be right back folks All All right, folks welcome back and i'm so lucky to be joined by someone who actually represents me in prince william county i'm the proud prince county commissioners in virginia janeen lost and janeen great to have you here and Congratulations on running for virginia congressional race. Thank you. Thank you for having me prince william is such a fascinating place Used to be a red area. It's sort of purpleish blue now But we saw some tremendous change with the glen yonkin race just a few weeks ago What's going on there? One of the issues driving voters? I agree. Yeah, there's a lot of energy on the ground and People are starting to wake up to the nonsense of the far left At at the federal level and at the state level, which is exactly why glen yonkin and all three of our statewide candidates were successful I think it's a few things. It's it's the constant Grab of our money higher taxes at all levels people are feeling that especially with record inflation It's the public safety issues. It's this Softness on crime, which is just nonsense And um, and then people are rejecting the this critical race theory Critical race theory, which is an ideology that is counter to everything the marlin with the king stood for You look back and just in this short period of time suburban mom said kind of bolted the republicans for a little while Back in really large numbers that energy of parents taking control and saying school board governor all the way up I want my voice was terry mccollis moment the wake-up call when people he said I don't believe parents Have a voice in in the education that that become the battle cry without a doubt Look he finally said what we all know they've been about and and you know It leaked out in that debate and I knew the second it came out of his mouth That was a game changer for glen yonkin and it certainly proved to be you feel the ground move Um with fiscal sanity there's been so much use of property taxes are a big issue when you look at the yonkin Pauling data fiscal sanity in general. How do we get a control of it? How do you sell that to the american people next year? Uh, I think it's going to take some fiscal discipline and I've certainly been a supporter of that at the county level Um, you know We continue to see the rise of property taxes that far left wants to fund everything It's sometimes like running against santa clause and you know, I believe in the philosophy that government cannot be all things to all people I certainly believe that americans know what's best for their money And uh, I think that next year in the midterms are going to send a resounding message to joe biden And nancy polosi that they reject Uh the the money grab and it's constant. They're relentless and I think americans are fed up with it Yeah, there's no doubt about it. Well, we're going to be watching your race very closely It will be a bellwether for 2022 and we can't wait to see what happens. Thank you. Thanks for joining us today. Great to have you on Thank you All right folks welcome back and i'm really lucky to be joined by uh jenn kegens who joins us a former uh navy pilot helicopter pilot Uh and has uh done a lot for her country and now running for congress Why this moment for you? Why do you pick this moment to jump into the fire plane and say i'm gonna run for college? Great question. So in 2019 I was literally sitting on my couch watching the news yelling at my television as many people still probably do and very Frustrated with politics 2018 was the year that we saw blue wave come to virginia It was the year that democrats flipped the house senate and they had the governor ship as well So so I've had a front row seat to that kind of danger and insanity of one party political role in virginia So I have seen a lot of radical just agenda being pushed and being passed and being in the minority has been very frustrating And I have been really powerless along with my colleagues there even though we have fought day in and day out for our conservative values So having that front row seat really motivated me After what happened with the administration change just to take that fight to the national level I believe in balanced power. We don't have balanced power right now Dangerous way to run a country dangerous way to run a calm wealth as well So just having that experience in the senate has really provided me an education Along with that, you know, just the issues that are important to all americans are still frustrating to me I'm still sitting on my couch yelling at my television the news every night So so I want to take that by to washington and really excited to flip this date Having served in the military and all the sacrifice you made there when you look at what happened in afghanistan What's happened to america standing on the world stage in such a very short period of time very frustrating as a navy veteran So I served for 10 years as a helicopter pilot my husband's a f 18 pilot Retired I have a father who's a green brand vietnam my grandfather in world war two We have a huge military family. So even my apolitical veteran friends We feel very abandoned very isolated by this current administration, you know, we served there We sacrificed there. I deployed a couple times in the Persian Gulf as well. We lost friends there It was a fight it was a fight for our country But we did the mission because that's what our country asked and within a week We saw the crisis in afghanistan before our eyes And we saw the way that our military and our americans were abandoned there And I have a son who's in at the naval academy He's a junior and I have also a son who's a freshman at virginia military institute So now i've children who who are in that fight and even though my husband and i and our friends sacrificed and served there and we kept world peace That's been taken from us and now you've put my children at risk and so now i'm a mad mom So that's the last person you want to mess with that's right very personal. Oh, I bet it is Um, you have your finger in the pulse as a state senator you work real hard for the glen young and victor Your region of virginia was pretty blue for a while and you had an extraordinary turnout what went on there What happened so we worked our tails off For many months, but uh, we did show up from hampton rosarian What a great victory that was not only did glen glen yunken he was able to flip cd2 So from the time joe biden won last year till glen yunkens victory. It was a 14 point shift to the right So that's big volumes. We knew the country was watching us We felt the pressure in virginia, and so we all wanted to send that message that we took back our commonwealth We're coming back for our country. I also, you know, south west virginia also showed up for us So there's definitely different parts of the state but hampton ros was one of those areas in congressional district two alone We were able to flip three out of our seven house of delegates seats So there was a lot of momentum virginians, especially are very tired of the direction of the calm wealth the direction of the country Yeah, it was it was an earthquake. There's no doubt now the question is does it carry in the 2022? Absolutely A lot of momentum and thanks to have you. Thank you for your service. Sorry. Thank you so much. I may appreciate it Well folks, that just about wraps it up for tonight I'm so grateful that this just the news real america's voice special could bring you inside the majority makers Eight extraordinary republican candidates who are trying to help the republican party take back congress I want to give a special thanks to house gop conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik for making all of the candidates available and spending so much time with us tonight I think you got a really inside look at the quality of recruitment in candidates that the republicans are Working on as a try to take back congress in 2022 now Before we go, I want to make an announcement tonight a little off-script, but I think it'll be a lot of fun If you like what you saw tonight and you'd like some of these just the news real america voice specials that we've been doing I've got some good news for you starting in january. We're going to do this five nights a week That's right five nights a week monday through friday six o'clock right here. We're going to launch a new show I am so lucky to be joined by my good friend a great journalist amanda head you've seen her here on real america's voice You know, whereas the woman who started the great site the hollywood conservative a fantastic journalist And we're going to create a show together called news not noise We don't want to give you an old-fashioned cable show there's not going to be long-winded monologues We're not going to give you a lot of talking points We're going to try to give you real news every night So as you can go home to the water cooler the dinner table the boardroom and make up your own mind have your own conversations Facts news not noise. That's what we're going to be about and guess what amanda is joining us right now Amanda great to have you're born Great to see you john. I am so excited I've been bursting at the scene to tell people about this show And it's been in the works for a while and now we can finally announce and announce that I guess this is the first official Um, but I think that it's going to be an incredible endeavor. I think that you and I both bring Uh unique Characteristics and personality and flavor and i'm i'm a big fan of the who what when where and why I love bringing facts to the conversation And it's one of the things that as journalists and people in politics has to keep us consistent But I also like to throw in a little bit of humor every once in a while because between the left and the right And conservatives and liberals and republicans and democrats I think that one of the few ways that we can bring people together and help people to see The other side's perspective is a little bit of humor dashing with that So news not noise is going to Accomplish that and john you you are one of those people in the industry who I have esteemed to To be and work like and work with and I couldn't be more excited You are the epitome of one of my favorite phrases My favorite phrase actually is better to beg forgiveness than ask permission But one of my other jr. phrase is Complexity and preparation simplicity in execution and you with your skills and investigative journalism That's that's the epitome of what this show is going to bring to to america and I know that this network is going to be blessed by you being on it Well, I already have this partnership and all that we get to do with real america's voice is incredible And I get to watch you every night all the amazing things you're doing You know, we we're moving into an era where I think the era of cable television is sort of coming to an end It's changing and people are looking for a conversation. I wonder how you know How can we go about this? We're going to bring in a lot of our audience to the show We're going to have a two-way conversation I'm kind of excited about that But you know as you go out and you have these conversations with voters and real americans every day What do they want to see in a show? What can we do to bring them in and incorporate them into all that we do? Yeah, I mean, this is one of the things that makes this show so unique john when you are digging for a story There there are copious amounts of documents and memos and things that that you go through and research for each of our stories And I will be taking on some of those duties as well But being able to push that out to the audience through the app in real time For them to be able to scour these documents as well And look I know that a lot of times there's gray area in politics and reading these long documents seems like an arduous task But these oftentimes are very important things that you need to see In black and white so we're going to be pushing that out to the audience and also Our friday show is going to be a town hall type show where people can submit questions through the app And john and I will answer them. Although I feel like john there's probably going to be more questions directed towards you But we're both going to have a good time with those I I was thinking about the humor part. I'm almost certain to deliver some of those humorous moments Probably accidentally t on this show, but we're going to have some good laughs along with some great conversations It's uh, it's really really Exciting to do, you know the As as I go around the country lately, there's so many people talking about, you know We get we see a story and then we know right away It's not right and then we don't have any way to go about and tell our friends Hey, that what thing that you heard? It's not true. Here's some stuff The idea that every day we can push documents and video and our Reporters notebook to the audience is going to be so much fun We want them to be along for the reporting ride and i'm just really excited about that And I also think the opportunity to have conversations to bring in big newsmakers But get beyond the talking points and get to facts no spin, you know real news real questions real facts real ideas I just can't wait to get started. I know you share that sentiment a lot Yeah, and you know one of the things I love about america's voice at other networks Across the board you have talking points and a lot of times you feel like from show to show from hour to hour You're hearing the same content. That's one of the things I love about real america's voice is that we each have our own unique opinions We have our own unique personalities and we are allowed to put those on display and john you and I have unique perspectives Even different from each other and I know that we are going to have some some differing opinions on things And that's okay because at least it used to be okay And within the culture of real america's voice in our show. I know it's going to be okay too We can't we can't wait to bring your opinion into the fold as well Yeah, listen. I'm so excited. I admire what you do every day and I can't wait to get started early january We should be on the set and going with the brand new show news. Not noise and I can't wait to join the man Every day.
