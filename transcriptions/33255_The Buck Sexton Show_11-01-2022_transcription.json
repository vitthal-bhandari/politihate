Mountain Cold Refreshment made to chill. The lib narrative on COVID-19 is in free fall. Now CDC chief Rochelle Walensky is admitting that a lot of people in the hospital are there with COVID instead of from it. Oh what a surprise right? Not at all. Not for those of us who have been saying this for over a year now. Oh while they call this conspiracy theorists. Looks like we're right again. It's time for Hold the Line. Welcome to Hold the Line. I'm Buck Sexton. I don't want to do a victory dance over and over again on being right when it comes to COVID. I want the madness to stop. That's the most important thing. I want the libs. I want the Fauci commies to take their boot off our throat and the mask off our face. That would be a great start right? Let's just get down into reality here for second. First of all they have failed. Okay they failed to stop the spread. They can talk as much as they want about how the shot is good for individuals to protect against hospitalization and death and sure that's a good thing and we say that here on the show. But that means that individuals who are at risk should choose to get the shot and the public messaging focus should have been on getting those at risk the shot. Not 30 year old nurses that already have natural immunity who don't want the Vax. Not five and 10 year old kids who are at effectively no risk from COVID whatsoever but they refuse to be reasonable. They wanted control. They are in a panic. The libs have lost their minds and they want to drag us all into their insanity in perpetuity. We say no here on hold the line. First of all is it a failure to stop the spread? Gee take a look New York Post headline New York reports over 90,000 COVID cases and they've broken another state record. We are breaking COVID spread records after a vaccine mandate has been in place for four months. Oh but I thought we did everything right. I thought if we masked up and took the virus seriously. Nope. Wrong. That's not the case. We all understand what's really going on here right. You're seeing the enormous failure of the narrative and the apparatus of control in real time. This is clear to everybody now. Like the whole oh we're gonna be fine. Remember when the lib journals in DC and New York and another Democrat enclaves were laughing at Florida over the summer. Haha. Rhonda Santas they have bad COVID case numbers because they didn't listen to the science. Oh about that. Florida's doing just fine right now. They've got a pretty sizable COVID surge but not on the lines of what you're seeing in New York and turns out that the virtue signaling did not coincide with actual viral protection. Didn't. Meanwhile the data that we have to base all this off of. Is it sound? Is it good? Do we even know how many people are in the hospital with COVID versus from COVID because that's what that's what really matters. We don't care when it comes to our COVID conversation about an asymptomatic case with somebody who's there for appendicitis or somebody who's there with a broken arm in the hospital right. So do we have real numbers on this? Well here's the director of the CDC. It's just an utter incompetent saying oh no we'll get back to you on that. Do you know how many of the 836,000 deaths in the US linked to COVID are from COVID or how many are with COVID but they had other comorbidities. Do you have that breakdown? Yes of course with Omicron we're following that very carefully. Our death registry of course takes a few weeks to and is it takes a few weeks to collect and of course Omicron has just been with us for a few weeks but those data will be forthcoming. Mm-hmm worth coming. I feel like they're not a big rush because you know Fauci had to say recently that a lot of the kids in the hospital marked as COVID hospitalizations weren't actually there for COVID. So do we think that a lot if a lot of the children in the hospital are being marked as COVID when they're really not COVID patients meaning they're there for something other than that virus do we think there've been a lot of adults over the course of oh I don't know the last two years who have been listed as COVID deaths who were there who were COVID positive but actually died of heart failure because they were over 80 years old and had multiple comorbidities. Well we have more information right now on the data because some of us have been saying all long this is a disease that is dangerous to the elderly and the sick and particularly the elderly who are sick and we were yelled at oh no it's so dangerous for children 10 year olds 18 year olds let's get every professional athlete vaccinated it's so scary and dangerous and we were saying it's really not for those people it is for seniors and those at high risk and yet here is CDC director Rochelle Walensky once again saying yeah the people I mean she doesn't say this but the space Gucci segment people like Buck who have been pointing out who's really at risk from COVID were right 75% of COVID deaths at least four comorbidities. The overwhelming number of deaths over 75% occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities so really these are people who were unwell to begin with. Unwell to begin with comorbidities advanced age gee why do we have vaccine mandates in the school system then why do we have people that are mandating boosters for everyone? The CDC is an abomination folks a total failure during this whole pandemic remember they messed up the testing in the early days they were telling us to wipe down our groceries with Lysol wipes these people have been an abject failure that's the reality let's all look at this and be honest okay if they were fighting a war we'd have to fire all the generals and have a whole new draft right we'd have to start from scratch even resident idiot at CNN Brian Stelter is like CDC is a problem watch. Here's a great example I think of how to cover this moment in time here's the today show here's Savannah Guthrie interviewing the CDC director being very much in touch with the public recognizing the CDC has turned into a punch line it is so sad but it's true the CDC has turned into a punch line yeah because they're wrong a lot because they're politicized hacks because they have no humility they shut down scientific discussion and claimed that that science they're appalling and now they're also having to all admit that what some of us have been telling you all along is true there is no eradicating covid there's no covid zero this is a virus that will be with us that will mutate that fortunately with omicron while it is more transmissible it is also considerably less lethal less dangerous so we'll be getting a whole lot of herd immunity built up through natural immunity not these vaccines so much that last a few months at best here is x-bide in task force had Zika manual on MSNBC saying look we're not going to eradicate covid we're going to have to learn to live with it we're not getting rid of covid it's not going to disappear we're not going to eradicate it we're going to have to learn to live with it just like we learned to live with RSV adenovirus flu we're not there yet when you have 140,000 hospitalizations you have 1500 deaths a day you're not at a situation where we can live with it normally we still have to combat it to bring those that mortality rate down to about a hundred people a day to bring the hospitalizations down but once we're down we have to sustain it and we will live with it we'll be in a new normal we won't have to wear masks all the time we can go into restaurants ventilation will be improved that is the situation won't have to wear masks all the time the masks the cloth masks don't work admit it admit it lives they don't work you've already had the former FDA chief say it you've had lina win on cnn say it they don't work now they say it so they can get little kids to start wearing n95 masks but they don't work and we should never have to wear them again because we should have never had to wear them in the first place oh no we have a lot of work here to do friends the authoritarian lives just because they're wrong doesn't mean they're going to change we'll have more on this with the first tv's jesse callee we come back the first i want to talk to you about protecting your online data a lot of a lot of companies promise you that privacy is guaranteed but we know that's not true that's why you need a new privacy

a moment just like everything else in this country the fight against the pandemic appears to be going woke yeah you heard that right folks with co-op treatment in short supply in some respects the FDA issued new guidance that health care providers can consider race or ethnicity when administering potentially life-saving drugs and therapeutics what exactly does that mean let's get into it with a host of i'm right with Jesse Kelly right here on the first tv but what an only Jesse Kelly Jesse good to see you well i think we know what it means buck there's a word for it that was thrown around a lot last summer uh hang on sorry it starts with a nest uh systemic racism i believe that was the word that is and i don't know how you can look at that any other way we have these life-saving treatments you come in for the life-saving treatments and if you're white uh sorry sir head on to the back of the line while we fix other people first that is the very definition of systemic racism and i don't know about you buck i distinctly remember being told that that is basically a national security issue america's an evil place because of it and now it's official government policy you have an FDA put out a fact sheet detailing the emergency use authorization of the drug uh so trauma-mab which includes what includes for mild to moderate covid cases the conditions they had were advanced age which is obviously very very real in this obesity pregnancy diabetes car it goes down a whole list other medical factors including race or ethnicity so now now we're actually going to take a a a affirmative action approach of some kind here or some kind of race conscious approach to distributing life-saving medicine this seems pretty appalling and it's amazing that it can actually happen in america today but it is happening i'm not surprised i i i know you're not surprised either buck you we've been rambling about this stuff for two years now how do you look at the medical community in this country now and i realize that i'm not i'm not indicting every doctor and nurse because there are some wonderful ones out there especially the hot nurses but let's just be honest the medical community they've joined forces with a really corrupt federal government and i'm old enough to remember when we add potential life-saving early treatments for coronavirus out there and not me i'm not a medical expert but doctors and hot nurses they were out there talking about how things like hydroxychloroquine and i've remected and i'm not endorsed and those because i'm not a doctor but they were saying on camera i'm fixing people with this people are coming in with covid i'm giving them this and it's saving their lives and i remember the medical community in conjunction with the government in this country said nope none of that we need a lot of dead people because then we can blame it all on trump when you stare at somebody's mom lying in a hospital bed dying from her own lung fluid and you say no no no no no don't treat her we got a win in election how are you any different than any other historical monster is the apparatus really in disarray right now in a way that you think might be reversible as in is all this fauci narrative finally crumbling or is it just crumbling for people that have known all along that it's bull crap and you're still just going to have the doubling down of the loons i mean i'm here in new york jesse they're gonna they're gonna have a booster mandate here soon almost guaranteed it to everybody in here today i'm a booster mandate so so is the apparatus crumbling or what yes and no i i this is what i think buck nobody dr fauci is in gaining additional influence at this point in time everyone can agree well not everyone but everyone with an iq above an amoeba can agree that he got way too popular and influential very early on that's only gotten lower and lower lower as we've moved on he's not gaining so technically we are gaining but places like new york places like washington d c they're so communist and they're so wrapped up in a bubble they don't have any exposure to real information they get their information from me see they get their information from eric adams they get they watch cnn at night for real not just hate watching like we do they really watch it and think that that's news what person what chances that person have ever at getting the truth about anything buck they never have a chance they they literally don't have a chance to live a normal life because they don't live in the real world so where do you think they go at this stage jesse when the cdc just in the last few days has announced publicly that a large percentage we don't know the number yet because they don't know the number because apparently the cdc can't really count you'll notice the uk israel there are countries that have very immediate granular data on this stuff and we're talking about hospitalizations and deaths not you know how many calories the average you know arcanzin is eating right i mean this is something that really affects the whole trajectory of the pandemic right now not to bring an arkansas for no reason love my people in arkansas pointy we got an arkansas governor uh soundbite coming up that's why i was thinking of it but jesse they are having to admit that a large number of people in the hospital may not be there for covid we've been saying this for a long time and now they say the thing that they've been yelling at us for saying as if we haven't been saying it and even getting shot down on social media hit pieces written about it uh about people like you and me in big places new york times what the heck is going on well what's going on is they're being exposed covid's no longer a winner for democrats and what's going on is i mean you mentioned earlier people waking up people are going to have to unpack i mean your viewers are as informed about reality as anything else and even a percentage of them probably haven't fully unpacked the united states of america was never trying to defeat corona virus we were never trying to stop deaths that virus got here in about 15 minutes after it got here it was viewed as an opportunity to defeat donald trump's re-election chances and that's how we've approached it that's the only reason you wouldn't dig in and immediately figure out did this guy die from covid or did he die because he's 65 475 pounds has emphysema and lung cancer we didn't do those separations not because we don't have people smart enough to do them we didn't do them because they wanted everything assigned as a covid death i just put some article out on social media i'd forgotten about it my producer brought it up to me remember the guy in florida in july in 2020 who wrecked his motorcycle and died god rest his soul and they counted him as a covid death that was simply policy early on test every single person who dies test them until they pop positive list them as a covid death drop it in donald trump's lap so we can win an election america isn't defeating corona virus because we've never tried you know we're still waiting to see jesse if the supreme court is going to put a stay on the national and i i've been warning my red state brothers and sisters for a long time you're not safe from the federal government mandate right i mean you know you live in texas you live in florida they're going to try to jam this thing down your throat wherever you are if you're at a company with other of you know over a hundred employees and you know you have to fit into all these different categories but it's coming for 84 million people we're going to find out if the court actually stays this or not they're not going to rule in until june here's a governor of arkansas why i was thinking of arkansas watch i don't believe that uh the mandate is the right way to go at this time uh particularly the federal mandate that uh should be struck down because that's going to give us a greater worker shortage it's going to increase the resistance for uh taking the vaccine which is what we want to be able to do now the governor of arkansas is not exactly uh front line freedom fighter in a lot of ways i'll just say that he's okay on some things not great on others a little too pro uh pro-fauciism for for my taste but i mean you know what do you think here i think that we're about to see a great dividing i don't have it honestly to be to be frank i don't have any faith in the supreme court at all and look we're at the point now but i mean we've been talking a lot about the cdc and democrats we're at the point now where americans in general don't trust their institutions and you're going to see a lot of people myself included i'll be honest i don't care what the supreme court says i'm not taking it i i'm not ruled by a supreme court i if they view that the federal government has the authority to point at me and say inject this into your body then i point right back and say you're not a legitimate institution anymore and i don't have to do what you say and i'm not a minority you're going to find a huge percentage of these jul p states that say that and you're going to have attorney general pushback you're going to see a real divide in this country but i hope i hope not a dangerous divide but i'm telling you you start pointing your finger at 80 million americans and say do this or you're fired that's a problem jesse sannity my friend it's a nice thing isn't it even if people don't share it with us it's good to have what you can see you hey man you good you good brother new york cities mayor eric atoms has announced so be signing a bill into law that will allow non-citizens who've been the city for 30 days to vote in local elections we'll have reaction from conservative talk show host marx amone coming up want to talk to you about protecting the most vital asset you own your home you have homeowners insurance for good reason because without it a fire flood or burglary could destroy you financially there's another major crime your homeowner's policy doesn't cover it's called home title fraud the fbi calls home title fraud one of the fastest growing crimes and it can ruin you financially which is why you need home title lock title fraud happens when a criminal forges or signature on documents stating you sold your home to him then he takes out loans against your home and leaves you with the payments you'll spend a fortune and legal fees trying to prove you didn't commit fraud home title lock puts a barrier around your home's title the instant they'd attack anyone from a cider thief to a renter to a relative trying to forge their way on way on your home's title they help shut it down go to home title lock dot com and register your address to see if you're already a victim enter code radio for 30 free days of protection that's code radio at home title lock dot com we'll be right back with more all the line New York City Mayor Eric Adams about to saddle New Yorkers with yet another controversial measure Adam said Saturday he will sign a bill allowing hundreds of thousands of non-citizens living in New York City to participate in local elections by expanding voting eligibility to green card holders about 10% of the city's population and recipients of deferred action hmm interesting well i've had some concerns about aspects of the bill Adams said about this in response i had a productive dialogue with my colleagues and government that put those concerns at ease i believe allowing legislation to be enacted is by far the best choice and look forward to bringing millions more into the democratic process you know what i mean now is i heart radio talk show host mark some own mark good to see you good to see you thanks for having me okay so let's just be clear are are illegals are they you know i saw deferred action there so green card holders are allowed to be here but generally not allowed to vote so that's a problem right there but are illegals in any way included in this new legislation so it's effectively our deferred action recipients who are illegal aliens able to vote yeah absolutely let's listen democrats saying if you won't vote for us we'll import people who will so i mean anything goes we don't even know who signs these ballots anyway no signatures are authenticated uh listen it's like tom brady you got to just uh be grateful for all these uh obstacles it just makes you play better here is uh cnn zone jake tapper doing one of those things where he actually asked some real questions which he does do sometimes and he does it here with new york cn air iraq adam's wanted to have you respond uh give us one sec play doesn't the bill just make a mockery of the idea of american citizenship though i mean this is just for local elections but does that mean like next uh new york city is going to want non-citizens to vote in federal elections i mean it when what do you say to all the people who went through the process the difficult process of becoming an american citizen studying for the test swearing in oath of allegiance to the united states of america and after hearing their rationale and their theories behind it i thought it was more important to not veto the bill or get in a way at all and allow the bill to move forward did adam's change his position because he kind of said that he had concerns or whatever what's the reality here mark the reality is he's only been in office about ten days uh we don't know about him yet he says all the right things he acts like he's going to do the right thing but we don't know and he's being very cautious with this uh issue and with a couple of others he's tip-towing very lightly i would rather see a rutie juliani come in and just take a stand but we i don't know what he'll do in the end uh you know the great thing about democrats they always go too far they always push it too far you know now it's the illegals voting next thing you know it'll be people under 18 that you know kids voting i they'll they'll just keep going until it blows up in their face. eric anns by the way it is switch gears a little bit but still the mayor of new york city here and i think this is always a harbinger of what you'll see with other prominent democrats across the country in this year how are they going to operate given the new realities of you know covid and defund the police and what people have seen over the last 12 months but he is in talks uh supporting mandating the jab for all right now for children to attend school this contradicts what he said about schools being the safest place for kids just last week here's what he says about mandating for children watch this one. covid is a formidable and moving target and we have to pivot and shift based on that and our policies have been rooted in i need my children in school and if my medical professionals tell me eric we have to do a mandated vaccine we're going to do that. What do you make of this going to be a problem for him to mandate the shot for kids? Absolutely but you know the good thing about eric annums if you don't like what he's saying just wait a day or two it'll change but uh you know here's an important point uh Biden, Adams, every democrat demands everybody get vaccinated to do that you got to go to a location you got to fill out forms you got to show id so if everybody in america supposedly can do this for the vaccine why can't they do it to vote this argument is going to come back to haunt them. Speaking of arguments coming back to haunt somebody alvin brags it hasn't been very long here he was on i think it was day one the new alvin brag the new uh d.a in manhattan he's had to defend his approach of not looking for criminal sentences for people for a whole range including just wait wait this one always gets everyone's attention armed robbery well if you don't actually shoot somebody with the gun we're not going to send you to prison in new york which strikes anyone who knows anything as completely insane the new nypd commissioner though mark as i understand it uh is not on board for this what do you make of what we're seeing from this d.a in new york who i mean to call it soft on crime seems like an understatement no it's pro crime he's an absolute lunatic and if you read the whole order uh even burglary it's not really a crime uh i mean it's just a ridiculous list everybody is against this guy but i looked at the newsstand yesterday the daily news savaging him on the cover the new york post even the new york times liberal papers conservative papers everybody is against this people are going to die because of people are going to get killed because of it the answer is the governor can remove him as district attorney it's going to take a huge movement of business leaders political leaders police so they have to turn together to her it could become a big election issue and i think that's what'll make her do it at some point just to get it off the table because when she wants to run for reelection she's not going to want this issue he's got to be removed from office you know you're allowed to uh there's prosecutorial discretion only on a certain case you can't just decide i'm not going to enforce uh 50 things or i'm going to change the penal coding he's not a legislator he's a district attorney by the way the manhattan d.a spoke about this policy the new manhattan d.a and claimed that somehow mork was going to make us safer i wanted to have a react watch we've all seen the story of the person who's uh on their eighth arrests and people say well how this happened how that assault happened well there were seven prior times with that person struggling with addiction or mental health we didn't connect that person to surface this is going to make us safer it is intuitive it's common sense i don't understand uh the pushback this guy is out of his mind i'm not the guy he's a nice guy in real life he's uh must be a smart guy went to harvard i think he fell down and hit his head or something something happened to this guy he's just delirious you know even if you on paper thought this experiment can work it's been tried 25 cities have tried it and people end up dead it ends up being in a crime wave so it's it's not just four times it's 25 times this is a proven failure there's something wrong with this guy the mipd's new commissioner key chance sule has been really vocal mark in response to this new d.a soft on crime approach uh she put out a memo that said the following this is the new commissioner of the m y p d i'm very concerned about the implications to your safety as police officers the safety of the public and justice for victims i'm making my concerns known to them in hatton district attorney and hope to have frank and productive discussions to try and reach more common ground uh i just gotta i gotta ask you mark i got friends who in response to the d.a and a little bit of what adam says done recently but there text me saying i think new york is done i'm out of here are you are you still holding that hope that adam is going to pull it together and not be he doesn't have to be great he just has he just has to be not a disaster can you do it there's already a groundswell against this d.a if we get rid of him uh adam's put in a couple of good he's got a deputy commissioner from the n y p d phillip bank suit he's really going to be the commissioner and people love him police guys love him uh but if we get rid of all that i think i know this d.a may even back down you know turn style jumping no longer a crime that basically makes the subway system free now resisting arrest no longer a crime it's not just a guy shoving away from the cop you're gonna have a guy tearing down the street or tearing away in a car that everybody's gonna be in danger so i i think everybody will we'll just get brag stopped and deadness tracks somehow mark thanks for the sanity in an insane world appreciate it thanks a pair of transgender athletes take top spots in an ivy league swim meet this weekend we got more on that with first tv contributor t and a low when we return the record shattering university of pennsylvania's transgender swimmer lea thomas was defeated by another transgender swimmer and an ivy league swim meet saturday yale university student itzak henig defeated thomas in both the women's 100 and 400 yard freestyle races according to reports henig who is transitioning from female to male set a record for the women's 50 yard freestyle daily male also reported that uh henig who had uh breast removed won the 50 yard freestyle and proceeded to pull down the top of the swimsuit in celebration fairly unusual way to commemorate a collegiate win but i mean now to discuss is t and a low commentary writer for the washing examiner and contributor here at the first tv uh t and uh what exactly happened here what was this explain yes so it is very confusingly to those of us who didn't grow up taking gender studies one on one from kindergarten the transgender man competing in the woman's race beat the transgender woman who was born a man so it's confusing because clearly the nc double a doesn't have any rules about actual gender identity the only provision that was put on lea thomas um the pen swimmer that has gained more notoriety is that she had to be on um testosterone suppressors for one year which as you know doesn't dilute the impact of male puberty the inherent strength and also not even just the inherent strength but the aerodynamic advantage that men have men don't have hips men don't have breasts and apparently the yale swimmer also doesn't have breasts so we're talking about two female swimmers none of which are for lack of a better term encumbered by the reality of swimming with breasts and this isn't necessarily uh very comfortable stuff to talk about but it's a real thing when we're discussing the purpose of women's athletics in in schools which is to be equal in terms of funding and fairness to men's sports so if you can give yourself a biological advantage by either transitioning in one direction or in the other because the surgical results of moving that which inhibits the ability to swim as fast as a man then we're denying those scholarships to born and bred cis women so oddly enough as has been true throughout this entire saga the once loud feminist finally found an issue they want to shut up about wow it sounded like jesse kelly there um we've got uh a it's a henig column here uh it's a henig is the biological female i'm trying to keep all this straight biological female that has transitioned to male that had breasts removed here you go as a student athlete this is what henig wrote coming out as a trans guy put me in a weird position i value my contributions to the team and recognize that my boyhood doesn't hinge on whether there's more or less testosterone running through my veins at least that's what i'll try to remember when i put on the women swimsuit for the competition and i'm reminded of a self i no longer feel attached to a stunned parent who was in attendance at the Yale U Penn Ivy League swim meet told the Daily Mail quote i wasn't prepared for that everything is messed up i can't wrap my head around this the NCAA needs to do something so wait so did the did the the female then transitioning to male was able to beat a lot of guys at the meat is that what i'm seeing here because that is so surprising so remember lea thomas was was very close to breaking missy franklin's record in one of these races so the fact that she was beat by anyone i mean again i am not a biologist i am not a doctor but it doesn't seem like it would be a coincidence that it would be a woman who is again removed subcutaneous fat that we know impacts your ability to swim more quickly you have lesser comfort in one direction there are aerodynamic and buoyancy issues at play here yes exactly exactly so it's it's surprising obviously that lea thomas could lose to anyone but it's not that surprising who she lost to and in what form but that being said you know lea thomas has still been smashing records left and right it's possible you know that that the the goats a female swimming like katie le deck you like missy franklin but their records are being very are very close to being broken specifically by lea thomas and again i fully believe that she's not been fooling around on you know taking feminizing hormones but that still doesn't impact the fact that during puberty when you're 12 women just get wider pelvis is to enable the future of potential childbirth men don't men have still have much more bone density than women um you're you are inherently stronger even if you don't later on get the extra bolster of testosterone for the muscles that skeletal development is already completed by the way in late december and oakland california engineering manager switching gears here but fill in the transgender topic uh named amie shnider became the quote winningest woman in jeopardy history uh they said that this is the first woman in the history of the game to surpass one million dollars in winnings during regular season play the the corporate media of course praising amie shnider as a woman for her victory here some of the headlines cnbc amie shnider is the first women to win a million dollars on jeopardy new york times snatter surpasses momillion of jeopardy etc etc uh amie shnider is a biological male well the biological mallet men are just beating us at everything aren't they um and notice that none of these headlines are carving out you know the first trans woman which i don't think you know is extremely objectionable no but it you women are literally going to be replaced from the record books i mean jeopardy is something that's that's professionally scored by the gennus book of world record this isn't exactly an arbitrary record here um you know it's a show that's more than 50 years old and it's ingrained in our cultural consciousness again not as important as something that is legally protected by the equal rights amendment to ensure fairness for men and women for scholarship opportunities and academics but still a sign of how quickly the corporate media is willing to embrace you know rewriting definitions again five years ago woke media would have labeled her the first transgender woman to win and now what what do feminists have to grapple with are they going to accept this framing and then entertain some sort of notion that men that biological men are inherently more able than women or they're going to reclaim what the feminine identity is i'm just wondering i mean i i look at this i wonder do you think that the only way this maybe stops is if people if biological males start applying for uh for is either claim to be chant transgender saying they're senior of high school and say they want to be on the they want to be recruited for like harvard women's lacrosse and they want scholarships at schools that can give them for athletics i believe schools can but do you think the only way to do this is to actually just bring the system down from within because i i wonder what level of lunacy is the left willing to embrace on this oh absolutely as college i i think it's going to happen at the elite university level and here's why as elite universities get rid of the purely meritocratic measures of achievement things like the sat things like your gpa things like subject exams and they are slowly replaced with markers of elite privilege things like could your parents get you you know an internship at the u.n. could your parents help you set up your own 501c three for climate change or whatever and i i went to one of those schools where that was common but we still had the sat as a buffer to make sure i went to i went to school a private school with a lot of rich white kids and a lot of scholarship latino kids and all those scholarship latino kids were able to compete with with the rich white kids and admissions because they had the objective measures of merit but as soon as you know we start replacing the idea of privilege being a race thing or a class thing and now we're inserting this sort of chosen metric and i'm not saying that all people who identify as lgbt are choosing to do or choosing to do so but yeah if you're a rich straight white man the easiest way to gain the system in a second is claim that you're a woman immediately you jump to the front of the oppression Olympics more so than any poor working class kid of color right so of course it's going to start being gained and that is especially as the student loan cartel continues to squeeze the value up to the very top well i forget to that one another time tina always insightful good to see you thanks buck all right coming up the los angeles police department is celebrating some heroes today after isn't nice we have a good story heroes l.a.p.d rescue me man from an oncoming train the visual is amazing the video after touring wildfire damage in calorado bumbling biden goes off on his windmill solution and the view sunny hoston says even though justice so tomorrow was on was wrong on the facts she was somehow right on the facts you know whatever let's dive into what she meant in quick is let's get right to it this is amazing so do my or sounded like a an ill-informed and kind of dumb person during the supreme courts oral arguments last week on the biden oce mandate for vaccines she just said things that you would think nobody would say if they were acquainted with some of the most basic facts about covid here is the views sunny hoston because of course democrat has to love the i mean just to be clear so so you're so my or is an activist on the supreme court i mean she is she's like the huff posts comment section or you know the uh what's that site with what's the site with as recline vox the vox comment section made real into a person who then dispenses policy from the supreme court anyway here's the view sunny hoston trying to clean up the mess watch well first i just want to reframe this a little bit about justice sulta myor because um while you know she may not be accurate for current hospitalizations um in children she is correct that we have more children in the hospital uh now more than ever before um and it certainly reflects the current cases in children right now we have 82,843 um children are sick with with covid more than a thousand children have died from the virus um and in addition about 7.8 million children have caught covid since uh the pandemic started and so so that that those are just just the numbers yeah you know just just let's kind of find some way it doesn't sound like someone may or just know what the heck she's talking about let's just you know a bunch of numbers blah blah yeah right sure nice try bide and this was bizarre after touring the wildlife dammit i'm sorry wild fire damage in colorado that destroyed over a thousand homes here is mr. mcgu as commander in chief showing up to just say the kind of weird stuff that he says you know we're gonna have windmills you can you're gonna see that have 100 yard wingspants each each propeller on that on that uh um windmill 100 yards long so there's so much that is going to be able to be done and uh you know i uh when i visit the national reviewable lab renewable lab energy lab about 20 miles i said from here it's uh it's also going to create significant number of jobs the reason i'm telling you this what people have lost their houses the wildfire and he's mumbling about 100 yard long windmill things what this guy's the president it's it's beyond embarrassing it's it's almost like how is this even possible i mean you really think that he should be outside of some kind of a facility with a blanket over his knees you know giving peanuts to squirrels and having the family come and visit him and like that's really what he should be up to but instead he is the commander in chief of the united states military president oh anyway here's a boy who hugs his grandparents through a sheet of plastic while no one around the course is wearing a mask watch this it's really sad the lunacy that has infected this country and i really i do blame the democrat aligned corporate media their hatred of trump blinded them to all reasonableness all reality at certainly in 2020 and then beyond it just turned into being cheerleaders for biden it's appalling Anthony Fauci is a blight on this country when it comes to dealing with covid he has been an absolute disaster and all the people around him and giving voice to his ideas and supporting all this bull crap should be ashamed of themselves that all said let's take a moment to see some heroes in action of the la pd saving the life of a pilot who made an emergency landing on the railroad tracks at san fernando road and ozborn street in la right before an oncoming train collided with the aircraft check this out go
