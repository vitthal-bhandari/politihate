As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts into the premium version of our website as well. Today I am here. I'm joined by Michelle Blair and her attorney, Verna Det. Broils, who is the president and general counsel over at the Child and Parental Rights Campaign Inc. We're going to dive into a tragic and unfathomable story based on a lawsuit that Michelle and Verna Det have filed actually just this week as we're taping the podcast. First before we dig into that, I want to welcome both of you and thank you for joining the show so much. This is not an easy thing to talk about, so we very much appreciate your time. Oh, thanks for having us. Yes, Emily, thank you so much. I really appreciate you letting my voice be heard. Thank you. Absolutely, absolutely. Let me start by reading from the press release with some background on the allegations in the lawsuit that was filed in Virginia this week so that listeners are up to speed on the story and have a clear picture of the facts because this is an incredibly complicated case. And it is just, again, as I said, I'll use the word again, unfathomable on so many different levels. It's one that some people might already have heard from, although I imagine there are more details in the lawsuit that we'll get into. People who are familiar with the push for sages law in Virginia may be familiar with the contours of the case, but let's go to the press release here on Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023, the child and parental rights campaign, Inc. filed a lawsuit on behalf of Michelle Blair against the Appomattox County School Board, superintendent and net Bennett School counselor, Dina Olson, school counselor, Avery via and public defender, Anisa Khan, Mrs. Blair's parental rights were violated when school officials withheld information about her 14 year old daughters asserted a male gender identity, an ongoing harassment and the public defender interfered with Mrs. Blair's right to custody. In August 2021, Mrs. Blair's daughter Sage began identifying as a boy at Appomattox County High School. Sage had a history of mental health issues and early childhood trauma, which Mrs. Blair had shared with the school. Yet school administrators actively hid Sage suddenly identifying as a boy from her parents and did not inform them that Sage was being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by her male classmates because of it. Despite this, the school still encouraged Sage to use the boy's bathroom with a bullying and abuse continued. Because of the harassment Sage faced, she ran away from home and ultimately was drugged, raped and trafficked. After days of abuse, Sage was found in Maryland and assigned a public defender, Anisa Khan, who falsely convinced the judge that her parents were abusive and deprived Sage's mother of custody. Sage was placed in a male juvenile services facility where she was further sexually assaulted. Sage ran away from this facility and once again fell into the hands of sex traffickers who transported her to Texas where she was rescued by law enforcement and reunited with her parents. That's from the press release again and believe it or not, the details as we dive into them will be even more shocking as they continue to get fleshed out. Michelle, my first question is for you, you are Sage's grandmother, correct? You have guardianship over Sage. Is that the way? And tell us maybe just a little bit about the history there. It's in the lawsuit, but tell us about that. Yeah, my son, Sage's daddy, passed away when he was 27 in 2005 and Sage was shuffled through a few different foster homes until I finally was able to get custody and it took almost a year. So Sage came home a little shy of two years old and she was our pride and joy, the apple of my eye, the sun rose and set and me and my husband, we just loved her. We loved her and we loved every minute with her. What are Sage doing today? Well, you know, we're hopeful for a brighter tomorrow, but Sage does have a lifetime sentence of complex PTSD. And it's interesting you say that because when Sage had had trauma as a little one as a baby, I read a book while she was gone called The Body Keep Score. Because see, when I adopted Sage, I thought that, you know, I could love her through anything that she had been through as a baby. And apparently The Body Keep Score. So when puberty came, her puberty hit really hard. So she did have a rough time with puberty. And as soon as she hit like 12, I started taking her for counseling because I could see her mental health was declining. And going into that school year, you had alerted Appomattox, the school system, the Appomattox. I did. That's why I, to this day, I don't understand how this even happened because the forms you fill out when your child enters school, I let them know. I let them know she had trauma. She had mental health issues. She had been inpatient for five days a month before. So I just expected them to, you know, read the file and let me know if anything, you know, changed or if they saw her acting different. And something that strikes me about this story and these allegations is how it condemns two states. It's not just, it is not just Virginia. It's also Maryland. And wherever Sage turned as a 14 year old girl, she was let down by the system over and over and over again, according to these allegations, turning to adults for help and adults allegedly failing over and over again. And that's stunning. And I want to ask you, Vernadette, what the sort of constitutional questions on the table are constitutional and related to the law in Maryland and Virginia. What is in this lawsuit? Where have these states actually legally appear? Where did they appear to have failed on the legal questions? Well, from, I'll talk to about the legal questions, but first, when we human rights standpoint, they failed because the adults pursued their own ideological agenda as opposed to the best interests of the child. You know, the entire legal system is supposed to be set up on a standard of always at all levels at the juvenile court level and the family court level at the superior court level, even in federal court, it is always supposed to be pursuing the best interests of the child. And that did not happen here. These adults pursued their own ideological agenda. From a legal constitutional standpoint, they clearly violated the fundamental parental right that is protected by the 14th Amendment, by the due process clause. So the 14th Amendment has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States for about 100 years now to protect certain very basic fundamental rights. So the oldest of which is the right to raise your child, to be able to raise your child according to your own ideas for up upbringing, to direct the education of your child, the directly religious training of your child, and the medical and mental health care of your child. That case law has been developed over the course of time, but it's now quite here. It's a, excuse me, a fundamental constitutional right. And each step of the way, the school, the school officials and this amisa Khan, the public defender, clearly violated that fundamental constitution right. I want to get into the story of an isa Khan. And Michelle, I'll turn this one to you first. An is the public defender in Maryland. Sage ends up being trafficked, runs away from home and Appomattox ends up in Washington, DC, is sexually assaulted, ends up with a Maryland public defender in Baltimore, sort of discovered, I think by law enforcement in Baltimore, and is assigned a public defender, their allegations of the public defender fabricates stories of abuse on your behalf. And Sage ends up in squeezed in this horrific system is being housed with boys again in the process. And an isa Khan, according to these allegations, coaches sage in some just gobsmacking mind numbing ways. Tell us about the story of Sage's interactions with an isa Khan as you understand them. Sure. Well, what I would like to mention is Sage was actually rescued nine days later in Maryland in the house of a sex offender who is in jail right now. Why Sage was brought to jail, I don't understand because Sage has never been delinquent. She has always been a very innocent child. So, so when I couldn't even see her, me and my husband couldn't see her at the jail and we were told we had to go to a hearing at four o'clock, that's kind of where it all started. I don't even know why a nisa Khan, I mean, she's never even talked to me. Sage comes up on a big zoom screen and I just, I say, Sage, I love you and I start crying and she says, I love you too, Nana. And that's when an isa Khan shut down the hearing and said that I was, I was misgendering her. Oh, and then she's remained in the jail. And when we came back to the other hearing, the following week, because we had to come back, you know, the judge ended that hearing. I asked the judge, I said, why is she in a jail? Can we please get her out of the out of jail? She's done nothing wrong. Well he agreed, but unfortunately, an isa Khan convinced him that we needed to make sure she went to a facility and all boy facilities, she ended up with high risk teenage boys. I don't know how that happened. I don't know, but it was absolutely horrible. It was horrible. And in that there are echoes of what allegedly happened to Sage in the Appomattox County school system, which is, and this is the big question on the table, when they decided to keep this information from you, they were allowing Sage to use a restroom with boys. And Sage said that Sage had incredibly difficult experiences, sexual experiences in the restroom. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? Well, Sage, Sage was bullied horribly and they kept me in the dark. She was harassed, sexually harassed. She was verbally harassed. The boys pushed her around. I do not know that an actual rape occurred. And maybe Sage will someday remember if there was or wasn't, but the bottom line is she was horribly bullied on the bus with X-rated disgusting insults to the point where she was so afraid she was threatened that they would kill her and that they knew where she lived and that they knew where her family lived. So in essence, Sage ran away, not just to save herself, but she thought she was saving us. These were ended up because they didn't feel it was necessary to tell me. They kind of didn't understand trauma or I don't know how this all happened. And Michelle, can you tell us a little bit about how Sage, and I know that this comes from mental health difficulties in the years prior to 2021 as this all begins unfolding, but how Sage came to be diagnosed, at least by one counselor with gender dysphoria, how Sage came to start identifying as a boy. I think basically what we know at this point is from Sage in the school because you were kept out of the loop. But what do we know about how that unfolded back in 2021? Well, how unfolded was Sage went from being goth and then she wanted to be emo. So I've been a volunteer class since 2015 with kids. So to me, the kids need to figure out who they are and their puberty is hard. And I remember my puberty. I was a tomboy and we go through different stages. So I was just letting, I was just going along with it and I bought her a boy style clothes so she could be emo and she wanted blue hair. So my husband colored her hair. And so she was going to school as emo as far as we knew, which was fine. It was never any problem until she let them know she was going by a boy gender and a boy's name. And they just had to tell me. Yeah, they just had to tell me and I could have got a handle on it. Sorry to interrupt that was when I was reading through the lawsuit that was among the allegations. That is one of the ones that stands out to me is essentially have somebody who works at the school stopping Sage in a hallway asking whether she identifies as a boy or girl then just jumping to what you can use the boys bathroom. Am I remembering that sort of set of. Oh, you are. You. Yeah, this counselor the second day of school. They absolutely that was what Sage told me. Well, Nana, I asked and they and the counselor lady told me to use the boys bathroom because the girls are uncomfortable. Hey, y'all. This is Sarah Carter, host of the Sarah Carter show.

Now, Vernadette, this is interesting from a legal standpoint as well because schools are interested with students well being in safety when they're in their facilities and to jump from for a counselor to jump from how do you identify to it's okay to use the boys bathroom and then not tell any of this to the parents and then on top of it not do further due diligence. There's this history this entire history of mental health concerns prior to that legally. This is we're talking about Miss Olson. This is allegation against Miss Olson. What does the liability look like there? Well, there's there's going to be clear liability. So people under need to understand as school officials need to understand that endorsing the child's discordant gender identity and identity of themselves that is in direct conflict with by their biologic reality is a very it's a serious personal and mental health situation and decision to make. And it is one that school officials are not qualified. They're not competent and they're not authorized to make those of the types of decisions that only parents are authorized to make because they don't know if it's it's not about a broader, you know, school policy or curriculum issue. This is a very personal individualized mental health decision for a child. Schools are not competent authorized to make that decision. So legally they clearly they overstep their bounds and and stepped into the purview of what every all of your audience just instinctively recognizes. That's our decision to make for our child. What makes it so wrenching in this situation is that it's what set off a whole series of of actions that deeply traumatized this child. And that's what people need to get. It's not a benign intervention to drive a wedge between parents and their children just because their child expresses a discord and gender identity is actually placing these children in farms way because that's a time when they need their parents the most. And if they don't have the guidance and the assistance and and the care that their parents along are able to bring to bear in the situation, the most horrific things can begin to happen in a child's life because now they're isolated and they're off on their own to try to figure out a very troubling situation for them. So these officials own it. And Democrats in California right now are debating a bill that would prevent what they refer to as quote forced outing of children to their parents. So this is the flip side of the coin which says, you know, I would argue laughably that I mean it's not really funny, but that you the only way to keep students safe if they are just secretly transitioning or experienced before experiencing dysphoria that their parents do not support. So in their language, they would say they have anti trans parents, something like that. The only way to keep them safe is to let them keep this to school and to prevent this from going to the parents to keep the secret from the parents. So Vernadette, what is the legal? Where does that in Virginia? What does the law look like? And then legally as the other side prepares a case that I imagine might hit on that theme, where does that come into play? Well that entire mindset is completely aberrant. It presumes that children are not to be protected by their parents. It presumes as a matter of law by the state that children are to be protected. All children are to be protected from their parents. It basically presumes that parents are a threat to their own children, not the state, not the government, but that parents are presumptively a threat to their children. The day we have that is law in our country, we don't have a country anymore. Very very seriously. And so by extension, if you presume that parents that, of course, historically, naturally speaking have always our entire Western civilization has always had the presumption recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States, that parents are naturally the guardians of their children and they are naturally the ones who are going to have the best interests of their children at heart above anybody else. And so therefore, presumptively, they must be making, we have the right to make the decisions for their children. That's what our case law has been, that's what our cultural normatives have been. If we reverse that through some horrific set of laws, then we're saying that now that children are the creatures of the state, that they are the mere creatures of the state, that is exactly what the Supreme Court said they are not. All right. So fortunately, Virginia does not have a lot of fact, Virginia has some very strong protections for parents. There is a has been recognized a cause of action for interference with parental authority under Virginia common law. And so we amongst our claims that we that we have brought, we have brought a cause of action under the Virginia interference with parental rights under Virginia law. And that's in addition to the constitutional claims. And candidly, most states do not really all states still have the presumption that parents act in the best interest of their children and that they have the right to make these decisions. It's just these recent laws or bills that are being debated that are very disturbing and candidly have got to be resisted with every fiber of our bill. Michelle, on that note, what would you say to people in other states that might be considering laws that would have changed your circumstance, that would have given the school full license to do what it did wrongfully, according to these allegations? What would you say to people, even well-intentioned people who might be, they might be on the left, they might deeply care about the well-being of LGBT kids, kids suffering from the horrors of gender dysphoria, which is legitimately an incredibly painful thing. What would you say to them about allowing schools to keep parents in the dark, laws that would allow, and in fact, in some cases mandate, that schools keep parents in the dark on these huge questions of sex identification? Well, I would say if you're going to keep parents in the dark, you are robbing us of our right to protect our children because they're not experts on our children. We are. They do not know our children. I know my child better than any of them ever did. And we must be the voice of a reason for these kids. I mean, they're going for puberty. They're going to change their minds when the wind blows. That's just what it is. So to put adult decisions on a child to begin with, and never mind behind the parents back, it's just going to cause, it's just the consequences are going to be horrible. I mean, I can just see the writing on the wall with this happening. I mean, if you're going to take my child away from me and put her in a safe house, I don't even know what we're going to do. I mean, you have to remember I was traumatized. Not only are these children being traumatized, we are too. These parents, I was petrified to speak out. I didn't know what to say. So I'm not alone, but I will tell you that we love our children. We are not the bad guys. We want what's best for our children. And I think that parents need to stand together and let them know that. Emily, I had served for five years on the state board of the department who services here in Georgia, which has our Child Protective Services as part of that agency. I helped co-chair the Child Protective Services subcommittee. And I can just tell you that states are struggling to respond to actual legitimate abuse and neglect. They can barely handle the number of cases and the number of kids in foster care due to actual legitimate abuse and neglect, physical, sexual harm and so forth, that they can really hardly even handle those cases. And to think of taking away children from loving parents is we're talking about completely destroying and undermining, completely destroying the system, so that you can't actually respond to kids who do need that are being of truly abuse. You think about it just completely perverse? You know, I'm really glad you make that point because I was actually just going to ask about the cases or the points in these allegations where we see incompetence together with ideology or incompetence instead of ideology. I mean, some of these cases, the one thing that stands out to me, I'm going to read actually from the lawsuit because this one is just unbelievable where you have an officer Gunter in this case. Gunter Gunter is interrogating, intimidating and threatening sage according to the lawsuit who is the sexual harassment victim. The way that officer allegedly treated sage is again a situation where it seems to me like they just, it's beyond ideology. They have no idea what they're doing. And I had a similar reaction to the allegations about Maryland where sage ends up in this group home being abused. Is that the consequence of ideology as well? Yes. But it also seems like they have no idea what they're doing with these precious children. And both of you may have thoughts on that because in some cases to me it seems like it's a combination of ideology and incompetence and not just one or the other. Thank you. Thank you. Now what I need to piggyback on that because that's where sage finally broke was when she was being interrogated. I did not know had I known that the bullying was this horrific that parents had to even call in. I would have taken sage out of that school immediately. I would have taken her out immediately and got her the mental health support that she's so desperately needed. And I'll add to that. The ideology particularly obviously in the school, when Michelle every talked about that within the Maryland juvenile court system, the ideology drove the incompetence. Because best practice in terms of handling trauma in terms of responding to victims. This was a victim of sexual assault and sex trafficking. Rape, not just a pat on the rear end. Multiple rape and sex trafficking. This is probably the most serious of combat victims. And somehow for frankly the police officer been born importantly this public defender to bring her into the juvenile system as if she's a juvenile delinquent. Frankly, it was in order to maintain control. That was the purpose of all of this. And so the ideology overwhelmed everything that we all know about trauma, about sex abuse victims, about children needing their parents and how they should be restored immediately to the parents unless there's an actual proof of actual abuse and neglect. All of these well established understanding of children was thrown out the door. Not to mention how vulnerable Sage is not even 100 pounds. She's small. She's a small girl. The idea of putting a diminutive little girl who already had been raped in with troubled boys, again, you're throwing out our basic knowledge of youth, of kids because of the ideology, the ideology drives the competence.

Check out the Watchtower on Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski on Apple Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. It's disgusting. And on top of that, it reminds me of what we were talking about earlier of Miss Olson allegedly jumping to, oh, go ahead, use the boys bathroom without even considering this history of mental health that Michelle, you had disclosed to the school that the school rightfully needed to know in order to prevent decisions like this allegedly from happening. Michelle, can you tell us more about, I imagine over the course of this incredibly painful experience, you've learned how human trafficking in some cases happens and child trafficking in some cases happens. I imagine some listeners are curious about that. My understanding from the lawsuit is that Sage left through a window was then somehow got into contact with someone who brought her up to Washington, DC. And then to Baltimore, she ended up in Texas at one point. Can you tell us what you've learned about that industry and those patterns from this entire ordeal? Well, what I've learned is that social media, I think COVID really took a hit on all these kids mental health because everybody's been on the social media. And these kids are vulnerable. And if I have to sign a document at school to let the school give my daughter a title and all, then I'm pretty sure I should sign something to allow her to go into the same bathroom as a boy. So when she left, she was having a mental breakdown. So when this Virginia guy picked her up, I mean, they brought out certain rescue dogs that lost the scent. So she obviously was meeting people that were grooming her that she just did not know because that's how she ended up losing her innocence. And I mean, just horrible circumstances. Like Bernadette was just saying, just horrible. From Virginia to DC to Maryland, where we could have ended it on day nine and it just continued from there. And when Sage was missing, I ended up with Freedom 424 on Lynchburg, a nonprofit organization that gave me so much knowledge, scared me. But now I understand why these kids are leaving home. And it has really just because their kids running away, because that's what teenagers do. They're looking for excitement. I don't think it really has anything to do with lifestyle. It's just a teenage thing because their brains are still developing. And she really, truly thought she was meeting a 16 year old kid. So it was not only a rude awakening, it almost killed her. It's a miracle this child's alive. It really is. These guys are good, man. They're waiting on every corner. They are in every game room. They are everywhere. They're just waiting for kids exactly like Sage that have had a lot of trauma. You know, and Emily, that's what makes it so insidious that school officials across the country are unfortunately, what happened to Sage in terms of the secretive transitioning at school is by no stretch and isolated incidents by no just the opposite. There is a national movement where we're all across the country where school officials are taking the position that they are deliberately undermining the authority of parents when a child expresses a discord and gender identity. Whereas in just, you know, just a few years ago, they, you know, generally speaking, the position was to work cooperatively with parents and be and transparently. It's now you're just seeing this domino effect all across the nation of promoting this ideology. And as part of it is deliberately cutting out the parents. And what I want to continue to stress is that when you do that, you place a child. There are, there are predators. There are people out there that are waiting for children to be isolated and they're waiting for children to fall into their nets, into their into their webs. All right. And so by by by driving wedges between between teens and their parents at an at an at a stress time of stress and distress in their life, you are setting children up for harm. And unless you're prepared to own all the consequences that your interference with parental rights sets in motion, then you shouldn't start it to begin with because otherwise you need to own it all. That's right. I agree. Michelle, has it been frustrating with this personal experience to watch this issue be sort of kicked around like a political football in the the national discourse over the last couple of years? Is it hard to to watch that having gone through what you did? Yeah, 100% 100% I read, you know what? I just it just drives me like my heart breaks every single time because, you know, I moved out of the big city in Massachusetts to raise my daughter, my granddaughter here in a small town. So this was never on my radar. So that that kind of is my warning to people. My top priority has always been sage and my ability to protector was just robbed. It was stolen from me by by a small town. So I guess my morning is guys, this is real. This is happening. It's not just to say just to our children all over the nation. And if you don't think it could happen to you, you need to think again, you really, really do because, you know, if it wasn't for me having the training as a casa, I would never, ever have made it through this. My mental health never would have made it through this alive. I'm so serious. I don't know how parents are handling this. I just happened to have some experience with the, the court system for children juvenile court system. But without that, I was, I would have been, I don't, I don't know. I mean, my husband was 73. He could not be. He almost even the judge had to ask him the bail to remove him because he couldn't remember to call her by a boy's name. It was horrible. We were in tears. Like just, and I kept asking him, okay, could you just please get somebody to talk to her about all the trauma she should please, please. And if they just, they just did not see it as a trauma case, it was hard, hard wrenching. And candidly, that should never have been necessary for your husband to have to have to be put through that. I just want to say this is not, this is no longer a big cat, a big city, small town, a town issue anymore. And it's not even a right left issue anymore. We encounter parents from every part of the political spectrum. We help all parents. And if there's any civil lining in all of this Emily, I wish I could leave with some ray of hope because it's so dark is that we're actually seeing this issue, this issue of parental rights be a unifying issue where I have, I have colleagues and I have parents on the left and on the right saying, you know what, we agree on this one thing, that parents have to be the ones who make these decisions. And they're not going to, we're not going to let our, you know, school officials or others take that out of our hands. So it actually is bringing right and left together in many ways, certainly at the grassroots. And we want to challenge those leaders that have stood against this parental rights issue. Wake up, wake up, wake up. It flipped things in Virginia. So again, let's let this be an issue that brings us together because we all want to protect our kids. Yes, I agree. I so agree with that. Well, you have both been so, so fascinating to listen to and so generous with your time. Michelle Blair is the mother of Sage.
