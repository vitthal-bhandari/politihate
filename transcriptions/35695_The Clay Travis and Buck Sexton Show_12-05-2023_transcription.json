Promo code Clay. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Second hour of Clay and Buck kicks off right now. This is Buck coming to you solo today. Clay is at his wife's law school graduation. He's spending the day with the family 802.82.82 on the phone line. Paul Lynch, whatever you like. It is Friday after all. So anything that you think is important that we're talking to you about here, the CNN Town Hall continues to have a bit of fallout, which I got to say is pretty remarkable. Really. When you think about it, they have the leading Republican on for a town hall. And you know what the part of it is that I think they really couldn't stand. It's not that Trump was on CNN, although they they hate that. They hate that for sure. But it's also that he didn't have a room full of sneering lives who hate him to his and boo and shout him down. He had a squad of of MAGA folks for the most part of him. That's who was there up in New Hampshire. And that really left, I think, a very bad taste in the mouths of the CNN audience that was watching it. Because if Trump is going to be on their channel, and that's how they think of it, right? If he's going to be on that Democrat aligned platform, he needs to know that it is his job to toe the line, that it is his job to say the things that they want him. I'm sorry, that that the audience needs to toe the line that they need to say the things that they would say if they were in his position, right? So the audience is supposed to be there to be boo, terrible. I mean, I remember when I used to go on CNN, it was always, it was illuminating because I go on, I could make the most baseline, normal Republican argument. And I did sometimes possible. I mean, I would even go and say things like, Hey, when there's a big terrorist attack by some guy who is a jihadist for ISIS, these young walk bar, you know, I'm the most mad at the terrorist and the terrorist ideology and the people at ISIS, you know, an ISIS. But at CNN, sometimes they were mad at the lack of assimilation in Europe. I mean, they had other problems that they would get angry about, right? That's, but I would go on and make the most normal argument imaginable. And I would look, and I learned not to do this afterwards on Twitter. It was all, you're so stupid and ugly. And you should just jump off a bridge and it was, Oh, okay, whoa, whoa, CNN need to calm down a little bit. Some of the CNN watchers. So that is their expectation that if you're on the right side or even a true centrist, a real centrist, not a make believe one who's just there to dump on Republicans, the whole point is for you to be attacked, maligned, undermined, and ridiculed. That didn't happen. And so the CNN audience has the sad feelings now. They're very sad. And so Anderson Cooper still has a show over there. Still going, I wouldn't say strong, but still doing this thing over at CNN. After all the years after weaponizing CNN into an anti Trump loony bin, they're still doing their thing over there. Here is Anderson Cooper trying to calm down all of the CNN audience that is still furious about the town hall that happened. Play 14. Many of you think CNN shouldn't have given him any platform to speak. And I understand the anger about that, giving him the audience, the time I get that. But this is what I also get. The man you were so disturbed to see and hear from last night, that man is the front runner for the Republican nomination for president. And according to polling, no other Republican is even close. You have every right to be outraged today and angry. Never watched this network again. But do you think staying in your silo and only listening to people you agree with is going to make that person go away? If we all only listen to those we agree with, it may actually do the opposite. It's fascinating to see this change because you know that back in the 2016 election cycle, they had Trump on all the time. I should say they had his rallies on. They weren't having town halls with him in this way, but they would run the Trump rally. They wouldn't even have an anchor there to, you know, to push back on him. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. They didn't have that. And you know why? Because it was the belief of the Democrats, as you all know, and it's a remarkable moment in American political history. It was their belief that the more people saw Trump, it was just a spectacle they could laugh at. It was a clown show. It was buffoonery. It was a circus that no one would take seriously. And then he beat Hillary. Hello. The least charming politician in modern American history. That's amazing. She got as far as she did. Is it what you think about it? So that's what happened there. So now CNN doesn't really know. Well, can we even put him on air if we just attack him with the anchor? But we have the part of it that they couldn't stomach was that the audience was with Trump. That was, I think, part of it that was far too much. And now it's funny, though, because this happens one time, one night, and over at MSNBC. Now there's a competitive situation playing out here over at MSNBC. You have Joy Reid saying CNN wants to be Fox News. Play 13. A few things to me became clear last night. Number one, CNN wants desperately to be the new home for Republican viewers. They want to be the new Fox. They want to move to the right. That's part of Lick's agenda. Clearly. And Chris Lick used to work here. He used to be E.P. of Morning Joe for a while. He used to work at CNN. CBS, I'm sorry. But it's clear that what he's doing over there, and under John Malone, you know, who's the big investor and the people above him, it's clear that the goal is to make it a friendly place for MAGA. A friendly place for MAGA. That's funny because, dude, to any of you feel like CNN is a friendly play. Think about it. The anchor is no sir. You're lying, or, you know, at Caitlin College, you're lying, you're lying. That's not true. That's not true. A friendly place for MAGA. That's not going to happen. But the Democrat political media audience has been conditioned in near Pavlovian fashion to expect that there won't be any, any scary hurtful thoughts that Republicans have on their channels, on their screens, unless it is purely to be ridiculed. It is not to be taken seriously. It is purely to be a point of of ridicule. And you really do feel like with so many of these Democrat pundits, when they speak about these issues, they've abandoned principles, sure, but they've also never even considered that the other side might have an argument that's worth hearing, not that they would agree with, but that they should at least know and understand. I could sit here and make the arguments to you on MSNBC. I could probably make them better than the people at MSNBC do. I could make the arguments from going pretty far all the way. I'd say all the way to the left. I mean, I would feel dirty doing it. I'd feel bad about myself. But I would know how to do it. I understand what they say. Remember, the first thing is to understand the mindset of the contemporary Democrat in America, you have to just not just embrace, but you have to luxuriate in hypocrisy. The whole point is that you get to pretend to be someone and to care about things or want things a certain way that you don't want at all, that you're not going to live your life that way. The fun of being a leftist, if you can say they're such a thing, certainly the benefit of being a leftist in material terms is you get to make millions of dollars while talking about how you love radical socialism. So much or just socialism. You get to live your life. You get to fly around in private jets if you're really important while talking about the problems of climate change. You get to live in safe neighborhoods where you have armed security often while making sure that other people, including people in high crime neighborhoods who are law abiding and just want to be safe, are left defenseless and so on and so forth. Go down the whole list. I mean, members of Congress are effectively exempted from insider trading laws while they pass laws that send people away to prison for years for doing the same thing. Remember with Obamacare, they all they love to Obamacare. The members of Congress, they didn't want to be subject to Obamacare. Like they didn't want to be on any of those plans, but they want everybody else to. That's the, that's the basis of it. That's the basic standard for being a Democrat because no one would really want to live with what they want for other people as a leftist. And this is why it's so funny when I call them commies or I'll discuss, discuss issues like this and refer to them as the communist Democrats. They'll say, well, they're not true communists really. Is the Chinese Communist Party true, true communists who really is the true communist? I mean, let's think about that for a second. You sit around and you recognize every time this is really done anywhere, there's a class of people who are incredibly powerful, powerful, incredibly wealthy and live a different existence from the pro-letarians and the bourgeois and everybody else that they pretend to either support or that they openly oppress, right? The whole point of it is you get to live a very different life. There's a great book about this by Milavon Gilles, called the new class. And if you haven't ever read it, I would say it's worth, I think it's, it might be out of print. You can usually pick it up. Milavon Gilles, the new class he talks about in some detail how the whole point of the system in Yugoslavia, the communists in Yugoslavia was that they were able to live these lives of power, ease and wealth relative to the rest of society. That's what communism really is. And that's really what being a Democrat is in different form today, different name, but similar idea. They don't actually want this stuff for themselves. They want it all for you. And this is why when you have Donald Trump on TV and able to expose them for lacking the principles they care, they pretend to espouse not really having any connection to the working class. And one of the funniest things is liberal elites going on TV all the time. We care so much about the working class. That's why they're going to raise taxes, raise, you know, take more of your money, have more regulation, make you live in more crime, bringing more legal immigrants. That's great for the working class. Only in the issue, only on the, on the concern of immigration is supply and demand magically suspended doesn't doesn't matter anymore. So you can bring millions of low wage workers into the country, low, I should say low skilled workers competing for entry level wage jobs. And that won't have any effect. This has been proven many times by anyone who really looks at analysis that it's not true. It's just that the wages change in different places, depending on the migration patterns of where illegal immigrants are clustering at any point in time. That's what which makes perfect sense, right? If you have a million illegal show up in New York City, more illegals, then the wage scale in New York will be affected. It probably isn't going to ripple all the way across to Washington state, understandable. But they're lying to you constantly about all of this. And they can't actually allow someone to make the case directly without them being booed and jeered. And even then, I think, it's they would still be complaining if Donald Trump had had a hostile crowd there. They would still say, don't platform him. He's the leading Republican contender. Don't platform him. My friend Molly Hemingway, who's a brilliant writer, and she's over at Fox as a contributor. She says here, the media meltdown over Trump just shows they don't trust the American people to see and make decisions. They have to run a propaganda machine. Play 15. This is not just the former president. This is the like far and away top candidate for the next Republican nomination. The idea like the media meltdown over this means that they don't really trust the American people like asking questions, get the answers, trust the American people to make the decision, but they don't. They basically handled everything by silencing him for the last few years. And it actually counterintuitively made it all that more refreshing to see him. You're like, not sick of hearing him for the last few years. So it was like, wow, I forgot this was great. It is very, very engaging, very entertaining. Someone taking the fight to the other side. We can all understand. And I think that's also really important point. They effectively deplatform Trump from the internet under the Biden regime. That's had a major effect. Yeah, is that true social? I know you're but it just doesn't have the reach doesn't have the user base that say Facebook does. Facebook is hundreds of billions of dollar market cap company with a billion users globally, right? I mean, maybe truth gets there one day, but it's a different, different scale. And this just shows you once again, they, it isn't it interesting. It's not just elections. They want to rig. It's the marketplace of ideas too. It all has to be rigged because in a fair system, they lose. hosting a three hour radio show is a lot longer than three hours when you factor in all the prep that Clay and I do.

I believe this is from Libs of TikTok or maybe it's from End Wokeness. There are these great accounts that just show you what the left really thinks and what they really believe. Play 23. If you would, sir, I threw this up. There we go. Oh, we don't, we don't have 23. How do we not have, we have 23. I know we do. Because it's on the sheet that says we've got it and I have so much faith because if we don't have it, then I'm just going to. All right, I'll read the transcript for clip 23. It says, my children are all, I'm sorry, my, my children are all queer. This is the quote. My eldest child is non binary. My son is gay. My youngest is fluid. So this is a Hollywood actress who is telling you that all three of her, she describes them as queer. This is the quote, but they're all members of the LGBTQIA plus community. And I'm just wondering at what point do we get to start to look at the math here and say, Hmm. That's, that seems really unlikely. That seems like something that maybe is more related to the people who are pushing this on them, like maybe a, in this case, a parent who is a very leftist Hollywood type. Hmm. Maybe we'll have that sound, but we come back. We'll try. To my fellow gun owners out there, if you're getting the range this weekend, good for you, for those of us who can't, the next best thing is a no ammo, all electronic training, a tool called the Mantis X. Look, it works so well. It simply attaches to your firearm, like a weapon light connects to your smartphone and the Mantis X app that you download. The Mantis X gives you data driven real time feedback and your technique helps with your aim by guiding you through drills and courses. Nearly everyone sees improvement within the first 20 minutes of using the Mantis X. Product is also being used by the US military and special forces. It's military grade technology at an affordable price. The Mantis X, it is a must have for every gun owner. I'm actually just texting with my brothers today about when we're getting the range the next time they can be like, Oh, wow. Look at this. Look at that trigger pull. Look at that site picture lineup that he's got there. He's been using this Mantis X. Get yours today. M A N T I S X dot com. That's mantis X dot com. All right, as promised, we do have this soundbite now for you from Marsha Gay Hardin. She's an actress. I am not familiar with her work. Really. I think the most well known movie she's in is Meet Joe Black. I am a big fan of 90s cinema, but I meet Joe Black is I haven't seen. That's 1998. There's some others on here anyway, not neither here nor there, but not not a point is she's going viral right now because she claims that her three children are it's not it's not like, um, well, you know what? I'll let let's let her say it and then we can start to break down the numbers a little bit. What drives is my children are all queer. My eldest child is non binary. My son is gay. My youngest is fluid and you know, they're my kids and I they teach me every day. I'm not a non binary gay and fluid. Those are the designations she has for her children. And if you look at this, I know there's been a there's this like mass. There's all this data now that's meant to show you. I think the data is meant to obscure a lot of ways. What's really happening, which is the indoctrination, particularly of of children and indoctrination. Not it's sometimes parents, sometimes schools, sometimes, you know, TikTok and media, but there is a brain washing that is going on of young people very clearly to think that they are all on this spectrum that is ever changing. And and there are additions, hence the plus at the end, LGBTQIA plus. It's second time I'm bringing up CI in the show. I used to know acronyms pretty well. CIA, you kind of live in the acronym world. We never had an acronym that long that I can remember. LGBTQIA. Well, now there is a like transgender being serious. There's actually transgender appreciation day and all these federal agencies. And they're trying to increase their trends, they're trans hiring as much as they can. Because when you're talking about someone the FBI or CIA, you know, whether they identify as non binary or not, that's very important to the mission. So yeah, let's look at the numbers here for a second. He's got this is reminds me a little bit of the Disney chief of content. Remember this woman? Maybe we'll pull that audio to who claimed to have, I think it was either two or three children who are all also. Had any of you heard, I just asked you, I know this is anecdotal. But if I said, it had five years ago, 10 years ago, were you hearing actresses coming out to say or corporate executives coming out to say that, you know, three or four of my three kids are four kids. They're all these new gender identities. And are we supposed to believe so? Is this now an innate thing? Or is this a conditioned thing? Is this an identity? Because the whole part of the issue here is if they're saying it's a fluid identity, well, then that means it is changing. And we know from D transitioners that even the trans identity, sometimes people decide who have become trans that they are no longer going to be trans. So what does that tell you about whether is this this is in an eight characters? No, it can't be an eight has to be this is a nature nurture argument, right? This has to be a predominantly, if not entirely, nurture as in environmental situation, right? I mean, it has to be doesn't it? Now you've got Gen Z, you know, saying something like 20% of Gen Z identifies on this LGBTQIA plus spectrum. And you say, well, is this because they want you to be the left wants you to believe that this is because people are now free to be themselves. You're free to be yourself. But if that's the case, why are they so interested in going to children at the youngest age possible, they want to introduce sexual identity and norms and even behaviors and practices to children and an age that is far younger than say, your cisgender standard heterosexual parents are trying to introduce this, right? It's not like we're saying, Oh, no, we don't want you teaching our third grader about being pansexual and gender fluid. We just really want to get into like, you know, all the other stuff that's going on the realm of sex and sexuality. So they know and not even just third grade, you know, kindergarten. No, that's not the argument. Notice one side wants to inject this stuff into the curriculum into the classrooms as young as they possibly can. Why? And when we say, hold on, can you not do that? This just happened here in Florida, the parental rights and education bill, which I think everyone needs to know is the real name of the bill that they have tried to slander with some some other name, the parental rights and education bill, which even Democrats in the state of Florida supported and Ron DeSantis took a tremendous amount of heat for from the national media, but not from people who live in a state, not really. They were on board with this. He was saying, can we just not do this? I know they've raised the age now even even further, but initially it was two third graders and the left wing activists and the active very powerful activists of the LGBTQ, I a plus community were outraged about this. And there's some, uh, what's her name? Charlize Theron. She's a famous actress. It's gonna say for better or for worse, definitely for worse. In this situation, she's saying, you know, she's, I can't repeat what she says, but she's gonna go mess people up who are opposed to transgender story hour for kids. Why do they want to do this? They want you to think that somehow having adult men who for the last 50 years of psychiatry, it's believed men who dress up as women do so because they get sexual gratification for it. We're not supposed to believe that anymore, but it's true. They want to go dress up as women and be in front of, not just children for storybook hour, but for dancing and, you know, gyrating their pelvis isn't all this stuff. Why is it so important to left? You would think that given this isn't a really nationally popular position. Why do they want to do it? So badly? Well, you see this all ties together because now we have idiot actresses who are saying that, you know, I have, I have three children and all of them are, you know, gender fluid, non-susgender pansexual. These kids probably can't even spell these words. They certainly can't define them, but the parents are out there like they're showing off a fashionable handbag talking about how their child is this new gender identity that who who even knew what this was. I mean, I like to think I have a decent vocabulary. I speak for a living and I remember when the Disney head of content said that she had a pansexual child. That is a quote, by the way, a quote. I was like, what does that mean? And every time I bring this up, somebody goes, wait, what is that? And even when I try to define it, I'm like, I don't need anything. It's like everything. What does that mean? Where are the limits? Ah, where are the limits? Maybe that's the essential question and all this. What comes next? What's the what's the next phase of this? What's the next part of the conversation? Look at how dug in they are on trying to get children to believe that they are part of this community even even goes beyond that. They want to. Oh, wait, we have, we have the Disney executive. This is from some months ago. This was early in the fight between Disney and what became the fight with Ron DeSantis over this, which he is winning. I should note, he is winning despite what the national media may be telling you, he is setting a standard in the state of Florida for other states. Kevin Stitt out in Oklahoma doing good stuff on this front too. We have him on this show. Governor of Oklahoma getting high fives were getting good sound same policy done. But what kind of stuff am I talking about? Here is the the director of creative content for a multi billion dollar story. American corporation Disney talking about, well, let's hear let's hear her say it. It's 24. I'm here as a mother of two queer children actually, one trans gender child and one pansexual child and also as a leader. And that was a thing that really got me because I have heard so much from so many of my colleagues over the course of the last couple of weeks and open forums and through emails and phone conversations. And I feel a responsibility to speak, not just for myself, but for them. Okay, we're getting to a transgender child and a pansexual child. What she was Carrie Burke, president of Disney general entertainment content. I even remember basically what she was doing for Disney. It's a senior job there. What are the statistical chances of that? What are the chances he has a transgender child, which we all know is at certainly less than 1% of the population and then a pansexual by the way, a child. She's not saying these are you're sitting here saying, hold on a second. Well, how old are these individuals? That's one part of this. I don't know, by the way, but I assume she means her kids. Maybe they're adult kids. Fine. What are the numbers? What are the numbers here? And you're looking at it's basically impossible unless you're a mom who's conditioning your kids and then other things inside are conditioning kids to believe this or young people to believe this about themselves. Why is that? Well, why do they want to tell doctors that they get the gender of the baby wrong, which is a thing that the left, the activists of the trans community will say now they get the gender of the baby wrong. It really boils down to this. If they can get you to say something that is so provably false and makes you feel so stupid, it debases your ability to think about anything else with confidence. If they can get you, and I'm going to say there are some big conservative sites out there that call transgender, you know, male to female, she know that is wrong. They should not do that because by going along with the lie, you are a part of the lie. All right, look, with Mother's Day this weekend, let me take a moment to recognize an organization that's helped tens of thousands of women bring unborn children into this world. The organization is preborn, and they operate a network of clinics under that name nationwide. Preborn provides the resources for pregnant mothers making a decision on the future of their unborn child. Most often, they're contemplating an abortion, but preborn gives them an alternative. They offer support, love, and understanding. They also provide an ultrasound or multiple ultrasounds to meet their unborn child. That experience of hearing their child's heartbeat and seeing their babies movements via ultrasound often leads that mother to make a decision to give that baby life. They go on to welcome their child into this world. And this weekend, they will be celebrating Mother's Day alongside so many other proud mothers. So really, let's make more mothers this Mother's Day. You could help bring life to both a mother in need and an at risk baby. Each ultrasound costs only $28. Every penny you donate goes toward loving mothers and babies. To get involved, simply dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 say baby or visit preborn.com slash buck.

If I had to pick one, I think it would probably be my number one of the 1980s. So take that for what it's worth. 80 is a great, a great decade for music or question about it. Also, I mentioned a moment ago that Kevin state, the governor of Oklahoma is doing some very good stuff out there in his state. And here he is saying, you know, we're, they're not going to allow black rocks. Some of these massive, we're just talking about Disney and Florida. Some of these massive financial institutions are using your pension money or 401k money, etc. To push far left ideological agendas. And you're like, wait a second, I'm just, they're supposed to be custodians of the money, you know, invested in the stock market for me. And over time, it's supposed to grow. We'll see how that's going these days. But you get the idea, right? Well, they're also pushing DEI. They're also pushing these new equity programs where they're even pushing ESG, right? What is that? Environmental social governance. And Kevin Stimp, governor out there is like, no, we're just not doing that with the state of Oklahoma anymore. So here's what he says, play it. All we're saying is, you can't use our pension funds and our assets to push some political agenda. That's all we're saying. Black Rock doesn't want to turn into the next button light. That's for sure. As soon as you stop attacking the oil and gas industry, as soon as you start stop pushing a political agenda with our pension funds, we're happy to do business with you. There you go. Stop using the money that has given you for one thing to push for another, right? To push for politics that the people who are entrusting these institutions do not want. So I think it's interesting. David in Louisville, Kentucky, this is interesting. A licensed clinical social worker. Talk to me, David. What's going on with the transgender agenda? Okay. Well, this is my observation being in this field for nearly 30 years. About 20 years ago, the transgender people and the transgender activists wanted to get gender identity disorder removed from the DSL. I think because of the stigma. And what it's been interesting to me observing it is how they've came back full circle again using the mental health concerns as a reason why they should be getting gender affirming care. So basically, the arguments came back full circle to me in my observation over the past 20 years. I find that just to be ironic. Well, you know, they've been doing that. Thank you for calling in. You're correct. Others have noted this. He mentioned the DSM just for all of you listening. That's the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, shorthand it as the DSM. And it's the guidebook, if you will, the mental health disorders. And they have, this has become very political. One of the challenges here is that psychiatrists are about as left wing by the numbers as gender studies professors at Wesleyan University. I mean, psychiatrists are overwhelmingly very left way, which not all, not all, but a lot of them. And psychologists too. So what's happened is there's been all of this political pressure as well as ideological reasons to change what had been the accepted scientific understanding of things in the realm of psychiatry to suit the needs of the left wing agenda, and particularly the trans agenda. So things that I've been bringing this up, body identity integrity disorder is considered a still, thankfully, a mental health, serious mental health issue. It's repulsive right arm. We can all agree. And the people, believe it or not, people who have this very, very sad, very serious mental illness think their arm should be or their leg should be removed. Why is that clearly still okay? We need to help this person. The person does need help. This is about compassion. This is about compassion for people to help them have the best healthiest outcome and live the best possible life. But why is it that removing a healthy right arm is obviously mental illness, but removing genitalia because of identity is to be celebrated and pushed and pushed on children. These are the questions we all have to ask. The borders and absolute mess. It is chaos. I'm going to bring you up to speed with the latest what we're seeing down there and also where I think all of this is going. What is the Biden administration plan for this?
