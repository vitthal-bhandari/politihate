    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Duchinsky, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I'm so excited to be joined by Richard Reeves. He's a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, where he holds the John C. and Nancy D. Whitehead Chair. He's also the director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative and of Brookings New Boys and Men Project. And he's the author, speaking of that, of Boys and Men, why the modern male is struggling, why it matters, and what to do about it. That book is out on September 27th. Richard, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it. Yeah, I'm really excited about this book. It comes up a lot on this podcast, but my college job was helping Christina have summers with the re-release of War Against Boys. So this is... Yes, I think I knew that. Christina is on the back of the book. She is. And in the book. So, I think I'm doing an event with her at some point soon, so she's closely tracking this book. Wonderful. And I saw actually the collection of people who blarbed the book is so interesting. Ann Marie Slaughter, Andrew Yang, Christina. It's just a fantastic collection of people who've been working in the space as you have been for a long time. And I wanted to start just by asking the most obvious question to establish the problem itself. Why do we know, and how do we know, the modern male is indeed struggling? What metrics show us that this is a real problem? Well, I think if we consider three of the main areas of flourishing in life to either be represented by or caused by education, work and family, probably right out there. If you think about the triangle of human flourishing, that's getting there. What we learn and the kinds of families we're able to form and the relationships we have in our families. And on all three of those, there are signs of male struggle. It's important to say that it's much more true of working-class men and black men. There's a lot of inequality in this. And I think that's really part of the problem with having this conversation is if you were talking to a Lee audience, they tend to look around and go, wait, what problem again with boys and men? They're not looking at the whole distribution. And so in education, you'll see some absolute drops in male achievement in some areas, certainly very, very slow improvement. And a big gender gap, having emerged with boys and men falling a long way behind women and girls. That was an important difference between a relative and an absolute gap here. But to put a pin in it in 1972, when Title IX was passed, men were about 13 percentage points more likely to get a college degree. Now it's 15 percentage points the other way around. So the gender gap in college degree attainment is bigger today than it was in 1972, and Title 9 was passed, but the other way around. If you look at the highest, the people with the highest GPAs coming out high school, two thirds of them are girls, et cetera. And so in education, pretty much at every level and around the world, there's now a pretty big gender gap with boys and men falling behind women and girls. In the labor market, the US is a bit unusual in the most men in the US earn less than most men did in 1979. So if American men were a nation and we're measuring measuring the economic output of that nation through their earnings, then that nation would be poorer today. American men had as poor a nation today that it wasn't 17, which is a really important economic fact. In many other countries that's not as true, the male wages have been flat or growing slowly, but in the US, we've actually seen a slight slip back. At the top, of course, male wages have increased, some only everybody else at the top. But certainly, and a significant rise in dropping labor force participation, Nick Everstadt, AI has a new report out updating his previous workman, our work, which really dives into the numbers on this nine million men of prime working age, and what are they doing? And so that's an issue. And then the third leg of this is family where we're just seeing a really big increase in the number of children who are growing up with our strong relationship with their fathers. And that's for all kinds of reasons we can get into. But a big one is the decline in marriage, especially outside of the upper middle class. So 40% of kids now born outside marriage. Only a minority of American kids will grow up their entire life childhood, rather, with both biological parents. And so there's been a really radical transformation in family. And the big result of that has been what David Blankenhall has called an epidemic of fatherlessness. And there are various ways that we can kind of talk about that problem. But no one really doubts that there is a problem. And the problem gets worse in the sense that it is boys in particular and boys from less advantage backgrounds in particular who suffer most from a lack of a strong relationship with their father. So that then becomes an intergenerational element to male problems as well. When men struggle, they're less likely to be formed in good relationships with their kids. And so in school and so on, because they suffer, they're more likely to grow up suffering too. So there is a stronger intergenerational element to male disadvantage and there is the female disadvantage. Are we seeing exacerbated problems when it comes to incarceration, crime, suicidality, suicidality, drug addiction, alcohol addiction? Have we seen increases in male suffering in those metrics over time? Or has that remained steady? Yeah, all of the above have increased. It's worth saying that many of those have increased for women too, but from a much lower base and to significantly lesser extent. And so if we take the much talked about deaths of despair in the US, that's something I know Angus Deaton and Anne Case really popularized that idea of looking at deaths from drug related overdoses, including especially, of course, opioids, alcohol related illnesses. Or suicide men are three times greater risk of a death of despair than women are men and all age groups are at least three times more likely to die from suicide than women are. And that number has risen significantly. And that's true in the US, but in the UK, for example, where I originally come from suicide is the biggest is the leading cause of death for men under the age of 45 in the UK now. So there are these gaps have existed for a long time. They exist everywhere, but they have gotten wider in many cases. But more importantly, in some ways, just the absolute number of men who are suffering from some of these symptoms of a malaise has just gone up quite significantly. And you're already touched on what my next two questions are going to be, but I think you probably is helpful even to flesh them out as you do in the book. To what extent does class explain or intersect with this problem and also race? I think they're both probably very important factors. So where do we see the interaction of those variables? Yeah, you're right. I mean, it's again, I think it's one of these things where we have to be very careful about how we use binaries. And I think that's true for male female. I think it's also real often true for white, white, black, rich, poor. You've really got to start looking at how these things intersect. So there's this whole idea and progressive thinking from Kimberly Crenshaw around intersectionality. Well, applied in my view properly. What that means is you look at how some men are actually at a greater disadvantage than the equivalent women. And that's particularly true for black men. And so in education, for example, black women are twice as likely to get a college degree as black men as a two to one gap. In fact, young black women are a little bit more likely now to have a postgraduate degree than young white men. So you've got to say a good example of how to have to think across both those domains. And in the labor market, white women earn a lot more than black men. Black men are an 84 cents on the dollar for white women. White women ever took black men in the 1990s. And so there's this really, the picture is quite complex. But the basic messages, the one you alluded to, which is the main problems being experienced by men are not those at the top. It is those in the particular bottom half or two thirds of the distribution is working class and low income men and black men in particular. And so every gender gap that we might talk about in this conversation, just assume that it's twice as wide at the bottom as it is at the top. And that's a pretty good proxy. Every education gap, every only go to it's just a bigger problem at the bottom. Folks should go listen to the interview we did with Dr. Ebersstadt about a month ago, because it gets into the... Yes, I forgot you'd had him on. Yeah, it was a preview, it's sort of a preview of his paper, I think. Right, yeah, absolutely. And to that extent, I wanted to ask about social capital because Dr. Charles Murray and everybody as you go back to Robert Putnam, they've done a lot of work on this. And in relation to men in particular, especially when we talk about class, I'm curious as to how some of this relates to marriage rates, how some of this relates to family cohesion and how it relates to what Tim Carney did at AEI about looking and digging into districts, for instance, that had different rates of voting for Donald Trump, is their male malaise, that's sort of pushing people in different directions. What do we know about how social capital is measured and how men are fairing? Yeah, so we know a certain amount. We know a bit more now because of the recent work that came out of Opportunity Insights, by Raj Chetty, which actually used Facebook data to kind of look at some of these links and some of the people who set a colleague of mine, Brookings, has led that I was involved in. And we see various patterns. One is it's clear that a lack of social capital of sort of ties between people within communities and across communities is associated with all kinds of other bad things, including lack of employment, etc. The causal relationships are always very difficult to tease out here. But it's clear that these social and economic problems get clustered together in ways that are important. And it's also clear there are differences by gender and by race. And so the work that Camille Led for example found that the most socially isolated people are young black men, just in terms of networks, in terms of social capital, huge difference, whereas black women actually had pretty strong social networks by comparison to black men. So again, we should be very careful about using a black white binary when we talk about social capital, because it turns out there's a much bigger gender binary within the black category. And I'm recently convinced by and here, I look on danger of name tracking too many AEI scholars that Daniel Cox has done. I mentioned one rookie scholar, I'll slip in a couple more, but Daniel Cox has done surveying this sort of so-called friendship recession. It's very interesting because it finds very big gender gaps. It finds that actually it's the fall in the number of friends is much greater among men. Young men now more like to say they'll turn to their parents for help, whereas 20 years ago, much more like turned to a friend. And so this relational aspect of both human flourishing and kind of economic potential is a big gender gap in and of itself. And then what happens is they all get combined, because how do you form these relationships? Well, through institutions, maybe through churches, but every church denomination except one has a gender gap with women much more likely to go than the other is the only one that doesn't actually is the Orthodox Church. In work, men make relationships with work, but we've seen this drop in male employment. Through families being tied into families, we've seen this huge rise in non-marital birth and in fragile families and family breakdowns. So Catherine Eden and her colleagues have written a paper which I refer to in the book and I strongly encourage everyone to read, which is called the tenuous attachments of working-class men based on in-depth qualitative work in, I think, four or five cities. And it really does talk about how these anchors of male identity have been eroded in these communities. And so men are then having to create what they label the haphazard self. That's having to improvise an identity in the absence of all of these institutional frames that having to improvise. I think it's what Tim's work is about and other people's work is about. And I have lots of agreements and disagreements across this debate to be clear, but I think that the descriptive data is pretty clear for men. And that just seems much less truthful than it. For a start, they can still get a strong identity through motherhood and they typically will remain the primary parent, even in the event of family breakdown. Women are doing much better in the labor market now than they were. In many areas, female employment is actually stronger than male employment. And it's the woman who has a better chance of being the breadwinner than the man. As I said, the more likes go to church, the much more likes to be engaged in voluntary work, the Joint Economic Committee showed that a single full-time working mom spent more time volunteering than a childless, unemployed man. Which was like one of those really depressing findings. And so these women and these moms, they're engaged. They're much more relationally connected. And so there's a gender gap in social capital, for sure. How much of this comes from our education system? Obviously, there's this argument that it's been feminized in a way. Cristina was talking about recess and discipline, all of these things that could start as young as four or five years old for men. How much of this, I guess, is conditioning through the education system? Is that something that is very important? Or maybe it's not, what's your take on how that forms or influences these trends? I think it's a huge issue. It's a bedrock issue, actually, because I think it's a cliche, but nonetheless, true that a good education sets you up very well for success in other areas of life. And the education system, as it currently stands, is structured to be more favorable to girls and women than to boys and men. And I think that's in a number of ways, some of which you've already referred to around pedagogy and just the physical movement and so on too. But I think in three really pretty big ways, one is that the education system presumes that chronological age is a good marker for developmental age. It turns out that's not true when it comes to gender, because 16-year-old girls are much more advanced than 16-year-old boys because their brains develop earlier, especially the prefrontal cortex. That's called the CEO of the brain, but parents will know it has the remember to turn in your homework a bit of your brain. Don't go out with your friends, do your chemistry homework instead, bit of the brain. And raising boys, I've raised three, raising boys could be described as essentially a kind of at least a decade long exercise in being a replacement prefrontal cortex, because they just don't have it. And the girls do. So for all the arguments about differences between male and female brains, which both sides over state, there's no argument about the pace of brain development, especially in prefrontal cortex on average. And the interesting thing people then say to me, well, okay, if you think that it's biological difference, how it interacts with the education system, especially in adolescence is the cause, why are we only seeing the gap now? Because biology hasn't changed. Which my answer is, girls were always favored by the education system, but we couldn't tell before because they weren't going to college. It actually took the women's movement to expose, ironically, the fact that the education system was structured in favor of girls and women, once we took the breaks off, they went, they went flying and nobody expected this overtaking everyone in the 70s. They was fighting for gender parity in education, title nine or do literally nobody. You can't find a single article that speculated that the lines might keep going. And the women and girls wouldn't just keep catching up with boys, but they would keep going and blow right past them and keep going. And it seems clear to me that when you have these education gaps, pretty much at every level and in every country in the world, every OECD country, there are more young women with college degrees and young men, every single one now, that's got to be structural. It's not like it's not like billions of men have suddenly had some psychological crisis. It's got to be something in the education system. So number one is just the failure to treat my biology seriously, especially this developmental gap. Number two, I do think it matters that only 24% of K12 teachers now are men and dropping 33% in the early 80s, because that does have an input on the ethos of the classroom. Male teachers do seem to help male students, especially in subjects like English, just as female students, teachers rather seem to help females in STEM subjects. So I think that that kind of feminization is a problem and one that's barely remarked upon, let alone tackled. And the third is a move away from more vocational training and hands on kinds of learning, which everything else equal typically seems to be more favorable to boys and men than to women and girls. Everything we're going to say in this conversation is on average with overlapping distributions. Can we just take that as a given? I don't have to say it to you every time. You know that. And actually, there's very little investment in that kind of learning, which I think is a problem generally, but it's specifically a problem for boys and men. So those are the three ways I would point to as well as some of the other ones that you and Christina have worked on in the sort of way the school day is constructed, the mean the education system as a matter of structure disfavors, boys and men. Is there anything in our popular culture that you could put your finger on? Because some of this obviously reflects, you know, changes in the way we think about sex and ways we think about marriage, the way we think about work, the way we think about motherhood and fatherhood. So are there any like pop cultural or even broadly, more broadly cultural, let's say, I don't know what to say, trends that might be influencing or exacerbating this problem to? Yeah, so there's two different levels we could talk about it. You've invited me to talk about more of the kind of pop culture level first. So let's do that. And then of course, there are some deeper cultural issues. But the level of pop culture, I would say just the the casual way in which men are very often portrayed and described as either toxic or useless or trash hashtag men or trash, etc. And the indiscriminate use of the label toxic masculinity, the sort of the depiction of a lot of fathers in popular culture, which you can tell, he's always the blunderer, it's always the mom who's got her act together and so on. So there's a kind of bunch that there's just some stereotyping, but also just some real damage being done here, I think, around some stereotypes in pop culture that are quite anti male in their expression. And you can understand sometimes where they come from, and you can understand the history of where they come from, partly because the stuff that Christina has been right back for a long time and that I have to, and you've been working on, this stuff's happened really fast. I just can't emphasize that enough. And I especially want to talk to young people, like my kids, they're in their 20s, my boys are in their 20s, they're trying to imagine a world where women and girls weren't, weren't handing it to them in the classroom. They're trying to imagine a world where there was rough, they don't mean, I was trying to explain to them that when I was at school and went to college, you know, it's about 50 50. Right. And when my parents went, it was massively the other way, right? And so it's just, it has the blink of an eye in a generation, maybe a generation and a half, we have completely flipped the script around some gender inequalities, especially in education. I just think it's really hard. It's sometimes it's really hard to acknowledge success when it happens this quickly and reorient. And we have so many institutions and organizations whose job it is to keep banging the drum for women and girls, and we could list them, it would be a very long list of coalition of this, etc. And I support those organizations and the work they do, but there are none on the other side. And so what that means is that we're in, there is a whole institutional structure, which is committed to a view of gender equality, which was formed in the 1970s. And now the Senate 1970s probably seems like a long time ago to you. At when were you born? 93. Yes. Okay. So, so, so you're like, so you're trying to do the math at this point, right? But I was born kind of the 60s. And so, and in terms of culture, it's literally is the beginnings of a blink of an eye. And so it's no wonder that we're struggling to catch up and a lot of our priors about men and women are struggling to catch up with this. I think the pernicious pathologization of certain aspects of masculinity is causing all kinds of problems socially, culturally, and politically. And I've seen that firsthand with my own sons, but also more generally in the kind of political culture, I think that, you know, sort of, in some ways, the one acceptable form of victim blaming left is to blame men for whatever their play is. You know, if they're suicidal, it's because they went to toxic to seek psych therapy. If they're dying from COVID is because they weren't wearing a mask or they're, you know, did drink too much. If they're struggling at school, it's because they're lazy and just drinking marijuana and watching porn, if whatever it is, there's an answer, which puts responsibility straight back onto the shoulders of the boys and men. And I don't want to, in any way, deny individual agency, but it's very striking that both left and right agree that this is the level, a problem to be situated to the level of the individual, rather than a level of structure. And I think the right correctly pointed to the changes in family structure is a massive problem for men in the left, ought to be paying attention to issues around education, and especially how it affects boys of color. And so when you're a point where one in four black boys are held back a grade by the end of high school, and one in four of all boys are diagnosed with a quotes developmental disability, it's fair to start questioning whether it's the system failing the boys, rather than the boys failing in the system. Can you actually flesh that out? Because the last point about the developmental disability diagnosis, because I feel like that's kind of a third rail, people really do not want to talk about the spike in diagnoses of developmental disabilities, whether it's ADHD, whatever it is. Autism. Right. Right. Exactly. And the medication, the spike in medication for ADHD. How do you think that is involved in some of these trends as well? Yeah, it's hard to unpack because I think there's a lot of different things going on there. I think one of the problems is, so some of it I think was just always there, and is now being diagnosed in a way that it wasn't. I'll hear about some of it was always there, and it's being diagnosed as a problem within the current system. And so it's a developmental disability. So this is, it's a bit of you know, how, you know, disability activists will sometimes call, they'll say, no, I'm not disabled, there's an ableist society, it's not me that's disabled, it's, well, I think that might be true for a lot of these so-called developmental disabilities, because they are things like attention deficit, autism is really, really high among boys too now. So there's a welcome recognition of some of these things, but I look back on it, it's quite clear that if I was, when I think of what I was like at six and seven and eight, I clearly have attention deficit disorder, I definitely would have been diagnosed with it. And if I'd been in the current education system, I don't know, my parents were quite likely of me encouraged to start giving me medication, because they would have realized that my inability to focus and pay attention to them is going to mean I got bad grades, if I got bad grades, I wasn't going to get to a great college, a good college, and so on. So I think it really, what it means is that these differences are sometimes mislabeled as disabilities, because they're disabling in the current context. But then there's a really interesting question as to whether we shouldn't be trying to change the context. You know, if boys say struggle to pay attention for very long and focus, well, maybe classes should be shorter. If they do better when they're working with their hands, maybe it should be more vocational training, or whatever, maybe we shouldn't, maybe we shouldn't be just assuming something wrong with them. So I think some of that 20, 24% developmental disability is a mislabeling, and we wouldn't have mislabeled it that way before. Are we partially seeing a generation of young boys who was, we sort of treated normal masculine tendencies as pathologies that is now in college and the workforce in ways that, and struggling in ways that could be related to how they were treated from the age of five until 18? Well, we know a lot about their old fathers, so come back to family, right? So boys, in particular, who have good strong relationships with their fathers, you know, tend to have much better social skill there. They mature, right? So I've already said how much I dislike the term toxic masculinity, but I do think it's useful to think about, partly because no one can ever define what non-toxic masculinity looks like in a way that's distinguishable from femininity and all kinds of organizations. It's a kind of trouble trying to do that. But also, but I do think it's the appropriate thing about maturity, right? And we all know that, you know, you're immature when you're whatever it is, you know, 13 if you're a girl and 15 if you're a boy adjusting for their prefrontal cortex. But we're different at 23 and 25. We're different at 30. We learn, we grow up, right? And so I do think that growing up with a father figure, whether in or out, you know, whatever the family structure is, is important for boys, that's true. I also do worry that going forward, we are in danger of having a cohort of young men who have been raised through a culture environment. There's had, I think, where some of these quite hostile rhetoric around boys. And I don't yet know how that will play out because it gets too early to tell. But I'm somewhat worried about it. And what I see, and we talked about some of the numbers already, is not that the boys as a result are acting out in a way that some conservatives are worried that they would, is that they're checking out, not to say some men don't act out. But it's the ones who are checking out is the ones who are retreating. There's a passivity, a sort of a drift, you know, a lot of them are a drift rather than dangerous. But there's a lot more of them who are. And I think that might be part of the consequence of some of these cultural, basically our cultural failure to think properly about masculinity in a world where the women's movement has succeeded so splendidly. And that, again, raises this other question of, like, there was this premise. And it was, I think, in some ways, correct, especially during the second wave of the feminist movement, that there needed to be correctives to something that was what they would have called, maybe they wouldn't have called it this at the time, but toxic masculinity. There are some necessary correctives that need to happen. Title IX, for example, is a good sort of case study in what they were trying to do, what their ambitions policy wise in terms of creating parity. But that was predicated on this idea that there were essential sort of sex differences. And now we're actually even seeing in the educational space things like social emotional learning that are saying some of those differences actually are not essential. They are marginal. And the difference between the sexes overall are not as important. And I'm wondering if that has, if you're worried about that as a trend, if you think that's going to make any of this worse, in general, is that playing into any of this at all? Yeah, I am worried about it. And I think that it's a good example of how the culture war that rages just at the kind of high level, right, in the magazines and the podcast and sort of things will be the we've both kind of engage in. And at most people thankfully don't, does nonetheless have this potential trickle down effect on the broader culture. And my fear actually is that with one side potentially like denying any sex differences at all, even on average, even with just, you know, even for things like risk taking or aggression or sex drive, whether it's just the evidence is just like beyond refutation. You get accused to suggest there are differences. And I've been accused of this already, of course, of being gender essentialism. Right. So any recognition that there could be any differences on average with overlapping distribution is gender essentialism. We're all blank slates. And that's just not true nonsense. But the distributions really do overlap. And most of the differences between us aren't that consequential. There's certainly not consequential poetry and individual. And so what I think that the consequences of my play on some aspects of family policy or occupational choice, but they're not that big a deal. And I think we're making some progress to making them kind of less of a big deal, right? Meanwhile, the reaction from conservatives is to sort of freak out and make hay with it, which some of the attacks are very effective, don't get me wrong, because the left give them enough to kind of play with. And actually almost reassert this incredibly concrete binary, right, in defense of the difference between men and women. And so we get this going to get, whereas the truth of course is there is a distribution between men and women. There are some people who are in the middle and some people who transition, actually, the very word transition. Right. Exactly. What does it mean if there isn't some edge transition from transgender? Right. Yeah. He's predicated on that. Yeah, he's predicated on that. And there are some people. And then look, there's a there's so Melvin Connor puts this very well, his book, Women After All, where he says there's the middle of the just of the spectrum is very is like something I'll get around, but like he's very exotic, beautiful, and rare. Most people are at the end. And I think that a good premise for a liberal society is that you can have rules, by which I mean, this is the norms, and you can have exceptions. And they're both fine. And right now we're in a situation where something on the left will deny the fact that there are even rules, that there are even there's even any difference between men and women, right, that there's just that everybody's in the middle of the spectrum, right, or even equally distributed along the spectrum, rather than cluster to the ends, which is what we actually are. And then the right comes along, and says, no, no, no, it's completely binary. This is all nonsense, which ends up, even if it's a very small group, and does end up creating a hostile and more people who are transitioning, who are intersex. And so, you know, a good liberal principle is that we should be supporting the rights and the freedoms of every individual. And we don't have to throw out this sense of the so in other words, both sides freak out moral panic, both sides, both sides push each other further and further away, right, the more the left denies any biological difference, the more the right doubles down on it. Right. And meanwhile, most of us just muddling along through saying, of course, there are some differences, but I want both my sons and daughters to have equal opportunities. I'm not going, I don't want my son to be discriminated against in a childcare role, which is why he does, because he's a man on the grounds on average women a bit more nurturing. And nor do I want, I don't have daughters, but nor do I want my god daughters to be discriminated against if they want to be a firefighter or an engineer. If that if they happen to be at that point of the distribution, that's the good liberal feminist principle. Right. And then the patterns, it probably won't come out 50 50 because some of these differences. But this stuff then trickles down a bit. And I think what it does is it makes ironically, it makes these ideas of masculinity and femininity much more salient than they ought to be in a more healthy society, because one size denying it and the other size doubling down on it. There's this great line in Robert Bly from from his book, which the neighbor, which now escapes, which is unforgivable, but it will come to me in a moment, where he says, I think it was in the 70s, I think we've reached a point where we can use terms masculine and feminine without being afraid that some moral carpenter is going to come along and make boxes out of them within which to trap us. And I think it's a beautiful line, because of course, that is the fear that if you've acknowledged that there's a masculine and a feminine people, and we are that's why, for example, I can be president, but you can't, because you know, you might it might be the wrong time of the month when a missile crisis happens, or whatever those kind of canards were those stereotypes about women. So there's this history of worrying quite rightly about how biological differences might be used against women, because that is how they were always used. Therefore, we have to learn them all together, which makes you sound crazy. Surely we can get to a point where it's like, yeah, there's masculine feminine, yeah, the overlap. And by the way, I don't think we should be defined by them. And anybody who thinks that playing with gender is a new thing. And I'm sorry to be ages here. Wasn't around in the 80s when David Bowen, Duran, Duran were all the rage. They just they obviously just missed, like a lot and queen. I mean, anybody does paying any attention to popular culture during the 80s, and doesn't think we were playing with gender during those years, they weren't paying attention. Well, and of course, the sort of Camille Paulia response would be they had binaries to react against. And that's sort of what made there are transgressive and interesting. And without that, you can't it won't be nearly as interesting if you don't have something to react to. And that's still true. That's still true, I think. Actually, this is such a good segue in one thing I wanted to ask you about. There was a thread that went viral on Twitter, I think yesterday, where someone was going back through the history of newspapers writing on freakouts about men. I saw it. Yeah, it was great. It's funny, because it goes back to I think I think the last one was from 1883. So it's going back like almost each decade showing an example of newspapers freaking out about men being feminized. But what's interesting about that to me is it's really post industrial or in the middle of industrialization. And I wanted to ask about that, these sort of economic transitions induced by industrialization and industrial technology that have transitioned humans from a really like agricultural society to being organized in all kinds of different ways where we're now sort of harvesting data. And for instance, men are really into crypto. That's sort of a niche male community, not to diminish any women that are interested in crypto as well, but it's a very heavily male space. So in some ways, is this downstream of technological changes that people like Carl Marx were writing about about I mean, it's in the communist manifesto. He was concerned that sex differences were melting to be sort of the capitalist cog. Is there is there an argument that some of this is downstream of economic transitions? Yeah, that's a really rich subject. So my my reaction to that is first of all, I love that thread. And then some people added to it. So people are now quoting from Sisaro and stuff. Yeah, it's really fun. And I do think that it's probably downstream of some of those industrialization questions and probably also upstream of it. I mean, one of the things we know from Smith and others and Marx actually is that the one of the things industrialization did was impose a very strong division of labor. And it was very, very gendered right guy would go and work out in the house that woman would stay in. And before that, it was much more like a family firm type model, right? The lines were much more blurred. And so in some ways, I think these very sharp gender roles were a product of the way in which the division of labor in industrialization was gendered. And so to the extent that we've been moving away from that since whenever, gradually, I think it's from industrialization, not agriculture. Agriculture was a much more shared endeavor, much more family endeavor than industrialization was much more gendered division. And we kind of been moving away from that, you know, for whatever it is, 100 years. So I think that's the first thing I was saying, that's probably true. The second thing is there's a crisis of masculinity about every decade, sort of regardless of technology. There's one after the Vietnam War, there's one before the Vietnam War, there's one in the 50s with kind of the organization man is one of the 30s unemployment. There's a great Esquire article by Schlesinger called the crisis of masculinity from 1958. And it's all about the rise of women in a way, which I think I quote him in the book. And so it's like, yeah, then, another decade, another crisis of masculinity. And so, you know, it's good copy. I think as a couple of things I would say, one is that, first of all, it does expose, I think, a truth about human culture, which is that masculinity is more socially constructed. It is somewhat culturally constructed than femininity is. Right. So this is a slightly controversial point. But I think me and others were right about this is that masculine roles and masculinity is a bit more contingent. It has to be constructed. You need more like, you have to create rights of passage, you have to create roles. Whereas with femininity, it's a little bit easier because you've got fertility as more of a clear marker of like, and then you become a mother to become fertile, then you become a mother, and then obviously that the other end, there's menopause. So there's a kind of biological underpinning to femininity that's kind of not there for masculinity. So the problem of every human known human society is being what to do with the men, i.e. how to construct masculinity in a way that's prosocial and generate surplus for everybody, and so on to. So in that sense, I think it's kind of right that it's in constant crisis. It has to be constantly created and is therefore much more fragile. So masculinity is more fragile of femininity for the reasons that I think I've just identified around culture, which is why you don't read about, when was the last time you read about crisis of femininity? I mean, you didn't even have that really through the women's movement. There's a little bit of that, you know, but then the women's movement just moved in a more pretensible direction. There was very few people that were talking about the crisis of femininity, even as women entered male professions and started succeeding and so on. There's a little bit of it. You get a bit of the girl boss. Stuff has a bit of that feel to it, but not much. And so it is more kind of, it is more socially constructed, which is why we should pay real attention to it. And the last thing I'll say on this is previous crises of masculinity have not been accompanied by very much empirical evidence for male struggles, maybe with some acceptance of recession to start to be as shressing as writing in 58. Really try telling women in 58 that there was a crisis of masculinity, whereas now, for all reasons, we started at the top of the show with there, actually an empirical crisis facing men, which is, I think makes it much more of a real crisis than some of the earth's that's ones that we've previously had to live through. And just before we run here, I wanted to ask, I've seen you do interviews about this book with Salon or Slater Salon. It's Salon. So my question basically is, they think the right is kind of finally ready to start talking about this. Obviously, people have been talking about it sort of in right adjacent spaces without getting much policy, push through follow through or anything like that. Is the left ready to have this conversation, especially as this conversation about sex and gender so charged right now in some very unhelpful ways? Have you found that the left is actually ready to sort of be honest about this? Well, you know, in some I'm a bit of a controlled experiment in that question. Let's say ask me again in two months, but I will say thus far, you know, I've had it really need a lantic I've got and working on very single the times. Gabby Hinsliff had a very good review in the Guardian, written from a very left perspective. You've mentioned Salon, which is good. So I think that there is more appetite than you might think from just looking at the headlines of of the culture war, if it's framed correctly. I think the problem is that because this has been framed as so zero sum, and if you basically don't create a permission space for people, particularly if they have a very strong commitment to women's rights and to, you know, the remaining obstacle facing women, it's very important that we construct this in a way that doesn't require people to somehow give up on all those commitments in order to engage in this conversation. And lots of people on the left feel that they and there's this gap between what people said to me in private and what they're saying in public. And it's that kind of private public gap that I'm probably trying to bridge in the book by saying, look, there's a lot of people out there, regardless of the politics, they're really worried about men and their sons and with boys, you know, they they note that like it's not breaking news to most people that this is a real problem. What they want is a way to talk about it and think about it that doesn't get them sucked into one side of the culture war or another. I described myself as a conscientious objector to the culture wars. And I think that's true. I really, I mean, I think, no, I quote George Gilder and Charles Murray and Dench and a lot of people and of course, Christina, who just think we're like absolutely right about a lot of their predictions and concerns, in many cases, wrong in my view about what they wanted to do about it or what they thought the solutions were. And again, I think on the left, it's quite right to still worry about a lot of the issues facing girls and women. It's far from the feminist revolution is far from complete. But we've made enough progress now that we can just pause and look both ways and say, Hey, hold on, there's some boys and men struggling over here. One of the things that I have found actually helps a little bit, weirdly, is the mass agenda gap we're seeing emerging in in voting behavior. And the fact that Donald Trump won with the biggest gender gap in recorded polling history and picked up votes from black and Hispanic men and some Hispanic women in 2020. And the many of the populist movements we're seeing are actually very often really benefiting from a sense of male malaise or male grievance is probably what people on the left would call it is is acting as the same sort of wake up call to people on the left. I think many other aspects of this moment are too. I think I also think it took Trump to make people on the left take their problems of white working class rural communities seriously. It was lipser. It was honestly lipser. It was till then. So I think there's a moment of out of a combination of self interest, genuine concern in the right framing, which means that we can at least have this conversation. I hope that the right will be part of that conversation too, in a way that gets away from the zero some thinking that is the poison at the heart of so many of these conversations. This conversation you and I had, right? We're talking about this as Susan Frodo with the Greek we agree, disagree, etc. I think I'm probably, I know I'm wrong about a whole bunch of things. My biographical subject is John Stuart Mill. And one of the lines I love from Mill is he says, everybody is walking around with opinions or beliefs that are false. They just don't know which ones they are yet. And the point of intellectual engagement is to try and find out which ones they are and learn from others. And you can learn from people across the political spectrum. And if you don't do that, then you're not doing good work. And it feels to me like I have an opportunity given where I start from, to at least try and create create a space within which we can have this conversation across the political divide. It is so thoroughly depressing how divorced the sentiments of Mill in that exact quote are from our cable news discourse. That's right. I'm going to invite on all the people who will loudly agree with everything I everything I said. Yeah, I tell you one, I will know if succeeded if I get on to Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson. That's right. In the same week. That's my goal. Increasingly, it seems as though the horseshoe theory is manifest every day. And it's also true that there is a sort of element of left, maybe the more the sadness left, the socialist left, yes, that is really worried about working class man. And they had to, you know, they have to be a bit careful. And so you're right, the horseshoe thing there too, if you could give you this class dimension to it, that then does also bring in some people. And anybody that doesn't think black men and boys are struggling is again, just looking at completely different data sets to the ones I'm looking at. We can argue about why and what the solutions are, but I've done work again, I'm going to do last day, I sculled Winship and I have done work on three generations of black, white poverty. And it's just the race gaps are just enormous. And Scott himself is on the record of saying the main problem with social mobility is black social ability and in particular, black male social mobility. And we need to be looking at that. And so, regardless of whether he and I will agree on solutions, which mostly don't, we have done work together where we agree that there is a problem here that both sides are failing to pay attention to for different reasons. So I'm pretty hopeful. Let's see, this conversation is a great example of the kind of dialogue that I want to have, honestly. No, absolutely. The book is called Of Boys and Men, Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters and What to Do About It. It's out on September 27th. Richard Reeves, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. Absolutely. I'm Emily Jisinske, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. We will be back soon with more. Until then, be lovers of freedom and anxious with the fray."
