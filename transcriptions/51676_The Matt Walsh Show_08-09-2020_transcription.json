    "text": " Today on the mat, we'll show Camela Harris was the latest Democrat to visit and pay homage to Jacob Blake, incredibly accused rapist and serial abuser. With the canonization of men like Blake and George Floyd, among others, the Me Too movement is now officially dead. And we'll talk about that also five headlines, including BLM fighting for racial justice by harassing elderly diners at restaurants. And in our daily cancellation, I will cancel gender reveal parties before they get us all killed. All of that and more on the way. But we start here. Camela Harris, as I said, latest high profile Democrat to meet with and pay homage to Jacob Blake and his family. After speaking with them for an hour, Harris gushed to reporters that Blake Sr. known for ranting about Jews and crackers on social media and Blake Jr. accused of drunkenly abusing a woman over the course of several years before finally breaking into her house and raping her are incredible. Watch. Well, they want them to have support. Now Blake family attorney Benjamin Crump, a man for whom the term ambulance chaser was invented, issued a press release after the visit, providing more details about this kumbaya session. According to Crump, he said the press release, quote, Senator Harris had an inspirational and uplifting one hour visit with Jacob Blake Jr. And his family today. She spoke individually with each family member about how they were handling the trauma and urged them to take care of their physical and mental health. In a moving moment, Jacob Jr. told Senator Harris that he was proud of her. And the Senator told Jacob that she was also proud of him and how he is working through his pain. Now would be a good time to remind ourselves why Blake Jr. finds himself in a position where he must work through his pain. And that reason is that a few months ago, a sobbing and trembling woman called 911 to report that Jacob Blake had allegedly broken into her home early in the morning, digitally raped her, humiliated her, then stolen her debit card and vehicle. On the day of the shooting, Blake had returned to his alleged victim's house with a knife, taken her keys and then assaulted the police officers when they arrived in response to the woman's emergency call. This is the man that apparently swells Kamala Harris with pride when she looks upon him. And she's not alone. Not by long shot. Joe Biden had his own state visit with the royal family of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and spoke emotionally about the resilience and hope and optimism of the accused rapist and serial abuser. Let's watch a little bit of that. I just spent an hour or more with with a family as I got off the airplane. Had an opportunity to spend some time with Jacob on the phone. He's out of ICU. We spoke for about 15 minutes. His brother and two sisters, his dad and his mom on the telephone. And I spoke on them a lot before, but we spent time together with my wife. And he talked about how nothing was going to defeat him. How, whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up. We talked about a psalm in my church father based on a 23rd psalm. And he raised you up in Eagle's wings and buried you on the breath of dawn until we and keep you in God told you in the palm of his hand that we meet again. Well, I think Alderman was been unleashed with a lot of people is to understand that fear doesn't solve problems. Only hope does. And you keep, you give up hope. You might as well surrender. Now, I know it can be kind of hard to understand what he's saying there. He's talking as if he just jogged 98 miles through the desert, completely out of breath while he's really just sitting there. But this is a healthy man, folks. Very, very physically healthy man, not physically falling apart before our eyes at all. Okay. But anyway, the media, of course, has also played a crucial role in Blake's canonization. On Monday, the New York Times published a lengthy article about the suspects, the suspected rapists medical challenges declaring that Blake can now be the, quote, rare survivor to, quote, tell his own story. And it takes the article's author, Nicholas Bogel-Buros, about 30 sentences to finally mention that the rape charge exists. And then only mentioned as vaguely as possible, of course. He writes only that Mr. Blake, quote, pleaded not guilty on Friday to three domestic charges against him, including a sexual assault account. That's it. No mention of the specific details of the charge, which are harrowing and horrifying. No mention of the knife and Blake's possession on the day of the shooting. No mention that he assaulted the police officers who came to the aid of his alleged victim. The alleged victim herself gets only half a sentence of acknowledgement. She is described as, quote, the woman who reported the assault called 911. That's it. That's the end of it. We are told nothing of her condition, how she feels, how she's holding up, how she's coping with seeing millionaire athletes and celebrities rally around and celebrate the man who she says raped, abused, and terrorized her. The New York Times just does not consider her physical or emotional state relevant. And on that point, Biden, Harris, and the rest of the Democrats agree. Now, this is quite interesting coming from the same people who in very recent history have spoken so passionately about the need to amplify the voices of sexual violence survivors. Speaking of which, the leaders of MeToo just last week launched something called the survivors agenda, which is supposed to amplify the voices of sexual violence survivors. In a video announcing the initiative just last week, the MeToo Warriors said that, though they've made, quote, incredible strides and had some, quote, amazing wins, there is still much that must be done to ensure that society takes survivors seriously and that all survivors are heard. In fact, let's watch that video right now. It's been almost three years since millions of us raised our hands and voices to say MeToo. Since then, we've seen incredible strides and experienced some amazing wins. We've also learned that we have so much farther to go to bring about the change we need to see. We launched the survivors agenda to center what survivors of this country care about so we can build the kind of world we all deserve. As a survivor and an attorney who has dedicated my career to seeking justice, the thing that I most want to see is institutions take survivors seriously and develop the systems that allow for justice and for healing. As a survivor, the things that I care about most are ensuring that all survivors are heard and supported, no matter their zip code, immigration status, ethnicity, or any other reason. There's power in our numbers and an end to sexual violence needs all of us. We are resourceful, resilient, and ready. Yes, all survivors are heard. Well, not all. We've always known that exceptions are made to this amplify their voices thing whenever a high profile Democrat politician is accused. But over the past few months, we've learned that the exemplalist also includes women who are allegedly brutalized by men who later die or are injured in police custody provided, of course, that the circumstances, including the races of those involved, are politically useful to groups like BLM. George Floyd was convicted of forcing his way into a woman's home, shoving a gun into her stomach and robbing her in front of her child. Jacob Blake is credibly accused of the brutal crimes already described. These victims' voices are far from amplified. On the contrary, the very existence of these women is covered up, buried, ignored. The champions of me too certainly won't say their names or even acknowledge them in passing. They are shoved to the side and trampled over in the rush to lionize their abusers. There are real consequences to this. First of all, the continued emotional trauma suffered by women who must now live in a country that hails their abusers as heroes is real. Also, will the next woman confronted by a man she knows from experience to be violent and volatile hesitate to call 911 fearing that he'll get himself shot and she'll be blamed for it while society wails in grief over the tragic fate of her abuser? What if Blake's alleged victim had made that calculation? What if she had not called the police? What would the angry man with a knife who had already stolen her keys have done? Would he have done something terrible to her? Would he have hurt the children? Now, we can't know the answer to that question, but we do know that if things had played out that way, BLM would have nothing to say. Me too would remain quiet. The left and Democrats like Biden and Harris would just yawn and continue along their way. The woman in the Jacob Blake case, the woman who is still just the woman, nameless, is not the kind of victim that any of these groups care about. And that's because they don't care about women at all. Let's get to our five headlines. If we've learned any lesson over the past few months, it's that emergencies happen. And if you're not prepared for the emergency before it happens, well, then it's your in catchup mode. And you don't want to be in the mode of trying to catch up and get prepared after the fact. So that's why you got to get ready wise. Now, there's no better time than right now to be prepared with long-term nutritional food options. Ready wise has many options like emergency meals, freeze dried fruits and vegetables for convenient on the go to attrition. They also have adventure meals for hiking, which I've used many times if you're out hiking or hunting or out in the woods. Those are great as well. And they taste great too. Ready wise meals are easy to prepare. All you've got to do is just add water. They have a very long shelf life. And ready wise makes being prepared simple and affordable.

Okay, number one, Black Lives Matter agitators have returned to the familiar well harassing random white people while they eat dinner. This is the, one of the primary tactics now of BLM. And because BLM are very tough and brave, they focus once again on elderly people. Watch. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check.

I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got to check. I got going. That'd be funny. You know, big, big tough guys. You're so strong and brave are these warriors for freedom. Oh, and by the way, here's BLM same day, same city, harassing and assaulting a black McDonald's manager. Hey, very good. There's nobody up at the hotel chair and they're cheating right now. No, you need to let the **** out of there, okay? And you need to be open that door. But, oh, we need to open that door. Okay. Welcome to the night. The people that have air **** out of there. This room for me. This room for me. This room for me. This room for me. Come on. Let's get started. USA. Can I be up? No! You're up! I'm getting started. It's amazing how you're doing today. Not really. donated. guards out here adults installed nine people withdown Okay. Wow. Okay. Well, okay. So apparently every time I've seen, you know, someone shout at a McDonald's manager because they got a six piece nugget instead of an eight piece nugget. That was really, they were really advancing racial justice. And I didn't realize that. So when you shouted a McDonald's manager, you're advancing racial justice. You know, we hear the word hateful, tossed around quite a bit. The left especially likes to call everything hateful, really. And most of the time hateful really means something more like has opinions that differ from my own or is more passionate about this issue than I am. That's most of the time when someone calls something hateful, that's really what they mean. But what we see here with BLM, this is actually finally a real hateful movement. People in the most literal sense, they are filled with hate. They have only hate to offer. They aren't trying to achieve anything positive. It's not like this is just a misguided way of achieving some positive goal. No, there is no positive goal. There's nothing harassing and intimidating old people while they eat dinner. You know, that's, that's not something you do because you have a goal in mind. It's something you do because you hate. You hate them for the race. You hate them for their age. You hate them for their assumed socioeconomic status. BLM is only hate. It is defined by hate. It hates white people. It hates police. It hates conservatives. I mean, it hates pretty much everything and everyone that doesn't bend to its whims. It hates black people too. I mean, if you've noticed in that, in that last video we played as a black McDonald's manager, racial minority, middle class, you know, as far as we know, not a conservative or Trump supporter, but they hated him too. Why? Well, because he didn't dance to their tune. That's it. You have to do exactly what BLM wants. And if you don't, then they hate you and you're an enemy and you're a fascist and you're a Hitler and they can do whatever they want to. And they're morally justified in doing so. That's the attitude. Okay. Number two, but wait, BLM maybe is not so bad after all. Report from the Hill reading now. It says, despite several incidents of protests against racism and police brutality turning violent, more than 90% of the summer's protests were peaceful, according to an analysis released Thursday. The report produced by the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project identified 7,750 protests between May 26th and August 22nd and 2,400 locations. The report found that about 220 became violence, a term defined as demonstrators fighting with police or with counter protesters. The term also applies to demonstrators or demonstrations that resulted in property damage. In 93% of cases analyzed, there was no violence. Okay. So a few problems here. First of all, there's no reason to trust these numbers at all period. So we could just end it there, I guess. Second, based on this definition, what we just saw there, BLMers walking around, harassing and intimidating the elderly, that doesn't count as violent by this definition. Now it is, it is violent, but it doesn't count by this tally. To be violent by this definition, you have to assault a police officer or burn something. Or maybe kill a random pedestrian as has happened. Maybe that will count, I'm not sure. The third thing though is even putting all that aside, let's pretend that the actual figure is 7%. 7% is a lot. Okay, that's a lot. 220 violent riots that even the media will call violent in one summer. 220 and you're, we're supposed to be impressed with that. Oh, it was only 220. Only 220 violent riots in a summer. That's it. No, that's, that's a lot. I am not impressed with BLM's restraint, even if I pretended that it was only 7%. I mean, the crazy thing is March for Life, pro-lifers get together, hundreds of thousands been doing this every year for, for over four decades. It's never been violent. There has, there has been 0% violence over four decades with hundreds of thousands of people gathered together. Now that's impressive. Okay, that is an impressive streak. But when you can't even put together, you know, like four days in a row of nonviolent protests, no, that's, you know what that tells me? That tells me this is a violent movement. That's what it tells me by definition. 7% of your pro, your quote, quote, quote, protest turned violent. That's a violent movement. To be nonviolent, that number needs to be 0%, 0.001% maybe. Okay, let's see. Number three. Now, I don't know where this is from or the context, but this apparently is a, well, it's a vegan funeral for slabs of meat at the supermarket. I don't know when it happened, but it's making the rounds online. Pretty heart wrenching stuff. Let's, let's take a look. Yeah, that's, that's emotional. And I join these vegans in many ways. I am with them. And I too hope that one day the site of a murdered cow will be rare. Does that taste a lot better than medium well? And actually this is a common vegan tactic. It turns out I looked it up and they do this a lot, I guess. I've never had the pleasure of witnessing it in person when I'm at the supermarket. I wish I would, but I've never seen it. But here's some more footage. I found this from an animal rights YouTube channel. And in this case, they are mourning and commemorating some frozen chickens. Watch. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. My store. Theunts' turn everything. Listen up. May they arrest and peace is. Pieces with gravy as for the the vegans themselves. Exhibit A right there. Number four, the United Nations sent out a tweet yesterday. It said, the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know. Millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone, women, men, girls, and boys. It's demonstrating what now? How does the what does the patriarchy have to do with? I mean, okay, I guess this is kind of how I remember thinking back in 2008 how the global financial crisis really demonstrated the need for more trans representation in the Australian avant-garde theater scene, which is to say the two things aren't connected at all. But I suppose, I mean, really any event can demonstrate any point you want if you're not worried about things like making sense. Number five, finally, for our most important story of the day, and look, I say this in all seriousness, I've of course never been a supporter of Joe Biden. I never saw myself voting for him. I still probably won't, but I don't know. He just made a case for himself that even I can't ignore. He made one point that sort of made me pause and say, hmm, maybe there is a case for voting for him. I don't know. He was being interviewed by reporters yesterday, and this is something that he mentioned, kind of a sales pitch for himself that I thought was pretty persuasive. Listen, step or two, what's your response to that? Look at how he steps and look how I step. Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps. Okay, come on. Yeah, it's a good point. I mean, if you like me have always planned to vote for whoever can most skillfully and swiftly navigate a ramp, then Biden might be our guy. I'm a one-issue voter, okay? And my issue is ramps. I want to know how fast can you walk down them, how confidently, how gracefully. Think of all the press of all the ramps that a president walks down in it. I think the latest study was a president has to walk down a ramp 14 times a week. Okay, so that's a lot of ramps. And I mean, do you want a guy who's tripping and stumbling down the ramp, or do you want someone who could do a cartwheel down the ramp if he wanted to? I just wish that I was alive back in the 19th century to see Grover Cleveland, because that man was a master of ramps. He used to go down ramps on his hands doing handstands, one of the all-time greats when it comes to ramps. Anyway, interesting stuff there. The ramp debate rages on, but a little bit of food for thought, something to think about with the ramps. I'm glad that Biden brought that up.

So today for our daily cancellation, we're going to be canceling gender reveal parties because it's happened once again. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, some pyrotechnics used during a gender reveal party caused a forest fire and the people responsible will face severe penalties. Here's the press release. It says Cal Fire law enforcement has determined the El Dorado fire burning near Oak Glen and San Bernardino County was caused by a smoke generating pyrotechnic device used during a gender reveal party. The fire began at 10 23 a.m. on Saturday, on September 5th, 2020. In the El Dorado Ranch Park, Cal Fire reminds the public that with the dry conditions and critical fire weather, it doesn't take much to start a wildfire. Those responsible for starting fires due to negligence or illegal activity can be financially responsible and criminally responsible. So so far, 7,000 acres of land have been incinerated because a couple of narcissists wanted to announce their baby's gender with fireworks instead of announcing it by just, you know, announcing it saying something like, Hey, we're having a girl. But no, they needed pink flames to rain down from the sky lighting up the heavens and declaring their news unto the whole earth. And this is not a new thing, by the way, gender reveal parties seem to start forest fires every year. In total, about 98 million square miles have been burned because of gender reveal parties and two and a half billion people have died. Those are rough estimates. Don't Google it. Just just go with it for now. The main point is simply that fires are no fires. Gender reveal parties are stupid, extremely stupid for many reasons. But here's the main one. And I don't mean to disenchant or demoralize you with this information, but but here it is. Nobody cares about the gender of your baby. Nobody is on pins and needles needing to know. You might be, but nobody else is. I've got like over 20 nieces and nephews and counting and that's one figure that is not an exaggeration. I didn't have a preference for the gender for any one of them. I didn't care that much. I'm interested to know, but it would be it would be really weird if my sister said to me, hey, we're having another baby. And I went, oh boy or girl. And she said, well, if you want to know, come to the park next Friday at 2 30, bring a long chair. Show starts at three. What? Why don't you just tell me? Like, I'm not that interested. I'll wait for the baptism if that's how it's going to be. But see, the gender reveal party wouldn't bother me as much if it weren't part of a larger trend. And the trend is people in the modern world deciding they need about 52 public celebrations and gift giving occasions for every milestone. Milestones that used to be normal and celebrated once, if at all. And with an intimate circle, a family and very close friends. But now we've decided that these things which humans have been doing for millennia are when we do them anyway, historically momentous occasions and legions of angels must come from on high to sound the trumpet and sing choruses of hallelujah's. Consider how many public celebrations a modern couple might have before they've even made it around the first turn on the monopoly board of life. First, they have their engagement party, then a bridal shower, then the bachelor party, then the bachelorette party, then the rehearsal dinner, the wedding, the wedding reception, the post wedding brunch. If you're counting at home, that's eight parties just because these ego maniacs are getting married. Meanwhile, nobody cares that much. I mean, we care, but not eight parties worth of caring. And they aren't done yet, not by a long shot. When they decide to have a child, there's the gender reveal party. There's the baby shower followed now by the man shower, which is a baby shower for men, or more precisely for individuals who might be mistaken for men. Then the mother gets a push present simply for pushing the baby out. And after that, there is, I'm told something called a sip and see, which is a party where people come and see the baby. We used to call that seeing the baby. Now it's a sip and see, make sure to bring a present. This will be the 15th time you give these psychotic materialists a present in the past year and a half. And at some point, there's going to be a first wedding anniversary party because that also is a thing that people do now, by the way, apparently, I don't know if you knew that, a party to congratulate themselves for not getting divorced within the first 12 months of taking their vows. People have parties for that now. And there will be the big first birthday party for the child, followed, I'm sure, not far behind by the divorce party. And then another engagement party, and so on and on and on until we are all saved by the sweet release of death. Of course, with our luck, when we die, it will turn out that there's a big reveal party for each soul to find out if they're going to heaven or hell, bite into the cupcake. If it's red inside and tastes like sulfur, I hope you packed your summer clothes. It's kind of strange when you think about it because by the amount of celebrating we do for these ordinary life events, you'd think that we, in our culture, have a serious and profound appreciation for their personal importance and personal magnitude. But that doesn't seem to be the case. I don't look around at our society and notice a deep reverence for marriage and parenthood. I notice, in fact, the exact opposite. And when you think a little harder about it, you realize that it kind of makes sense. These parties are not a reflection of our appreciation for these institutions and milestones. That's because the parties don't really celebrate the institutions and milestones themselves. The parties are a celebration of the individuals. The individuals are throwing themselves expensive parties to give you an opportunity to celebrate them as individuals. This also explains why all of these baby and pregnancy celebrations are popular in well-off liberal areas where almost everyone is pro-abortion. What are they doing celebrating what they believe to be a parasitic infestation? Well, again, they aren't celebrating the pregnancy or the baby. It's the woman, the person. They are gathering to stroke her ego. Rather, she has called this gathering. She has summoned them for the solemn task of kissing her ass, which these days also, of course, is what almost the entire wedding reception is designed to do as well. We joke about women being bride's zillas on their wedding day, and we excuse it by saying, well, it's her big day. But first of all, just because it's your big day, why should that be an excuse to act like a raging sociopath? I don't even tolerate that behavior from my three-year-old on his birthday. You're a grown woman, allegedly. Pull yourself together. Also, it's not just your big day, okay? It's supposed to be a day for you and the groom and the family. It's supposed to really be a day celebrating the marriage, not you, the marriage. If you're seeing it as a day about you, that's a bad sign. And that's why I would recommend to any man out there. If you're engaged and you're bride to be is already giving off bridezilla vibes, maybe think about getting out now while you still can. Bride's zillas become wife zillas. Women who want everything to be about them on their wedding day, will, it turns out, bring that attitude with them into the marriage. When it comes to her narcissism and self-involvement, the wedding is just the appetizer. You don't want to see the main course. And dessert, well, dessert is a 70-30 custody arrangement. Now, I was fortunate that I didn't have to learn this lesson the hard way. My wife was anything but a bridezilla, yet there are a lot of bride's zillas and bros zillas out there. Our culture of self-worship is pretty much designed to create them, build them, churn them out like an assembly line. And all of the over-the-top, self-congratulatory, pageantry is both a symptom and a cause of the problem. So, I'm canceling all gender reveals and other superfluous celebrations. You will be permitted one wedding reception, no more than three hours in length, and that's the only public celebration you get until your 50th wedding anniversary. Needless to say, what I am theocratic dictator, this will be a matter of law. Violators will be thrown into a volcano. And that will be a cause for public celebration. We'll leave it there. Thanks for watching, everybody. Thanks for listening. Have a great day. Godspeed. Clavin Show."
