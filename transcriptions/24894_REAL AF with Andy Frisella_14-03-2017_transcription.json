your other names Vaughn diesel well one you haven't used in a while DJ DJ God that's chase now bombs favorite one yeah I know yeah yeah if this your first time listening guys welcome I'm sure you came here via word of mouth and the reason I know that is because we don't charge any money here we only ask that if you like the content if you like the value that we bring that you bring one other person that's my little feed that's my little request other than that the only thing I ask you is to go out and do some fucking shit that you learn and don't sit there like a bitch and do nothing be nothing stand for nothing accomplish nothing and then wine and cry like most society about why the fuck they can't do anything DJ salmon shorts over here is is here with his salmon shorts just so you know MC MC salmon I'm still laughing on the inside because right before we started the podcast you called Vaughn a little bitch and I love that because you try to copin out on some work guys that Vaughn does try to cop our work doesn't I try to be more efficient does he not doing work that I don't have to do no by not doing work that's right yeah he's more efficient with his time I'm not doing that work some people are working born workers some people are forming I'm a foreman oh Jesus you only get to be a foreman by doing the work I know I was just testing yeah okay look here's the deal today we have a really special podcast it's something that we haven't done before we're gonna try it out I think it's gonna be a great thing we actually have a room full of actual entrepreneurs young people who are out hustling doing the things that you all want to do and we're gonna do basically a live Q&A with these guys they're the winners of the 100th episode MSCO contest that we have where we fly people out and we're just gonna go one by one and let them ask some questions we're to have conversations and so we might jump around a little bit the important thing to know guys is that if this is your first time listening you have to understand that being an entrepreneur having the mindset of an entrepreneur becoming a mother fucking CEO is not just about owning a business it's about how you live your life okay having an entrepreneurial mindset having a mindset of self-awareness of control of confidence those things are valuable in any area of life so you might not be the guy owning the McDonald's right now you might be the motherfucker make a french fries but the reality is if you listen to this podcast you can develop the skills needed to progress very very far and whatever your goals are so guys as we talk about these things don't tune out because you don't own a fucking business you're doing yourself a disservice so Vaughn introduce these people and let's let's let's get into this alright to my left I have Jesus otherwise known as Jesus the Messiah Delgado straight from Naples Florida and he's got a lot of going on young guy 21 years old and you you have an apparel company kind of on the side but your your nine to five job is a is a you said a bank assistant bank manager and then you're also working on some brand development over here that's right over here in front of the mic yeah yeah okay so he's going to be our first first question yo what's up guys my name is Zeus you guys want me to say what I do a little bit yeah yeah all right cool so like they said I'm in the finance industry I got a nine to five job right now busting my ass on on that growing there I know I'm learning a lot you know I see what PJ talks about that even though he his job he knew he wasn't gonna do that forever he knows that those are PJ from Secret Entourage yeah he knows he's gonna use those skills yeah exactly reading his book now so he says that he knows he's gonna use those skills in the future but I do that I do a lot of real estate investing I'm learning a lot about that I got a couple houses about my first house when I was 19 about my second when I when I was 20 and next week hopefully putting a contract on a third house and 21 right now I'm 21 right now but it's first one at 19 I thought my first house at 19 yep so anything's possible guys and you got to remember that you know no matter what you're doing what's your insta my insta plugging already yeah at Zeus Delgado I spell Zeus different I put the you before the you so ZUES Delgado you guys can check me out on there I post so don't lie did you like did you like make a mistake when you spelled the first I didn't I didn't I wanted to be different I wanted to be different I did it I was like I made a lot of mistakes then played it off like oh dude I want to be different that's that's that's it's really yeah so it's kind of weird because your name is Jesus but then you also go by Zeus so you're all about being a god so I'm actually I'm actually with a with where the do's name is hey Zeus it's it's it's die hard it's one of the die hard movies a third one it's a conversation starter yeah yeah yeah soon I tell somebody my name is Zeus you know it's a conversation they think you're saying hey Zeus yeah but your name is hey Zeus that's how I came about yeah now I'm good but anyways where are I going oh so I got the the clothing company I've seen you know minor success but really what I've learned I've learned so much about finance about marketing about building a team there's just a ton of shit that I've learned and I paid for that in all the money that that I spent on it and you know I wouldn't trade it for the world so I think actually going out and doing something is how you're gonna learn the most and I don't I don't regret it at all and I'm still doing that that company so I got a question for you right I wrote it down let's see man he's getting right to business I'm getting right to business so in my opinion one of the most parts one of the most important parts about being an entrepreneur and just growing yourself and being a better person is having confidence I feel like people overlooked that and they don't really know that if they had confidence their relationships with a lot of people would be that much more important and also if they had confidence in what they're selling and themselves they can sell themselves better and sell their products better so how do you feel about confidence in having like that as a base as a foundation how important is it to start when you're when you're you know you're maybe you're focusing on like marketing or like connecting with people but you're not confident so how important is confidence in yourself and in your product and if there was one tip that you can give the people listening what would it be and something besides not giving a fuck because that that to me that's the most important one but something besides that right so first of all guys I want to before I answer your question I just want to point some things out this this guy's starting young you know 19 years old figuring out how to buy his own house a lot of you guys are emailing emailing emailing asking asking asking listening listening listening and not doing fucking anything and the reality of the situation is exactly what he said the money that he's invested that he's lost that he might not see a return on as part of his education and that's how you have to look at your losses so I think that's an important thing to point out is that look when you're a young person you're gonna fucking lose I mean I can't even tell you how many times I've lost but at the end of the day you have to look at it as look that's my education entrepreneurship or my losses and so figuring that out at your age is an amazing thing now to answer the question about confidence the biggest problem with confidence and first of all it's very important very very important you spent the day with me today I doubt you're gonna walk away thinking that I lack any fucking confidence but the problem with confidence there's two folds one some people have none and the other spectrum is some people have way too much you know they're arrogant and they don't understand humility and what that means so they have a hard time balancing those two points now I want to address the first part of not having any confidence first because I feel like that's the problem with most people I feel like that's a much more common problem is that even if people pretend to be confident they're not truly confident and you have to understand first off is that confidence is not a God-given trait it's not something that God sends down from the heavens and gives you like other certain things that you're born with in your personality some people have a natural good sense of humor some people have other abilities you know everybody has their own little skill set of what makes up the personality and confidence is not one of them confidence is a skill that is cultivated through the process of doing things and becoming successful at things so the problem that most people have with confidence and they say oh I don't have any confidence to do this how do I do this they think that they have to have the confidence first and you're never going to have the confidence first to pick up the phone and make a sales call or to go see somebody dude my first sales experiences I was scared of death fucking terrified probably just like you or anybody else but you know what I fucking knew that if I didn't do it I wasn't going to be able to get where I wanted to be so I fucking did it so what you're saying is even if you don't have the confidence as long as you have the balls to actually take action after you get it done and after you do it right then the confidence comes right confidence comes as a result of those of those little bitty victories that come along the way most people get paralyzed by the fact that they don't have much confidence and they think there's something wrong with them there's something wrong with their character I don't have much confidence I've never had much confidence well motherfucker I'm pretty sure you don't have any confidence because you never fucking try to do anything so confidence comes from being embarrassed I've heard that a million times and I guess that's what you're saying I mean not just being embarrassed but understanding that you're gonna win sometimes you're gonna lose sometimes and sometimes it is gonna be embarrassing sometimes it's gonna be awesome but the reality of the situation is you're not gonna fucking die you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah you you could go through and step through and find confidence through accomplishing little things now is that important fuck yeah it's important because it's impossible to really sell anything with if you're not confident in it it's impossible to sell yourself this comes down to your relationships it comes down to everything in life dude if you're not confident in yourself the the person that you want to be with in a personal relationship is not going to find you attractive okay there's so many things that come from confidence so it's extremely important now on the flip side you have these people who seem to have all kinds of confidence and they have these all all these different things that say oh I'm confident and then you look at like why they're confident and you can't find any fucking reason why they would be right they haven't done anything they haven't accomplished anything they just seem to have this and that usually comes from ignorance they usually have no fucking clue what they're doing and you know what there's sometimes there's value in that because there's a lot of times that I've done things or attempted things or tried to do things when I had no fucking business trying to do them and it ended up working out you know what I'm saying because I didn't know any better so but it becomes a handicap when you start really like believing that you're the shit when you're not and that's whenever the world is going to step right in your fucking on your face you know what I mean and so you have to understand that you know being very confident and being humble are things that go together to create a winning recipe you know what I mean so you could joke around like I joke around and all that shit but at the end of the day you'd like I'm always listening to people and trying to learn and figure out and get better and I think that's true confidence when you feel like you don't have to prove yourself to anyone because you're that humble right and you don't so I mean you know you kind of have to figure out where you are on that scale and you know become aware of that and and make adjustments you know to help improve that if you need more confidence go out and try to do some more shit you know what I mean because eventually you're gonna not be scared of it when you're not scared of it that gives you the ability to go do it more and when you go do it more you get better when you do get better you start winning then you develop confidence so that's the answer. Salas fuck thank you so much yeah you're welcome thanks Zeus. All right up next oh Canada we have Brittany Michael Chuck who who's got a handful of things going on you've got you've had a marketing company you also have developed and what is it bracelet company or a jewelry company and yeah you just got just tell us tell us what's going on. Hey guys my name is Brittany Michael Chuck I am from Calgary, Alberta Canada it's very cold there and yeah I started my bracelet business about seven months ago and it started off as a charity project and um supply and demand it was super popular and so I turned it into a little business I've been an entrepreneur since I was 12 years old and yeah I also have a relationship blog I love social media I'm very interested in growing social media platforms for my clients and yeah keeps me busy. Did you make that what you wearing there? No I didn't I did bring my jewelry though but um I was checking out on your page it's cool. Thank you it's uh I love online like it's a way of connecting people from all around the world it's a way of getting out your message and passionately pursuing what you want and being able to get a tribe behind you so it's a powerful method when utilized properly. So my question to you as an alpha male is what are the secrets that you found to create a successful relationship in your life and how can listeners out there be able to create successful relationships in their life as well? Um you're an alpha male? Well I was actually going to address that right up front I think that people you first understand what alpha male means you know a lot of people have this idea that alpha male is like you know this loud obnoxious you know boisterous dude who like wants to fight everybody that fucking like comes around and like kick their ass that really has nothing to do with it. Um what really has to do is with the presence that you portray and that comes from how you treat and respect other people so it has much less to do with like being this big tough thing even though like I know on our podcast like that's sort of how I present myself it really has nothing to do with that if you want to be somebody who's a leader and you want to be somebody who's considered alpha it's much more about how you respect and listen and value other people than it is about how you act uh because it's all about how other people respond to you so you have to understand that um you know first off like you have to realize that relationships from the viewpoint of social media are you know everything's not visible so like a lot of people portray our relationship as this perfect fucking thing when in reality we have our struggles too right we just don't we choose not to put them on the fucking internet for people to see so like the same things that other people go through uh we go through as well and so I think you know it's just important to understand that and I actually wrote about this a couple weeks ago on Facebook about how people publicize all all aspects of their relationship and that amplifies the good and the bad times which creates for a more up and down situation that is really kind of hard to live with um you know I think people uh when they look for a relationship partner I think you know that's where we're going to start at you know they they look for things that are very fucking shallow they look for things like you know pure looks or status instead of like compatibility and support and the things that are going to matter after the first year of a relationship which is natural right we all have needs we want to like date somebody who looks good and we want to like it's kind of a status thing you know you're walking with somebody you're proud of and that's all good and fine but at the end of the day there's plenty of people that have those things that you can still connect with on a personal level uh and I think people don't know how to do that in our society I think everything is so quick now and so impersonal you know if you go text email social media I mean you have fucking apps you know like Tinder where it's just like hey I'm gonna go fuck this person and the reality of of of our society is that it doesn't cultivate healthy relationships by the way it's set up so I think you know becoming aware of the things that you need outside of like sex uh and physical attraction are are the basis of what you should be looking for um as far as creating a good relationship at home um I mean we I have a great relationship but the thing is is that you know we it started with good foundation so it wasn't like uh we met you know on a one-night stand or some shit like that we were friends for five years first before we ever went out on one date so um you know I don't know like sometimes I feel like I just got lucky with that you know sometimes I feel like I know what I'm doing sometimes I don't know what the fuck I'm doing so I don't know Andy do you think that most people don't even think that there's a connection between their their relationship with their significant other and their success in business I think most people see them as two completely disconnected things when in reality everything depends on what energy you have either taking away or contributing to you and I can tell you this the building a company you're becoming successful or making a lot of money all those things require a tremendous amount of energy and if you're not getting that kind of energy at home and you're spending that energy dealing with something that doesn't work in a relationship area you're not going to have the energy you need to put into what it is over here so it's absolutely connected and anybody who's successful will tell you that um but it's not something that people think about I don't think I think they think of it as two different things they think of it as my personal life my business life but at the end of the day those things definitely contribute or take away from each other on on an every every day basis you know like let's say you have a bad day at work and then all of a sudden you go home and get nagged on top of it you know what I'm saying it's going to suck everything creative out of you every day and that's how most people live dude most people have terrible day at work then they go home and they get in a fight with their fucking wife or their this or that because they don't have as much money as they want or they don't have this that they want and the reason they don't have this is because they're spending their time at home wasting all their energy in this fucking relationship it doesn't serve them you know and on top of that I feel like a lot of people are way too loyal to uh to relationships that are not serving of themselves interesting yeah I feel like a lot of people are they they will meet let's say at 25 years old they'll date and then they think because they're with somebody for three years they have to get married and instead of thinking like okay well are things getting better are they getting worse is it serving me is it not serving me and they say oh well you know what everybody thinks we should get married so they get fucking married and then they go down the path of the whole cycle you know they have some kids they get more in debt they have less money they start fighting over money they get fucking divorced and they don't know what the fuck just happened you know and I think a biggest problem with relationships is that people live to other people's expectations or society's expectation versus what is good or bad for them personally so I don't know if that answers the question. So you talk about the importance generally speaking of connecting with somebody who is what you would call a good person but if you could identify one indispensable character quality like if this person doesn't have this don't even bother with them what would you say? I would say the person being a giver as opposed to a taker you know you want to be with somebody who's going to contribute uh and help and and push and instead of like being an anchor in your fucking boat and uh and I think you know to get that you've got to you've got to be that you know so many people want that without being that and you know it's hard to have a relationship the point of a relationship is to make you better right like it's not just because you're supposed to fucking do be in a relationship it's supposed to make you better it's not supposed to be this thing that's so fucking hard that it drives you crazy I mean if that's the relationship you're in you probably shouldn't be in it I mean you know what I'm saying so like I don't know I think you know let's let's remember the purpose of a relationship what's the purpose the purpose is that it should make your life better hands to challenge you push you right so what you know what the fuck are most people doing these relationships whenever they're bitching on Facebook about how fucking miserable they are you know I don't know all right thank Brittany thanks guys and feel free to add me on instagram my instagram is Brittany Michael Chuck b-r-i-t-t-a-n-y-m-i-c-h-a-l-c-h-h-u-k thank you so much thank you all right up next we have a very unenthusiastic unenergetic doctor of chiropractor from uh from uh San Diego California doctor mike wasa listen hey if you got back pain he's got your back right kind you know what I used to say I've got your back but the truth is is if you discover it for yourself it's much more powerful than me having your back yeah so I mean he's got your front two he's got your one to remove that yeah yeah we were talking about oh fucking look at you we got your front two we were dr mike is a really interesting guy we were talking about pelvic range earlier I could talk about that all day yeah well so what you are the impaler I am the impaler you must be the king of pelvic range you know what you told me tell me what you told me about my about my uh what you noticed about my you know what wavon told me he was he said that he had back pain but he thought it was because the food he was eating is causing inflammation and what I asked you then why would that inflammation go to your back right and just watching von walk he's in forward tilt meaning he's got a lot of forward tilt he's got a lot of curve in his back it means you have a tough time doing that midnight move von which where you tuck the hips under get up in there von there's some room for improvement in there sorry honey but what that does von is is when you're in that forward tilt it puts inflammation in your joints and maybe you your back is right below that tipping point of pain and you just eat something shitty and that just takes you over the tipping point but I think that's when you're back pain that is the cause yeah I don't think it's bad enough to do anything he's been calling me the impaler for the last two years and I think his words are exercising no von points of fucking hypochondriac like this is von here's von you go to dinner with him and he's like oh I don't want to eat that sugar blah blah blah because it'll make me inflamed but yeah he'll drink fucking five drinks with 15 fucking sugars each and I notice that actually oh I can't have that crumb roy because I'll have a I'll have to go and take a fucking nap but but but but I but I but bring me another fucking vodka and Sprite you know get the fuck out of here man that's right you're hitting that a little bit all right okay he thinks that like he's gonna he thinks he's gonna eat something he's gonna fucking like like he like gluten allergy whatever you guys got everything this motherfucker was allergic to like fucking air I'm pretty sure so anyway oh my well Andy if I could start off first of all by saying dude you've changed my life and I do it from the bottom of my heart man thank you I appreciate you've helped me I realized what a pussy I'd become with speaking to my patients and people I didn't want it I didn't think they want to hear the truth about if someone's in chronic pain I didn't think they want to hear it so I deliver in this watered-down version all that did was is is probably pushing off to some other doctor yeah it may I was in quick fix mentality you help me understand you help remove those barriers so I can deliver to them the unfiltered truth about what it really takes to get out of pain and get back to an active life and I and now that message that you've helped this transpired through me from you I'm helping tens of thousands of people and we created a fucking movement because of it that's awesome so I feel dude yeah grab your social because I follow I follow you on social and you do a really good job yeah so our social media handle is at move you mov e the letter you underscore official move you official now our instagram page we teach people we teach people through through entertainment I want I want before you get on this I want you guys to follow him because I want you to like see how he does his social okay this is somebody who's taking something that is boring yeah it's fucking boring fucking blame yeah and making it fun and exciting in a unique way that I've never seen somebody do the people are lame is that's what it was it wasn't the information yeah yeah well I mean dude you know I don't know like I got a back pain it's it's not that exciting but the point is is that you're a lot of these people will write in be like dude I do this and how do I make that interesting well they should follow you because you're taking something that isn't that interesting and making interesting and that's a huge compliment because I enjoy following you thank you dude I said before when Andy gives me a little like I'm like oh Andy liked that one but um but we we teach people through people always describe us as entertaining and educational right and we teach people simple techniques how to improve the posture how to eliminate pain and how to ultimately really it is how to live an awesome and active life because people get the medical system here's what's happened is I've been in his profession for 17 years the medical profession pounds you down for your pain you've got this disease you got degenerative disc you've got this and I got so fucking tired of it last year of hearing it and I didn't I looked around nobody else was making a stand for it right nobody right everybody in the little local levels but that's not going to do the job right not when the medical industry owns back pain right they don't deserve to own it and with move you that's when I stepped up because Gandhi says be the change you want to see in the world so I fucking stepped up to it and it took some and it leads me to the question yeah I got for you to okay and so there was a turning point that happened right now I'm sure you hear this I hear Will Smith talking about it third circle theory he talks I'm moving from circle one to two but there's this point of time that happens where this kept for me this cascade of events happen between listening to you mentors being fed up that led to me going that's it I chose to make a stand for something I stand to deliver the authentic truth and into guide people out of pain back to an act of life now my question to you and all the listeners out there I know they're looking for that breakthrough in transformation so what have you found with yourself and other people that have had these transformations what are the events or what events have you found that have led up to that day at that point of time where they go oh my god they've chose a life now of purpose and not pleasure well that's an awesome question and I think you answered it with the way you presented the question if you're listening carefully enough you know you said that you were fucking fed up with the way that things were are you were pissed off you got to a point where you're just not willing to accept you know the way things were in your industry anymore and you took it upon yourself to make that change and that's what it takes man it doesn't matter if it's fitness business your relationship it doesn't matter you've got to get to a point where you're just fucking tired of it and you're fed up with it and you're not willing to accept anymore of whatever it is that is driving you to feel that way and people will put band-aids on things right they'll make excuses for things and when things are irritating them or pissing them off they'll they'll instead turn the blame on themselves whether something wrong with me or I'm irritable or I ate that sugar drink at the fucking bar you made me have an allergic break right he did too right people will make these fucking excuses for why they feel this way instead of saying no motherfucker that shit is fucked up and I need to fix it and you know what that's when the change happens when you're so tired of the way things are that you say dude I've had literally enough I'm not going to go one more fucking second doing this this way and that's it and it's like you see this with people with diets a lot like a fitness you know they'll say oh I'm gonna start Monday and it's fucking Tuesday of the previous week like motherfucker you should start right fucking now you know what I'm saying don't wait for extra you know after this weekend or after this or after that dude taking action right now is one of the most powerful fucking things you can do to start creating momentum and so you know people are conditioned to come up with these ideas that like why they can't do it like you took initiative to change the things that you were upset about most people won't do that they won't take initiative they think that someone has to come around and qualify them to do that no if you see something that's bothering you or you are upset with something whether it be in the world or whether it be with yourself or whether it be with whatever situation you're in you have an obligation to start fixing it right now because that's where your purpose is going to come from you just don't fucking see it yet every single great person out there who's ever accomplished you know anything they didn't start with this great wonderful fucking feeling like oh I'm so happy that I'm gonna go out and try no they started fucking pissed off because they were sick of the way things were and they said dude this has got to change do you think of any political movement any government any fucking discovery any cure any invention it started with that feeling like dude this is fucking bullshit and they went on to fucking become great and so dude getting to that point where you are so irritated and so fed up is a good thing you don't make excuses for that you look at that as a benefit as to how I'm gonna be productive and instead of like sulking and being mad and being upset about it you use it as a pivot to act and that's where great things are born damn the similarities you said like if some I got so fucking if I am like if I see one more unnecessary back surgery right one more but then you know what happens now is these people the same emotions you're saying when people feel like with pain when they when they hit a point of frustration feeling hopeless or fearful I go that's awesome you're ready to fucking do something about it exactly you're ready that you can use that to get your head above water and your feet there the same damn principles that you teach can you apply to what I do right dude you could apply to anybody anybody in this room anybody listening anybody that's how you get there is by finding out what bothers you and doing something about it it's that simple that's a good question nice yeah awesome thank you just ramp up that ramp up the enthusiasm and on honestly thank you for being an awesome host and you you're seriously awesome now Vaughn he comes off proper but he'll spin out with these random acts of hilarity out of nowhere yeah he he tries to act like he's all goody goody on the podcast right you know try to act like I'm goody goody I'm genuinely trying to be a good person yeah it's just that the bad stuff comes out of me every now and then you know I think every listener knows that you're a good person or hard thank you I appreciate it I appreciate it okay next up we have Joshua I can't talk today Joshua Rockwood uh Josh is from the kind of Albany area of New York and he he has a great story uh I'm gonna let you tell most of it but basically this guy is in the beef business right I'm in the meat business that's for sure yeah so my wife and I own a company called Westwind Acres you can find us on Instagram West underscore wind underscore acres we started our farm kind of as a passion to uh there was a need for my cholesterol to lower and I didn't want to go on statins at 24 years old for the rest of my life so we found through a little research that if we raised animals properly they give us healthier meat and over the years it's become a passion now we're up to around 200 acres we're hoping to hit 400 acres this year where we can hopefully feed about 400 families that's badass man uh so our goal uh over the next couple years is to take the farm from baby animals right to plate in every aspect and that's kind of what my question is at what point in a business is it time to make that step it's an integral step to go to you know to start butchering or start slaughtering our own animals but it's also taking on additional risk additional labor additional work you're gonna have to invest some money invest a ton of money as well so I think if you ask 20 people this question that you're gonna get 20 different answers so what I'm gonna do is kind of let you know when I knew okay um it's all about what your goals are okay and if if you're thinking big picture if you're thinking long term if you're thinking 10 20 years down the road which I think you are yeah um it makes sense to do that as soon as you possibly can because even though you're going to invest the money up front you're going to make the profit margins on the back end better and vertically integrate yourself so that you can produce more and make more money in your business and um a lot of people will get to a point where they will be able to afford to vertically integrate their business to to take another step in in the process but they haven't made very much money for so long that they like are like oh man now I'm making money so I don't you know I don't want to invest even more right because they're tired of being broke it's right scary to stay broke to look at the long term but I could tell you from my for my situation um just ripping the band aid off all at once was probably the best thing that I ever did and just continuing to invest and best because now we have a legitimate foundation that we could stand on very solidly and and make a very profitable business from um and I the little bit I know about you uh I think you know the sooner the better for what you guys are trying to do and just kind of like suck it up and fucking deal with it you know what I mean and and just keep going but if you ask other people you know you're going to get different answers some guys are going to tell you you know oh you know recoup some of the money and then do it I don't agree with that because if you recoup some of the money and then do it you'll get comfortable and you won't fucking do it you know what I mean I'm afraid of that right so just stay uncomfortable go as hard as you can go in and and it'll work out because I know you're gonna make it work so that that would be my recommendation absolutely so I think that I think that people fuck up by not going all in on their growth and their in their in their infrastructure from the beginning um I noticed that a lot in our industry you know there's a lot of guys out there that don't do any manufacturing they don't do any of their marketing they don't do they outsource everything and then what do they end up really having you have nothing you have a fucking label and a logo um and it just takes more than that to build a brand so I think for what you're doing you're building a real brand and what you guys uh what your goals are I just think the sooner the better for you guys awesome thank you yeah you're welcome so for the sake of time we don't have enough minutes to to go into the the real trial that you faced josh but I think it would be important josh basically faces brutal brutal trial in this brutal difficulty um that took about 18 18 months to reconcile it involved legal stuff some unfair um charges and Andy you made a point earlier when we were talking about this that um without wanting to minimize the seriousness with which you know he was facing that trial you said everybody's gonna face trial well look we were here's where we're going to set the so we were sitting around talking getting to know each other earlier today we sat around for two two hours or so talked just you know had some good entrepreneurial conversation um and we went around the table and everybody kind of told me their story and everybody was you know sort of saying their challenges like oh I'm having this issue or oh I had this issue with this and this is why this didn't work out or oh this and and uh you know josh's story was definitely a very difficult obstacle to overcome uh he had a situation where his his farm was actually seized quote unquote stolen uh from him for 18 months and he had to keep the business going and um you know we got around to like the end of of the group and and I just kind of like you asked me what I thought the theme was the theme was hey this is what we fucking deal with as entrepreneurs you know every day is going to be a fight every day we're going to have a new story every day we're going to have a new challenge and there isn't a day that I wake up and and expect to have a day with no fucking bullshit it's just part of what we sign up to do so you know instead of like being the person who's always saying you know oh why me why is this so fucking hard dude just expect it to be hard then it's then it's then it's not that much to deal with right you know if you expect it to be hard you can look at it and find find the challenge figure out how to fix the challenge like what's today's what's today's game gonna be yeah what what good can we find in this you know how can we move forward yeah and what can I learn from it you know and and I think people really get fucked up in entrepreneurship because they have a hard time and then they look at it and they say oh well it must be me I must not be a good entrepreneur this must not be for me when in reality no dude it's fucking hard it's hard for everybody like dude every and like look I don't expect all the fucking entrepreneurial gurus out there to tell you this shit because their egos are fucking gigantic but look it's hard it's fucked for me man like it's hard there's not a day that goes by that I have a fucking easy you know what I'm saying like and so if I don't have a fucking easy why the fuck do you think you should have it easy too you know it's it's hard for all of us you know and I think overcoming these battles is where ultimately is going to make you a very successful entrepreneur 10 15 years from now when you've got the fucking you know the market that you're wanting to take a chunk out of fucking lockdown you know what I mean so it's all part of like Jesus said it's part of the education process you know and it's not always fun but you know when you start expecting it to be hard then it's not as bad like if you know it's like like you know when you expect to get your ass kicked every day after a while you just kind of get used to it you're ready for it right you can take it on right exactly that's really what what's drawn me into the podcast is yeah you tell it as it is you you teach me how to find the good in all that crap it doesn't do any service to anybody listening to sit here and be like oh yeah it's so fucking easy for me because I'm so good at this and then they go home and get their fucking nuts kicked in and then think badly of themselves right like what good is that providing I don't do this for money I do this to fucking help people and like you guys have to understand there's two sides of this a lot of you motherfuckers aren't entrepreneurs I'm not talking to you I'm talking to people listening you guys are entrepreneurs I'm just saying there's a lot of motherfuckers listening that aren't true entrepreneurs you know and there's also a lot of people that are true entrepreneurs but are getting their nuts kicked in thinking that maybe I don't have what it takes you know and dude I fucking thought that for a long time dude I used to always think about it like this and this is why I always use the the magic success fairy analogy that if you listen to the podcast you know I say that a lot because I used to think of success as like this thing that was like granted like dude I wonder if I'm going to be fortunate enough to be one of these people or be lucky enough to be one of these people that you know gets to live this kind of life and make this kind of money and do these kind of things and that's how I used to think of it like I wonder if like I've if I'm gonna get selected like it was a fucking lottery and you know only once you've I mean do you ever think like that I try not to I know but like the idea is like honestly naturally right like you guys are all shaking your head yes you know I think we all think that when we're when we're trying to build something we're like man I wonder if I'm gonna be that guy and I think once you get to a certain level you start to understand that it's not about that it's about doing the work it's about connecting the A and the B to equal the C and it's hard it's hard to believe that when you're young and starting out and just getting it going and not quite where you want to be and you're constantly getting beat up and you're constantly going through these struggles it's hard to see that is really just an equation of fucking math versus this magic thing but like you have to trust that when I tell you and I'm speaking to you guys listening right now when I tell you guys it's that simple it really is that simple it's just a matter of doing the work learning from your mistakes and continuing to move down the path and eventually you're gonna have built something the luck comes in where you get up that morning you don't want to you make that 11th call when you're only gonna make 10 yeah you know right but those connections you get to make but that's not really luck that's just your hard work that's the intestinal fortitude that you're willing to fucking display into your craft and other people see that as luck but they don't see that shit right they see that shit like they only see like oh the farm grew from 200 to 400 acres now it's a thousand acres now it's 10,000 acres oh man he really got fucking lucky at what he did no motherfucker this dude did fucking sleep for 10 fucking years you know what I'm saying you don't people don't see that shit so they believe in the luck because that's the stories we're told we're told the glorifications of fucking entrepreneurship we're told overnight successes we're told the stories of the Kardashians the people who are fucking really what I mean what the fuck do they really do that make millions of dollars you know what I mean that's what we're told we're not told like the stories of of Joshua Rockwood you know who's fucking had false accusations on animal abuse and had his whole farm fucking shut down basically for 18 months and had to fight the legal system to get it back you know and then 10 years later he builds this awesome successful fucking cup you aren't told that shit because you know what people don't want to hear it because that shit's hard and they don't want to believe that it's hard they want to believe that they're going to hit the fucking grand slam to win the game in the bottom of the ninth and be the fucking hero and that's not the way it works for 99.9 percent of us right Josh the coolest thing about your story that you told me was that just at the time that you that all this stuff was going down we had the very first episode of the MFCO project you came across that episode the very first episode we ever had was Andy talking about the power of perspective and how you it to be an entrepreneur and to be successful in life in general you have to be able to see the good in the bad and so that's that's exciting that that podcast just changed my changed my outlook on the whole situation and we were able to to turn it around and get a couple thousand extra Facebook followers and and really get some support for your cause get the support for the cause yeah okay so our fifth and final entrepreneur's name is Nicholas otherwise known as Nico Kaufman out from the Pacific Midwest the Communist Center of the United States Midwest I'm sorry Pacific Northwest the Communist Center of the United States of America but I'm sure you're out there fighting a good fight so Nico you're involved in a very unglamorous business but you're killing it so I'll let you take it away. Realistically in my eyes what I do it is kind of glamorous I started a pressure washing company it's a long story essentially I started working for this guy and I felt like he was just stepping on my throat every fucking day being like I know you're good but I don't ever want to see you do better than me and you know so I took it upon myself that like you know what fuck it I'm just gonna start my own and I took the my final paycheck from him which was like I think like 250 bucks and paid my car insurance about a month late so I could hop on the good old Craigslist find what I thought was the best equipment for the money and I was gonna go all in we were doing car dealerships washing down all their inventory and I was all about it registered my company bought the equipment that I needed at the bare minimum just to get by and then I went I can't do this on my own and since I had just started it was hard for me to get people I like working at it at night you ever been to a car dealership during the day it's fucking insane with people running around driving around all over the place so that that was my first wall and I was I was like I'm fucked and then I was like no there I got to do it you know I got to do something at the time my girlfriend was about three months pregnant and I'm sitting over here we were we were pissed poor we barely had a pot to piss in and your back was against the wall back was against the wall and realistically I look back now and that was probably one of the most exhilarating times that I ever had doing it because I didn't have money for anything so it was literally going door to door after I'd worked about 6 30 a.m. I'm a service manager at an auto repair shop and go to work 6 30 in the morning take like a 30-minute lunch I you know he encourages an hour I took a shorter one so I could get out of there earlier so that way I had more time to hit the pavement and literally go door to door different neighborhoods throughout town knocking on people's doors right introducing myself to people introducing my services what I could do trying to make friends in it that was probably one of the hardest things I ever did because you had some people that were super super cool welcome you into the house like oh you want like a glass of iced tea or anything like that after I'd been done working for them some people would pay me a little bit more and then I'd have people that would just literally slam the door by face and tell me to fuck off yeah man to go get a real job yeah and I'm like what's your real job because I guarantee you the person that you work for at some point did something similar to what I was doing to start my company no question so what can I help you with so my deal is we've talked you know you got bracelets you can you know hop on the internet buy it ship it anywhere me you know Mike was his back painting it's all online like that man over there is just like revolutionizing like I'd say medical attention not a practice essentially it's right so for me it's if you're doing a labor intensive job or I can't you know I can't throw my shit on a plane I can't hop in the truck and drive out to St. Louis right for a job how how important is social media for the people that are essentially for the time being service jobs because service jobs and labor jobs right essentially almost stuck in an area until they have the capital to grow and move so I dude I think that's a good question because I think a lot of people who are in the trades sort of speak like painting construction you know power washing like you are they they don't quite understand how to utilize social to grow their their their business and nobody's really doing it right now in those in those areas and you have to understand that we are in a we are in a time where we can literally target neighborhoods with Facebook ads about whatever service that we do and you're in a good position because while you might not be doing it yet neither is anybody else and so if you're the first guy that does power washing that could figure out how to scale his business through Facebook ads and grow business through Facebook because that's where the attention is that's where people are watching that's where we spend all of our time we don't watch TV we don't listen to the radio we're not reading the fucking newspaper anymore no we're on Facebook 24 hours fucking day and if you could figure out how to target your little neighborhoods and get people to purchase your product and you could build a customer base that way you could leverage that into word of mouth you know you can use people you could do such a great job for people so they rep they that your advertising expense becomes exponential all right and your results become you know so much better than what it costs to get and by the way Facebook is very cheap to do right now that you could grow your company that way and then you know you you get enough customers where you can't do them all yourself you hire another dude you know you have him fucking do it you reinvest and grow your company and you know I think the idea that what you guys have to understand if you're in that sort of service business is that you know start some pick somewhere to start a neighbor of geographical location and build outward you know go out from there like a like a like a radiating target all right you know start very focused as you get bigger you can hire more people and you can start to go in other areas but the point of it of starting in a radiating focus is also it's not just hey let's start in this neighborhood but you know it cuts down your travel time it cuts down your expenses it cuts down if you can get 10 jobs in the same neighborhood now all of a sudden you know you're you're building a network of of customers that are all in the same area and dude it's just a strategic battle plan so to speak about how to grow your business the answer to your question is social is highly underutilized for your kind of business you know and people who are in those kind of businesses power washing construction doing any kind of labor or service painting you know you guys aren't utilizing social at all and if you do you're you're you're basically have a Facebook page for your company that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about figuring out how to fucking run Facebook ads targeted at certain clientele that are very very cheap to run and they're going to be extremely cheap for you guys because other people in your business are not doing it most of the guys that do that kind of work aren't they're not entrepreneurial minded they're guys that do that work and they happen to have a business and if that's you you start thinking like an entrepreneur so that you can scale your business up to be a real company one day and I mean to me you're you're in the best possible opportunity that you could ever have because up until the last three or four years where Facebook ads became relevant how the fuck could it one guy who owned some power washing equipment afford to advertise on TV or radio you couldn't do it it would be fucking impossible you can so the biggest companies the biggest companies to have already established themselves are going to be the ones that stay there because you can't get to that point of actually running an effective campaign because it's too much money and because you don't have the money you can't get the customers and because you can't get the customers you know you end up staying in this little bitty cycle of you know the two or three or five people that you might talk to and the reality of business now is that you could take someone who is small and scale up very big against these bigger companies who are refusing to adapt and they're still spending their money on TV on radio on print and you could beat the shit out of them very very quickly so if I were you and I was anybody listening in those kind of businesses I would learn how to how to run Facebook ads and I've become really fucking good at it and I would spend every fucking minute that you have learning how to do that and do that you know until you scale your company where you want it to be because we're in a time right now that it's the first time in history we've been able that the little guy's been able to legitimately compete with the big guy when it comes to a service based labor based type business you know you weren't able to do that 10 years ago now you can do that so it's a really exciting time for for guys like you and guys that are in those sorts of businesses to scale because the big guys the guys who have been around for 20 years 30 years they're still stuck 20 30 years ago they're not paying attention they they have the attitude of I'm the king we're the king those little guys are never going to get us and you know we're going to keep spending our budget on the radio on TV and they don't have any need to like adapt right and you're going to be able to you're going to be able to fucking adapt quickly and and and I'll I'll place them in the market in a very short time period so it's it's very very exciting you know that wasn't we weren't able to do that five years ago not at all right so you're in a situation that that I would be extremely excited about I yeah I can't even explain it's just like now I'm just like I mean I don't want to leave here but I'm like I got so much shit that I can do today yeah I want to do it hard like next week I'm like yeah all right it's time to make this my bitch and yeah it's hard as I can and if you're in the Portland area and you listen to the MSCO project and you need your what is it your your house power services I do houses driveways I've got this new stuff that doing roofs from my research that I've done really not marry many people in especially Portland but the whole northwest west coast it's going to be huge and I'm getting ready to you know drop some money and get this whole new setup because it's it's low pressure high pressure because I don't feel like buying new roofs for hundreds of people I just want to help them make their roofs look better last longer we're gonna find social my Instagram I'm not super super huge on posting but it's but you're gonna be I'm and I will yeah I'm gonna be it's gonna be crazy and uh actually within the last couple days starting Instagram for my company it's at King's pressure wash and my personal one is at in underscore Kaufman K AU FF m a n cool man cool yeah that's a good question a very very useful practical question yeah yeah guys thanks so much for being with us a couple things one uh listeners if you're not following Andy by now you really need to be following him I'm sure you are but just in case you aren't it's at Andy Fersella uh for pretty much everything except for um Snapchat is MFCEO dash one and uh Tyler's at my Tyler MAI underscore T Y L E R and I'm at Vaughn Kohler for everything VA U G H N K O H L E R three quick things one we're still getting requests for Andy's favorite books we've actually put those together it's the MFCEO.com forward slash badass books that's his list and anoty dated bibliography of all well not all of them but most of his favorite uh books that he recommends number two uh people are still asking you know how how can I buy Otis and Charlie which is kind of a strange question go to Amazon and uh enter Andy Fersella and Otis and Charlie the book will come up and uh if you buy it please do us a favor and write a review that really really helps a lot and book is selling really well so thank you so much for that and then finally Andy always says uh do us a favor by you know telling a friend about us I just want to echo that and just say guys do us a favor help us to spread this movement so many good things are happening so many lives are changed um tag your friends on everything Andy posts um email them do whatever you have to do but tell them about the MFCEO project so that we can expand the movement because good things are happening you want to be part of it yeah I think that's I think that's something that that needs to be expressed I don't think we've hit on that in a while is that this is a movement you know the reason we do this shit is to help cultivate the next generation of entrepreneurs um you know you guys listening are mostly very like-minded people you're people who think the same way and we're usually the kind of people who look at everybody else they want to fuck do they think that way um if we don't stand up and and help spread the mentality that we have guess what's going to win the opposite mentality the entitled the deserved the whining crying bitching shit that we're all tired of so uh you know be proud of the way that you feel about things and the way you view the world and help bring other people to this quote unquote meeting place because uh we need to take the shit back um I also think it's important to note you know guys these these guys that were here today are real people they're not people you know that we set up to come in here as guests and I didn't know the questions that they were gonna ask and I'm sure that you have your own questions that you want to ask but it's important to remember you know and I want to hit on this again I hit on this in the podcast the entrepreneurship is a hard thing it's a tough thing it's something that you're gonna get punched in the mouth on a daily basis and the obstacles that you're gonna have they might be unique to you but you're not the only motherfucker out there having issues you're not the person that's having uh this you know the the sky isn't falling on you because you're you entrepreneurship is just that fucking hard and so surrounding yourself and being around people who are also of that sort of lifestyle is extremely important and not enough of you guys are doing that you're still trying to hang out with your old crew with your old friends who have regular nine to five jobs and on top of you getting punched in the face on uh your your journey every single day now you gotta listen to these motherfuckers tell you about how stupid you are for doing it so guys do yourselves a favor put good shit in your head surround yourself with good people be around people who understand the journey you're on and it's gonna make your situation a lot more tolerable and a lot more fun so with that being said guys um I appreciate you guys listening I'm excited for the things that we have coming up thank you so much for all your support and we'll see you next time"
