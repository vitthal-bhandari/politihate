    "text": " So we know that we live in an enlightened age when it comes to our understanding of a gender, and by enlightened I mean insane and confused. We're told that men are women and women are men and some women are men and women and some men are men and women and like armadillos or whatever. But the trans agenda has run into a kind of a problem which is sort of interesting. We're supposed to see men as women if they call themselves women, but they aren't really women and other men know that. And if other men are heterosexual, then they aren't going to be attracted to a man just because he says he's a woman. So that presents a real problem. You can't blame heterosexual men for wanting biological females. That's how they're oriented. It's the orientation. It's their identity, you know. And that's the conundrum that the gender warriors find themselves in and they're always trying to find a way out of it. One way out of it is to simply berate heterosexual men and demand that they be attracted to trans people. So that's one thing you could do. Find them attractive, damn you, be attracted to these people. Another strategy is what you find in this video that we're going to play for you right now. A person goes by the name Don Marie. This is a transgender person who identifies as a woman explaining just kind of laying out a case for why straight men should date so-called trans women. In fact, the case being made here is that straight men are better off dating biological male so identify as women. Let's give it a watch. Today we're going to talk about the reasons and the benefits of dating a transgender woman and why we are probably most likely, I don't want to be biased, but why we're probably most likely a better candidate of dating than your average bitch. The first reason being we are strong, strong individuals. We've had to endure a lot you know within our life and we've been through a lot and it just makes us stronger people and it makes us really sweet. You go through as much as a trans woman who's been like either kicked out of her home or she's been beat up by people by bullies and stuff. He's going to be a very very loving caring person because she doesn't want anybody to feel what she's been through. So she's going to be super sweet and she's going to be a loving person. So females aren't strong. Biologic women are not strong. Is what I'm getting at this? Or sorry, not female. I believe the scientific term I wrote it down here being used here is average bitch to describe biological women. That's okay. Don't be insulted. You can't be insulted. Ladies and if you are insulted, you're not allowed to say so because that's the lesson. Remember, that's if you're being insulted, integrated by a trans person, then if they're invading your privacy, even if they're going into your locker room or your bathroom and you're thinking, G, I'd rather have privacy. You all you're allowed to do is smile and say, thank you. So when you're being insulted right now, that's all that is female empowerment. This right here, this series of insults and it continues and gets worse. Let's keep watching. Two for why you should date a trans woman instead. I'm just kidding. We are more appreciative of the small things. We don't need you to go buy us an expensive lunch or spend $100 on something for me to be happy. We just want you to hold our hands in public. We just want you to be happy that you're with us. Little things like holding your hand in public can make us super happy because there are people out there that want to hide us. So we're easy to please. We don't have super unobtainable standards. We do have standards. I don't want to make a sound like we don't have standards, but we are not just stuck up and like bougie and just wanting the world from you. We just appreciate the small things. Get it where I'm living. Okay. So I'm because I'm taking notes here and I'm trying to just make sure that I'm listening and I'm being a good student. So biological women are weak, materialistic, stuck up, bougie, that's what I'm gathering here. And I'm not saying that. Our friend Don Murray is saying that. So far, this is just a parade of insults against women. And there's not but there's not so much of a real case. Like we're not getting over the the hump. I was looking for a better word to use there and I couldn't find us. I just went with hump. I we're not really getting over the hump here of of this difficulty of how do you get around the fact that a heterosexual male is actually wants a female. That's the whole, that's sort of like the whole point really sexually if you're a heterosexual male. So we haven't gotten to that part yet. Maybe we will. Let's keep watching. You know, I do have stretch marks on the side of my booty because it's growing. It just feel my brain cells committing Harry, Carrie committing ritualistic suicide in protest for subjecting them to this. No offense. So update the list. Biological women are weak materialistic, stuck up, bougie, stretch mark riddle. That's what that again, that's that's the portrait. Rather, I should say the cartoon of women that's being presented to us here and not just here. The the entire the less entire agenda when it comes to gender rests on this kind of thing. By the way, trans women quote, unquote, can't get pregnant. Is that is that correct? That's true. I mean, that is finally some good information. We got we got one fact in here and that's good. That's that's biologically correct information. But why do you think that is? It's a man, baby. Oh, see, you've got, let's think about this for a second. All biological women can get pregnant, barring old age or disease, right? So in other words, in principle, biological women can get pregnant. On the other hand, quote unquote, trans women can never get pregnant ever under any circumstance. Huh. I mean, it's almost like we have two different categories of people here. And there's a there's a word for that. What's the word? We've got you've got two, two potential categories. And so, you know, on one hand, you have people who can get pregnant, the other hand, you have people who can't get pregnant. And what is it when you got two different category of binary? Yeah. So it's almost as if we have a binary system here of, uh, preg, preg, people who can get impregnated and people who can impregnate. That's almost what it seems like. I don't know. I got to think more about this, but all right. Let's, uh, let's finish this up. Number four would be that we know a man's needs more than their average girl. The reason that being is because we've been on the other side. If you're catching my drift. I hope I feel like number five is because trans women are more feminine and make more of an effort. The reason that being is because we're making up for what we, for what we lacked in our previous life and, you know, we care about our appearance and we just want to look spruce up and feminine at all times. Guys love that. Guys appreciate it. I heard from a few guys that I've dated like, you know what? Like, I really appreciate trans women because they actually take the time to get ready and don't take advantage of being a woman. Oh my God, this hair is getting my nerves right here. You guys actually like take the time and effort to be feminine and to be girly. And you guys aren't trying to like step all over our toes all the time. Okay. Well, let's uh, final update to the list. Biological women are weak materialistic, stuck up bougie fat, stretch, Mark riddled lazy, unfeminine, but other than that, great. And Don, I got to tell you the people you're dating who compliment you on taking so long to get ready. Those are called gay men. And a hint that they're gay is that they're dating a biological male. So that's really kind of a dead giveaway right there. But if you need more, no straight man anywhere ever is eager for their, their wife or their girlfriend to take more time to get ready. That's just doesn't it. No straight men when their woman comes out of the bathroom after 98 minutes and you're late for your dinner reservations, none of them are saying, wow, honey, thank you for putting so much effort into your appearance. Unless they're being sarcastic. No, straight men are pounding on the door saying, hey, babe, just throwing some sweatpants. We got to go. Let's go. That's a straight man. It really is amazing. The claim here is that biological men identifying as women are not only feminine, but more feminine. They are better at being women than women are. That's the message these days. The message is if you're a woman, as a woman, you can do anything except be a woman because men are better suited for that role. So what do we have here all told just to summarize? We have a bunch of insulting generalizations and stereotypes along with a huge misunderstanding about the nature of women and the desires of heterosexual men. That's what we have. And that in fact is what the whole of left-wing gender theory is built upon. Other than that, great content."
