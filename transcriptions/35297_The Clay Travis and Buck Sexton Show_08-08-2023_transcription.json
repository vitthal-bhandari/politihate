    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast Welcome back to clay and buck we have Steven Miller with us now former senior white house advisor and a man who knows policy both legal and border and everything in between Like the back of his hand Steven. Thanks for joining us Thank you so much great to be here today. So we've got homeland security committee field hearing today going on down in uh in texas democrats as i understand it have pulled out of this at the last minute and They're saying for example. This is representative mark green Who talked about how there is an app where you if you're an illegal who comes into america right now You fill out the app and you get parole as soon as you fill it out play it Why would secretary my arkis want to do away with the judiciary? Why would he want to subvert laws written by this body the con the congress? It's because they want more people to come into the country and now their solution is an app where whomever fills it out Just automatically gets parole when they show up at the crossing site That is in total contravention to what the laws pass by congress about how people are to enter this country I can see it now some drug cartel coyote. Hey for an additional fee will fill the app out for you Is there really an app for that Steven? There most certainly is and chairman green explained it correctly when you said this whole administration is objective is to get as many people into the country as Possible is that simple as that straightforward anybody has been following this for two years to understand is that in 2020 with the policy of the trump administration and I know because I implemented that policy To detain and deport all the legal board across earth so we would meet on a regular basis with the whole Management structure of cbp board patrol and ice to reiterate this over and over and over again If you apprehend legal immigrant you use every single available policy tool at your disposal under no circumstances Are they allowed to leave a detained setting? To be able to walk freely on us soil and so we saw as a result record low numbers in 2020 Biden comes in in 2021 and he changes the policy From detained at the port to catch and release and it's not even just relief. It's recital I mean you see people as we all know particularly unaccompanied minors being flown to the destination of their choice in the united states So the government is Resettling legal immigrants in the country this new application is a way of expanding that process So you can be an intending legal immigrant You can go onto the smartphone application by the way the fact that you have a smartphone also demonstrates that you're um Definitely not in the kinds of dire straights that are often portrayed You you fill out the application and you show up at a port of entry And you get admitted into the united state of america to live the rest of your life here And these are overwhelmingly going to be Individuals who do not have a high school education or the equivalent of one in the united states they do not have the kinds of Professional skills that are going to make them um financially self-sufficient so it's going to be in the Incredible burden on the u.s. Tax payer is going to subsidize free housing free education free welfare Free food and so on and so forth for decades to come Steven, you know the latest from border patrol chief raul or t's uh earlier this morning and his testimony is that there have been approximately 385,000 known godaways not to include unknown godaways. There's a lot of those two since the fiscal year In october of 2023 So we're looking at approximately this is according to border bident's border patrol chief Says that there are 1.4 million godaways since the start of fiscal year 21 1.4 million not that's not including as we know the whatever it is now six or seven million who have just come into the country and Game the system Who's who are choosing to just let everyone know in this audience because you you know these numbers? You know this reality Who are the people who are choosing to be godaways when they could just otherwise surrender right? I mean there's something going on here yes, well very much so and so The hearing had a lot of explosive revelations and I did watch the hearing in this entirety today And that was indeed one of them. So the number of godaways of course We only measure what we call known godaways and as you mentioned almost 400,000 just in this fiscal year alone And there's this other number that I would estimate personally Is at least as many as the known number of godaways and these are the ones that you don't even know that they escaped Versus the ones that you can estimate escaped because of drone footage and sensor technology Footpath visual observation things of that nature and so Who are these people? Why are they evading so as you mentioned there are enormous number of people who are turn ins or surrenders This would include almost all family units are going to be turn ins All minors in most cases are going to be turn ins because they get automatic resettlement So people 17 and younger and then many nationalities that know there's no deportation to their home country Are going to be turning in as well too. So the godaways are going to have among them Two groups primarily one which is pretty straightforward are going to be Mexican nationals just because For them it's a zero cost proposition. You know you run away you get caught you get sent back you try again So you just you keep trying till you get in And then the other group though is going to be which will of course include some Mexican nationals are going to be people who have criminal records Whether in their home countries or in the united states who have multiple previous deportations Which although I don't think the ministration would apply it which can trigger a felony prosecution Are going to be of course a huge category here are going to be actively smuggling Or transporting narcotics or contraband into the united states And then of course sex trafficking and labor trafficking and things of that nature So you have within that group an enormous amount of criminal activity And that now is all inside of the united states and every state and every city all throughout the country It's being the steven miller former senior advisor to president Donald trump Stephen um, you may have seen this as well That the the dea now according to reporting uh by fox news dea is aware That there are Mexican pharmacies that are selling pills that are laced with fentanyl So now it's we've known for a while that the cartels will try to press pills to look like pharmaceutical grade Uh pills and and then people overdose and there's no quality control and the whole thing is is a disaster for the american people But mexican pharmacies are selling this stuff and of course it's getting across the border to us What can we do about this? Well, but of course they are because the cartels have operational control of vast sloths of territory And if you don't go along with their program, you're going to be killed So if they want pharmacies to uh to manufacture this drug and just should be united states Nothing exactly what's going to happen What you do of course is is exactly what we did do in 2020 And then what president trump has further proposed doing which obviously is you need to treat the cartels as a as an unlawful enemy combatant With all of that entails and then you also need the united states navy To blockade the seas where the drugs are being transported into mexico From areas further to the south including of course, uh, south america and the uh, the united states board of patrol needs to have a policy of 100 Deportation and we're applicable 100 percent prosecution And so you have to place completely field up between ports of entry and then you have the military engaging With the cartels to do what we need to be done in terms of kinetic activity And at the end of the day we just have to realize that There's not a single foreign threat on the face of the earth That comes even close to these cartels in terms of the loss of american life No one no one even approaches that no one even gets close And yet the united states military is engaged in nation building activities and and Proportantly peacekeeping activities all throughout the planet And our southern border is where the greatest threat emanates and lies that is untouched in fact It is actively aided by this administration Stephen how can we address the issue of uh, the asylum? Claims that are being made and and the open door that that has created Uh, what would be you know, what is within statute or within the executive branch's discretion? We know bide is not going to do this right? This is more of a look toward 2024 When maybe there'll be an administration hopefully that will decide to do something about this But how how can the? False asylum loophole be closed It's actually very straightforward to do so one of the common misconceptions that people have Um, and that is repeated On a fun item by by many Is that anyone who enters the country legally has a quote right to make it a asylum claim And then to be released if that claim is deemed to be plausible or credible in some way Uh, that is not true In fact, there are multiple tools that already exist in federal law that would invalidate those claims the one of those of course is title 42 which Was pioneered and implemented by the trump administration and invalidated Hundreds of thousands of asylum claims, right? That's the pandemic authority, right? That's the se that's the cdc pandemic You can't come in here authority, right? And so that authority is a is a particularly broad grant of executive authority Then so we use that for example title 42 We use that to solve the problem of unaccompanied minors So when we would get a minor from say or say 15 or 16 minors 16 17 years old from hady That uh under the current administration would be sent to hhs helping human services And then relocated wherever they want to go be it, you know, New York Cincinnati, los angeles. What have you? Uh, we would call the local government in hady and we would say get your social workers ready We've got a plane coming in tomorrow with 17 Miners and we would use title 42 to do that and and it would work quite seamlessly and that numbers Drop to almost nothing Uh, then you have what's called safe third agreements which in statute it says and if they're in black and white that that one of the categorical bars to asylum eligibility Is if another country Is willing to take you so you could even be eligible for asylum like fully eligible And even then but by any definition so you could be somebody who who has a rock solid claim Which of course you basically never see on the southern border But just hypothetically and you still wouldn't be able to get asylum in the united states Because of other countries agreed to take you so when we left the white house in 2020 We had safe third agreements with all three northern triangle countries I'll solve it or guadamala and honduras and so anyone who applied for asylum. We could just say to them Your claim is not Receivable in the united states you can choose to withdraw and go home or you can choose to be flown to honduras Or guadamala or al-salvador and you can apply for asylum in one of those countries because the thing to remember about asylum is that The whole premise of it That you're being politically persecuted in your home country It's not an escape hatch from violence or from poverty If half the world is living in one of those two conditions or both at any given moment in time So if you are asking for asylum All that means is you want to go somewhere where you're not going to be politically persecuted So if you've invented some fantastical tale of political persecution in hady But it's okay great. Well whoever's persecuting in hady I'm sure doesn't live in guadamala. So by all means go there And that is that is a complete solution to be a father fraud issue So I would just say that in 2025 you number one you put in place your robust network of safe third agreements all over the country And then you get congress to amend title 42 to be a a catch all authority Uh for border management and not just tied to public health Steven miller everybody the guy knows the border backwards and forwards and something we need to fix Steven.

This is an unusual thing when when it is going terribly By all measures by all indicators and the people in charge Are happy about it That's jet now. I know some of you saying all they want to collapse the economy and everything else I'm Nancy Pelosi likes being rich. She wants to they want to collapse the economy for you But they want to make sure that you know they destroy the entire us currency I got news for you. We've all got a lot of problems. It reminds me um for the ancient uh the ancient history Um folks out there. We have to come up with that term than calling people who like history nerds. We're not nerds We're history athletes, you know history cool people um, but the uh the coinage of the this is famous and if you go to uh In you know lectures from the you know the mezes institute and you go back milton freedman fans and everything else ancient rome at its absolute height of power would have been now some people are going to argue with me about this But essentially the the reign of the emperor cesar agostus Um that would be when you reach its absolute peak and that's when you had Around then roughly you had the coinage of the denarius Or denarii I guess is what the aplura would be which was the roman silver actually I think the the coinage of the denarii started uh Well before that but it reached its you know the the roman empire reached its total peak And they were having these uh they minted these silver coins the denarius And it went from being I think a hundred percent pure silver over the course of a couple of hundred years to You know 70 silver 50 percent silver and then by the end it was like fought history aficionados producer alleys says That makes us sound fancy Like we're light in a hundred dollar bills on fire with our fancy cigars talking about history Although maybe that's cool if you were starting a history club that might be a good way to go But the the denarius Was debased as a precious metal coin Over the course. This is the bottom line. Okay. I'm just going from memory here So pardon me if i'm getting some of the dates I think they might have even started coinage of the denarius during the second puneic war one of the most fascinating uh military historical periods you could ever find Hannibal crossing the Alps people always talk about all the elephants he crossed with actually Didn't cross it very many because the elephants died. It turns out they don't really want to be in the uh, you know the european Alps for very long anyway, but the coinage was destroyed and the roman empire Essentially collapsed along with it, but you know what they made sure to do the whole time To pay the bureaucrats and to pay the military That was the one thing that they knew they had to keep doing and raise their pay and raise their pace The bureaucrats and the people who worked for the state that kept getting in the military because you need to control the population They kept getting their pay raised over time. There are lessons from history about inflation my friends Uh, the us dollar if it were backed by silver.

That's mantis x dot com Always be wary when the left is making an argument along the lines of Why are you making such a big deal of it? Why are you so focused on this? You're obsessed with this. It doesn't happen that often We're not pushing this This tells us more about you than it does about origin at think any version of that uh, it's just gaslighting Which is very common these days And they're doing it on a range of issues, but the place where you'll see it. I think in the most uh obvious the most obvious cases would be on issues of gender well, they're now calling gender equality Um or the transgender agenda, right? So we have up in vermont and I always say this vermont is for me a place That we we should have seen this coming and and should have done something to keep well to prevent vermont from becoming the uh left wing haven in new england that it is a lot of people from new york new jersey in kenetiquette who Had very Leftist tendencies figure well, you know, I can get more land and cheaper cheaper cost of living etc all moved to vermont So you know bernie sanders for example at brooklynite new yorker Who moved to and now is the senator from vermont? It's a beautiful state. I I love it I used to spend summers there. I used to go to camp in vermont. So I think vermont's Lovely, uh, well in the summers at least i've never been in the winter. I'm not a skier so it's not as Appealing to me, but vermont has a situation unfolding the mid vermont christian school um a few weeks ago It's high school basketball team forfeited a playoff game You all know where this is going the christian school mid vermont christian school forfeited the playoff game because the opposing team Had a transgender player as in a teenage, uh, you know an adolescent male Who wants to play against women's basketball players Or you know teenage girl basketball players. I'm not sure if they're they could be 18. They could be 16 I think it's uh, they're varsity. They're probably All the anyway, so we'll say roughly 16 to 18 years of age is what we're talking about here And and by the way, any of you who have well, I was going to say who have kids But just anybody who has has eyes knows that by the time boys get to 13 14 years old and puberty uh hits their strength speed musculature Everything is very different from girls Right, so it's you know at at uh earlier ages the differences are still pronounced but are not You know super pronounced And then they get into their teenage years and all of a sudden Um, it's quite different. I mean it's any guy who played high school sports knows if you then went to college And you know scrimmaged on like a coed team and you came up against You know all american women in your sport you you realize men have a huge advantage over women Right even now. I just mean in a recreational setting Um, so here's where we are The mid vermont christian school said they would not participate in this game And now they have to be punished You see This is heresy in the democrat stronghold of vermont you're not allowed Um, and this is they're saying this is a violation of a gender discrimination So The school this christian school has had its affiliation in the athletic league that it is in canceled They say that the mid vermont christian school violated The organization's policies against gender discrimination And they said they're no longer able to be members in this league Uh, so this just goes to show you How committed the left is to this it's not enough remember they just forfeited So they're not even taking action beyond saying look we're just not going to play against a Trans we're not going to play against the team that has a transgender student look i'm a 41 year old man If i decided that i was actually an eighth grader And that i wanted to play eighth grade basketball i would hope I would hope that all of the parents on that eighth grade basketball team that i was going to play against would say This is not fair. This is crazy and we're not going to allow it We're not going to allow it. I mean i remember i used to make the argument many years ago That and i'm talking about 2000 when i first started in radio so 12 gosh 12 years ago now Maybe i'll 10 11 years ago. I said what about transgender because this was when the beginnings of the transgender athlete thing was becoming really really uh A debate. I said what about uh combative sports. What about mma and sure enough within Short period after having these discussions on and by the the left then their gaslighting then was that'll never happen Nobody will want to do that. There's no transgender man who wants to fight against women the mma actually there are And in one case uh the individual just just watching The fight between the the biological man and the women in the in the cave and it's horrific It's wrong. It's unethical. It's gross And yet the left they they won't budge on this stuff Their argument is crazy. So they're going to keep making crazy arguments In fact, I don't even really have an argument. What is the argument here? That there's gender discord you have gender segregated sports But it's gender discrimination To insist that the gender segregated sports are actually segregated by gender That is what is happening in vermont right now the the vermont you know athletic association involved the state of vermont the democrat apparatus there They're all in favor of punishing this team is of course is a christian school too, which is great That gets extra extra points For slapping down a christian school, you know, that gets the left really excited godless commies So You look at this and you say what exactly Are the rules? I mean, i'm just wondering and the the state of vermont right now Um, and the you know looking at that the vermont i'm trying to find the name of this uh, this entity That is banning them whatever, but uh, the vpa vermont public athletic association, I guess I don't know something like that. I don't know the vermont principles association the vermont principles association um, they're official policies that if you live in the state of vermont and And an 18 year old boy wants to play um Basketball against your 18 year old daughter If she has a problem with that She better shut up and if she gets an elbow to the face from this you know from this guy and is you know Swinging his elbows around he's got it. You know the the probably a little bit of a beard growing That's her problem You notice they always try to make this about kindness But actually what they're doing is trying to rely on the desire that people Who who are traditional in their view of gender to be kind So that the people on the left can do vicious things This is wrong. This is absurd. It's also a slap in the face to women's athletics What what is the point of this? Right. What is the what is the rationale behind it exactly as you know? It's the eradication of gender and even more than that It is to force you to bend the knee to insanity if they can make you affirm obvious lies They can make you believe and affirm anything They own you psychologically if they can make you say hey, there's no problem here So it's an 18 year old guy that decided he was a woman I don't know a few months ago and he wants to play against women's basketball. This is great This is progress And by the way, there are a lot of democrat parents Who go along with this a lot of Biden voters go along with this because that is what the herd demands of them But yeah up in Vermont right now, that's what you're up against We're also going to talk in the third hour by the way about Wellesley college It's a women's college, but is it though? Is it a women's cup because the students there wanted to be open to not only transgender women but non-binary individuals Which I feel like that leaves a lot of It's a lot of open territories and we'll talk we'll talk about this. We'll talk about this. Oh, yes Oh, and also Lindsey Graham had some thoughts on What we should do about Russian planes I South Carolina. I love South Carolina.

Can we play mr Senator graham's comments on this one they shot down our drone What should our answer be? Well, we should hold them accountable and say that if you ever get near another u.s. Set flying in international waters Your airplane would be shot down. What would ronald reagan do right now He would start shooting russian planes down if they were threatening our assets american foreign policies in freefall Oh Boy, it just started shooting russian planes down to see how that one goes just start shooting those planes out of the sky Look i get it right there is a A provocation here the russians, but it is a drone. We did not have loss of life and we have to be very uh Very serious About how we view the long-term consequences of these things. I just think the problem with trying to prevent a Slide into massive conflict in a situation like you crane Is that there's an inherent? Incrementalism and the other side the people that want more and more involvement use that to their advantage It's oh, what's the big deal? We're just going to do a little more. We're just going to send a little bit more more advanced weapon systems more of those systems More intelligence support more you name it We're not going to we're not going to get to this point that you're worried about But the problem is You have a momentum to these conflicts And once you start getting too far involved in the first place It is the unexpected it's kind of like how the economy can just all of a sudden almost fall off a cliff, right? Well, there are the systemic issues that you talk about. Hey guys the debt inflation we're spending too much We have too much inflation or rather we have too much debt and and the inflation problem is going to get worse But you hear that every day and people go, you know, they'll figure it out I guess and then you know tune it out you get used to paying high, you know higher prices for all these different things in the stores You figure it'll eventually it'll go away Um, but so people tune it out. I think that there's a lot of tuning out of the voices that are saying What are we doing in Ukraine exactly? There is no chance this conflict is going to end on its own because of a Russian battlefield defeat Before the next election. I mean in my mind it is it is a fantasy to think That that's going to happen and and in fact we could see depending on how the next Six months ago you could see some pretty substantial territorial losses by the Ukrainian defenders. I don't know I don't pretend to be able to Assess the battlefield moves that are going on here This is not a conflict that I've seen up close and personal myself as other conflicts. I have Certainly from a strategic, you know analyst level Uh, and so I look at this and I say well When are we going to say that there are some things right now the The red line seems to be that we won't put us troops in harm's way Is that the only thing that we won't do? Because if we're going to keep sending a hundred billion dollars a year And if we're going to have senators remember lizzy gram also said maybe somebody could just take poutine out I don't understand. I don't understand why republicans listened to this man on foreign policy issues I've never heard him say anything that wasn't yeah hold them accountable and do something aggressive All right. Well one is is it actually going to result in accountability by the way the answer is no Putin doesn't care but two The notion that we would start shooting russian planes and pilots out of the sky Over an incident like this is reckless. It's a reckless thing to say. It's it's a it's a foolish thing to say And I I watch some of the republican voices on this on this issue And you heard you oh, I should say you saw what trump put out and what de santis put out on ukraine which I think were Even-handed and and nuance on both counts I think that there was a sensibility trump is like we got to negotiate this thing. We got to get it done As as quickly as we can we got to stop the bullets from flying the missiles from flying over there de santis's position In summary is more we just got to make sure that it doesn't become a huge problem for america We got to focus on our own issues here in the southern border and limit our involvement in what's going on in ukraine But I hear other republicans say if if russia loses in I'm sorry if uh if ukraine loses and russia were to um Take I don't know half the country or maybe all the country under into its domain That the next step would be a russian invasion of poland and trigger article five of nato And I hear this and I say how Look at the trouble that russia is having in ukraine which I would note is a Territorial and strategic interest of the russian federation in a very real way This is not make but they didn't just decide this recently that that's been the case for a long time not saying the invasion is anything other than uh wrong morally and and belligerent but it matters to russia and has matter to russia Every single day since the collapse of the soviet union. This has never been a oh, it's not a big deal for us thing um the future of ukraine and This idea that they would go and invade poland next how is that? I mean if you're if you're having trouble winning the High school jv basketball game, but maybe you're able to sort of squeak it out in the end Then you're going to take on an nba team next. I mean I just I don't understand the logic of this position at all other than it tries to silence people who say we should be very cautious about getting too Into this conflict in europe that is it they keep saying there's a a core american interest at stake here What exactly is that the future of ukraine and regime the future of the ukraine regime is a core american interest I I'm not saying i'm not open to hearing about this stuff from the other side of the debate, but Let's not just throw around. We're going to shoot russian planes out of the sky. I am asking that"
