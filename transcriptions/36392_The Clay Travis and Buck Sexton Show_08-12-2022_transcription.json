Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Joe Biden has done it again. The man who everything he touches turns to crap has made one of the worst trades in the history of trades. Giving up the merchant of death Victor Boot, a man who was, if you talk and buck you can probably speak to this very well about exactly what this guy did given your CIA background, but a man who spread Russian weaponry around the world. He was able to see the American government and the American government that's a great deal around the globe to allow internal and external conflicts to be far more violent and deadly than they might have otherwise been without the heavy armament that he was able to sell in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Back to Russia where he will probably immediately begin. I would bet Buck working to get as much men and material as he possibly can to help the Ukraine invasion and also to continue to ferment global instability by allowing warlords to buy the biggest possible weapons that he can provide for them. And in exchange, the United States has got Brittany Griner, a WNBA player who was arrested for breaking Russian law as it pertains to drugs and who famously has said that America basically is an awful place, refused to stand for the national anthem, denigrated her home country, and yet Joe Biden has made this trade left behind former Marine Paul Wayland, whose family has put out multiple statements, but Wayland himself to the credit of CNN, they actually managed to do some journalism and they have a quote from Paul Wayland, who is still, he's been four years now. Let me just read the direct quote. I'm greatly disappointed more hasn't been done to secure my release, especially as the four year anniversary of my arrest is coming up. I was arrested for a crime that never occurred. I don't understand while I'm still sitting here. But Brittany Griner admitted that she had violated Russian law by having a small residue, I believe, of cannabis in a vape pen. If I'm removing that. She's oil in a vape pen that she says she inadvertently packed on her trip to go to Russia to play for a professional team in Russia before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. All right, so Victor boot, you were in the CIA. This is a guy that 60 minutes ran stories on at the time. I believe I'm correct in this. He was alongside of Osama bin Laden bin Laden as one of the most wanted criminals in the world from an American perspective. We arrested him. We convicted him. We had him in prison. And now Russia has got him back in exchange for the release of Brittany Griner. For people out there who may not know Victor boot, what would you say about his reputation? I mean, when you're when you're your signifier, when your nickname is the merchant of death. That and for those of you out there, what was the Nicholas Cage movie? Lord of War. So it's actually one of the better Nicholas Cage movies. It's pretty straightforward how this guy Victor boot did what he did. I also hear people pronounce it about by the way, but whatever. We'll just go with boot for now. And somebody could yell at us and tell us that our Russian pronunciation is terrible. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, you had a massive military apparatus that no longer had a place really to go and didn't know what to do. And he had some connections. And this is pretty well laid out in the Nicholas Cage movie, which I will say is, as I think, worth the watch. And he just said effectively, I'm going to take the old tanks, Kalashnikovs, missile launchers, whatever we got here, sell them on the open market. Now, the reason that's such a, that's such a problem from the US and Western perspective is, I mean, he would sell it to anybody. Right. I mean, if you were running a militia that was lapping off prisoners heads and murdering, you know, women and children in parts of Africa that were in the midst of a civil war, Victor about would sell you your weapons, right? He would sell you guns. And so that was why he got so high up on the radar in the US. He was arrested. And I do think this is relevant because on the one hand you look at the scale of the trade here, Brittany Griner, vape pen, cannabis oil residue, you know, people keep saying she broke Russian law. They grabbed her as a piece of leverage to use against the United States. It was not a, she wasn't caught with a kilo of cocaine, which some, by the way, some travelers, we see these shows, you know, I was talking about this. It's the same thing where he was like, I was on all the day in Spain and some bloke gave me a kilo of cocaine. I thought, Oh, I'll make so much money. And then all of a sudden the guys in some prison in Pakistan and like we're supposed to, you know, broke down pallets and other good movie starring Claire Danes basically. Same same same same same idea where they had the death penalty for drugs smuggling. So, you know, there's some complexity there, but bout, bout was, does everyone here say boot? I should have gotten that we should have squared this way beforehand. Whatever point being Victor, the merchant of death, the merchant of death, which was his name, he was caught in a sting operation set up by the US to sell shoulder-fired missiles. I believe there were stinger missiles made famous by the US provision of the US. So, they're going to bring them to the Afghan Mujahideen and the Soviet Afghan war. The heat-seeking shoulder-fired man-pad, man-portable air-defense system that can bring down planes very easily, especially on take-off and landing. He was caught in a sting selling them to a Marxist group in Columbia, the FARC, and I won't try to do that in Spanish, but it's a Spanish acronym. It's something where's a revolution, arrays, or whatever. The DA sting, the DA officers posing as FARC members, US DA officers, obviously, that they're going to shoot down some planes that have Colombian and US officials. Joury didn't like that in the US, understandably, and he got 25 years for essentially aiding a terrorist organization, delivering these anti-air, intended to deliver these anti-aircraft missiles, and conspiracy to kill Americans. So, the trade here is, WNBA player has less than a gram of hashish oil deep in her baggage on a trip to Russia for a guy who made civil wars with massive carnage, much worse, and was trying to sell missile launchers to bring down planes full of Americans and Colombians, and that is the trade the Biden administration has made. Some are pointing out already, probably not as bad, actually, as the Obama trade of Bo Bergdahl for the five senior Taliban officials, some of whom went straight into running the Taliban again, by the way. Yeah. But a bad deal, a bad deal. Here's Randy Weingarten, our good friend, the idiot teacher's union head who kept your kids out of school for multiple years. She tweets, and she said the quiet part out loud as she often does because she's an imbecile. What a great relief. Extraordinary news. A basketball star. And let me just say, calling Brittany Griner a basketball star is an exaggerated version of basketball star, right? I still don't know what team she plays for. I'm not kidding. Nobody. Like I'm sitting here. I don't believe there is hardly a WNBA star period. She is not a basketball star. She is probably the 1200th most famous person who plays basketball. That puts you pretty far down the list. But listen to this tweet, Buck. What a great relief. Extraordinary news. A basketball star. But also a gay black woman is released. You see, actually, and really, this is what the Biden administration's identity politics leads us to. The reason why Brittany Griner is out, and such, in my opinion, an awful trade. Russia is getting someone who is probably going to lead to many people who would otherwise be alive dying because of his arms dealing. And we are getting back somebody who's a mediocre WNBA player at this point. And then people are pointing out right away, what about Paul Whalen? And I always, you know, when I've done, I've done Fox hits, for example, on the Brittany Griner arrest and issue. And I always bring up Paul Whalen. And I never forget to bring up his name because we have to keep his name out there. It's a former Marine who is held on totally bogus espionage charges by the Russians. That starts, look, we can, they're going to say that, so the complexity here is the Russians say, oh, that's a totally different universe. There's so much more serious what he did. And of course, we're saying, no, you are just holding this guy as a tool to use for a trade for real Russian spies in the US, basically. This is their get out of jail free card for an actual Russian committing espionage, or rather committing real espionage in the US. But when you look at this negotiation, it's hard not to feel like there was so much more interest from the Biden administration to free Brittany Griner. And Paul Whalen, I think has gotten a 15 or 20 year sentence, and he's already several years into it. Now his family got to give all the facts here. Understandably Clay has said they support the release of Brittany Griner, and they hope people remember what's going on with Paul Whalen. I mean, what else can they say? Exactly. I mean, that's what I mean. But I'm just, anybody that you point this out to this, they say, well, the family, the family supports it. Of course, they want, you know, their father, their husband, they want Paul Whalen. They're not going to blast Joe Biden at this point, because the best way to get him back is to say exactly what they were saying. So, you know, but the focus, I'm just going to say this, this administration was more motivated to get Brittany Griner out than Paul Whalen. Full stop. I mean, that is the truth of this administration. Let's be honest. We've got a cut. We'll find out how 60 minutes is pronouncing his name, Buck. If you don't know who Victor. I think it's about. I'm going to go about. You're going to go. We're rolling the dice here. I don't remember. I just got a clip earlier today because I wanted to familiarize myself and I shared it on social. So if I'm wrong, I not only watched it, but then mispronounced it after watching it. But this is 60 minutes. This is a cut explaining who exactly this guy is. This is from several years ago. But listen, Victor Bood in my eyes is one of the most dangerous men on the face of the earth. On the face of the earth without a doubt. Mike Braun, the former chief of operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told us Boot first exploded on the scene in War Torn West Africa in the late 1980s. Elevating bloody conflicts from machetes and single shot rifles to AK-47s, not by the thousands, but by the tens of thousands. So he weaponizes civil war in Africa. He transformed these young adolescent warriors into insidious, mindless, maniacally driven killing machines that operated with assembly line efficiencies. There you go. That's what, Boot, but that is where he is. It is Boot. Come on. Golf clap for Clay on the pronunciation. Not usually a pronunciation star of the show. I'm supposed to be fancy with pronunciations over here, especially of the foreigners. And I missed, I whiffed on this one. So the larger, I think, question that is at play here, Buck, and I would just let everybody think about this. If Joe Biden actually thought Americans were going to support this trade, he would have made it before the midterms. Just think about this. I mean, if it can happen in December, three weeks after the midterms, if it can happen a couple of days after the Herschel Walker versus Raphael Warnock run off, he would have made this trade. If he thought Americans were going to respond to it in a favorable way, I think before the midterms. I'm feeling kind of cynical about a lot of things in politics these days. Anyone really going to change their vote, but you know what I mean? Based on this, I don't think this White House really cares. I get it, but I think the reaction, I've been actually encouraged that so many people have said, you know, this is ridiculous. We're giving them a violent murderer effectively, and we're getting back a mediocre WNBA basketball player. Like that is not a rush of balance. Now I'll also point this out because you will come across this argument that at different times the Israelis with the Palestinians have traded hundreds to one, you know, foreign Israeli soldier, for example, or an Israeli citizen. And now, but they do that for very purposefully to suggest to show they value the life, you know, they want their people back and they value life at a very high level. So they're willing to make that trade to get back, for example, and I may also I don't know. You may know better than me. I bet that Israelis have far more Palestinians in prison than Palestinians do Israelis. That's an interesting question, actually. But I haven't, you know, I haven't looked at the numbers. I would imagine the terrorists and but they have a long history of prisoner swaps. And the Israelis make a point of, okay, you know, if you know, you want you want 50 terrorists back, but you're going to give us back our IDF soldier on harm that you have in captivity. You know, this is dealing with Hamas and dealing with, you know, Islamic Jihad, the Israeli say fine. So I just I tell you this just so everybody, you know, your your liberal neighbor Bob may come up to you and be like, well, you know, the Israelis and, you know, I just want everyone to be aware of how these arguments about prisoner swaps go. We remember the Bo Bergdahl thing where they had Bo Bergdahl to the White House, Obama administration. And they were all saying, Oh, look at, look at how great this is. And then you had all these soldiers come out who were like, this guy walked off post. Yeah, he deserted. Basically. And and we, you know, we're risking other people's lives trying to find him. And now you trade five Taliban members for him. He's here. We'll talk about this a little bit more. I'm curious what you would say about this buck. My concern is we've now emboldened every foreign adversary we have to hold any American who commits a minor violation or maybe he doesn't even commit a violation at all as a bargaining chip because they know that Biden under political pressure will make a move like this. Certainly that's the argument why we don't negotiate with terrorists over the stuff. Although Taliban, we do actually negotiate with terrorists hate to be the one who points out the reality that makes these cute phrases for people to say less, less comfortable or more complicated. But we'll, we'll get into more of that. And a whole bunch of other stories come up here in a second, but you know, I'm going shooting tomorrow, folks.

Media not all that interested in it because I think we're going to find out that he was paying off all sorts of folks. Clay, you might have seen Elon Musk said that Sam Bankman freed. Remember this guy built this crypto exchange and he's just like, oh, there's like billions of dollars missing. Yeah. What happened? I don't know if you billiate whoopsie and they're not really concerned about this in the media. It seems because I think they were getting money, but did you see that now the post is New York post? Can we just say the good post instead of the bad one, the Washington Post, New York Post reporting that he was trying to negotiate a deal to sponsor. They call her a Taita. Yeah, Taylor Swift, Taita, a hundred million dollar deal. Because I think he realizes you sponsor Taylor Swift. Libs won't prosecute you no matter what you do. You could be selling nuclear weapons to Victor boot and they will prosecute you. Whoever advised Taylor Swift kept her out of millions of dollars of legal fees here because all the celebrities that have FTX deals are going to get sued in a big way. I also saw Maxine Waters now is saying, oh, we don't need to bring a SBF in front of Congress. No. Hopefully convenient how little Democrats are going after him. Yeah, I'm just saying. You have 40 million dollars, Buck. You provide yourself a little bit. I think it's a lot more than that, by the way, when they really tabulate it may well be. By the way, story coming out about the Washington Redskins, Washington commanders and the cover up there. Dan Snyder, this is a little bit of a mess. Just popped a minute ago. How about saving money to go into the new year? How about getting hooked up with a new pure talk deal for you and your family? You could save 7, 8, 900. Who knows how much given what you're paying a year just by joining our friends at PureTalk? Nothing but great news. You can keep your same phone number. You can keep your same phone or you can upgrade and get a new phone if you would like. But grab your cell phone, save your family up to $900 a year, maybe even more, by dialing pound 250 right now. Say Clay and Buck and you get an additional 50% off your first month. That's pound 250 say Clay and Buck. You can switch in 10 minutes. PureTalk simply smarter. Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck's accident show. I was kind of laughing about the idea of there being a WNBA star in the first place because the WNBA is so wildly unpopular in the country at large. It basically exists entirely as a function of the NBA being woken up to claim that there is a marketplace that is substantial enough to pay WNBA players. But I thought this was funny, Buck. Van Jones was on CNN already breaking down what a huge win. Whitney Greiner is to get back to the United States. He says that she is a black female icon. I just want you to hear this. This president got it done. He cared enough about this individual person to get her home. It was shocking. I think for young Americans to see an icon like that snatched, locked up, treated like garbage and just nine years, 10 years for bringing some cannabis oil. These are decades defining images. I guarantee you they're going to be young people 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now who will remember this moment because she is an icon. It's really, really extraordinary. People got to talk about, oh, well, this other guy, he's so terrible. Now what? There's a lot of terrible people in the world. There's a lot of terrible people in Russia, but what you don't have and what you can't allow to happen is have a black female icon treated like garbage and America do nothing about it. Okay. So there's a lot. There's a lot to unpack here. First of all, this is about at its core, right? Brittany grinders in America. That's it. She's an American should be should be. That's what I'm saying that this should be we have an American who we believe is being unjustly held. The federal government, the White House is trying to get back one of ours and American all this other stuff that he's bringing up here that banjo's bringing up should not factor into the thinking of the government at all. Yes, you have an American person. You have a US citizen full stop. That's why this matters, right? It's not about, oh, this person, this, that or the other thing. And if we're going to start talking about other characteristics, we do have to talk about the fact that we have a former Marine who is still riding away in prison, Paul Whalen. And I brought up that his family is obviously not being critical, you know, because they're what can they do? Biden's president. I know it's crazy for two more years. So they're saying, well, we're glad Brittany's home. Let's get the focus on to Paul here to bring him home. But, you know, the daily mail, it's heartbreaking. They have a piece up and there's photos of Paul Whalen in prison holding up a note. And he says that he is, he doesn't understand this is Paul Whalen. Now, I don't understand why I'm still sitting here. My bags are packed. And he says it is catastrophic that he has been excluded from the Brittany Griner prisoner swap. And he's obviously deeply disappointed and says he's serving a, I said 15 to 20 16 year sentence for what he says is quote, I was arrested for a crime that never occurred. I don't understand why I'm still sitting here. My bags are packed. I'm ready to go home. I just need an airplane to come and get me. It's quite obvious that I'm being held hostage. Yeah. I know. Now here's going to be the real test. Is the Biden administration going to use the same degree of focus and energy in trying to get this former Marine? Remember, Brittany Griner broke the law. She did break the law. She didn't even bite it. She said I broke the law. She's like, yeah, I messed up. I broke the law. She says that. So she broke the law. Okay. By all claims on the US side, including Paul Whalen's own claims, did nothing wrong. Did nothing illegal whatsoever. And you'd have to wonder, well, why is it that this administration would be less focused on bringing, you know, it's either Americans or Americans. And if that's the case, by the way, isn't shouldn't it be a first in first out policy? You would think you would think. And if we're going to start doing the who should the government focus on more, I think the Marine should get, you know, the person who served his country and was willing to put his life on the line. First country should get extra points. I don't think that there should be extra points awarded for famous, you know, kind of athlete. I don't think that that really should qualify. So we are seeing some decisions being made here by the Biden administration that obviously we're criticizing it. And I think you're going to see that Paul Whalen starts slipping through the the cracks again. And it's just wrong, man. It's just wrong. Let's also point out Van Jones on CNN said that Brittany Griner was a black female icon. Okay. Beyonce is a black female icon. Okay. You might even say Michelle Obama is a black female icon. Michelle Obama Oprah. I mean, there are, you know, these are black people you can describe as that. Brittany Griner is not one, but to justify Joe Biden making this decision by saying Brittany Griner is a black female icon. If you said on CNN buck, Joe Biden had to go do this because this guy is a white male icon. First of all, you wouldn't be allowed to say it and it would be considered super racist to even mention, right? Like so who's a white male icon? Brad Pitt. All right. I don't want you to say Clay Travis there. I mean, look at you. I don't think I'm not on the icon level. Brad Pitt. Let's say, is that fair? Would you agree? That would be a white male icon. I mean, this conversation is going to get really interesting. Yeah, sure. All right. Tom Brady. Tom Brady, if you want to say athlete, white male icon, if you said that on CNN, you might get canceled. They'd be like, this is totally unacceptable. And also if that person got out, they would say, Oh, this is an example of white privilege. Well, being described as a black female icon is an awful lot of black privilege, I think, for Brittany Greiner here. And building on your point, which we talked touched on a little bit to start the show here, Buck, I mean, she denigrated America, refused to stand for the anthem, has taken shot pot shots at the country for years. And we got her out within a year. And the guy who actually served his country as a Marine and didn't even commit a crime, at least not a crime that he's admitted to, whereas she committed a crime. And yet, Brittany Greiner gets out and Paul Whalen does not. I think that strikes a lot of people as flat out wrong. And that doesn't even contemplate the trade itself that was made. You know, this is like back in the day when the Minnesota Vikings fleeced, got fleeced by the Dallas Cowboys for her show Walker. I'm sorry to bring it up for all of our Minnesota listeners. And Jimmy Johnson built an entire, an entire dynasty around the picks that he got for her show Walker back in the day in the Minnesota Vikings. Well, you know, sorry, Minnesota Vikings have still not won. And I'm feel sorry for all my Viking fans out there because Minneapolis is a great city. And I know you guys are driving around and you're like, Hey, we're having a pretty good year this year. And then out of nowhere, boom, I'm off the top rope, just wiping out Viking fans. But you well remember that trade back in the early nineties. That's how Russia feels right now. They just fleece the country and I'll point out two other things here, Buck. If you truly care about gun control, maybe don't release the largest gun dealer in the entire world criminal drug deal. I mean, how does this trade look? By the way, how does this trade look? I mean, take a step back for a second of the Taliban five released for Bo Burghdahl by Obama, right? And then and then they had a whole ceremony too. They were like, look at us. We're amazing. The Bob administration gets it done. A couple of those Taliban seen these are seen. And some one of them was the basically the equivalent of the minister of defense for the Taliban. Okay. It's like the secretary of defense for the Taliban was in custody. Let him go. Went right back into the battlefield, right back into helping the Taliban. In this context, this trade looks bad right now. What does this trade look like? If in the next three years, an airplane comes down somewhere around the world, shot down with a man pad provided to them by Victor boot, who still has the same connections and the same, same modus operandi that he had in the past. I'm just saying it could get even worse as a tool. And and by the way, how about just contemplating it in the larger context of Ukraine right now? Russia is having a great deal of difficulty supplying its armed forces because of all the casualties that they have incurred as a part of this Ukrainian invasion. Are you really telling me that they're not going to put Victor boot back out in his global network of trade to try to add as many supplies to the right. This guy's going to be flying. He's going to be flying C one 30s full of heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. And you name it probably from, you know, North Korea right to the Ukraine battlefield in the blink of an eye. This is what this guy does. It's who he is. I mean, so not only is it a bad trade in terms of what this guy can do when you look at the specific aspects of probably no one puts more guns into the overall global arsenal than this guy and in the middle of a war, we are giving back to Russia, potentially the greatest asset to the Russian army that we could find on the global marketplace. And I know, look, it also shows you the imbalance of this trade shows you that the all the bluster from the Biden administration, let's not forget it. It was earlier this year still, all the bluster about we're going to cripple their economy and our sanctions and you know what? Yeah. Well, apparently we like bagged for a totally imbalanced trade from the Russians almost a almost a year into this war and all the sanctions and all the diplomacy and all the things that we were going to use to bring the Biden administration was going to use to bring Russia to its knees. Not so much. Not so much. I think that's I think that's self evident at this point. But let's take a moment here and think about a gift you could give yourself or somebody that you really care about that would benefit them all year round. I was just talking yesterday in the show about how, you know, you don't want to give somebody another lumpy sweater. You know, yeah, it's a thought that counts, but it's also the gift that counts. Let's be honest. And you can give a gift that defines comfort for anyone who has to sit at a desk like I do like Clay does like so many of you do for hours and hours every day. Think about this. DX chair. It is the finest office chair you're going to find anywhere. It's the one that I sit in right now every day doing this show. Clay does all of his writing in his ex chair and we love them. I've got one for my dad and my sister. The ex chair is the best investment you can make. I mean, seriously, it benefits both your body and your output for your business because you're going to be more productive and more comfortable, less distractions. And with financing available, ex chairs only going to cost you about 20 bucks a month. So for less than a dollar a day, ex chair will make the hour spent at your desk that much more comfortable, my friends and productive. Here is a extra special offer to throw into the mix.

All individual experiences may vary. It's how some people describe shingles. This painful blister and rash can interrupt your life for weeks. It could even force you to cancel social events or weekend plans. Over 99% of adults, 50 years or older already carry the virus that causes shingles. One in three people will get it in their lifetime. Why wait? Ask your doctor or pharmacist about shingles today. There are some areas clay where I can assert a degree of uncredential but absolute expertise. I have the equivalent in my mind, at least, of a PhD in action movies. I grew up. I had VHS tapes that I watched until they were falling apart of all the Schwarzenegger movies, all the all the the Stallone movies. I was more of a Schwarzenegger guy, I'm going to be honest. But young guns with them, I find Emilio Estebes is one of the greatest movies of the 80s. His finest, a very underrated Western for what it is. Young guns also really good. Both of those are rated young guns was an excellent franchise. I think that was there a third one I don't remember now, but also all the all the various martial arts action movies, you know, Van Damme. I celebrated Van Damme's whole catalog and he's a very interesting character as we see later on in life. I bring all of this up because Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence has come out to say that she was the first and you know, like, isn't she from Nashville? What's with all these? Louisville, I believe. Oh, Louisville. Okay. I thought she's a Kentucky. Yeah. So he's a Kentucky close close by. So close by. Yeah. You know, you have to take you and your folks here in that region have to take responsibility for it. I would take all responsibility for SEC state shenanigans. I think that's fair. Yeah. You know, because she's lovely, but her politics, not so good. She spoke at an interview in variety and she said that she will nobody ever put this is the quote nobody ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn't work because we were told girls and boys can both identify with the male lead, but boys cannot identify with a female lead. I'm sorry, but Ripley from Alien and Aliens would like to have a word among other female acts. I'm sorry, Linda Hamilton in term of morning, term of two, you know, if you're going to mouth off and try to get social justice points or whatever, wokeness points, don't don't make it so easy for us. You don't I mean, come on. It's also disappointing. I would say only in the context of if you are a movie buff to say nothing of a movie star, you would think you would have seen aliens in Terminator because they're two of the most iconic films of that of the seven. I think aliens is one of the one of the 10 best action movies of that of that period. Honestly, I think aliens come out like 81. Oh, you know, alien came out. I think it I think aliens was later like 85 or 86, but the team can check for us. But yeah, she was a member of both 19. I was thinking even made it maybe late seventies, but both of those are 1980s or late seventies, iconic films, right? And to not be familiar with those is embarrassing for Jennifer Lawrence who seems totally normal and also simultaneously. Oh, alien didn't come out until 1986. Okay. So that was like later than I thought. I mean, I'm not a I'm not a Quentin Tarantino fan, for example, like I don't like most of his own movies. Yes. Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. Kill Bill, I think is actually his most watchable movie for what it is. And and kill Bill Uma Thurman is excellent. That Lara Croft, Lara as in Mrs. Travis, Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider movies. I mean, there's so many. It's just, but this thing even she's made clay. She's made tens of millions of dollars. And you know, she's one of the genetics lottery. She's quite lovely. And you know, physically. And she's got a wine and complain and make it seem like women have it so hard in films. Really? That's where we're going now? Give me a break. Let me clarify this because we're going to get blown up. Alien came out in 1979. Okay. Aliens came out in 1986, which I believe was the sequel, right? So, so Ripley 1989, the original alien. And I think also aliens, one of the best sequels of all time up there with Terminator two, the Godfather two aliens is an enhancement to the franchise. And fortunately it went substantially downhill from there. I'm still trying to think about all the different women action leads. There've actually been so many of them. It's a willful ignorance. And also I would say this. I don't know who did the interview and who did the story, but this is also an example of just totally, if you're writing about movies, when she said that as the interviewer, there should have been some pushback. And there should have been like, well, you know, Sigourney Weaver, pretty big deal. And you're kind of stepping on Linda Hamilton and what she did in Terminator. Those are big female led action movies. I mean, for some, some folks may even remember from the Conan, the barbarian era, Red Sonya, which I think was a B movie, but she's swinging a sword around and stuff. Hey, I was a big he-man guy. They did bring out Shira to try to appeal to all and they made a movie about it too, I think. Wasn't there, was it the Bionic man or the Bionic woman or was there both? I think they did both. I think they did both too. So this, this is, you know, it's ridiculous. But every clay, it's not enough to be rich and famous. You have to also be beloved for your political stances these days, which is just a shame. Do your kids, by the way, do they, do boys, do they like the Hunger Games? Is that a thing still that people read? We haven't watched any of the Hunger Games. I think those are to be fair, like kind of R-rated, aren't they? I mean, they're pretty vibrant. I think so. I'm having the Hunger Games right now. I'm going to be hungry. I'm going to get a sandwich. It's not a bad move. It's a pretty good movie, by the way, the Hunger Games. It's disappointing because I like Jennifer Lawrence in that thought. It is Ryan here and I have a question for you. What do you do when you win? Like are you a fist-pumper? A woohoo! A hand clap or a high-fiver? I kind of like the high-fiver, but if you want to hone in on those winning moves, check out Chumbakasina.
