    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day. And after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. The gentleman, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mickler. I am the host and founder of this podcast in the public movement. That is for a man. You're new. You're joining us for the first time today. It's Michael to give men the tools and the guidance, the direction, the resources, and of course, within this podcast and conversations, they need to step up more fully within the walls of their homes and their businesses and of course their communities. And frankly everywhere we're showing up as men, I've seen a downward trend, downward spiral towards an effeminate society stripped of any sort of traditional masculinity. And it's my goal to reclaim and restore that and to see you and hear you and your stories and how you're improving your lives is inspiring to me. It's inspiring to millions and millions of other men who have banded with us in this fight. And I couldn't be more honored that you're in this battle with us. So with that said, we've got today's show, which is our Friday Field Notes, where I share some thoughts from throughout my week. But we've also got our interview show where I am interviewing some of the most successful men on the planet. And I'll let you go check out the lineup. But it continues to be pretty inspiring through the conversations that we're having with warriors and scholars and New York Times best-selling authors and entrepreneurs and any man who's having some levels of success in his life. And then we've got the Ask Me Anything where Kip Sorensen, my co-host and I are answering questions from our Facebook group and from our exclusive Brotherhood, the Iron Council. And on that note, guys, of the Iron Council, I do want to share that with you because we're implementing some new programs for rank advancements and improving some aptitude tests to measure how effective we are as men within certain frameworks and certain contexts of the way that we're showing up. If you're looking for some of those frameworks and you're looking for a Brotherhood, some camaraderie and accountability and maybe a little kick in the pants every now and again from the guys who are on the same path as you, that I'd encourage you to check out the Iron Council. It's our digital band of brothers, but these guys are also getting together face-to-face and doing a lot of cool meet-ups and again, holding each other accountable to big and audacious goals, which I think a lot of us have. I don't think you'd be listening to this podcast if that wasn't the case. So check it out and band with us, join with us, orderofman.com slash legacy, orderofman.com slash legacy. So that's all I've got by way of announcements today. I want to get into the conversation. I was thinking about this morning what I wanted to talk with you about and it reminded me as I was thinking of this. I remember to quote that I came across that I know a lot of you are probably familiar with and it's from Jordan Peterson and he says, a harmless man is not a good man. A good man is a very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control. That quote stuck out to me and I think it's stuck out to a lot of guys. Who have heard that and repeated it and shared it and I thought we could talk a little bit more about that today. Specifically what it means to be a dangerous man and then how to make ourselves more dangerous and why this is even important in the first place. And I'm going to take this in a little bit different direction than maybe you would think because obviously we think about martial arts and we think about firearms training and we think about being situationally aware and having some of this training, which, listen, I'm not undermining that. That is critical. I participate in martial arts, specifically Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I've done a lot of firearms training, especially because I've been in the military and had some of that in the past. Situational awareness is huge when I'm out to dinner with my family or at a movie or just in society in general. I'm situationally aware. I've got a firearm with me 99% of the time. So these are things that I think you should be able to develop and tap into and improve your skill set in order to become more dangerous. But the angle that I wanted to take today is how we utilize what I would call quote unquote soft skills to make ourselves more dangerous. And the reason I want to share this with you is because I think it's something that we overlook a lot of the times. When we think about masculinity, we think about being tough and strong and athletic and capable when it comes to martial arts and firearms training. We think about that stuff. And again, that's important, but very rarely do we think about these softer, interpersonal communication and dynamic skills that I'm going to address with you today. So we're going to get into that. But why is it important that we be a dangerous man? We need to talk about that first. Again, that quote is a harmless man is not a good man. That's the first part of it. And let me break that down here for you for just a minute. I think there is too much emphasis in society on being a good man. And what I think ends up happening is we only address the morality of it. All right, we only address the morality of it. You can't really be a harmless man if all you are is good. If you're a good little boy, according to society standards, because it might just be that you're weak. Jordan Peterson says a good man is a very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control, meaning he has the ability to be dangerous and yet voluntarily and consciously decides not to be dangerous, or probably more accurately, use that dangerous skill set that he has in a controlled environment, in the right situation when it's appropriate. So what we see is we see a lot of men who don't have this under control, specifically because they haven't had the male mentors and role models and coaches and fathers to teach them how to harness this raw masculine energy that's coursing through these young boys' veins, and then it comes across as violent and tragic and horrific in a lot of cases as well. So it's our job as men to learn how to control this ability to be aggressive and competitive and violent at times so that we can use it in a controlled manner that it will be more effective and that we'll be using it appropriately, so doing that for ourselves, and then also teaching our young men and the people that we have a responsibility for how to harness those same characteristics to produce effective outcomes for themselves, whether that's get them out of a dangerous situation, a violent encounter, or to face some sort of natural disaster or even a car wreck, or even just something as simple as competitive sports with some guys around town, a pickup game of basketball or softball or whatever it is you're doing, by that way, is to harness the power that you have within you. And that makes you, according to this, what Jordan Peterson would say, a good man, I don't use that term necessarily because I think, again, it comes back to morality only, and that's important, but if it's only morality, we're missing this critical component of it, which is capability. So we've got morality, good man, and then we've got our proficiency at skills, which makes us capable. Good men don't change the world. They might be nice to talk with, and women might like them for a short period of time or put them in the friend zone, but the men who change the world are the ones who are capable of and so when I think about that word capability and I think about dangerous, I think those two things go hand in hand. If you want to be a capable man capable of providing, protecting and presiding, which is our motto, and not just motto, but our way of life, then you need to be willing and able, willing and able to be dangerous in the right set of circumstances. That's why it's so important that we as men learn how to harness this. So, again, martial arts, firearms training, situational awareness, tactical training, a lot of you guys have military training, maybe even some medical training, that stuff's all important, but that's not what this discussion is about today. This discussion is about, again, the quote unquote, soft skills that we need to develop that will allow us to be more dangerous and more capable in order to produce the type of outcomes that we're after and the people who we have a responsibility for are after. So, let's break this down. Now, these aren't in any order necessarily. They're of equal importance, but I think all of us could do well to incorporate this a little bit more in order to make ourselves more dangerous. All right, so number one is develop confidence. Now, I know that this is broad sweeping. I know this is pretty general. I know that most of you realize that you have to develop confidence or have a desire to develop confidence. Guys, it is so critical. I can't tell you how many people I've seen who are so weak and so passive and lack any level of confidence in their lives. And of course, when they're faced with a violent situation or a natural disaster or even just as something as simple as asking for a raise or asking a woman on a date, they have no ability to do this because they don't have any confidence in themselves. And what these guys believe is that somehow that some men are just born with high levels of confidence. That's not the case. They're maybe pride. They're maybe an over-inflated ego in a sense of arrogance, but you don't get to be confident just because that has to be earned. And so as I talk about why having confidence and developing the ability to be confident is so important in the context of being dangerous, what I really want to share with you is that you have to go out and do the things that are going to make you confident. You have to go out and earn that. So as you're sitting here listening to this podcast and thinking to yourself, well, man, I'm just not as confident around women or I'm not as confident around my boss or around highly successful people. And trust me, I've been there. Then the next question should be, what can I do? What can I actually do in my life to develop more confidence? Now, some of the things I'm going to share with you as we progress are naturally going to help you become more confident, but if you feel fear towards any conversation, any engagement, any activity, any hobby, then that's probably a pretty good indicator that you could develop a sense of confidence by tackling that thing, by facing that activity head on and getting it done anyways. You don't need to be confident to develop confidence. What you need is you need to be courageous. And any one of us in the right set of circumstances and with the right mindset can exhibit courage. And when we exhibit courage to go do the thing that we're afraid of, we get done with that thing and we realize that maybe wasn't as bad as I thought it was or that it was bad, but I did it anyways. And it's through developing skill sets. It's through developing the ability to overcome the things we're afraid of that gives us the level of confidence that we need. And when we're confident, we can be more dangerous. We have more capability to face what needs to be faced and to do what needs to be done in the face of the fear that we might be experiencing. Too many men cower, they tuck tail and they run because they don't have any level of confidence. And when they're faced with a difficult circumstance, they can't be these dangerous or these capable men because they haven't developed that confidence. So that's number one is develop confidence. Now, how do we do that? A lot of ways. But again, these next four points that I'll share with you will certainly help you develop more confidence in your life. All right. Number two is to develop some level of assertiveness. Some level of assertiveness. There's four communication styles. There's passive. The passive communicator is weak. He's passive, obviously. He gets railroaded. He doesn't share his ideas. When he does share an idea, he makes excuses or apologizes for those ideas. And very rarely is he taken seriously. That's the passive communicator. Next is we have the passive aggressive communicator. This individual is trying to pretend like he's passive or good in some way. And yet he's actually a very aggressive individual. He's just good at disguising it. So this is the individual who can't take anything seriously. They've got a joke for everything. They're sarcastic. They undermine. They mock. They ridicule. They put others down, but they do it in a sly way. They give underhanded comments and compliments. This is the passive aggressive communicator. And while they may be funny for a short period of time, it becomes extremely, extremely exhausting dealing with these individuals because they don't know how to deal with difficult or awkward or uncomfortable conversations. And so they make light of everything and they mock everything. It's ridiculous. So that's a passive aggressive communicator. Next you have an aggressive communicator. And we all know this guy. We've probably had a boss like this or a member of our family that wants to railroad everybody. It's a type A dominant red personality who's a driver who doesn't take no for an answer, who isn't willing to communicate with other individuals or take other things into consideration. And he just dominates and bulldozes everybody in every circumstance. Obviously, we don't have good success with this individual and people don't like these types of individuals. So they don't make great leaders. Now you might look at it and think, well, this is a great leader. A dictator is not necessarily a great leader. They may be able to produce results for a short period of time until people catch on and realize that they don't want to be led by this individual. And so they stop following voluntarily. So an aggressive might be able to get things done now, but can't do it long term. What we should all be working towards is being assertive. Assertive certainly in our communication, like I'm talking about here, that you're willing to take on new ideas and new perspectives and you're taking other people's thoughts and ideas and feelings into consideration. And yet you have a very clear idea of what you want. You're willing to and capable of sharing your ideas with other individuals. When you see that there's a problem, you don't push that off. You're not passive about it. You're not aggressive by bulldozing it, but you're taking all of the stimulus into consideration to figure out the best way forward. The most assertive individual is going to get the job done the majority of the time over the longest period of time. So don't put the blindfold on. Don't pretend like threats don't exist. When a conversation needs to be had, don't pretend like it doesn't need to be had. Don't bury your head in the sand and think that if you just keep it there long enough that somehow this threat or this conversation or this circumstance will go away. It won't. In fact, it'll get worse. And so a dangerous and a capable man is able to recognize conversations and situations. And then he addresses those as quickly as possible as efficiently and effectively as possible to a neutralize the threat or b to get us further to advance the cause, whatever that may look like. So try to be assertive in all of your dealings and interactions. A couple of resources I'd give you is number one is No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert Glover. Great book that addresses nice guy syndrome is what he's dubbed it and how to be more assertive. And the second book is the assertiveness workbook, which will actually work you through how to address scenarios and situations in a more assertive manner without feeling like you're being too aggressive or being too weak. It's the balance. It's somewhere in the middle. So again, number two is to practice assertiveness. Number three is knowing what you want, knowing what the ultimate objective is. I know that if I asked 100 men, tell me what you want. Most would probably say something like, well, I want to make some more money or I want to have a better relationship or I want to be fit. And although that is good, I think that's worthy objectives that you should be striving towards. I think that if you're not specific enough that you're probably not going to accomplish that thing and you're not going to know how to get there and you're not going to be able to smash through the barriers that will inevitably present themselves. Now, if you're crystal clear, if you are hyper focused, very, very specific on what you want to accomplish, I don't want to get healthy. I want to be to 10% body fat. I don't want to be strong. I want to be able to bench 300 pounds or deadlift 450 pounds. I don't want to have a good marriage. Here's what I would define as a good marriage. I don't want to be wealthy. I want to have $10 million in my bank account. There's a huge distinction and difference. So when you know what you want, whether it's career advancement or in your relationship with your wife or your kids, whether it's your health or your bank account, then you can smash through those barriers. You can overcome the hurdles and the obstacles and the challenges. You can also call upon resources that you've identified as needing to be able to incorporate into your life to achieve those objectives and to overcome the hurdles that, again, present themselves. You'll know when you do these types of things that you are capable, you have confidence in being able to do it because you know exactly what you want. So my challenge to you is if I ask you that question, maybe you need to pause the podcast right now and ask, what do you want? Answer that and then ask yourself, is this specific? Is this crystal clear? Is this laser-like? Is it so specific that a five-year-old could understand it? And if not, then maybe you aren't clear enough on what you want, which will keep you from ultimately having it. So number three, knowing what you want. Number four, learn to be an effective communicator. Now, this kind of ties back into assertiveness, but there's so much more that goes into communication. And ultimately, it just is a level of practice. You need to learn how to communicate effectively with others. So if you're negotiating a raise or proposing to your soon-to-be fiance and wife, if you're disciplining your children, if you're engaged with your children, if you're engaged with a would-be attacker, then you need to be able to communicate effectively towards that individual to produce the outcome that you're after. If you can't open your mouth and use your sounds and use your words in a way that will illustrate exactly what you're all about and exactly what you're after, then you're probably not going to achieve your objective. Now, one of the interesting things about the topics and the points that I'm making with you today is that they're all intertwined. If you become a better communicator, you are naturally going to develop more confidence because when you say something, it's going to be followed through and then you'll realize you're capable of doing that. Assertiveness requires your ability to communicate and vice versa. Your ability to communicate requires that you have some level of assertiveness. So it's not like these things can be taken out and isolated and these decisions can be made in a vacuum. They're all interdependent of each other. And when you improve one area, whether it's communicating or knowing what you want and getting specific with that, or assertiveness or developing confidence, if you improve just one area, all other areas elevate and improve as well. So it's compounding. It's compounding returns when you start to take some of these things into consideration and then incorporate them into your life and get better in these soft skill sets. So again, learning to communicate effectively. I would say the best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you need to communicate. So if you know there needs to be a difficult conversation with you and your kids, have that conversation. If there's an opportunity to present to a group of people in something like Toastmasters or Rotary or Business Network International, then take advantage of that opportunity. If you're feeling a little nervous about putting yourself out there, but you want to do some public speaking and you know there's an event coming up, then reach out to the event organizers and throw your hat in the ring and give yourself a chance. It's not going to feel uncomfortable, I should say. You're going to feel awkward and at a place and inadequate, but this is how we develop the ability to communicate effectively, which makes us more capable, which ultimately makes us more dangerous. So that's number four is learn to communicate effectively. And the last one is educate yourself. Guys, you've got to educate yourself. Knowledgeable people. And let me say this, the information alone is not enough. You can't read a book and assume that because you read it that somehow you'll be able to apply this effectively in your life, but you've got to be knowledgeable. You've got to know some of the harder skills like martial arts, like firearms training, like situational awareness and these tactical situations. You've got to know how to be assertive. You've got to know the information that you're going to be communicating to other individuals. You've got to gain new credentials and new designations and new degrees. This is how you make yourself knowledgeable, which will in turn make you more capable. It will help you become a more effective leader and ultimately it will put you in the position where you are dangerous, where you can actually move the needle when you say something people listen. When you do something, people are inspired. That's where I want to be. And that's what I'm trying to do here within this podcast and of course other elements of my life. And I think I continue to improve. I hope so. That's the ultimate goal is that I can educate myself on the topics of masculinity so that I can then come and communicate these to you. We can enlist you in this cause of reclaiming and restoring masculinity. It certainly builds up my level of confidence because I can communicate effectively. I have other skills that I'm developing, whether it's something as simple as playing the guitar, which is something that I'm doing. Archery, which is something I've been doing for about a year and a half, almost two years now. My ability to hunt. Of course, educating myself on physiology and biology and how the body and the mind works so that I can make myself into a more effective tool. Jiu Jitsu is something I'm educating myself on so that I can use this tool as a weapon in the right circumstance. And again, that comes back to being dangerous is using it in the right circumstance and having under voluntary control. So these are some skills guys and I want to recap these with you really briefly and just highlight what they are. I would encourage you if you're in a spot where you can take notes to jot these things down. And then to ask yourself, how can I incorporate these into my life? Because what I think I've seen is that there's a gap between what I'm trying to share with you guys and maybe to some degree what you're actually implementing into your life. It's easy to do this while you're at the gym or mowing your lawn or exercising on a run, whatever it may be. And then we forget about it, right? We get distracted with other elements of life or we get listening to another podcast and we forget about the points that I'm trying to make and share with you guys. So I'd really encourage you to write this down and then to incorporate it into your battle plan. So let me go through these and we can talk about how you might incorporate them. Number one is to develop more confidence by acting. Number two is to develop more assertiveness. I gave you the two resources, no more Mr. Nice Guy and the Assertiveness workbook. Number three, learn to communicate. So throughout the week, look for opportunities where you can communicate. Maybe it's a small little thing where it's just a one-on-one interaction or maybe there's an opportunity per tip present in front of 15 or 20 or 30 or 100 or 1000 people. Take advantage of that. Number, I think I said that backwards, but the next one, number four, is to know what you want. So within your battle plan, you should be carving out time every single day. Maybe that's 20 minutes in the morning to really start to formulate and to bring life to some ideas and thoughts about who you want to be, the kind of father and husband and business owner and community leader you're trying to show up as. And be as specific as possible. And then point number five is to educate yourself. Where are you deficient? Where are you falling behind? What are some areas in your life where you could gain a new designation or degree or credential? What type of skills and activities and hobbies are you missing? Do you know how to do basic electrical and plumbing around the house? Or are you incapable of doing that? Are you enrolled in jujitsu or some other form of martial arts to be able to train your body into the tool and weapon that it can become so that if the situation called for it, heaven forbid, that you knew how to deal with it and how to handle yourself? These are all critical components of being a man in general, but being a dangerous man. Let me recap with this quote from Jordan Peterson. He says, a harmless man is not a good man. A good man is a very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control. So guys, I would encourage you to not follow what the American psychological recent quasi study said. They said that competition, that aggressiveness, that assertiveness and stoicism are a threat or a danger to society. It's only a danger when we don't know how to get that under voluntary control. It's only a danger when we don't focus on it and we pretend it doesn't exist and we aren't able to harness the power of being dangerous in the right circumstances. And as much as the hard skills that we all know we should be incorporating into our lives are important, it's also critical that we focus on these soft skills which will help us develop and become more dangerous and more capable as well. So that's what I've got for you today guys. If you would, let me know what you think about these Friday field notes. If I'm covering the topics that you want, if there's other topics that you would like me to address, I'm open to those things. I want to give you what you need, what you want so that you can improve your life. The best way to do that is to hit me up and give me a direct message on Instagram or Twitter. They're both at Ryan Mickler. My last name is spelled M-I-C-H-L-E-R. Let's have a conversation there and continue to talk about what it means to be a dangerous man and of course a capable man as well. And as a party note, guys, I would ask if you have not left a rating in review, do that. We need to get those rating reviews in. Also, share this. I don't ask a whole lot from you guys. I try to give you valuable information. It doesn't cost anything for you to access this valuable information, but I do ask that you share this episode. You've got a brother or your dad or a friend or someone at work or a cousin or somebody you're fathering in some capacity. Who needs to hear this type of message? And I don't want you to withhold it. I want you to be vocal about it. And I want you to start enlisting other men in the fight to reclaim and restore masculinity in a society that frankly doesn't want us to. Alright, so guys, that's all I've got for you today. Go out, be dangerous. Learn how to get that under voluntary control. Implement these strategies that I've shared with you today. And let's go out there and become the men that we are capable of being. Go out there guys, take action and become that man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
