    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals, a new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater, covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, chaos erupts in DC as the capital goes on lockdown and the results from Georgia. And what they could mean, we've got a lot coming up today. You are not going to want to miss it and it starts right now. Welcome to the News and Why It Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez, joined today by my good friend and also happens to be not only the future governor of Texas, but also America's favorite cowboy, chapbreaker. Good to be with you. I'm glad to have you back. Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be back. Happy to be back. It felt like 10 million years that I was at home with this baby. It felt like that frustrated. Did it. Also joined by Jason Bachel, chief researcher of the Glenn Beck program. I guess I'm also happy to see you, Jason. I appreciate this for the little time. It was awesome. I know. And you actually, you filled in a couple times for me as well. So thank you and a big thank you, by the way, to Hillary Kennedy, who she's all right. Held down the fort there. She's not bad. It's tough keeping you guys in line. And she did a great job of it. So thanks to both of you for holding down the fort while I was gone. But all right, let's get into the news today, shall we? Just a little bit going on today. Just a little bit in the headlines. Now, of course, as of the time of this taping, we will talk about what we know. What we know, though, is that DC is an ever-changing, very fragile situation. So by the time you're watching this could have changed just a little bit. But of course, the Stop the Steel rally took place. January 6th, everyone was waiting for it. And everyone was waiting also for the big electoral certification. Now, that actually didn't end up finishing taking place because of the craziness that happened outside with the rally, the protests, and the riots that broke out. Now, I want to, if we could, let's just take this in order, in chronological order, of how they took place and when. So, of course, we had the rally that took place. President Trump did join. President Trump spoke. Here is a little bit of what the president had to say. Watch. We beat him four years ago. We surprised him. We took him by surprise. And this year, they rigged it election. They rigged it like they've never rigged it election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either, if you notice. I'm honest, just, and I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you. And hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by a bold and radical left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's depth involved. Now there was a large crowd there as you could hear by the background noises. I think though, perhaps these words were taken a little bit out of context, maybe the wrong way, because what proceeded to happen afterwards was complete madness descending upon the capital. There are, I think if we could show the protesters who started, this doesn't really actually, this appears to be somewhat calm, but this is just kind of the calm before the storm. They start breaching security. Here they are with Capitol police trying to fight them back, macing people. I mean, they're just, they're trying to take over. They're trying to take over in the chamber. Let's actually watch the Trump supporters who actually got into the Capitol. And this footage, by the way, is from a Blaise TV host, Elijah Shafer, who is on the ground in DC. And I know we'll have a lot to say. I think he is good. Is he going to be on Glenshow tonight? Yep. Okay. So he will be joining Glenn tonight. He will have a lot to say. I'm sure he is always in the thick of everything. But here are the Trump supporters in the Capitol Watch. So just absolute complete chaos. Chad, what makes these people so different from, say, Antifa, who I'm sure that we would all be quick to condemn for their actions, you know, towards police, towards members of the community, the violence. What is different here? Because I'm seeing violence. And I'm like, why are we doing this? Why? I think it'll be interesting when we get to the bottom of it and we find out some things that are really going on there. Because right now we're shooting in the dark. This could be Antifa. And I have seen reports that there are reports. They have not been confirmed, but there are reports that Antifa was going undercover, that they were going to wear Trump related, you know? Well, I mean, I've been to several DC protests in rallies since the election. I've seen it. I've seen them infiltrate. You can usually pick out the telltale signs of the ones who are doing it. Elijah Shafer. I've been with him in DC. He knows who they are. You know, he's been targeted many times by Antifa. So I'll be interested to get his perspective on it and what he saw. I trust his analysis of the whole thing just because he is so deeply rooted and involved in that world. Yeah. You know, I don't, you know, it's, look, I could take this cup and throw it on the ground. I almost did it, but I love these news and why it comes. Yeah, don't. By the way, shopped up, please media.com. You can get your very own. You know, if I throw this on the ground, I break it. Okay. Well, it's broken. Now what? I mean, that's, that's the thing. Mob violence and rioting, it doesn't do any good, no matter who does it. Now, I understand and I'm as passionate of an unapologetic patriot as anybody. There are people out there. The Twitter atmosphere is just robust with people who are excited to see something, anything happening. But what? Revolutions and revolutionaries, they have a plan. There's a plan in place. It's not just mob violence. They're founding fathers. They engaged in a revolution, but they also had an idea of what overthrowing tyranny was going to look like. They signed their own death warrant with the Declaration of Independence. They had a government in mind on what they wanted established once King George was removed. This is not what we're seeing with this. This is breaking glass. This is breaking the cups. This is kicking the doors in. This is clashes with police at the end of the day. What is it accomplished? There's no pen to paper. There's nothing being realized here. There's no overturning of elections. There's no overthrows. There's nothing of that sort. This is just a lot of bluster that's going on. So, to me, I don't see any difference. It's a waste of time and people are acting like jackasses. That's what they're doing. I was surprised that this happened, to be honest, because I was at the million Magamarch. Read their chat. It was like a month ago or whatever. And the atmosphere was just kind of like hippie cool. Really? It was like they were driving these big rig trucks that were blasting God bless America and stuff like that. I mean, it was such a cool feeling because in many places in the country, you can't walk down the street with a MAGA hat as ridiculous as that is without someone saying something. Everyone was in full MAGA gear and it was awesome. And everyone was happy and it was totally peaceful. You did see people that showed up to fight straight up. You're going to have that in every, I don't care on what side, whatever protest. There were people that were ready to fight. They weren't Antifa. They were like, I don't know what groups they were, but they were their whole, you know, basically standing guard if Antifa showed up. So it doesn't surprise me when you see some of these pictures and you see like the helmets and the gear on. It doesn't surprise me. So, you know, I've been there. I've seen the proud boys. They're easily identifiable with their yellow and, you know, I don't see any of that on the video. There's none of that. Those guys, they have a chain of command. They operate almost like a militia, military militia. I've seen where some of them kind of gotten away from the crowd and their guys call them back, you know, come back. And I know that what you want to do is you want to put this down and say, oh, these are, this must be proud boys who are doing this. There's none. I haven't seen any footage of them in the forefront of any of this. I had to get up to the stage. But I do see the black backpacks and I do see the black helmets in which sometimes tends to be a sign of Antifa. I, I was there, I had to get up to the stage. I had to get through about 5,000 people that were in a rally and now getting through a concert crowd or whatever, if you got to go to the bathroom, people tend to get a little tick, that's you, because you're squeezing past, excuse me, pardon me, coming through. When I was there and had to get up to the stage, those people were so gracious to me. They were saying, come on, we'll help you get through and all of this. I mean, they were so gracious. That's how, they're usually so cautious. It's such a difference from a leftist title. The whole, the whole goal is to law and order. Exactly. We were walking down the street and there was a ton of them marching our direction. A leader in the background said, guys, because we were like in suits, we were there for business, said, guys, there's people on the other side, get out of their way. Like, that's how under control they usually are. That's why this is just so insane. But I will say though that people are pissed off. I get people in my Twitter mentions, I'm sure you guys have too, that are like, what else do you expect us to do? Which is, which is by the way, why it's hard for me to say, okay, this is 100% Antifa. I don't think it is. I don't think when you're getting responses like this, it's like, okay, well, I guess this really are people. And I think we'll see that it's not, even if Antifa was involved, I don't think it is 100% Antifa. I think people are just that level of done with the system. They're angry. I can't blame them for being angry. No, no, no, because we're angry. Yes. But they want to be directed at doing something. Like there's some people that are like, what do you want me to do, right, my congressman? What's that going to do? Nothing. What do you want me to do? Go vote, it was stolen from me. Right. Like they literally do not know what to do. And there's really no one on the right that's standing there saying, this is how we fight back, but peacefully. Now what, in the absence of that, what have they been noticing and witnessing for the past six months? Right. Five matter. Right. Antifa. Exactly. That hasn't happened. No accountability. No accountability. No consequence whatsoever. And I'm like, well, crap, it seemed to work for them. The Bubba effect is a very, very real thing. It is. So basically if people that don't know what it is, it's actually, I don't know if it's a military term or whatever. But so basically the Bubba effect is when things don't get taken care of, when the law isn't enforced, people will step in to do it themselves. Right. Once they've seen all of it, like the police have been told to stand back at these riots. They've noticed with their own eyes, nothing happens. When law isn't enforced, people will step in every single time, 100%. That's what they're seeing. They've noticed that. I'm sorry. The left right now clutching those pearls that, oh my gosh, look at that. You know what they would have done if this would have been the leftist Antifa BLM thing? They would have showed the peaceful people out in front of the place, probably having a corn dog and just watching everything. And then they wouldn't have showed the other thing. They said, oh, it's mostly peaceful. Oh, except for the federal building takeover. But they wouldn't have said that. They would have said mostly peaceful. It's smoldering behind the camera shot. Right. As I said, the left, you asked for this. They enabled this. They let this stuff go. They said there was a peaceful protest. They didn't talk about the writing, or they did not condemn them. And the mainstream media is to blame as well. I'm not given a pass for the people doing this because it's disgusting. I think that the people involved should be arrested and prosecuted. And they need to know that they are going to be used by the mainstream media. There's nothing more that the mainstream media likes than to see these people replay these people over and over on television and talk about, see, we told you guys that the Trump supporters were the bad ones. Yeah. I mean, you're falling right into their play. Legitimized it. Right into their hands. Yeah. Legitimized. Every bad thing they said about, I can't tell you how much this probably sets the conservative movement back. Yeah. I don't know how many years, but it will. What happens to the conservative movement? Well, good gosh. Is there one cohesive party at this point? I don't think there is. I mean, you think back when Obama, when they were in this position when Obama's elected, they had every single, you know, lever of power in the government. Exactly how it is now. We at least had the Tea Party then. Yeah. What do we got now? Yeah. There was a time magazine cover that had a picture of the Republican elephant and the headline said, in danger species. That was 2009. And we went in and flipped the Senate in the midterm elections. We're at a place now where you're right, whether it is a Patriot party or, you know, but because again, I go back to this. It's never been about Donald Trump, the man. It's been about what Trump represented and created and exposed. And now we've tasted that. We don't want to go back to the system. We don't want to go back to the establishment. We don't want to go back to the days of where our senators on both sides are like WWE wrestlers in the ring and then they get in a limousine after the fight and go eat at the same steakhouse. We're passionately polarized right now while they play politics because they have nothing to lose, right? So I think we see something begin to rise up in the form of a movement, if not a political party of some nature that comes in. This two party system is wildly fractured as it is now. All right, we've got more to come. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Home Title Lock. So if you have not heard of Home Title Theft, you're one of the lucky ones because that means it has never happened to you, which means you should pray that it doesn't ever happen to you because it will ruin you financially. So basically what happens is all of our legal titles to our homes are kept online like everything else where all of these hackers can come in and they can find your home's title, they forge your signature on a quick claim deed and it can say that you sold your house to this hacker and then they can take out loans against your home until all of your equity, your whole retirement nest egg probably is totally gone. You're not going to know it until the damage is done and by the way, there's no insurance program that protects you. Your bank, you might think, oh well my bank probably has a program for that, that protects me. So you can ignore due common identity theft programs but Home Title Lock does and in the unlikely event you become a victim of Title Theft while a member, Home Title Lock will spend up to a quarter million dollars in legal fees to help restore your home's title. Trust me, if this happens to you, you are going to need it. You got to go to home title lock.com, register your address to see if you are already a victim before it's too late. This is the key to this you guys because you're not going to know that you are a victim unless you go to Home Title Lock and register your address. You can use code radio for 30 free days of protection that is code radio which is weird because this is not a radio program so I'm not. But use code radio for home title lock.com back in a minute. All right before we move on to what is happening in Georgia just to wrap up this conversation about what is taking place in DC. I know that there, you know, we've tried to get through it in one segment. There is so much more to get into but one person, I believe it was a female, right, has been shot at least one person again as of the time of the staping and here is a video that someone took from actually inside of Congress. Watch. So obviously certification not taking place which is really I think not a great way to get your point across to make everyone else go on lockdown. Man when Ted Cruz was just talking. But yeah so obviously Congress had to stop what they were doing and go on lockdown because everything was getting breached security was getting breached. And by the way if you listen to the mainstream media you may hear that Trump was inciting violence but I will just just to state for the record President Trump did tweet out when everything started going down please support our Capitol Police and law enforcement they are truly on the side of our country stay peaceful. Exclamation point which I'm sure CNN will say is a dog whistle for something not peaceful. He said I'm asking for everyone at the US Capitol to remain peaceful no violence remember we are the party of law in order respect the law and our great men and women in blue. Thank you. Something tells me that won't be enough for the leftist pundits somehow this will become President Trump's fault. Yeah and during the break I saw that he made the comment where he said anyone involved with these rallies in protest go home. Go home. So it still won't be enough. Right. Yeah it will never be enough though. It will never be enough. But you know you guys before we went to the break we started talking about a what happens to this two party system. If there is a third party is it this is it this is it's the Trump party is that what happens there's a Trump party and everyone who's I hope we could come up with a better name but yeah I think that's basically it. You said patreon party not that long ago and I and I just think that I mean at the end of the day I don't know it's it's because because there's there's Democrats that are sick of the Democratic Party there are Republicans that are sick of the Republican Party. There are disenfranchised people who are patriotic look I don't I don't I don't hate you because you're on the left. Yeah. You know that's that's not my issue is in a person who disagree I have a lot of friends I believe it or not I have a lot of friends who are Democrats. Okay and I don't mind that's not my issue. It's the people who are being forgotten by the country they love and they're not being represented in this Republic and people are fed up with that. Yeah I oh gosh I hope it's not called the Trump party. I do think that there is a I think there's room for third party. I think I think it's been I mean it's long time coming long time coming the libertarian party is not going to do it to my disappointment but they need some kind of party needs some star power. Yeah it needs somebody with star power and it needs someone I I would love for the Trump family to be involved somehow because they really kind of started this but I hope it's someone that can really just like kind of like a Reagan I hate to say it's like a meme but somebody that can is passionate about conservatism and then has clearly read the book cover to cover and understands every single thing. They can look at you know his opponent who's a Democrat and when he calls him either a big it racist or immoral you know for not wanting to make these government programs can fire back and say I will know I agree with you we do need to be compassionate but there is another way there it's not just the way the Democrats when the Democrats say we're coming together you know let's all come together and everything no no they don't want to reconcile with you they don't want to come together they want the status quo of how it was before Trump and that status quo is we're all moving with the flow of the river in the Democrats way that over to windows moving further and further to left Republicans have been doing that. We got pissed and we were tired of it and we wanted someone to fight back we got Donald Trump so thank you Trump for teaching us that are reminding us that yes we can fight back we don't have to move with them anymore we can go our own direction we just need someone that's I don't know we just need a true believer I think he needs someone with the courage to do it god okay then finally how much I was like twisting the hint or not I mean to your point someone with the courage to say what needs to be said yeah right because I think that that's what's so frustrating for the average American who you know may have gone to DC and let all of their emotions boil over is that they've got all of these leaders that we elected you guys to go and do what we want you to do and none of you guys are standing up for all of the you know potential fraud that took place none of you guys are standing up for us and I think that it's frustrating for them I think they just they need someone to say what they're thinking and I think that that's why Trump was so they were so enamored by him I think but we'll see how that shakes out speaking of frustrated Americans Georgia Georgia did you guys did you guys pay attention to this at all last night oh no no I'm not totally ignoring well I mean honestly part of me was like I'm investing this time now knowing that there's not going to be an answer tonight yeah right I mean we knew going into it and they warned us of course there's not going to be an answer and we were certain that oh you know the pipes would break in one of the in one of the voting you know they're the counting counting the votes oh the pipes break or oh we got to take a break and oops something happened and we have to shut it down for the night and of course that did happen in what was it Chatham County they decided before 11 o'clock p.m. that they had they were just done for the night they were just going to call it a night and come back at 8 a.m. to continue counting votes I'm sorry but if you know what people thought of that the last time you did it why would you do it again she can get away with it right away with it because what were their repercussions the last time they did it absolutely nothing they got what they wanted take about it so they are I mean so now they're doubling down and just like you know what we feel like to stop in this and doing it tomorrow and who cares what we do in the meantime yeah and George is a microcosm of the rest of the nation I mean it is completely divided in terms of its number of voters going blue or red these were by the way it's too close to call us at the time this evening incredibly close elections I mean what you wouldn't think that it would be that close not with these can I just not with these particular democrat candidates off whatever he's better he's a cleaner yeah you're right a purple yeah yeah a purple state that's divided is usually not that divided right it's usually somewhere kind of in the middle they can bounce back either way we're not some Marxist yes he preaches Marxist from the pulpit yes I can't imagine how this guy got elected it's absolutely insane scary you know I can't you know what's crazy to me is and pisses me off is I think the GOP yes they just suck in general but they really sucked on this they didn't even I don't remember them making guns an issue ever ever I know and we I both of them want to go in the direction of doing something to the second amendment yeah Georgians don't want that I think it's pretty you know across both party lines there that Georgians like guns yeah and that's pretty you know consistent with every other state in the south if they would have made just just make that an issue that probably would have scared a few more people over to vote in for uh law floor law floor and Purdue but and again we get so again this kind of takes us back to uh the whole third party deal I mean again how in their right minds does the GOP not understand that that's the messaging that they need to get out for Georgia I don't know the jimmy there's no excuse for that no there's no excuse there's no excuse for allowing this to happen and there's no excuse for I mean so this I don't know how the audience is going to be on this they might be divided on it but you know it's both 600 dollar checks and 2 000 checks are stupid okay it's it's a disgrace it's a slap in the face but when Mitch McConnell so it was Trump's idea for the 600 dollar for the to up it to the 2000 it was his idea it was Mitch McConnell that stopped it what did you think Nancy Pelosi was going to do she was going to pick it up and use it as leverage and they allowed them to do that yeah how many people I mean there's a lot of like conservative conservatives that can you know that haven't been uh you know affected by coronavirus that would say I don't need that I don't want that but there is a lot of people in the middle in Georgia that probably lost a job in food service or something like that they can't pay the rent two thousand dollars would have paid their rent right that month right how many of them said okay screw it I'm done with this I'll vote for the Marxist guy even though they didn't even like him or you know agree with them they're gonna do it anyway yeah gosh man so again as of Jason's gonna Jason's gonna have like a cardiac over here in a second uh as of the time of the saping again uh so Warnock is projected to win in his race and Purdue has fallen behind Ossoff which of course people were like we really need both of them and then they were like okay but if we could just get one if we could just keep the one that'd be great and now um we could have both taken so that's really really terrifying I hate to I don't want to be pessimistic guys but we really need to keep a lookout to what the democrats are going to try to jam through while they control all chambers uh so we've got more to come first who want to thank our sponsor Bilt Bar now I was actually thrilled when I saw that Bilt Bar is now a sponsor of this show because I can't tell you how much money I've spent on the Bilt Bar website in the last couple months they just keep coming out with more delicious bars and I keep buying them and like legitimately no joke my husband is now like Sarah there's another Bilt Bar box at the front door do you have something to tell me and I'm like okay well they were running a really good special and they came out with this new flavor and I can't help it she always put up a dressing with chocolate all over Fable. I'm addicted. Bilt Bar is it's a protein bar okay but it's healthier than your favorite protein bar which probably tastes like chalk but you want to pretend to like it. Bilt Bar you don't have to pretend to like because it actually is really good it's low calorie low sugar high protein high fiber you guys know me I do the keto diet it's great for keto diet you can lose weight or you can maintain weight and it tastes like you're eating dessert it really does um I just went out and like bought up their white chocolate cookies and cream I have the caramel brownie at home which is great there are like 18 different flavors they've got peanut butter they've got mint brownie they've got they have got everything you could possibly think of and they're all covered in 100 chocolate so which is great in my house because my husband hates chocolate so I know all the Bilt bars go to me I get to eat all of them try it really if you've got a New Year's resolution that

us off as well yeah Fox seeing it also did so that's done we knew it anyway we so here so here's the question I think that a lot of people are are wanting to know or probably what's running through their heads is what happens right because the leftists now are already calling for very radical legislation now that they see what they can do they're calling to pack the courts they're calling to end the filibuster they're calling for all of the things that they threatened this entire time which is why I think it's so frustrating for the average american to go how did this happen did you guys not hear what these people have been threatening to do if they got in power and now you're just going to put them in power what do we do yeah if I will say the things you just listed off that they might do that's very well documented in fact harry reed is has gotten together with a couple other groups and act a few active senators at the moment and they established what they called the war room and they had a list of things that they want to do at the very top was get rid of the filibuster at the very top um after that 60 vote majority rule gone um just those two things right there you can push through pretty much whatever you want um but washington dc statehood portareco statehood yep that right there will ensure they never lose the senate again I mean they've got a very specific plan uh jaya paul said uh transformative chains recurring survival checks union jobs that pay a living wage guaranteed health care racial justice voting rights immigration reform climate action reproductive justice education and much more it can't wait oh man i'm excited i'm i'm ready static yeah no that's going to be a whole host of crazy uh and you think the the people are demonstrating a certain level of pissed off in washington dc today wait till these things start to happen these these gun buybacks and and these demands and reforms and the infringements that are going to come and are you saying that the average american who has been affected by all of these shutdowns doesn't care about racial justice or climate change well you know we are saying chamf well they they better care because not only is speech going to become a crime thought is going to become a crime as well i mean that's where we're going i mean nancy plos he already wants you know seaman to be called seafarers and no no reference to uncle or aunt or mom or dad or any gender references or anything like that just so just it's going to go all the way from your physical goods to the thoughts that you have in your brain you guys have unleashed a nightmare on this country and it's been a great run been a great run glenn beck was finally right the end has come no you know you know what i would love to see i would love to see someone like a joe mansion get together with some deal with mitch mackell and yeah and flip sides yeah he could do it he was just reelected so he's safe he'll be there for a while he's about as flaky as trotter joe mansion is our only hope is that where we're at now but but he already nominated me to run the party so he's got a lot of crazy ideas but i but seriously though i mean he's he's in west virginia he people in west virginians they're not going to want to get rid of guns they're not going to want to like what happens at the next you know mass shooting or whatever they use that to get rid of the filibuster so that they can screw with the second amendment i could totally see that happening but i could totally see joe mansion fearful of his job not willing to give into that right right so who how many of those democrats are actually in the middle it's so hard to tell these days but i mean they really are probably the most important thing for us right now yeah they're the ones that can stop getting rid of the filibuster or the 60 vote uh majority role stuff like that if those two things go you probably won't recognize this country in a couple years well good news all around today uh joe biden uh also announced that he is nominating marrick garland as attorney general uh for his administration chat what are your thoughts on that i feel like it could have been way worse could have been way worse but it just it's going to be obama 2.0 i mean this entire administration he just getting the gang back together that's all it is it could have been way worse but you know it doesn't matter they're all puppets on the stream at this point and the powers that be are running um yeah when i first saw this i was like huh you know like i know i kind of threw me for a loop too yeah it's going to be really interesting because there there is a current case in the justice department against the sun so i against oh against joe biden sun yeah against 100 what did marrick garland son so garland's going to have to deal with that yeah um i kind of saw it as uh almost like a slap in the face to republicans you know kind of like really if we wanted this kind of supreme court you tried not to you know did this to us fine i'm putting it in my cabinet type thing right i think we're going to see a lot of that pettiness actually the undoing of everything trump did you know pretty much everything i don't know what happens to middle east stuff you know all those peace plans i'm sure they'd be happy to torpedo it if it meant getting rid of uh donald trump's legacy there's going to be a ton of these things and i just kind of saw this as sure he seems like a safer pick maybe you know part of his let's get back to the middle you know type thing which is such bull crap but um i think it's pettiness i really do at least had a big deal with it so chad is there anyone who will be running the country who is not just a puppet on strings because i i tend to think that joe both joe biden and commala are just wherever the win takes them whenever is politically advantageous they will say i don't really find them to have really like strong ideals or morals that they want to stand on or convictions it's just whatever yeah and anybody who says any different just press them and say what what are those strong convictions nobody can list those off right uh one would say barack obama but he's a puppet on the string as well there's just powers that be they're out there and i know people want to say sorrow so it's not just george sorry it's it's it's just those those people behind the curtain whom we do not name it's they're out there i'm telling you can't corrupt a society to this level without having those people in existence and they're there somebody had to take a junior senator who was a community organizer and turn him into the president of the united states barack obama didn't do anything on the you didn't build that he didn't build that somebody else built that you know whether it's a david geffen or somebody of that nature but you know georgia is an example tens of millions of dollars poured in there from where from california if i had my way if you're going to run in a state you should only be able to receive money from that state not from california not from new york not from any of those places that's where it is georgia they poured two hundred million dollars into that race yeah i think i i i don't know if joe biden i i he i definitely think joe biden is a puppet on the strings comala we we pretty much already know that's that's their ace in the hole that's their plan going forward but bernie sanders said uh when all of them dropped out and let joe biden get the nomination that joe biden that there was an agreement struck he actually said it's on tv an agreement was struck and he believed joe biden would if if elected would be the most progressive president since fdr joe biden that means there were some wheel and dealing going on right so we should really take take note you know once this were as it starts going forward because it could be scary yeah all right we've got more to come back in a minute our representative emmanuel cleaver has blamed quote orchestrated outrage for the backlash he has faced since he concluded his opening prayer uh in congress on sunday that sounded a little bit like this we ask it in the name of the monotheistic guard brahanga and guard known by many names by many different faiths a man and a woman so uh this big dummy this is what he said this was his defense of ending the prayer like he did watch i say that uh you know we we have uh you know a society now that uh orchestrated outrage uh 99.999 to those of the people who are accepting outrage didn't see the prayer the prayer wasn't wasn't uh uh for them you thought i'm talking to god about congress asking for unity and so forth asking god to give us that strength to do that uh they're like end of the prayer by saying amen we have a record number of women in congress including the first chaplain in 240 years of of the united states history the a woman uh was after the prayer ended trying to recognize uh the the record number of women now income request and a female chaplain so i said a woman and and felt good how are you going to double down on that how are you going to go through life with a name Emmanuel Emmanuel I mean the irony that's been lost i would call him a woman you will for the rest of my days if i knew the man personally he's a woman you will cleaver to me i mean i mean you know there is a woman in that's the dumbest thing i have heard like i laughed for hours over this thing that is so stupid i mean that is ignorance on the level you know i made a joke to Hillary on monday i said he took the Hebrew to the shebrew that quick i mean it was terrible and then you try to you try to explain that there's no possible way him trying to explain it sounded like he actually believes that he believed it amen is amen yeah right well that's why i'm like bro have you not have you not been taught by this point that you were wrong he's like well no of course i i mean there are women there i had to add them and so he still doesn't know well it's it's it's it's it's it's common within that side of the aisle like they really don't have to explain what they do you don't have to apologize for it they don't say i was wrong well also politics is their religion religion is not their religion so they don't know anything about it yep they don't know the first thing about it all right and then very quickly talking about congress you know democrats i did you guys talk about this on monday that they're using they're oh you've referenced it they're not using gendered language anymore yeah you can't say mother father anything like that uh unless you are a member of congress and in your twitter bio you still have stuff like um mom and grandma so here's at katie porter but nancy polosi more importantly do we have nancy polosi she i know she has the other she is mother and grandmother she describes herself as so i'm waiting on the ethics committee to uh to chastise her for that and uh representative josh harder he is pams husband and also foster dog dad both of which you are not allowed to say anymore you're you have to be a parent and you have to be a spouse the else i said he was a track guy oh well welcome so uh we will be referring all of these people to uh the ethics committee for ethics violations you're not allowed to say that you're not allowed to say that in 2021 and we joke about this a lot here on the show but i do think it's important to mention like again i just said this these these people they're they're running our country they're they're actually in in charge of things and they're you're smoking hot today you know that i'm not that for a little massage oh my god that's how we keep this real little toxic masculinity yes because i'm a man you whale you are jason top that top what he just said tell her something nice say something appropriate no wait can i just really quickly um i'm gonna i'm gonna call you out jason jason now every time he greets me passed to insult me by saying something about my weight ever since i got pregnant every time i mean it was like a week after i told everyone i wasn't even showing he was like whoa you're one of nine months now they got ready started well that's so funny because she never looked pregnant really woman ever since uh no but i mean everything's falling apart it's 2021 people are storming storming the capital people are not allowed to call themselves men and women i call it 2020 season two i didn't i didn't ask for it we didn't i didn't renew this season yeah i didn't want another season coming back lit i did but we didn't ask for this chat does it get better are we are we really done you joked you joked was it a joke when you said this is this is the end of a month that's been a great run it's been a great run i know you know i mean there are certain things we if you want to be in this fight don't storm the capital let's come up with a way to create revolutions one of those things is and i'm not saying take to the field of battle i'm saying we do things like we hammer hammer hammer the concept that we have an election day and we don't do mailing ballots we don't do this we you start overturning these the fraudulent systems that are there Donald trump got us started on that now they want to erase all of that they want to you know the cadaver has been exposed joe biden's administration is going to do everything you can to try to put the dirt back on top yeah all right back in a minute you know it sucks is my first thought is let's just read it really well before we go joined by my older kiddo he's wanted to come say hello i wanted to for you to tell everyone how you're enjoying being a big brother i like it they told him to talk and you don't have to talk to the mic that much but that's good what's your favorite part of being a big brother how much your brother christ uh no this is on my research part what's the best part of being a big brother he makes poop jokes all the time i think that's what he would say poop jokes all the time but he's hanging out with me today we're having lots of family time getting adjusted and we're homeschooling now as well because we practice what we preach here at blaise tv so uh the part of my clan wanted to say hi um all right so who will win in the georgia runoff election tonight was the question from yesterday you guys were you were you were wrong you were wrong you said but 61 percent of you said both the republicans which was not it's not happening that's not happening and then there's nothing to see here i don't want to just go cry and drink a whole bottle of wine to myself think about the state of our nation uh today's poll who is the future of the right a trump Ted Cruz, Nikki Haley or someone else goes to our conversation when you think chad uh someone else someone else all right Jason i want to say Nikki but i'll probably say someone else but i think it could be good too yeah i agree so what you're saying is chad praether that chad praether well i'm quite humble i don't know if i'm so too lately i'm quite humble oh thanks for listening to the news and why it
