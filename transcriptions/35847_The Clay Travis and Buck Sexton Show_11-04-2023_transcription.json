    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast. Welcome and everybody Tuesday edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show starts right now. Got a bunch of stories to dive into with you. First off, the whole foods flagship store in San Francisco. We were talking about San Fran yesterday. That whole foods store has closed, not because they can't find a way to sell people very expensive gluten-free crackers and braised beef and etc. It's closing after one year because of drug use in restrooms, violent assaults on staffs. And this was quite a detail. All of its shopping baskets, hundreds of them stolen. So basically constant theft, disorder, anarchy and violence in a fancy grocery store in downtown San Francisco. We will return to this because I think it shows you every at this point, every lib writer and author who is saying, it's not that bad in San Francisco. They're operating in bad faith. They're lying to you. They're just carrying water for the left for the Marxist, commie lunatics, a Soros backed prosecutors that are destroying city after city. Also, we didn't mention this when yesterday, I wanted to get into it a little bit today. It's been a massive leak of Ukraine, Russia related intelligence online. Biden administration seems to be really caught off guard by it. And it goes to a number of things. The actual reality of the war in Ukraine and US involvement from the outside, as well as counterintelligence risk that we have in the era of online platforms. There's a there's now a story up that they think the leak may have come clay from disc on discord. I mean, that's where it was posted initially, which is not a platform I've used, but it's a live streaming platform. We'll get to it. Also, we have Riley Gaines joining us today in the middle of the show. So at the bottom of the second hour of the program, she was assaulted last week by a pro trans agenda mob at you. Oh, in San Francisco, right? Yeah, what a shock and Nancy Pelosi's district, same city where, you know, the people are fleeing as fast as they can and the stores are closing in that same city or same area of that city, I should say, they're having these problems. But we want to start today with two things and update, if you will, there's not really much information on it, but an update on the Nashville mass shooting and then also more information on the Louisville mass shooting. Yesterday at the bank, let's, let's first start, uh, clay with, uh, Nashville. Still no manifesto. A lot of stories out there about how the LGBTQ plus activists were really concerned about this coming out and the backlash against the community from this. So I don't see at this point how they won't even tell us what the declared, not that that's necessarily even we have to accept as the motive, right? They can analyze it. Motive is always a somewhat, I mean, it's not totally subjective, but it can be a multifaceted thing. Uh, at this point, I don't see how it's anything other than a cover up. They don't want people to know because they won't even tell us what they think the motive is. Doesn't take that long to figure this stuff out. It's 15 days. And I came on and said that I had been told that the, that the manifesto was going to be released and I was and it still hasn't happened. And Buck, note what's happened in Nashville. The story has shifted from psychotic trans shooter, kill six innocent people at a religious elementary school to, can you believe these crazy Republicans made the decision to hold a Democrats who took over the legislative chamber demanding gun control accountable for their behavior? Right. Think about how quickly that pivot has happened. Kamala Harris rolled into town this weekend to attack the state of Tennessee for anti-democratic processes in the process. She was not willing or able to meet with any of the survivors of this shooting. And this to me as an example of how a droid and skilled the left wing in this country is at putting narrative over everything because the narrative of this shooter, and we're going to get so Louisville in a moment, we try to avoid. So you guys know naming mass shooters on this show unless they are fugitives at large and we think, Hey, maybe we can help you guys with this big audience help to catch like happened in the, if I remember correctly, Buck, the shooting that happened in Manhattan in the subway when that guy unleashed and then he was missing and we said, Hey, this is the guy they're looking for. And when the shooter is dead, we're not going to try to make them more famous based on sharing their their names and whatnot pictures. But this is how it happens. This is how stories like these shift because it's 15 days. The narrative from this trans manifesto, we were told immediately that it existed and then it just kind of vanished. The FBI came in began their investigation. I don't know who signs off on the release now of this. I would guess the FBI has taken jurisdiction in some way. Over this manifesto, but do you trust the FBI to be honest and share with the American public? I don't, unfortunately. And so it needs to be released. Ever since that moment, I brought it up before on the show when the Obama administration FBI was editing out words from a recording from the transcript of the Pulse nightclub mass shooter who was a jihadist, who was an Islamic radical who was murdering people in a gay nightclub. And ever since they changed the words and then they went back on it, by the way, it was so obvious and so politicized and stupid and act by the FBI that they change, right? Imagine that. The outcry was what he because we all knew what was what was blacked out in those lines. We could figure it out from the context. So really it was both authoritarian or really totalitarian and insulting, which often goes hand in hand, right? It was an effort to shape the political narrative in a way that doesn't take into account free thinking human beings are the ones we're supposed to be able to discern this one way or the other. And so that's that's one component of it for me. I just think that now we see their whole game here is to delay it as long as possible, because then there'll be less of a public reckoning about whatever it is that would it's very rare, as we know, for a woman to do something like this. Correct. So why? And she was a individual who self identified as trans. Why would a woman go in there? And I mean, she shot little kids, right? This is as evil as a three nine year old and and will not they will not tell us what happened by the way, if she's just completely. I mean, obviously at some level, it is just psychopathy and somebody that you know, probably needed to be institutionalized. But then tell us that, right? But if there are things that are that she points to that she pointed to in these manifesto policies that were being adopted by different states with regard to trans issues, we should know that people are being radicalized based upon that doesn't mean that it changes our behavior one way or the other, but there should be an awareness. It's a public safety issue to know why maniacs like this do what they do. OK, that's one part of it. Speaking of psychopathic mass shooter maniacs, unfortunately, we have another one that we have more information on. Yeah. And you know, it's obviously not not very far off just next door in Kentucky. But this, I think, is also based on the profile we expect, Clay, from mass shooters of, you know, different that fall into these different categories. This was a lot of people surprise. This guy was 25 years old. He live streamed the shooter in Louisville, which just obviously happened what yesterday morning, live streamed the shooting on instant on Instagram. Wow. And left a note to his parents telling him he was going to do this because he had been fired. So this is at some level, the workplace massacre component. There may be more to it, but he's a very left-wing guy who hated Trump. And I think it's interesting posted a lot about that. I'm not saying that's why he did this, but I do note that there's no discussion of his individual's politics whatsoever. And we know that wouldn't be the case if he were a MAGA hat wearing Trump supporter. These are the narrative issues that the media, these, you know, the narrative manipulations that the media engages in. Yeah, this white guy was, and I think, again, we're not going to name him, the Louisville shooter, but I want to give you some of the details of his background. He was a graduate of the University of Alabama. He was aggressively anti-Trump, hated Donald Trump. In fact, for those of you out there who remember this football game and I was there, he was furious that Alabama fans cheered Donald Trump at the LSU Alabama game in 2019. I was at that game with my, my Bama fan son, unfortunately, because I'm a Tennessee fan, but, but I was at that game. It was amazing. It was Joe Burrow against against two. I talked about Lola for those of you out there who are big sports fans. It was iconic. One of the most watched college football games of the year. Trump traveled. And when they put him on the jumbo, Tron, Brian Denny stadium went crazy. This guy was super upset as an Alabama grad that Alabama fans were cheering Trump. He was also a huge BLM supporter. He was a guy who had his pronouns in all of his professional, professional resumes and professional LinkedIn profiles and all these other places. He was a far left wing loon. Now, clearly he was crazy. Something was often him as something is often off in all mass shooters because this is not a normal thing to do. But if you're wondering, wow, that Louisville shooter, that story really kind of vanished in a hurry. We're not hearing very much about him. It's because he was a left wing lunatic and it doesn't fit the narrative for him to be a guy who hated Donald Trump and who was a huge BLM supporter and was a huge pronoun in the bio guy side note. If you own a company and you hire anyone who puts their pronouns in their bios, I think you are in imbecile. By the way, I would never I ran a company for a long time. It's rare that I would look at something on a resume and say this guy or this girl is out the window. You got your pronouns in it. That is it for me. That would be I don't want to bring in these crazy people into my company. But this, this guy, if you're wondering, man, a white guy shot up a a bank in in Louisville. This is like typically the wheelhouse for Democrats. Why have they kind of vanished? And what happened with this story? There's your answer. It doesn't fit their prevailing narrative. I remember hearing about, um, you know, workplace shootings of, I think it was particularly in the late nineties and people would, there was this term that was being used because of there were some postal workers, I believe, right? You're right. And and shot up their coworkers effect essentially, um, of going postal. Yeah. So workplace violence of that kind is, you know, it's, it's as horrific as it is. It is not a new phenomenon. Um, but it is interesting to see that the politics of this individual, um, are not under discussion and in the media at all as to perhaps exacerbating his psychological condition. I mean, I think that this is an argument that I made, I have made during both of the BLM errors when the most powerful media institutions in the country are telling people that there's effectively a, uh, that not only his law enforcement racist, but there is a racist genocide of unarmed, uh, black men occurring in the country year in and year out that has a very damaging effect on the psychology of people who aren't able to figure out that it is a huge lie and also are already somewhat mentally unstable. And I will just say this, you find any incident where there's somebody who is in some way affiliated with, you know, ideologically, they can tie into the, if they're anti government in those broad sense, they will go, the left will go and they will find statements of individual members of Congress or, you know, or the president, if he's a Republican or whatever it may be and tie it to that person right away, say your words led to this. This is what they do every time. But then when you look at the guy who shot up the baseball field, for example, under the Trump administration, shot Steve Scalise, almost killed Senator Rand Paul. He was a huge Bernie Sanders supporter who was yelling that he did it for health care because they were opposed to Obamacare. That was that mass murder was motivation, which still, I think some people, and we know that because Rand Paul heard him screaming, this is for the healthcare as he's shooting at everybody. Okay. No discussion of, hey, maybe members of the Senate who are Democrats shouldn't pretend that Republicans want poor people to die of cancer without any assistance or any health care because they're so greedy, you know? So it's just, I'll note you can tell me that we shouldn't do this period. But every time it happens, I do believe it's worth noting that the left always ties it to their political enemies when they can. And when it's somebody who is of the left, they bury it as fast as they possibly can as a story. It just disappears. And we're not supposed to focus on any of the rhetoric. The, have you heard anyone talk in the last couple of weeks about the political temperature in this country? That's the phrase that, you know, the political temperature is just so high right now when it's a right wing person that does something. If this guy had been a huge Trump supporter, it would have been a MAGA shooter. It would be the headlines everywhere. It would last for weeks. Merrick Garland would be on the ground right now in Louisville talking about how we need an investigation into domestic terrorism and how white men, Donald Trump supporters are the biggest threat to democracy in this country. Otherwise this happens vanishes. Can we put on an ask here? I'm curious. I mean, Steve Ducey will probably be able to get this one. I'm sorry, Peter. Peter Ducey would be a dad. Yeah, Peter is right. Sorry. They're both great. I just get it. Yeah. Ducey of the White House, perhaps he could get this question. I want someone to ask the Biden and I really mean this. Ask the Biden administration. Why did the vice president have time to go stand with two individuals who broke the rules of their organization, their body and were punished rightly under the rules in Tennessee, time to go stand with them in solidarity. No time for the families of the mass murdered individuals and including murdered children in Nashville, though. I would like the White House to be asked that question. It's a fabulous question. Small businesses don't get nearly a number of breaks. You need to get ahead. It's rare. They come along and when they do, you got to grab them.

Clay Travis and Fox, shock up a win for team reality. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm a columnist at the New York Post and Fox News and author of the best selling books, stolen youth and now host of the brand new Carol Markowitz show. Yes, I'm taking a new journey and launching a podcast part of the Clay and Buck podcast network. And would like to invite you to join me for the ride. We'll talk to the biggest names in public life and get real answers to the deep questions. I've spent years writing a culture column about the things that really matter and then a book on how to protect your children from the bad forces around them. Now we're bringing that fight along with some fun to this brand new podcast. We'll also feature an advice segment. So send in your questions to Carol Markowitz show at gmail.com. Join me for the Carol Markowitz show new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Riley Gaines is going to join us next hour, Buck. And I think the conversation is going to be really interesting because of what's going on. Megan Rapinoe, US soccer star, Sue Bird, who is a women's basketball star. I can't believe this is real. Buck, both of those women have come out in favor of dudes. That is men who identify as women being able to compete in their sports. And Riley Gaines, I believe, is going to take a two by four to that argument next hour. But it's crazy. They're basically trying to erase women's athletes. I would point out, Buck, just at the time that both of those women are prepared to retire and don't have to actually compete with women with men anymore. So much bravery from the left on this issue. Isn't it amazing? They're just going to get better speaking positions and, uh, and, you know, analyst positions on TV now. What a shock mystery over cell phone service providers is being exposed. The expensive monthly prices you might be paying to AT&T Verizon or T mobile can be a thing of the past. If you switched to Pure Talk, get the exact same level of service you rely on now. But for about half the cost, try 30 bucks a month with Pure Talk to give you a sense of what it should be. And the 5G service is fantastic. I'm a customer. My calls don't drop.

We were just talking about both the lack of public clarity on the manifesto and Nashville and the Nashville shooting as well as now we have more information after yesterday mornings, mass shooting in the bank. But one thing that we know the White House is very focused on right away. I said they don't really get into the narrative of of the politics of the individuals when it doesn't suit the political purposes of the left, which is true, but they always get into the gun control narrative and some capacity. That's what they'll tell us. And the mayor of Louisville, Democrat mayor Craig Greenberg was saying yesterday that we have to take action on guns. So let's let's hear clip 19. Yesterday's tragedy brings us to 40 people who've been shot to death this year in our city. That level of gun violence is beyond horrific and it's beyond anything we can and will accept. We have to take action now. We need short term action to end this gun violence epidemic now. So fewer people die on our streets and in our banks, in our schools and in our churches. And for that, we need help. We need help from our friends in Frankfurt and help from our friends in Washington, D.C. This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. OK, so he says it's not partisan. All of us want no people dying from violence in this country period. That's that they won't actually allow for that good faith. Start to the conversation. Clay, it's they, the good people, the left want to stop people from being shot and killed. And we because the NRA and the Second Amendment and, you know, AR 15s and scary machine pistols and all this stuff, we don't care about the gun violence. And yet when you look at an incident like this, first of all, he wouldn't even specify what is the short term action? What is the short term action that they're really calling for? It when we have a situation, what they usually do is they call for a gun control policy that they've wanted politically for a long time, even for does nothing to do with the incident at hand, right? That's standard operating procedure for Democrats. But I would want to know, I mean, if he's really talking about the when he when he's discussing the 40 people who have been shot in the city of Louisville so far this year, Louisville has a high violent crime rate, right? I mean, I think nationally speaking, unfortunately, it's a pretty high level of shootings. I need to check that data, but just from memory, 40 sounds high for a city of that size. It's not a very large city. We're only in April. Um, almost all of those shootings are with handguns. I mean, this incident may be the only one where anyone has been killed in Louisville that involved a rifle. They're all with handguns. They're not even talking about handguns and the people who are shooting people in cities like Louisville are overwhelmingly people involved in gang and drug related activity who need to be locked up in prison for a long time. But that's not what he's calling for. What he was he he says, stop the gun violence in Louisville clay by making people like, you know, you would mean people have never broken a law, wait longer and get harassed more when they're trying to actually buy a firearm. That's about it. That's not going to play well in Kentucky. And it's also worth mentioning that this is a governor's election year in Kentucky. So when he says it's nonpartisan, this is not political. That is very effective messaging in his mind. Look, this guy was a disaster on COVID. That, look, everybody listening to me right now in Kentucky is nodding along the whole state of all of the SEC states. No state screwed up COVID more than Kentucky. Okay, period. Their kids in Louisville had to wear masks forever. They kept kids out of school forever. The entire Southeastern Conference footprint. No one was more of a disaster than Kentucky. And it's because they had this clown Democrat as their governor who won a super upset in 2019. And now there is a primary going on. There's two really good candidates at least. I'm not an expert on the Republican primary race that's going on in Kentucky. I want to make that clear. But I know that there are two really, really good candidates. And whoever the Republican is that wins needs to beat this guy, Bashir. So he is wrong on everything on COVID. And if you are listening to me right now and you are a Kentucky and I guarantee you are nodding along and this is what his angle is going to be. He's going to ignore the data just like he did on COVID. He's going to try and grandstand as if, oh, you know, this is not a part of an issue. Well, there aren't high rates of violence in Kentucky outside of Kentucky cities. Okay, that's the reality. The vast majority of Kentuckians driving around with guns in their car are super safe and using those guns to protect themselves. Meanwhile, Louisville in particular has been an abject failure when it comes to your point Buck rates of gun violence, irrespective of this mass shooting. And I always think it's important to bring this home for everybody. I wish I could wave a magic wand buck and eliminate every mass shooting that occurs in the United States. I wish I had that ability. Do you know that if we did that, 97 or 98% of all murders would still be happening in the United States. We give an inordinate amount of attention to mass shooters and to mass shootings. But the reality is most of them are criminals in cities with handguns. Let's look at the data. Louisville, city of 600,000 people. Lost 160 lives to homicide in 2022. Okay, so that's the last massive amount for city of that size. Huge first city of that size. If you were to just do some some quick math on this one, you're looking at New York City is over 10 times the size of Louisville, right? So if you just multiply that 160 by 10, you're at 1600 point being you're getting close to the worst murder rate in the history of New York City back in 1990 per capita. That's where Louisville is right now. That's what's going on in that city right now. Now he's talking about all of the gun violence. He's that he's using this. He says we had 40 people shot this year. Okay. What is more likely to bring down that number to arrest people who are involved in criminal activity in the city, irrespective, irrespective of whatever the demographic profile may be of the arrestees or to change the magazine limitation on AR 15. So that you can have a 30 round. You can only have a 10 round clip and you can have a foldable stock, for example. We all know the answer to this, but people like the mayor of Louisville and other Democrats across the country want to play the politics game while pretending to play the saving lives game. And I think people are tired of it. All you have to do is look at the data. All you do is look at the numbers. They say, why aren't you taking action on gun control? Okay. I want to see the stats. Do they prosecute and incarcerate every single convicted felon found with a firearm? Right. So they're already a felon in possession. Do they prosecute to the fullest extent of the law in Louisville? I haven't looked at it. I guarantee you the answer is no. Oh, 100% and and buck. We should also mention as everyone listening to us in Louisville right now, where I should mention we are number one in that city. As everyone knows, this is one of the cities. The reason the murder rate has skyrocketed is because of anti police sentiment, because remember, this is one of the cities where BLM was most active. And if you look at the data, the cities where BLM is the most active, see the highest rates of murder increase. Can I just add that this is even this statistic, 160 lives lost to people killed in in gun related incidents in 2022 in Louisville, an additional 400 people hit. So that's not dead, but that's getting shot or severely injured in. I mean, you're talking about a city of that's not that big. You have five, five hundred and sixty people that got either shot and killed or just shot. Remember, this is one of the cities where BLM was the most active. Didn't the mayor of Louisville himself get shot by a left wing crazed lunatic? There was some I was running for mayor. I think I don't remember. This guy who got elected will look that up because again, we're not experts in Louisville, you know, politics on a local level, but the rate of gun violence there is out of control. And it's because to your point, they have completely allowed this idea that police are the enemy. And by the way, congratulations and thank you to the police officers, many of whom responded to that mass shooting and one of whom I believe is still in critical condition. You got he got shot and it took it around in the head. Yeah. Yeah. It's still fighting for his life as I understand it. But Clay on the response to these incidents, what they do is they take Matt a mass shooting, which is highly emotionally, you know, damaging to the psyche of the, you know, you just were you went through this in Nashville. You're a Nash million and look what just happened, right? It really affects everybody, particularly who's in the vicinity of it. And then they say, we have to take action on gun violence in general. And you say, okay, well, if you're going to do that, it's actually a criminal justice issue. As in, you have to lock up people who break the law and they say, no, we're just going to do things that will annoy law abiding gun owners, tens of millions of them across the country. And this is, this is what happens every single time. And they won't do their too cowardly to do the things that would actually save laws that when you're talking about a mass shooting, by the way, overwhelmingly, the things that they discussed that are gun control measures would do absolutely nothing because the people that this guy had no criminal record in Louisville. So background check does nothing. So what else are we talking about now? Red flag laws. Good luck with that. That does nothing. Look at the limitations they want. Oh, you can't go in there with an AR 15. Some of the biggest mass shootings in history were done with pistols. But they realize that if they go after pistols, there's going to be much broader ramifications of that. And it won't just affect, you know, if they call for a pistol ban, for example, they're effectively intruding entirely on the second amendment. Anyway, they're non serious. They're non serious or unserious about addressing gun violence, but they. I love you. I just wanted to say succession. I love you, but you are not serious. People is one of the greatest lines of all time. And that's a good response here on the gun issue as well. I mean, it was a succession is a is a great show and the episode we can talk about. We come back the episode yesterday. Well, not yesterday or Sunday was was phenomenal. Um, also, by the way, it is international pet day.

Welcome back to play Travis bucks ex and chef. We come back. I'm just going to tease this. We are going to play a clip at the top of our two of a Tennessee Democrat, one of the Tennessee Democrats in the house that was kicked out of his campaign when he ran for president of I always mispronounced this school. Bowdoin is it Bowdoin college? You're the expert on these. Bowdoin college. It's a small, super liberal left wing school. This guy, this Tennessee Democrat was running for student body president there. You know what? The only way I think of Bowdoin, the only way I remember it is, am I correct that Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain? This is me being a civil war nerd. The man who held the left flank at Gettysburg at the top of Little Round Top. There's a lot of you out there like, yes, and there's a lot of you like, man, what a nerd you have no idea what I'm talking about. But he was, I believe the president of Bowdoin college. And maybe was a professor at the time, but he's one of the heroes of the battle of Gettysburg on the north side. And he was holding the flank. I'm pretty sure that he was the president of Bowdoin and maybe a professor of Bowdoin at the time. But when we play this clip for you, you are going to just, I guarantee that you're going to die laughing. And what it's going to represent is how I'm not sure that we have ever lived buck in an era filled with more performative BS on behalf of many of our politicians. I know that politicians in general are not really most of them filled with that strong of a backbone, right? They just kind of look around and float very often. There are exceptions and we try to have those people on this show regularly. But there are a lot of people who just kind of float in whatever direction the wins take them. Joe Biden would be a great example, a guy who has been a politician for 50 years and has been wrong on almost everything for 50 straight years. He you can trace this back and anyone if you think you can challenge me in this, I want to hear what issue it is. The only thing Joe Biden has been consistent on in 50 years of quote public service is saying whatever will help Joe Biden win the next election. That's it. There is no issue of principle, nothing, nothing where he has abortion, huge flip, huge change from Biden over the course of his career. Crime, huge changes. I mean, find me an issue. Civil rights, by the way, I mean, this is a guy who started out being mentored by you know, and getting a lot of praise from segregation and that whole crew. I mean, he said that Delaware, I mean, do we still have a lot of, I think that audio is even out there where he calls his kids, says he doesn't want his kids to go to school in a jungle. I mean, the guy got called out by Kamala Harris, probably the only moment of Kamala Harris's entire presidential campaign that ever registered. She got, he got called out by Kamala Harris for being opposed to busing in the 1970s because he didn't want his kids to go to school in a racial jungle. That's what he said. I mean, this guy and what buck, maybe the only thing he's ever gotten right was the 1994 crime bill, which he had to repudiate in order to get elected. But he only got right because the country was going through so much crime. I mentioned 1990 New York that people were desperate. And so it was actually popular even among Democrats in places like Delaware to stop all the disorder, anarchy and shooting. And unfortunately, you know, right now it's bad, but it's not so bad. The Democrats, I mean, we can talk about the whole foods thing at some point, the shutdown in San Francisco. They're not, they're not done suffering. They haven't suffered enough in these cities. But I guarantee you, when we come back, we're going to play this clip and you guys are going to be like, this can't be real. If SNL were actually funny, this is the skit that they would do to ridicule politicians, particularly those on the left wing in this country right now. When we come back, a clip that is going to drive you bonkers, but also make you really laugh. And then we're joined by Riley Gaines, the tee off on this absurdity of men playing women's sports, all that next hour."
