    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On demand This is the news and why why why why it matters Hi, I'm Sarah Gonzalez welcome to the news and why it matters We were just discussing how freaking cold it is in here and clearly that also matters just letting you know Let's do a top story. This is why we root for global warming on the network Top story is the incredibly Hispanic Beto O'Rourke. Yeah, his name is Robert Francis O'Rourke Jason more kashoggi news I know we've been talking about this a lot this week But it just keeps getting crazier and crazier as this goes along And I've also thought about a little bit how we can respond and some maybe moves that we can make if it in turn Find out that they you know the Saudis were responsible for this. Okay, and once again Andrew Heaton. Hello. I'm still here I haven't figured my way out of the parking lot yet. You have validated so I've just been glad to have all these blazers that I found I I am going to reach out to the many viewers in Canada and let them know that they're free to buy wheat now It's now legal there. Oh, we will we do have a very large Canadian fan base I thought about coming to the Canadian Bureau It's mainly because I'm a Canadian sports celebrity Yeah, everyone knows that A lot to get to before we do want to thank our sponsor my patriot supply My patriot supply is there when you really really are in dire need of food So if your wife goes out of town And no, is that not Hopelessly single but this also If you're living in bachelor city Because I don't know where to get a trash can so this will be this will be very helpful to me Yes, so but in all seriousness, you know, we just had that hurricane That in Dallas it feels like it's it's not going to stop raining ever And there's some flooding that's gone along with that But you know you think about hurricanes you it's flooding you lose power You don't have a refrigerator anymore. You don't have food that's available. So what do you do? The thing with my patriot supply too is like it has the Glen side of it like I'm a prepper I'm gonna get all this stuff, you know, and then it has the me side of it Which is like, you know, maybe if I have a couple packs of soy sauce I'm like pretty happy with myself for preparation wise this you could knock it out one quick call Knock out 95% of all emergencies with this two-week pack that they have and you're like, you know, you'll have you'll have it there You hopefully you never even need to open it, but what you do it actually tastes good Which is kind of a nice benefit to yeah, and the cost is amazing So right now you can go to preparewithnews.com and you can get likes to said two weeks of emergency food supplies So that's breakfast lunch and dinner 75 bucks. That's cheaper than taking the family out for one night out to eat So go to preparewithnews.com all right stew Robert Francis over work. Yes, Ted Cruz had a Raphael Cruz Either one of the music actual names, which is it makes a lot of sense with politicians But yes Ted Cruz and Robert Francis over work when at it Can we maybe we start with the Spanish clip can we start there because this is I just can't take it I wanted to bang my head against a wall. It's so funny because in reality like you know Ted Cruz is named Ted because Partially to separate himself from his father who is very active in politics as well But partially just because you know like Ted is like a thing that people in Texas are named right like isn't it just a nickname for Edward Yes, yeah, right. It's Raphael Edward Cruz I tell you Roosevelt was probably Edward Roosevelt right but Raphael is his first name like so most people get called by you know Their first name and it's like you okay well he took it and he uses Edward in the name of Ted and Who cares right on the other side is Beto, which is his name is Robert Francis over work and like There's a there's an element of like people use these things for the the demographic they're going for right like you're your politician in Texas Ted's probably really workable unless you're democrat in Texas then Beto's much better than Robert Francis over or here is Robert Francis Orok giving it a little bit taste of his Spanish first Jason Let me thank you and Sarah for moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here And the people of Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes It's one or is that a key comes status both right? That's a key in San Antonio now people are saying that's pandering. I disagree. I think it just slipped into it This is what he's like at home. He's constantly just talking in both languages standard now I think you have to do a different language every debate Like if he does it every time and we're like that guy's mostly lingual we should elect him He can go like he can be so you know talk to the other folks when you're that Hispanic. Yeah, it is this flows More than 100% Hispanic I believe and I think both we both noticed is the other thing too with that The first thing I could notice is just he was so shiny. Why was he so shiny? He was the most shiny person I've ever seen on television You know they had to have had a makeup person that went to powder him and he said no no no right now I need to remain shiny or maybe he said he said yes But he said it in Spanish and they didn't understand that could have been in He reminds me of the shooter McGavin of politics. Yeah, yeah It's like he's all like talking about how great the water is you know And that's what's making everybody but behind closed doors and the cameras off. He's he hates old people and he's kicking dogs Fine kind of so I'm I'm new to Texas. I got my voter registration. I'm gonna be voting I also I am an independent and I I've been no knee for man nor party So I don't know how I'm gonna vote and it's not like a wink wink much. No such things like I don't know these candidates well enough yet So I'm I I've not completed watching this but I want to watch it and kind of say I guess that you all are not on team But here's a question for you. So do you like? Democratic socialism not a big fan You're probably bet I was probably not your guy. Okay, although I also want to throw it like I watch this They didn't let in a libertarian like like which which I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with the parties of Texas in terms of Democrats Republicans I wish they were in favor of competitive elections and actual democracy and they're not good on that issue I mean Texas is I think good on most issues I'm a huge fan of the state and I never want to leave it and only want to go out for like a visit to anyone But like enough you can do it. I can kind of just kind of you kind of the same But they are not good with the second, you know, it's it's hard to you know to get on the ballots It's not they don't make it easy which is a real shame. I mean why not give people choices, you know I'm a big fan of what they did in Maine Right choice. Well the ranked choice voting which I think is hopefully they're testing it there and it does well and people like it because That's a real solution to this you can you could vote for your top choice and not feel like oh I'm letting down the you know the candidate has the chance to win I think they do that in France to although we shouldn't tell Texas. I don't feel like What's it up to you and then I'm gonna want the pen to be one yeah That let me give you this one clip. This is one of the amazing things because O'Rourke really is a National celebrity for no discernible reason He he's made a couple of good viral videos that have gone out there and he's raised almost all of his money from outside of the state Now he's become a national figure he skateboards. He does skateboard through water burger. We did learn that at one point You know There's a lot of other Republican candidates have great stories too that are younger or have more I mean his story was he was in a band and like he got into politics and he's been in politics for a long time And now he's in Congress and you know he's younger and good-looking. I guess and like people you know like it. Okay I'll leave that one up to you Me being from Oklahoma at least a few years ago Democrats in Oklahoma were functionally third party Because like an Oklahoma Democrat was when I was there was about like a main Republican Is that the same in Texas or does it vary? I'm get if he's if he's a Bernie Sanders type guy He would not fit that bill. No, he and he really is far the last couple of elections This is with Wendy Murphy wasn't it? Wendy Murphy the last one when he Davis. That's when he Davis as I'm thinking somebody else Wendy Davis ran and she was like a very Heart, you know her big issue was she was super duper duper duper pro Choice and she was kind of famous for a big protest that she did and they've been running these candidates that are you know Pretty super far left lately. I guess I mean I guess they're just trying to they're playing demographics And it does help them raise a lot of money So I think like part of the charm of of Beto or Robert Francis or work to the rest of the country is here's this guy in Texas And he sounds like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but she's he's saying it in in Texas I mean that's it's brave and I and there's something I he's marketing it a little bit differently He is definitely he's not saying I'm a Democratic socialist I want all these things that Ocasio-Cortez wants, but if you really look at what his plan is Bernie Sanders healthcare Even if you're even if you're for that kind of thing gets The math doesn't add up right but he's he has done a good job of disguising Where he really stands with and he's taken a bit of a page from the Trump playbook Which is he's jumped into some of these cultural divides on the side that the left likes for example the kneeling thing He's probably his most famous moment was a viral video about him talking about how it's okay to kneel in the Info ball, which by the way government has absolutely nothing to do with it and should have absolutely no I should never hear a freaking word from any government official about sports. I never ever in my I don't ever want to hear it. I love sports. I never want to hear a word from any of them about it So, you know, but I mean it helps you raise money So really the thing he's known for his entire story is he was able to raise a lot of money 38 million dollars this last quarter the all-time record for any senator at any time for a quarter He I mean and now that's a huge number The bad news about that is he beat Rick Lazio in New York who also raised a lot of money And then got his butt kicked by Hillary Clinton, so it's not necessarily leads to wins, but it's a huge number It's really impressive. He's out raising crews like crazy Which is why this next clip is just just drove me nuts It's a better talking about crews and corporate interests and for senator Cruz to say that this isn't gonna bust the budget at a time of 21 trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year He voted to add two trillion dollars and those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash And the already wealthy in a country that has driven with income inequality unseen since the last yielded age Why in the days just before and just after that vote senator Cruz accepted 120 thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this tax cut Why does he vote for this? Why does he vote for internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent? Why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses? 30,000 people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee Contributions to senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become So, you know a the idea that Ted Cruz is supporting gun rights or lower taxes over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars It was really on the fence on that one. Yeah, I know it was not a good news. I was gonna come down All right like there's a chicken and egg situation here, right? Like people people who want low taxes donate to Ted Cruz because he's been for low taxes for a very long time These are not surprising issues the idiocy of acting as if the NRA Donation from the NRA or some pack associated with the NRA is making Ted Cruz become pro gun is nuts He's been pro gun ever since he's been in the public eye ever since he was a child. I mean if you look at his life story But beyond this like there's this weird thing that goes on with money in politics that drives me crazy and it's the idea that who is responsible and and and what is What is the role of everybody else talking about how you spend your own money? If you have money and you want to spend it on political speech that is 100% You're right It is I think very clear example of what the founders intended Which is you get to do with your money when it comes to political speech? We're never going to censor you and the idea that some billionaire can't spend all the billions he wants to on political races to me It feels wrong. I can understand what people say what they're buying elections, but it's up to us to vote We are the ones doing it and it's the same thing in in Congress if if the NRA tomorrow somehow finds a way with our current laws Which I think are completely unconstitutional when it comes to campaign finance reform But if if some if they come in they decide to give Ted Cruz 700 billion dollars tomorrow. Let's just say they come up with it It's up to Ted Cruz to vote how Ted Cruz believes is right and then we have a chance to vote him out of office Is their responsibility lobbyists can't cast votes? I don't care how many you have it's an annoying world I have to bring up presidents Gingrich and Romney purchasing the election, right? Billionaire backing in they want yeah Wait, we'll get back to that in just a minute I have some some news to break to you, but the same thing with Hillary Clinton like Hillary Clinton outspend Trump bike Gobs and gobs and gobs and gobs. I'm underspinned virtually every part I think every single Republican at the moment you do the data at yeah Exactly like this is not about money. You can't buy elections in this country Yes, you can get yourself on TV if you're an unknown you can get yourself to being known But I mean in a lot of ways that's antiquated right like these races are all super high profile There these people are in your face all the time the news and politics are interface all the time You can be aware of who a good candidate is and regardless of this it is my money If I want to if I want to waste it so that Beto O'Rourke can run another stupid ad so he can lose by Six six points instead of seven that is my right as an American citizen and those ads are everywhere And now they are you know I have a YouTube on you there are commercials on YouTube You know there's annoying things that pop up in the middle really like he'll all of a sudden better We'll show up in the middle of a cat video It's just it is a lot of cat videos by the way Like in the in the debate they talked about they hinted at you know campaign finance law like like Beto said that He was not taking any money from packs and Cruz rightly pointed out that packs are still operating on it's a whole point of Right. Exactly. Point of packs is that you can say they're pushing in and that's yeah exactly and that's one of the the major unintended side effects of the McCain-Fengall legislation that happened was that rather than having one campaign actually Determining the messaging or hopefully keeping it civil and honest is no longer able to do that now There's all these aggregate things that are working autonomously and independently and then the other thing is I think the more you restrict that that campaign Spending the more you're gonna get dumb trumps and people that know how to game the media because you can you can go make You can go get media attention. That's not hard to do You do it by saying crazy stuff and mean stuff. Yeah, and you know if you if you have all being a big celebrity Yeah, right. I mean like that it it incentivizes Campaigns or parties to try to run celebrities because you can get so much free media. It's it's really it's just not right like trying to Micro-manage People's political speech. I thought we all agreed was a bad thing in this country I really did and you know you see the way that and I'm sure Beto if you asked him about it would tell you how evil the Citizens United ruling was which was it wasn't even a ruling it was just tell you it was in the Constitution like they were They it's it was not a new thing These are these are very basic ideas and we're still totally on the wrong side of this the all of these campaign finance laws are are Terrible there are every one of them's unconstitutional when you're trying to micro-manage How someone spends their money on political speech? It's like a fundamental thing we were trying to do in this country to make sure people were able to speak their mind and you know And use their resources which at their it's their time with their their speech their credibility their money all of these things As they want to when it comes to political speech and the fact that we still micromanage that is is an embarrassment Yeah, I want to get to Cush Cushoggy, but let's take a break real quick before we get so can you just agree? Are we going to Shoggy or Cushoggy? Shoggy, right? I keep hearing Cushoggy. I've heard Cushoggy. I've started on CNN today to show you Well, that was your first mistake Glenn Beck is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country But at least we can all go down laughing Glenn Beck's live be addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall A lot of crazy stuff going on with Saudi Arabia, but before we get into all of that one of the things our sponsor I target pro I am pretty sure that I have one on the way in the mail and I know you have one I'm super excited about it. Yes, it's the laser gun. What you want one? Why don't I get one? Well, you get one and I don't get one. I don't understand. I have all the things that everyone else has Well, first of all you could go on the website and pay for it, too I love that idea. Okay. I mean can I use your card? No, it just expensive. Okay, yeah, good idea So Jason you could probably speak to this the most because you are a firm believer in iTucker pro You've used it extensively. Yeah, we actually I did a little class here that we've been we're playing it right now Those of you watching on TV such a cool product So basically what it is is it uses your existing handgun and it comes with like multiple different calibers But you but it's got like a little thing in the back where the firing pin hits the hits the round and that pushes this little laser That shows up on a target and you get the app And it'll show it So like if you're like you should dry firing if you can either go to the right you can either go to the range and like You know improve your skills or you can dry fire in your home So basically it makes it to where you're not you know, you're doing proper, you know trigger control You're not squeezing it and moving it's extremely extremely important to maintain your skills. It's also pretty boring. It can be Yeah, it can be unless you're putting like we used to put like a little a pin a penny or a dime on the end And if it fell off that mean you're you know, you're doing it That's the way that our grand our granddad's did it but no longer with iTucker pro now We got lasers and stuff freaking laser beams So what you do is you set up your target. I do this with my kids You set up your target you can go all the way across the room and you can even make it into a game You're practicing your skills and you can make it into a game I've also helped my kids to teach them how you know profit firearm safety as well. Yeah, it's just a cool product Yeah, so you can save 10% right now with offer code news go to iTarget Pro I'm so pumped to get mine alright Jason the latest on kashoggi. This is I'm getting kind of like PTSD from the cavern all stuff See when I think it's not gonna get crazier than the next day happens and it gets crazier But now so the the latest news and I'm having a hard time in keen keeping up with all this But we knew that there was a supposedly video and audio I have my doubts in the video ultimately this comes down to whether tur is turkey lying or not I mean they definitely have a dog at a imagine that right? They would never So supposedly this is the the audio has leaked to suba newspaper, which is also online And I know It's supposedly they have it but they haven't released it yet I don't know if that's it's probably under order or it doesn't exist or who knows what maybe they're writing a big expose on it But supposedly the contents on that detail a seven minute long Torture session and execution seven minutes long they say the audio picks up to where you hear him being dragged out of the Consulars office the main office you also hear the consular saying hey you guys don't do that and here you're gonna get me in trouble And then the guy that's doing the execution says if you want to live, you know, you'll sit down and shut up basically Then it goes on there's also so apparently a witness that heard the screams coming from but seven it took seven minutes to when they finally You they said they could hear them injecting him with something so that the screams stopped and they continued to dismember him after that Oh god the most horrific thing ever and here's my question though is All I've heard the speculation that the audio would have come from his Apple Watch Is that right cuz what I mean where where they gonna get audio like who's going to record that? Okay, so that that's rumor Yeah He pressed record on his Apple watch when he walked in and that went to the cloud And then he did give his I guess of his phone. Yes, whatever to a Turkish saying I thought was that who it was Or yeah, and he was and she was supposed to take it to a Turkish official that he knew or something like that Something like that. It's either that or I don't know how much I can say about this on the air. Oh, but there are Multiple ways one specific that you can get video and audio that most nation states use against every embassy in the world It's very part But most most most nation states in their embassies have safeguards against that countermeasures But it's possible a Saudi consulate didn't have that but every single one of them is under this type of surveillance Okay, this is very very possible. Okay, maybe you bugged their consulate or that we that not us but the the turds were probably Using some kind of surveillance and they really do in that case, right? Okay, okay because the Apple Watch thing had me stumped I read an article about Just the safeguards in place that most embassies have that would prevent the Apple Watch from being The audio leak so you know just the radio frequencies and all of that So I was a little bit confused as to how they would have audio but what you just said makes a lot more sense I think it could be either or of it was just one of the things I think is weird about this is we keep getting all these details with no No, like we never like from Turkish official three days ago I think it was CNN came out and said the Saudis are gonna come out and they're going to admit This was an interrogation got wrong. They still have not admitted it all of this is reports It seems to me almost all of them come from Turkish officials would have their incentivize to Say bad things about the Saudis. I'm not saying the Saudis are good. They're not But it is a I feel like there's no reason for us in this particular Situation to rush to Judgment I Pro I you know again complete guess think this stuff probably does go down because you know It just seems like it does But I mean outside of outside of hearing a few reports from here and there and this guy not you know being around anymore We don't know what happened yet, and it's it's unlike a situation where there's a You know a terrorist is planning an attack or there's a nuclear You know a possibility or whatever it is this is one where they're you know They're really bad and we may put sanctions on them. We may not you know, but it's not there's not an impending Additional danger to in the United States of America because of this if they did something wrong we need to take Steps to show how much we don't like it. I think but that's that's really it's that this is not one more We need to rush to to do something drastic You know we just have to make sure that we get try to get to the bottom of it I mean again more facts better than less I'm assuming that it that it does come out that it was true What do you think that the ramifications will be see Glenn asked me something similar yesterday? And I thought about it for a while the problem is we really need the Saudis we really need the Saudis Multiple we don't really get our oil from there anymore. We get it from South America It's true, but we rely on the Saudis to help regulate the markets So which they pay a very big role in that so and I'll get more on that in a second But also, I mean economically we'll take a hit on this as well They account for about almost 20% of our that's how much military equipment we sell to them So about 20% of how much money you know the billions and billions of dollars we make on global Arm cells. I know we should knock that off. So that's it Martin's doing fine It's gonna make new flying jets and flying tanks and whatnot of a despotic theocratic Autocracy from arm sales we have flying tanks is that a is that a it should be a thing? A blimp to a tank and then billing the American people for 40 billion But but there's there's other reasons to like they are a significant check to Iran So they're they're part of like not only them, but it's not just the Saudis It's also the rest of the Gulf kingdoms around there that are all basically one and all allied with each other We rely on them to help contain Iran not only that but the other multiples your hottest groups that are in the area So it's good to have I don't want to say friendly but convenient relationship with the Saudis But one thing is we can't just go around throwing out sanctions because I again that they have levers that they can use to hurt Us as well. This is what I would do Hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna we're gonna tease this. Oh What Jason is going to do you get a fix problem. I hear that later on in the show We'll be right back. You're gonna drop flying tanks on the market Tanks, loop tanks copyright energy Up next enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why it matters Available exclusively for podcast listeners and blaze premium subscribers become a premium subscriber at the blaze.com Alright Jason let's pick back up where we left off on what you think that we should do Should all of this going on in Saudi Arabia be true. All right, so if I'm Not Stephen Miller if I'm Pompeo I guess or anyone anyone competent around the president. This is what I'm probably going to advise them to do now I don't think that we should throw out sanctions although I would love sanctions on them I think they deserve sanctions. I just wouldn't do it because there's a lot of stuff at stake I Personally would read would revisit a 2007 bill that never that actually got voted on both the house and the Senate But President Bush decided to threat he threatened to veto it and never went anywhere But it was the no-peck bill. You guys remember that no pick. I don't know so it stands for no petroleum exporting and operating or whatever cartels so basically what it would what it did was it opened it got rid of the Protection the sovereignty that the nation states had to where we couldn't go after them for antitrust lawsuit So it got rid of that So if OPEC or anybody else would want to take their place wanted to try and set and mess with the prices Do price controls on oil then we could actually go after them and sue them now. I Personally love the idea I OPEC Pretty much naturally has already pretty much dug their grave on that I don't think they have the power to set the prices as they once did But they still can't and this is something that the president has actually come out and and accused the both the Russians and the Saudis of doing This was just like few few months ago. He was he was talking about how they were doing this But it is something that they're still doing and it's still things that are like right I mean you think like we are record production oil There's no reason why we should be paying like in Texas like 250 for a gallon of gas But price manipulation is happening. So I think that they could go back to this. It's already been voted on I think I think it would easily get bipartisan support and President Troke could sign off on it. He could he would both be looking at something that he would be Coming through on something that he's already criticized them with It would also help the consumers American consumers also help out American oil oil producers But it would also look like he's being tough on them And also basically the effect would be it would be an ascension on them It would it in effect be a sanction without us having to actually say you are sanctioned. So that's what we do Hmm. Okay, so Just call up Trump Dial them up and just let them know call me. Unfortunately, they they just watch on TV. They're not on overtime So they didn't they missed the whole We would have solved the whole problem, but that's why I teased it so that they now they signed up Because they want to have that Twitter guarantee. He'll see that All right Andrew the legalization of marijuana in Canada, so our neighbors in Canada They passed the legislation to legalize marijuana a few months ago that came in with the Trudeau government was one of the things he He ran on but it is now as of today Wednesday. It is officially legal for all adults in Canada to purchase marijuana the individual provinces are setting the Actual age at which you purchase it. I think Quebec setting it at 21 because Quebec The other ones are doing whatever they want and I say hats off to Canada. I think that's a wonderful thing I think I don't smoke pot, but you probably should I'm usually funnier to people that have been And and you know like it's not your body if you do it in your garage or you do it yourself It's just do whatever you want. That's fine. So I think it's great. I wish we would emulate them more There's still a in the United States what we've been doing the last the last few years starting with the Obama administration is We're kind of turning a blind eye to states that want to legalize marijuana But it's still illegal under federal law It's just we're not enforcing it and that makes it very difficult for marijuana businesses to do any business with banks It makes it very difficult for them to do any trance state commerce We can't really invest in anything because the SEC is not going to validate a business which is in violation of federal law So we we're very much lagging behind Canada in this a phrase that does not thrill me But they're there they're beating us to it and you know hats off to them I hope that we fall asleep and if you're a chief you own a cheeto factory. Yes straight north right today It's amazing how far we've come on this so very quickly I mean this is something that was a I feel like a pretty controversial topic not more than 10 years ago, but the polls I mean have come in a long way to the point and now it's over It's a majority of people in the United States. Just wanted legalized around 16% like it was around 1990 That's like around 61% just like I mean Really like like it came out the Bill Clinton like smoke marijuana while in college. Yeah, oh my god Is he still high? Probably attack people with a crowbar. I saw that black and white film at my high school It's at your point though Andrew. We were in California And I'll say this about about the argument quickly before we get to this California is a great example of it at the time and that medical marijuana was kind of being debated before that was really I mean that's been overwhelmingly popular for I think I think a long time But there was that debate period where people were talking about medical marijuana and the argument against medical marijuana was always It's gonna be a slippery slope. There has never been a more true argument than that. It was absolutely a slippery slope I mean the idea when before it was a league it is legal in California now, right? Yeah, I know but for a long time it was just medical that was legal and it was you had a good of a guy in a van Yeah, you're like telling me your elbow kind of hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Oh gosh Yes, I mean it was absolutely ridiculous and in and so that argument was absolutely correct from people who oppose it I mean it's never been something that I've cared about Opposing in any way, but it was interesting to see when we were there. There was a Couple people on our staff and I don't want to bring up names I went to a a one of these dispensers there's one of these medical dispensers and One of the interesting things about it was with the banking thing these these these businesses are making fortune Yeah, and they can't do anything with their money and one of the things they are doing cars that they get absolutely hired Yeah, that's a big part of it and to to essentially let's let's not call it laundering but to not to clean the money They'll buy a house with cash and then list the house immediately on the market again And then sell the housing then they can put that money into the bank. So like the next plot to Ozark See I don't particularly I'm a scotch man. That's where that's where I damage my body So I don't really let me yourself to just one I have many I'll call it my just just the top But I don't particularly what it's about I would love to invest in that entrepreneur that person that's like I'm gonna Pay a doctor and a van to like give out a shit I'm gonna take their money and then I'm gonna buy a house car I'm like that's gonna beat the market just to play just to play devil's advocate for a second here though Stu you mentioned the medicinal use being a slippery slope, but so couldn't could you not make the argument that? Just having marijuana be legal would be a slippery slope to you know, they always call it a gateway drug Oh, well, I think I think you could I mean I think the main thing and this is one of the things Trudeau ran on That has has been a an argument for legalizing marijuana for a long time is that you you are you are removing that black market Element which is very important because right now, you know if you're in actually, Oklahoma Just legalized medical marijuana, which blew my mind But three years ago if you wanted to get marijuana in Oklahoma yet to go to a drug dealer And and that meant that drug dealer while you were there might go Hey, if you like pot have you tried ecstasy or something like that, right? And so you're you're removing that you know, I do think what it probably will do is I do think it's going to kind of break this hard-blind Dare to keep kids off drugs definition of drugs that like drugs is everything but alcohol and caffeine. It's gonna it's gonna Kind of atrophy that a little bit, but I think that's a positive thing I think what we need to be doing with with all drugs is shifting away from a national conversation of how do we punish this to How do we treat it like a medical issue? You know heroin and all these things these are medical issues people have problems and we need to have that conversation But but I know I'm not terribly worried about it just leading to rampant drug use And I always hate that argument anyway when anybody in government or anyone that is anti-pro legalization for marijuana It's not it's not their place, you know to say well, this is a gate-rate drug and we want to keep this we're not babies I think we can manage ourself. We can govern ourself on this. Yeah, that's not your place to do that I will say I will say I did read that Colorado in Colorado after they legalized marijuana. There was a 48% increase in Traffic deaths weed related traffic deaths Actually said it would be a criminal issue we'd related but well, but but there's not a reliable way to test people Was there a less amount of alcohol related traffic? Right certainly more right and but since legalization. Yeah, it's just increased You're saying right it's increased and they're finding that there's not really a great way to test people to see whether or not Longer two doesn't it is yeah, and metabolizes differently. Yeah, so Look, I mean the bottom line is the federal government should have absolutely no role in these things I mean, you know states I think can can make their choices I would generally side on the idea that people should be able to do what they want to their own bodies long as they're hurting others Which are already crimes like right, you know crashing into people is already a crime But you know the federal government it's insane. I mean there's no way the founders I mean you look at it wasn't even contemplated at the time that you would start banning plants and again I don't this is not a tax Whiskey tax read to a rebellion or led to a Tax whiskey okay revolution part two. Yeah, I mean it's true and I don't It's not something that's I don't it's always been one of those issues like you know libertarians talk about this a lot And I'm generally a libertarian leading conservative is how I would consider myself But they lead with pot a lot and it's it's always been one of those things that yeah, I agree But I'm not going out and protesting I just don't care like it's not it's not an important issue to me It's not a passion issue, but it is a freedom issue Yeah, I'm not like again It doesn't really affect me personally although what it does do is the the war on drugs takes my money and flushes it down the toilet It ruins a lot of lives and that's the thing that I'm really concerned about I've always been so confused on why the libertarian party has not picked up any traction And I think a lot of people that would might be republicans that could switch libertarians all they think about is You know the stowelier pro hookers pro drugs and then the open borders thing Which that kind of holds me back from it But I wonder if and it's an interesting maybe thing to look at like now that the stigma on drugs is starting to in pot It's starting to go away. I don't know what the same thing is gonna happen to prostitution or whatever But I wonder if since that's kind of diminishing a wonderful libertarian parties and I get more relevant I don't I don't think it's that the pot element turns people off of the libertarian party I think the problem from from kind of a marketing perspective is that there's a different There's a difference in thinking between conservative republicans and libertarians and democrats These are three different tracks of thought and for the last 10 20 years the narrative has been oh It's half republican half-democrat and that just doesn't appeal to people is like it's it's purple But it's not really it's kind of its own thing You know you and your body and it's you know the arguments aren't being based on like who's the traditional minority or anything like that So we'll see I don't know so do you support legalization of all drugs? I'd be open to it I mean like my main thing again is I want it to be a medical thing rather than a criminal thing I don't know that you know I think if we just went everything's 100% legal and that's it We're not gonna talk about it any further than that I think there would be some unintended consequences from that I will say that I am 100% for anyone over the age of 80 doing whatever they want if you die if you die from a heroin overdose at 85 That is metal Well done. What about you still? I mean I I am We did a show we were talking about it off here a little bit with kind of both sides of the drug legalization argument We had Jacob Sullivan from Reason who was there and I we had another guy who was made a you know a good case for why these things need to be controlled I certainly believe that the federal government should have absolutely no role in it So I mean I guess that is technically saying all drugs should be legal I do think that if you know if Utah wants to have a different choice I think you know you have to look at that and I think that I think what you would find immediately is probably all 50 states ban heroin Right like I mean, but I do think that it's one of those things where The way we look at it is is is wrong It should not be a federal government issue in the first place and fundamentally that's the more important aspect of this We all we know there are already things that are illegal that are incredibly damaging and like you mentioned unintended side effects Yeah, so the same thing that happens with french fries and the same things that happens with With alcohol and the same thing that happens with all sorts of various vices tobacco and everything there Those are situations where we just want to limit the The abuse that other people would have to deal with in that sort of situation But I you know I don't even like the idea where they're like, oh, we should legalize it in tax it and regulate it Yeah, well, I don't want taxing a regulation on anything else. What do I want it on that? Yeah, people should be able to do what they want with their age restrictions Yeah, I mean, I think it read restrictions is a sensible is a sensible thing That would be the one regulated regulation that I could see I think that's what you think that you think that 21 is too old Too old for what pot? Yeah, because you mentioned back. Yeah, I I High school party at Andrews house. Yeah You know, honestly I don't I would it seems to me that they're just kind of dragging their feet on that if you could show me scientific data And I don't know if you could show me data that like you know Alcohol you really shouldn't probably drink till you're 23 and because it doesn't hit all Like I you know, I look I had a power hour in the millvarados And I'm not want to talk here But if you could if you can make a really good But but there to its I it seems to me so unlikely that that's gonna be effective that it's probably if you're gonna let 22 year olds Smoke pot and everybody below that now has to make friends with a dorky 22 year old It's willing to sell pot to a 17 year old. It might just be better to legalize it at 18 or something Yeah, there are some major restrictions. You'd be just yeah, I would know I don't think like 40 year olds Be smoking pot or the thing like that. You know, I'm fine with tobacco being restricted and that kind of thing. I thought you're gonna say you're Smoking cigarettes are super cute cigars. That's not cigarettes cigars though. That's it's eloquent Jason Yeah, I'm I totally agree with stew completely on board I don't think the federal government has any voice at all and he say it all and telling people what they can do or not do with their bodies I'm all for the not full-on legalization as far as the full term is but decriminalization I guess because I do think that There should be I hate all regulation pretty much in general for everything But I don't think that yeah if there was like an 18, you know, you know age limit or whatever I just don't want like a seven year old walking into it. Yeah, I'm purchasing some reasonable things that could happen You know, I don't I don't want meth vending machines That's not the way forward forming right. Oh, it would be interesting. I'm good business. It would be a fun week. Yeah You have a lot to talk about But but then also you know, let's say let's say a 17 year old when he's supposed to an 18 year old bought it I don't think it should be the same type of sentence that it is today where someone goes to prison for 10 years or something ridiculous You know, it's come on it's ridiculous, but decriminalization. Yes. Yeah Before we go, I do want to play Ted Cruz when he was I guess departing from the the debate He was met with some they were really really big Ted Cruz fans. Okay, and uh, let's watch It was a victory for women in America. You think they're putting a sexual assault her on the court isn't it for women? Thank you, sir. God bless you. So you believe in men assault women. That's what your vote passed today. So I believe in due process Lots of women were out there talking about their stories Do you believe in a man lying about his alcohol to in front of the senate and perjury? Do you believe in perjury? Thank you for expressing your first amendment rights So why do you support a man that abuses women? Shame on you, Ted Cruz You Ted Cruz shame on you Ted Cruz I just have to say hats off to Ted Cruz. I don't understand how he stays so calm with that I mean he's on propanolol or something Seriously, I don't understand because I'm watching it and my blood is just boiling And what like I got like again like like I'm I don't know how I'm gonna vote, but that doesn't endear me to the anti-cruise side No, it's like I'm like, okay. I don't like loud noises. That's kind of my political disposition. Whoever's screaming I don't really want to hang out with them and uh, yeah It's a it's an odd thing too. It's like, you know, this is a common Refrain of a lot of people in that Kavanaugh situation, which was a really unfortunate accusation for anyone who thought Kavanaugh should be confirmed Was that we believed that she was assaulted but just didn't care? It's not at all. I mean, I think a lot of people believed in due process a lot of people believe well, there's just not a lot of evidence Maybe I don't even believe her accusation specifically, but that does not mean we certainly didn't believe it and just brush it off That's that's that's not what happened. Do you believe in men? Lying about alcohol. I do believe in that.
