    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, the latest on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Fauci says you may need yet another booster. What is that? The hundredth? I don't know. We will get to all of that and more and it all starts right now. Hey, happy Monday. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined I look. It is a full table today, which means I am very, very happy. I am joined by three people today, Jakubuians, host of the bottom line by Jakubuians. Yes, it is a new show that you have just debuted. So everyone needs to go and find it. Where can they find it? YouTube. Second episode is today. Probably go out to rumble as well, but YouTube right now. Yeah, yeah. Check it out. It's really amazing guest. You're not going to want to miss it. You're really not going to want to miss it. Also joined by Jason Buttral, chief researcher of the Glenn Beck program, who I guess, I mean, you should probably not miss him either if he's around and... On a Monday, there must be some calamity happening. He's around and you happen to have the time. You can check him out. Also joined by Amy Robbins, CEO of Alexa Ethletica, which you need for your women who carry, because she offers these leggings and just a plethora of options for women who carry and need to carry in their clothing. They are the best of the best. Thank you very much. And men too. Men, you're right. You did not exclude with the joggers. You don't discriminate. Oh, Alexa Ethletica. And they are... Every time I see the men in that, I'm like, these are so comfortable looking. God, you men get all the comfort. I really waited decades for comfortable quality. All right. So let's get to the headlines of the day. So Jason, you mentioned you're not here on Wednesday. You're here on Monday. Right. We brought Jason in because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Obviously, he is one of our foreign intelligence experts. And what that means is that I don't actually know much about foreign relations. And here's the thing. I don't pretend like I do. Okay. So whenever there is something that is foreign relations related, I try to go to Jason, if not just in my ear, telling me what's going on here, what do I actually need to know because I don't trust CNN to tell me the full scope. I try to get him on the program. So Jason, obviously, I read over the weekend that, well, we were no stranger. We covered on the program, how Joe Biden handled the question about Russia and Ukraine, whether or not, you know, America would do anything if Russia invaded Ukraine. Joe Biden was very soft, very weak in his response. He said, well, look, if there's a full-scale invasion, obviously we would not be in favor of that. But if there's a minor incursion, you know, I mean, whatever happens, happens. That's not the quote. But that was the, that was kind of what he was saying. Am I wrong? An attitude. Yeah, that was the attitude in which he presented his response. So that kind of led to this layout of, you know, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, what actually was happening. There was a lot of pushback on that. So I think the State Department got a lot stronger than they were planning on getting. But Jason, why don't you give us kind of the layout of what actually is transpiring in Ukraine and why it's important? Yeah, first of all, there are no minor incursions. Invasions happen. If Canada invades the McDonalds and the Washington-Canada border, it's an invasion. You just lost that territory. And plus you would have lost McDonalds. Maybe that's even worse. If they invaded a Taco Bell, I'm going to war. That's all there is. So there's two sides of this coin, right? It's significant, right? So we started looking at this. It was 50,000 troops to begin with. We were like, oh crap, what are they doing? But they said potentially it could go to 70,000, even 100,000. Well, now there's 100,000 troops on the border. They intend to do something. Now, my gut reaction, this is what my gut reaction is. In 2014, Russia basically already controlled Crimea. They just solidified it and said, yeah, we're just stealing it, right? We're taking it. And then they sent the little green men into eastern Ukraine, not by Russia's order at all. They didn't have anything to do with it. I think Putin said, well, they're just, you know, if Russians are on vacation and decide to go take some territory, that's on them. No, I mean, this was orchestrated by Russia. And they were setting it up for later down the road to where after everything was solidified, they could basically do the same thing they did with Crimea and just say, okay, yeah, we're annexing this part of Ukraine. That's my gut reaction. That's what they're prepared for. The troops who are a big show of force to where if anybody wants to do anything at all, the troops are there. But I think the troops will formally walk in and say, yeah, this is ours. That might not happen. Something else could happen diplomatically to change things. The big thing now is why it's so confusing is, you know, so you've got like, you've got your groups of GOP like Tucker Carlson that basically kind of say, yeah, Russia's not doing anything wrong. Well, yeah, if they're taking land that doesn't belong to them, they're doing something wrong. But then you've got another group that says, you know, I think in, and I'm speaking from the GOP side, they're criticizing Biden and in criticizing Biden for not doing anything, people are misinterpreting it as in, oh, we'll look at these neocons, these, you know, warmongers, they're advocating for sending in US troops. That's what we're doing at all. I'm in the middle to where I think that there's things that I don't want US troops to go there at all. I don't care what happens on the US troops to go there at all. We're not the world's police. Exactly. And we got to stop that. I mean, that's something that we've kind of, you know, we're still treating foreign policy like it's 1960, 1970, as if we're fighting another superpower and we're not anymore. But I think there's things that we could have done, like Nord Stream 2, right? We've heard about that. They lifted the sanctions and said, okay, go ahead and build. Well, can you, for the viewers who don't know, this was the oil pipeline that we voluntarily were like, oh, it's fine. You guys can run this. We won't give any sanctions. We won't charge anything. You can just, you can just do it. Am I, is that accurately characterized? Right. And the reason that they did that, or the reason Russia built that pipeline is because now the main pipeline runs to Ukraine. Right. So that means they cannot attack Ukraine. They needed to build another one. So we knew what, well, we foreshadowing, like, oh, they ever want to try and move into Ukraine, they'd need another pipeline. That's what they did. Biden administration just kind of handed that to them. But there's- While shutting down the Keystone pipeline, which would only benefit, right, which would really benefit Americans and Canadians. Right. On that point, Jason, such a key point to make there, for me, my concern is we're kind of in no man's land. Biden has put us in no man's land at the moment. I told you before the show, my biggest concern is that he sends troops there. He undermances them. He underpowers them and Americans die because he's going to have, you know, what do this thing because he's not- We shouldn't send troops. A proper foreign policy would be, hey, call NATO, call the EU, who is inclined to accept the Ukraine because they want to join the EU in 2024. They want NATO to come, which is going to give them protection. That's why Putin is saying, oh, heck no, you're not going to join NATO. You're not going to join the EU because then you've got reinforcement. Biden, as America, rather, call the allies that it's about to accept the Ukraine into their union and say, you guys go put pressure on, you know, this is Europe. You go defend them. We're not sending American troops. We're not sending American troops. My concern is that he is going to deploy troops and our armed forces are going to be underman or without any clear direction, clear initiative. Leave him behind again, something like that. I'm really concerned about that. He would actually have to ego sense them. As of, I think, like 30 minutes ago, they were already reporting that the administration and Biden administration is considering sending 8,500 US troops, not to Ukraine, but to the surrounding countries that border with Ukraine. Poland, Belarus. Exactly. Not Belarus, but Poland. Poland, yeah, for sure. Romania, yeah. All the countries that surround it. And that just cracks me up because I remember, so these are reactionary things that now look threatening to Putin, right? So something you should not do. No, this is this is obviously something that where you're like, it's a gut reaction. You're freaking out. Oh my gosh, we're sending troops. Putin and Russia that they get, they get a little freaked out. Well, I don't know if you remember, but do you remember when Donald Trump took was taking troops out of Germany? This is when no conflict was going on at all. I mean, there was still conflict going there, but we had no beasts, major beasts of the Russia at the time. But he took, he drew down the forest in Germany. Democrats in the left freaked out. They were like, oh my gosh, she's taking all the troops out. Well, no, he was putting troops in Poland, Romania, some of the same, some of the same countries. That's what pisses me off with this. Yeah. They're freaking out and just wanting to demonize Donald Trump was actually dangerous, because if they just would have let that thing go, if they actually would have explained to the American people what that was really about, it was about strengthening up those other countries. Now, if we'd have done that, they would have been training those other countries, getting them ready to defend their own homeland. Exactly. So that we could then take our troops back out. But now what is it? He's sending the troops to the same place that they wouldn't talk about, the left and the media. And now he's doing it in a reactionary, threatening manner. Yeah. So I have a question with this. If Russia is able to move into a sovereign territory, what globally, when you've got a country like China that looks and says, hey, I see what Russia is able to do, I mean, what kind of implications does this have for them moving into a sovereign nation like Taiwan? Well, it's interesting you say that because last night they flew multiple airplanes into their airspace. They've been doing that a lot, but they did that last night, probably on purpose. Do not discount that possibility of something joint. Yeah, I mean, they're absolutely seeing what it does. And seeing what we're going to do in response to it. And so, you know, if we're not able to send a strong message, then what are we sending to China? If China wants to do something like this. Yeah. The thing with this, again, there's a lot of irritating things about this. But who did what administration did Russia and Putin do this under before? Obama and Biden. Yeah. They everything's predictable with these people. They know exactly what to expect. They know how to counter them. Do they do this? They didn't take a when Obama said, I'm drawing a red imaginary line that other foreign nations didn't take that seriously, Jason. Yeah, amazingly, they didn't take him that seriously. Yeah, pretty weird. Everyone knows what to expect from that establishment. They waited for them to come back in. And why didn't they do this on the Trump? And they said before, and I think Putin actually is the direct government, that he was unpredictable. Yeah. They didn't know what to think. They didn't know how to respond. Yeah, you wouldn't want to play poker against the guy. But also remember the same guy that drew the imaginary red line is kind of running the White House today. And they know. Yeah. Yeah. They know the same policy is going to be status quo. Press them. But again, 8,500 troops. Jason, I'm telling you, I've got a real concern. If he sends troops, it's not good for us. It shows weakness. It's super weak. And at what point do you hold Europe accountable to say, Hey, listen, if this is your friend, step up. That's what Trump did step up. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. Step up and do your business. You know, we're here, but you got to you got to bring something to the table here. Yeah. Yeah. We just be the US. Which would be interesting. 8,500 troops. I'd be curious to know how many troops we have at our actual border for us in our own country. I do want to get to you feel free to continue talking about this particular issue. But I want to bring into just the realm of what we're talking about that the Biden administration, this feels a lot like deja vu. They warned over the weekend that they would quote, not be in a position to evacuate US citizens from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. And obviously this is this comes off of the heels of it feels like not that many months ago, we were dealing with Afghanistan. And the same issue happened. The department, the State Department actually increased Ukraine's travel advisory status to level four do not travel because of Russia's military threat. And they alerted US citizens that the US government would essentially be unable to assist their evacuation in the event of a Russian attack. Jason, am I being dramatic to say like this feels a lot like deja vu. I feel like we just went through this in Afghanistan. And here we are again. Yeah, these are the people that were, you know, kind of pinning our hopes that they're going to make rational and intelligent decisions on how to react. I think we have to be very, very careful on so it is significant, right? I don't want to play that down. The 100,000 troops on a border is significant. But when I hear the Biden administration say that there are fear and they have intelligence on this, I guess, they're going to go all the way into the country, take the capital and install a pro-Russian leader. I, that makes no sense to me whatsoever. That makes no sense to me whatsoever. I don't think Russia would even would risk that. And then when the United States recalls family members, diplomatic family members out of the country, and then the UK does the same thing, but the EU does not. Yes. The people closest to Ukraine exactly do not. That's what I'm saying. Press something. We have to be careful not to get mixed up in Biden's dog wagging on this. Because what two things does Biden and Boris Johnson have in common? They're both in political battles right now. They're both very, very unpopular. Boris Johnson's almost going to get kicked. He's not going to be, I don't think he's going to be prime minister more than a week or two. He's on his way out. Biden had a disastrous first year. We cannot get stuck in this dog wagging where, oh my gosh, let's not pay attention to everything else and just focus in on what they're doing with Ukraine. It's dangerous and we just can't give them the satisfaction and credit of it. We've got to say laser focus on issues. Exactly. If you engage in the fight, you give credit and honestly it's going to show weakness on our part. I think the report is 81% of Ukrainians disapprove of Putin. We know that Western Ukraine has always been pro-Europe, Eastern Ukraine. I agree with you. I don't think there's a full on take, hostile takeover. I think this is a situation where you sit back in America, you show strength, you signal we're watching, you call upon the EU and say that's why I keep saying EU because they're not moving. They're not moving. They're not flinching, but we're flinching. So we're flinching, but those who are closest, like Poland, they're not flinching. I'm going, okay, you need to read into that. I agree with you 100%. Well, I'm just tired of the strongest message that we're sending to the entire world is that we don't really care about our allies and we definitely don't care about our own American citizens. So when we're telling them we're not going to get you out, but we're going to spend every single resource that we have here at home to send people that are coming over our borders illegally anywhere in the United States that you want to go, but we can't be bothered to rescue people out of war-torn countries. That is sending a horrible message and I'm ready for Americans to wake up and see what's happening. Yeah. All right, all good points. We've got more to come first. We want to think our sponsor built bar. So if you have a sweet tooth like me, but you are trying not to pack on the pounds for whatever the case may be, we're still, are we still?

Dr. Anthony Fauci, which we like to refer to on this program as the greatest con man of all time, warned on Sunday on a program that continues to put him on the air, which I don't know why they continue to do because he is the least reliable source when we are talking about COVID-19 or the pandemic. He has taken both sides of every single issue when the opportunity presents itself, but he was on with, I believe this was ABC with Martha Raditz and he was asked about the booster shot. He says, look, you may, we know we told you to take one shot. We told you to take two shots. We told you to take three shots and take the booster. You may need another one. Who knows? We don't actually have the data to tell you what you will need quite yet. But don't worry, the data is coming. Watch this. Does it lose its effectiveness and how soon should they get another one if that's your advice? Well, the answer, Margaret, honestly, is that we don't know because we don't know the durability of protection from the third shot boost of an mRNA and the second shot boost of a J and J. We may need to boost again. That's entirely conceivable. But before we make that decision about yet again another boost, we want to determine clearly what the durability of protection is of that regular boost, that third shot that we're talking about. That's weird because I feel like before they recommended that people get this booster, which I refuse to use the term boost as a verb, they got boosted. You should get a boost. That's not a thing and I'm not going to subscribe to it. But it's weird because I feel like before you recommend two people that they should get this particular shot, you probably should know the longevity, the durability of that particular shot. And you can do a cost benefit analysis before you tell people you should definitely get this because, for instance, let me just say, for instance, if the shot only gives you three months more of durability, you could say to yourself, maybe the cost benefit analysis, we haven't actually done the studies on what three of these shots do in your body. Probably we shouldn't be recommending to people that they get as many as possible loaded into their body, into their cells, because it only gives three months more protection. Dr. Fauci basically says, look, we don't, you guys are actually the experiment. We don't actually know yet. We're waiting to find out from you, the dummies who continue getting these boosters. And then we can be able to tell everyone whether or not it was a good idea. Sorry, if you end up being the fallout from that. Am I wrong? I'm going to go way, way tinfoil hat. Here we go. Here we go. You too. Well, join me. That's what I'm here for. Well, I'm just telling you, I'm going to go way more nefarious than this. I mean, this is yes, you are the lab rat and the experiment in their eye is working. When you start looking at miscarriages and all the things that they don't want to recognize and yet still, if there was any inclination in sanity, right, and you would find out that there's miscarriages, side effects, you would halt, right? You would halt and say, whoa, proof and verify. Well, there are actually several, there are several countries who did do that. They did halt. Maybe it was just with young people. Sure, but still. But they did. But you don't double down and go another booster, another booster. It's a hundred percent a social experiment, a hundred percent. And we won't know for maybe a decade. How would you? Yeah. How would you know truly what's going to happen with with a child that just came out of the womb until he or she is five, 10, 12 years old, you know, but yet they doubled down. This is insane to me that we're allowing this guy to not be behind bars at this point. Right. Yeah. I'm so tired of COVID. I don't know if anyone else is just sick and tired and just. Well, I was hard of it. I mean, but I almost feel like Fauci is getting a bit of a rogue hair here because even the who came out and said, this might not be a long term strategy to keep boosting these developed countries when we've got so many people around the world that haven't even gotten their first shot, their second shot. And here we are, you know, sitting fat and happy in America, getting boosted by the fourth time, which now the European medicine agencies is even coming out and saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not even sure that this is effective. It actually might be decreasing your body's natural immunity. So where's that science? When Fauci is up there touting science and why we need to get boosted, he just like, you know, suddenly forgot to read that one study that could say, no, your natural immunity could be actually affected. And so now what now we don't have our natural immunity. And now we don't have effectiveness of the three other shots that we got to even fight off COVID. I mean, what is going on here? Yeah, well, according, Jason, according to the public health experts, natural immunity is just a myth. It's just a myth. What has that ever been a thing? It's like that's never been a change. Yeah, apparently. Since COVID came onto the scene, science has completely changed. Not full immunity is just a myth. Well, yeah, not only science has changed, but the definition, the meaning of vaccinate vaccines is also changed. Which by the way, they have admitted, the CDC has admitted that they are changing. Right. And the reason why, and they'll say, they'll say themselves, even the CEO of Pfizer was like, yeah, it doesn't really work well, you know, need to get boosted. Yes, you can still transmit the virus. Like, they destroy their own mandates and policy that they want to push on, on their public statements. But they're allowed to say those things were not, it's hilarious. You can have the Pfizer CEO on YouTube, he can say that thing, he's approved. Saragans also her YouTube channel, which is called Saragansales unfiltered. Thank you very much. She couldn't say that on hers, which is ridiculous. These trials are supposed to last 10 years, right? Yeah, supposed to last 10 years. I know more about Moderna because we had a lot of those documents that we got from them. But I know they tried multiple times to get human trials for mRNA vaccines, turned on every single time until the pandemic happened, then they were agreeing to do it. So can I ask you, is that because of, because I've read a lot that like anytime they had animal trials, the animals did not do well. They did not make it. They did not do well in the trials? I don't know. That's a surprise, man. Okay. That's what I read. Yeah, the animals always died in the mRNA. When you have the guy who helped formulate the vaccine and he gets silenced, I mean, you need to just look at the indicator and then go, oh, take the doctor who helped formulate this thing and he raises his hand and say, hey, maybe not a good idea. Silence that guy. Right. They don't silence that guy. They sound more like vaccine salesman at this point than they do actual scientists. And I know for a fact, the government gets money through the Moderna vaccine. Yeah. I know for a fact. We've seen it after we've talked about it. We show you. That deal was struck. But what we don't know is how deeply that goes. I don't think that the government was throwing all their eggs into one basket with Moderna. I mean, do they also own portions of Pfizer? We don't know at this point. Nobody's asking the questions. But come on, man. Like, didn't we talk about the public-private partnership? Yes. I mean, I'm sure it goes so deep that I mean, but that's also, let me on anything. Yeah. And you can find your answers. Yeah. So, let me, so let me just, before we have to go to break, let me throw something else into the equation that, look, if you're not convinced already, you really need to be connecting the dots here. The NFL is stopping. They have stopped daily testing of all players vaccinated or unvaccinated for the remaining playoff teams. So now that we're in the divisional playoffs. They don't want stars out of the game. Bingo. Thank you very much. So before they were like very stringent on it, everyone needed to get tested. And by the way, the unvaccinated got treated very differently. But now that, look, it's just a coincidence, you guys, that they are in the playoffs where they're at, they're actually going to, they're going to stop daily COVID-19. Yeah. And I love that they consulted their own infectious disease doctors. Like, where are these guys? Like, why doesn't our government consult these infectious disease guys? And before they start making policies and why don't companies come and hire these same guys at the NFL players or are getting to listen to? I mean, why are we having to listen to completely different science when corporations are making their policies and everyone has to be vaccinated? That's a great point. Yeah, that's a great point. So let me just to Amy's point. So this is Dr. Alan Sills. He is the NFL's chief medical officer. He said the league had not seen any verifiable asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 this season. That's that's weird. Which is weird, because I feel like all of the unvaccinated people got demonized who were in the NFL. And here you have the NFL's chief medical officer saying, yeah, they actually there was no asymptomatic spread. So that that is a lie in itself. Shout out to Aaron Rodgers. Shout out to Joe Rogan. Okay, shout out to those guys. Cole Beasley. Yeah, but Aaron is the one who took all the fire. Yeah, Aaron Rodgers went in front of a tribunal with that doctor included and they raked him over the coals to now. So we haven't seen any asymptomatic spread. Well, they went after Rogers at the time. So good for those guys to hold the fort. Yeah, but now the ratings are going to suffer. So and look, you're talking about one of the most woke, you know, organizations on planet earth with a commissioner that is as corrupt as can be that now it benefits the pocketbook. So just turn it off. Turn this pick it off real quick. Yeah, because it benefits us. All right, we've got more to come. But first, we want to thank our sponsor, Patriot Mobile. So we just want to thank Patriot Mobile for their support, you know, they support a lot of conservative shows as you know, us, they support turning point, CPAC, March for Life, Yaku Booyens. Yeah, they support they support the new show, the bottom line. Thank you very much. So they really are in the trenches with us when we talk about all of these conservative issues, when we talk about, you know, protecting the sanctity of life, we talk about cancel culture. Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative cell phone provider. Okay, they offer the same broad nationwide coverage that all of the major carriers offer. But they are also making sure that a portion of your bill does not go to all of these left leaning causes. But instead, they're going to go support the causes that you actually fight for you actually represent. They're going to support conservative causes. They're going to support, like I said, sanctity of life. First responder, veteran issues, they support all of these things that we are fighting for. And they have 100% U.S.-based customer support. They provide exceptional service. And they love and support you. They share your values. Look, we got to stick together these days. Okay, I feel like my voice is about to go away here. But we, before my voice goes away, hear me when I say we have to stick together on these. The left is trying to overtake all of the institutions. Do not let them, especially when it comes to who you use for yourself of, because it's all the same towers. Okay, go to patreon mobile.com slash news.

A Denver Colorado school district is allowing one of its elementary schools to host a Black Lives Matter week of action for its students. You know, this is interesting because I received, I don't know if you guys, how many like PR firms you subscribe to, but I have been receiving a lot of emails reminding me that it is school choice week in Texas right now. It is school choice week. Well, I guess in Denver, it is actually BLM week of action week, I guess. I don't know. They say, right, right for, well, or the public schools. Yeah. So the, so this program, which shockingly is sponsored by Black Lives Matter at school will instruct children as young as those in kindergarten and first grade to be quote, transgender affirming by recognizing trans antagonistic violence and queer affirming so that heteronormative thinking ceases to exist. They're also going to address globalism, which is really great for kindergartners and first graders. Really involved in the idea of globalism. They say, it is a person's ability to see how we are impacted or privileged within the Black global family and to teach students how to disrupt, quote, Western nuclear family dynamics. That's right there. And a quote for the, for a return to the collective village that takes care of each other. Guys, guys, guys, I feel like every week I sit here and I tell you guys, get your kids the hell out of public schools. And I can't help but continue to say, get your kids the hell out of public schools. Well, I just think it's so interesting for every person that put a black box in a black square in their social media profiles, they might be asking the question, well, you know, what does this really have to do with the BLM movement? I thought the BLM movements was all about, you know, simple, peaceful protest, fighting against racial injustices and for equity and all this stuff. We have been, I know we, we sound like a broken record because we've talked about this so many times on the show and for everyone that's not watching the show, you should be because we've been saying BLM is not about that. The Black Lives Matter movement is about so much more than racial injustice and equity. It is about dissolving the nuclear family and we have been preaching that from the hilltops and then like, finally, now they're not even trying to hide it anymore. Now they're coming right out and saying this in the school systems, well, please come and join us for this week of action as we destroy your families. So it's a great idea and trying your children to do the same. And it's core, it's Marxism. That's what they're teaching it. They found very, very fundamental, very, you know, basic, you know, basic level ways to teach Marxism and to indoctrinate and you're not even safe at public schools. We had to show on this a little over a year ago, I think, and I tracked this curriculum in multiple private schools as well. You got to stay active in what curriculum they're pushing to your kids because this stuff was scary. Some of what we could show, some of what we couldn't show. There was one, this was on a, I think it was a preschoolers walls. They had posters of what looked like a little boy dressed up like a girl but had whiskers on their face and it was about transgenderism. There was another course that they were teaching during this time, like at this week timeframe, was all about teaching your kids to be street activists, teaching them to be street activists and it culminated in making picketing signs and going out and hitting the streets. What happened to teaching our kids how to read? Literacy level in the black community has been decimated. You're talking about a third grade. Guy Jack Brewer. Jack is working on the hill on this heavily. The third grade reading level when they 14 and 15 years old. I don't want to self promote but please, please, I'm asking you if you're a parent, go watch my show today that launched. It's all about this issue with Julie Pickering. It's all about literally what they're teaching in the classroom. We dissect it for you in an hour and a half and we literally pull it apart and it is in private school because the superintendents and the heads of departments can pull this in. Even if your state votes against it, that's how this is in Houston, Texas, in Austin, Texas at the moment. When at state level we said, oh heck no, it's a local superintendent and unless you're as a parent, will be proactive and go demand the curriculum and you actually take the time and yes, it's painful and you work through the curriculum, all of it. You will not know what they're teaching your child and the damage control is almost impossible. Well, you don't even know if the teacher goes off curriculum though. I mean, nowadays it seems so it seems imperative for teachers that they have to let the children know what their sexual orientation is, that they have to let the children know, you know, this is my political view. Like, why? Why do they even have to introduce that into, I mean, this is a free country you can believe and act how you want to, but why do you have to let my child know that this is right, like where you stand on certain issues, like I, I'm not sending my kid to public school, but if I did, I'd be sending my kid to school to learn about the subjects at hand. I mean, you know, I want them to read, I want them to, I would love for them to learn how to start a business and be an entrepreneur, maybe budget, you know, balance a checkbook. I mean, kids don't even know how to do that, but you do, but you do, but you do, but you realize though, because I think here's the disconnect is that you realize that it is your responsibility as a parent to teach them a lot of those things. The school does the school stuff, right? What you talked about, learning to read, learning to do math, learning those basic concepts, but aside from that, it's not the school's responsibility to teach them the overarching values that is supposed to be taught by the parent. And I just want to reiterate, I know there's a lot of people out there who they get very mad whenever we talk about schools and they get very mad whenever I say, get your kids the hell out of public schools, which I will keep saying, even if it pisses you off, because they say, well, you just must be an elitist who can afford to send your child to XYZ. We're working families and we can't do that. I cannot even tell you how many families, including my own, who are working families who homeschooled, okay? It's not easy. It's not, can you? You're homeschooling. It's not easy. It's not easy. Okay, it's not easy. Do you need to cut corners in other areas? Yes. Do you need to watch your pennies? Yes. 100%. But I am telling you as someone, look, Yaku did it. He has like eight million kids, okay? And he did it. All right. I did it. Well, hold on. I did it. I did it not planning to do it with a third grader and a newborn who was not an easy newborn. He had multiple medical issues. I still did it with a full-time job. And it's not expensive. I just think they're like, you're listening to the left when you think like, oh, it's too expensive. We can't afford that. It's not expensive. It's just your time and your energy and your children are worth that. Please look into it. Jason, I just want to say there is a way that you can send your kids to public school, but it takes just as much effort. So basically you have to train little soldiers. Yeah. And I couldn't afford it. I sent my kids to public school. Yeah. Like my son right now, I've gotten multiple emails of how contentious he is in the classroom. And I'm like, come at me. Hell yeah. That's, I do not have to do that. Yeah. Like that's what he does. Like it's so funny when I, so when I go to PTA meetings, I'm like the guy every time they like, oh my gosh. You do not want a cultural showing up. Every time. We want to increase, you know, do a bond to increase the taxes. And I'm like, uh, uh, I have the sense. Like, I'm actually, we have to pay for that. We have to pay for that. We talked about the one thing I want to say that I don't want to get missing that they want to abolish the heterosexual thinking. So the inclusive party. Well, you should include us. It's not about including them. It's about completely decimating any heterosexual mindset. I mean, it's in the article. Yeah. That's, that's a, and only go to their, their norms or whatever it is. Right. So, so here's the tail wagging the dog. Yeah. That's a great. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's an amazing point. All right. We've got more to come first. We want to think response or policy genius. So, if you have someone relying on your financial support, we all do. Okay. Maybe it is your child.

So on the topic of schools, a California mother whose sixth grade daughter was allegedly recruited by teachers and encouraged to change her name to a boy's name while being told not to tell her mother is taking legal action against the school district. She says that the school district planted the seed to convince her daughter to believe she was bisexual and then urged the girl to believe she was a transgender boy. This comes at the same time. This is in California. Let's shift over to Florida. The Florida House Committee just passed a bill that would ban sexual orientation discussion being encouraged in elementary schools, which you would think when you read it on its face, you're like, yeah, duh. But it's happening all across the country. And Florida, at least, is pushing back on this. Yaku, I know that you are, you know, we mentioned it before the break, you are highly involved in a lot of school districts across the country. Am I being dramatic when I say this is literally happening? Public school, private school, whatever the case may be, this is happening all across the country. If you're not paying attention, all 50 states in every single school district, it's a very, very proactive movement. They've infiltrated. This is a movement they have. Again, if you watch the show, we unpack it for you. Yes, even Texas. And all it takes, one thing in that article, you just need to plant a seed. If you plant a seed, you can water it. That's just agriculture. And if you plant a seed a doubt in a child's mind, I said before, my sister said yesterday, her son is four. He said, I want to be a firefighter. So imagine we just lock him in right now and go, that's it. You're wearing a fire suit every day. You're playing with matches and it becomes a concert pianist. You can't because you said you want to be a firefighter at four, right? Because we planted the seed. But when it's sexual, there's actually so much internally that happens in the chemistry of the child that we can't get into it now. It's destructive. But you would go, yeah, this is logic, right? You would think. But apparently not. Apparently not. I think it terrifies me. Again, I'm super pro-home school. That's what we plan on doing. If we have the ability to do so. And it terrifies me that it's schools are now, your children are supposed to feel protected and feel like you're on their side and they are setting up to be parents and kids be against each other and to be fighting against each other. And that's really, really terrifying as a parent with young children to say, no, because then it's already difficult. I can already see the battles that I'm going to have between my kids. And I'm like, I don't need them to think that I'm against them. But I want them to feel like I'm fighting for them. And if the school is setting us up to fight against each other, that's a really scary that they're the savior of my children. And that's a very scary place to be. 20 seconds, Jason. This is nothing to do with transgenderism, radical, whatever. This is Marxism. They don't care about transgenderism. They don't care about your sexual orientation. They want to be able to set a state entity that can take control of your kids, if need be. They always said that their goal of any kind of educational institute is make the child more unlike their parents as possible. There was a San Francisco Chronicle article written just recently where they said they made the case for the state to take your kids. They're serious about this. They want to be in charge of your kids, not you because you can't teach them your values. They want to teach you their trumped up values. Yeah. All right. We got to take a break. We'll be back. I'll say. All right. Before we get to the review of the day, I want to remind you guys to follow all of the people at my table. They all have amazing things to say. You should be following them. They are on our team. We have Yaqubouyans, host of the bottom line, which you can find on YouTube. You can find Yaqubou on Instagram, all social medias. Make sure you follow him there.
