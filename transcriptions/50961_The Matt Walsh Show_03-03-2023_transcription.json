    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, Hershey's becomes he-she's as they appoint a trans activist to be the face of their Women's History Month campaign. That's not even the worst of it.

Women's History Month does not enjoy exactly the same status as Pride Month or Black History Month of the three sacred celebrations. Women's History Month, which began this week, is certainly the lowest on the totem pole. Still, it's an important and holy time on the leftist liturgical calendar, especially because it presents yet another opportunity to celebrate LGBT people. To be specific, Women's History Month is a time to celebrate men, gay men who masquerade as women. That's certainly how the Hershey's Corporation sees it anyway. That's why this week, as you've probably heard, the Candy Company unveiled its He for She campaign, which is meant to, quote, shine a light on the women and girls who inspire us every day. They selected five women to be a part of this, so to be faces of this initiative. Each of the women will even have their likenesses adorned Hershey's chocolate bar wrappings for the duration of the month. The interesting thing about one of these women is that he is not a woman at all, but rather a man pretending to be a woman. Trans activist Faye Johnstone announced his inclusion in the campaign this week with this video. Listen. My name is Faye Johnstone. I'm the Executive Director of Wisdom to Act and we can create a world where everyone is able to live in public space as their honest and authentic selves. You see the women changing how we see the future at Hershey's Canada. Now, it's already as absurd and as insulting as it can possibly get for a major corporate brand to make this man, who, by the way, also looks and sounds like a man, a representative of women, but a glance at Johnstone's history and at his social media posts tells an even darker story. In fact, Hershey has inadvertently provided us with, I think, a very revealing illustration of how trans activists are made and what they do with the privilege that their self-identity affords them. This is not the company's intention to give us this lesson. We can assume that it wasn't, but they have given us this instructive case study in any case. So it's worth, I think, investigating to see what we can learn from it. So follow with me briefly as we go through the story of Faye Johnstone and we go all the way back to a few years ago to 2014 and 2015. Back then, Faye Johnstone, then known as Zach, was posting on Instagram with hashtags like gay boy and proud slut. In fact, he even posted a public acknowledgement of, because at the time he identified as a gay man, and around that same time, he posted a public acknowledgement of an apology for his, quote, cis privilege, begging forgiveness for taking up space as a queer male. In that 2015 post, this is what he wrote. This was Zach. He says, I want to acknowledge my own cis privilege and say that across the board, white queer men like myself take up space that marginalizes the most oppressed and diverse members of our community. Now, it's quite a strange thing to see yourself as merely taking up space, but this is what leftist identity politics entails if you're a white male. But then an interesting thing happened. After taking some women's histories classes and reading some feminist literature and confronting his cis privilege some more, all this is documented on his Instagram page, Zach eventually decided that, well, it turns out he's not cis at all. He was no longer taking up space, nor did he owe any apologies. Over the next few years, he would identify as femme and, quote, non-binary and then land eventually on trans. It didn't take him very long after discovering his non-sis identity to monetize it. He put up another Instagram post in, uh, August 2017, advertising himself as a professional queer, quote unquote, and seeking honorariums and paid gigs. Magically, John Stone was now in a position to not only make money off of this identity, but to lecture the cis allies that he was just identifying himself with like five seconds ago. In 2017, he posted this, quote, allyship means means taking cisgender heterosexual spaces and making them queer and trans inclusive. It means not expecting trans and non-binary people to have to educate everyone around them every day in an every new space. It means being there and being consistent. So many allies talk a big game, but we need you to do more than talk. This is a man who had once not long before felt the need to apologize for taking up space. Now he was blaming others for taking up space that belonged to him. How quickly can a white male go from apologizing for his privilege to scolding other people for theirs? All you have to do is put on a dress. It's that simple. And these days, you don't even do that much. John Stone, once the oppressor was now apparently the oppressed and now makes his living as a professional activist. He also takes full advantage of the victim privilege that he has claimed for himself as he advocates for many horrific things, including putting women in harm's way just a few days ago, John Stone reprimanded someone for saying that male rapists who identify as trans shouldn't be housed in women's prisons. He claimed that trans identifying male sex offenders must be placed in women's prisons in the name of, quote, trans liberation. The separation of male and female prisoners is not a solution, he said. It bears repeating here and emphasizing. A man who wants to lock women prisoners into cages with male sex offenders and violent rapists is the person who her she chose to be a representative of women for women's history month. It gets worse. John Stone has also explicitly advocated for vilifying, quote unquote, his words, women who disagree with gender ideology. He said that such women terfs, as he calls them, should be shouted down until they, quote, don't dare to speak their views publicly. And this is not new or unique rhetoric coming from him. Back in 2017, he was calling for, quote, militant queers to rise up against his political enemies. Nowadays, John Stone advocates for mandatory trans affirming indoctrination of children in public school. A few months ago, he called for a school board to establish, quote, best practices to ensure all students learn about accepting trans people. And as for parents who might object, he believes that as he stated, that parents don't have absolute rights over their own children. Now none of these revelations are shocking. They don't even really count as revelations. I mean, of course, this male trans activist hates women and doesn't care if they're put in harm's way, of course. All male trans activists hate women because they resent and despise the people who authentically belong to an identity group that they covet, but will never really be a part of. It's that simple. And also they're all narcissists. I mean, every single one, it's why they're trans activists. They care about nobody and nothing except their own affirmation. Whatever sacrifices must be made to make them feel affirmed are worth it. And if that means that women have to get raped in prison, as far as they're concerned, they're fine with it. They're more than fine with it. I mean, they hate women after all, remember the militant rhetoric expressly calling for the vilification of their opponents wishing to make their, you know, women too afraid and intimidated even speak in public. This is also no surprise. It is how trans activists and LGBT activists and leftist activists in general have always operated. You know, while people on the right complain that my rhetoric is too mean, too abrasive, the other side has proudly and explicitly set out to demonize anyone who disagrees with them and they'll even tell you that's what they're doing. They're not having any conversation about tone. Okay, there's no tone policing going on on that side. They all agree. Whatever tone is necessary to harass and terrorize the enemy is the right tone as far as they're concerned. This is how they fight this war while many on our side are still trying to, you know, play patticake with these people. It's also not a surprise, though very important to note, how John Stone settled on his woman identity in the first place. I mean, you could track a similar progression for nearly every young trans activist in the country today, especially since they've all left behind extensive documentation. They've all left behind a paper trail on social media. So we can see how John Stone came to understand that he was the villain according to his own ideology. As a cisgender quote unquote white male, his role was to apologize and to step to the side. He was a warm body taking up space, but nobody wants to see themselves that way. Nobody wants to be that. So over time he came to see that there's a way around this. He doesn't have to resign himself to his position in the caste system. All he had to do was declare himself something other than male and as simple declaration is all it takes. And suddenly he finds himself situated at the top of the pyramid. Moments before he was at the bottom, pyramid has flipped on its head. It's as simple as that. It's really no wonder that trans and non-binary identification have risen so sharply. There's lots of social capital and also financial capital to be gained from that identity. It only takes a snap of the fingers to obtain it. Now as for Hershey's, it's likely that the company didn't know many of these background details when they appointed Faye Johnstone, their spokesman, or a spokeswoman as they would claim. They, you know, that certainly isn't meant to be an excuse for the company, not at all. The point is that they wouldn't have done any background research or looked into this guy at all. All they needed to know is that he's trans and that automatically makes him above reproach and any attempt to investigate his background or vet him or look into his past statements would be an affront against him. So I can guarantee you that they specifically decided not to do that. This is what the law of the I dictates and Hershey's like most other corporations is simply following that law. Now they should suffer the consequences for it. May we have to start really penalizing these corporations for their unthinking allegiance to this perverse, twisted ideology. Nobody needs Hershey's, right? We could all go the rest of our lives and never touch another one of their products. And it would require nothing of us. It would require no sacrifice at all. Like it would not affect all the people who are disgusted by what Hershey's has done here. If all of us just said, okay, well, I'm never eating anything that Hershey makes ever again, it would be a major win in the culture. And also it would require, it would not affect our lifestyles at all. We could easily do it. And so that's what we need to do. Now let's get to our five head. I believe in working hard for what you have. Who do you trust to handle any and all of your financial obligations if you can?

Well, to start with speaking of Hershey's or he-she's as we will call it now. One great way to make them pay for their wokeness is to turn to the alternatives. But what are the alternatives? Well, funny you should ask that. Here's the report from the Daily Wire. Hershey's chose the first day of Women's History Month to insult all women and rational men by introducing a gender dysphoric man who claims to be female as one of the faces of its commemorative she-bar. He even rolled out a social media ad with Faye Johnstone gushing about how she and other women are changing how we see the future. It was too much for the Daily Wire co-founder Jeremy Boring who has built a reputation for taking on woke companies and offering alternatives to their insulted customers, already a raz-a-raser magnet-raser. And soon to be producer of wholesome children's content, Boring is now a chocolate-tier. Is that what we call people to make chocolate? I guess after a-after a delusion Twitter user's appeal to him to offer another choice. Fine Boring tweeted early Friday, I'll do it introducing Jeremy's chocolate. Yes, it's real. We have two kinds. He, him, and she, her. One of them has nuts. If you need me to tell you what you want, keep buying Hershey's. So that's the news. This is a real thing that now exists. That's now there is Jeremy's chocolates. And you can go to ihateharshies.com and you can find the website and you can find the options for the chocolate bar. Right now it looks like there are just the two options, but if we've learned anything from Jeremy's razors, we know that there will be many more options still to come. Now, it's a meme now, right, on social media that every time a company goes woke, everyone always says, oh, I guess the daily wire is going to make their own version. But it's not just a meme. It's real life. We are bringing the memes to life here at the daily wire. And I'm very proud of that. And it's a great thing for two reasons. Okay, one is like the obvious one that the serious one, that it is important to build alternatives. And it makes it even easier on the consumer end to move away from these woke companies if those alternatives exist, which is why we're building them. And it should be really easy because as I said, even without the alternative, there's no reason like nobody needs Hershey's. And so if they, we don't need you, we don't need you. And if you're going to come in and spit in our faces, then I mean, how much would we have to, how much disrespect will we have to have for ourselves to continue buying this product that we don't need and could easily go without from a company that is directly spitting in our faces? But it becomes all the easier when there are these alternatives that we have now. And now we have Jeremy's chocolate. But also number two, the second thing is that it is great trolling. And I do think that there is a, there's a virtue in trolling. I've talked about this recently that we can engage the left, we can fight back and, you know, on many different levels, there's legislation. Of course you have to make the arguments, you have to do all these things. But there is a real virtue of trolling too and of mockery because these people are, and what they represent is, it's what they, you know, their ideology is poisonous and it's destructive, but it's also completely ludicrous. And we can't lose sight of that. That's part of the trolling is to point that out. That's part of the mockery is to point that out. And that's why there's a real value in it. Speaking of another thing we shouldn't be using, the ACLU is speaking out against efforts to ban the Chinese spyware app TikTok. And here's a video they put up, I think on TikTok talking about this and why it would be an incredible infringement on free speech to ban TikTok is what they say. Congress is trying to ban TikTok and it is worse than you think. Here's what you need to know. Tomorrow Congress will consider a bill that effectively bans TikTok for people in the US and the way that they're planning to do it will undermine our First Amendment rights for years to come. Quietly introduced by Texas Congressman Michael McCall over the weekend, the law would forbid US citizens from engaging with entities that may transfer sensitive personal data to a foreign entity that is subject to the influence of China, effectively banning TikTok and many other foreign businesses. It would also gut the Berman Amendment, which was passed in 1988 to protect our right to receive information, regardless of what country that information was created in. It's what keeps the US government from banning a book by a Chinese author simply because it's from China. And in this case, it means that you can't ban a social media app simply because the app is from a Chinese company. Whether it's sharing cat videos, discussing spy balloons, or watching this video right now, the First Amendment guarantees your right to express yourself both online and off. This is what the ASLU has become. They're now coming to the defense of communist China and the technology that they've put out into the world to spy on us. And not just spy on us, by the way, but specifically spying on our children, spying on and manipulating our kids, which is what they're doing with TikTok. You know, we've talked before about there's even a difference, a very noticeable and revealing difference in the way TikTok operates in China, as opposed to here. And kids in China use TikTok too, but they get a lot of informative, wholesome, you know, types of content. But here they get just absolute depravity and filth and stupidity. Because TikTok is a long-bing of spy app. It's also a scyop against, you know, against our children specifically. And of course, the claim that this is a free speech thing is ridiculous on the face of it because you get rid of TikTok. You are not at all preventing anyone from expressing their point of view. There are a million other social media apps. There are a million ways to express yourself on the Internet. How many ways do you actually need? And how many platforms do we have? And I say this as someone who's on 50 different platforms myself. And I can have the excuse that I do it for a living, but even then it's still excessive. But especially if you don't do this for a living and you're just kind of like a normal person with a normal job or no job at all, a lot of people on TikTok have no job. Like, what do you need? Do you need 50 different platforms for kind of like saying the same thing? So there's no argument that this is an infringement on free speech that will prevent anyone from expressing themselves. This is not an attack on the users of TikTok, if you were to ban it. It's to protect them. So if it's an attack on anyone or anything, it's on the Communist Chinese government. So what are we infringing on their free speech? Now she brings up that well, you couldn't, if a Chinese author writes a book, you couldn't ban it and say, well, no one's allowed to read it because it's written by a Chinese author. Why can't you say that? Well, because that would be among other things, that would be an infringement on the author. But who's being infringed on here? If the app is given to us by essentially by the Chinese government, so we're infringing on their rights, on their rights to access our kids. Okay, moving to this is a report in a daily wire. Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacted on Thursday evening to the arrest of a Canadian minister who protested a drag queen event for children. Derek Reimer of Mission 7 was arrested after he protested a drag queen story hour at Calgary public library on Saturday. Video shows him shoved to the ground by attendees as he proclaimed that Jesus Christ is Lord and quoted biblical passages about homosexuality. This is what they're doing in Canada now, they're arresting people for that. Carlson also referenced professional Christians who have frequently remained silent on governmental overreach and widespread disregard for biblical sexual ethics. Carlson said, whereas David French, Beth Moore, Tim Keller, all these people who are defending Christianity as actual Christians are being arrested for being Christian. Not a word. I'm glad that he brought this up because this is specifically on the issue of the sexualization of children, the drag queen events, transgenderism, gender ideology. And I have often had the same question as Tucker Carlson, which is all of these self professed Christian leaders. Where are they on this issue? I get this question a lot in Q and A's and we're going around giving speeches and I hear this question from people, where are the church on this issue? Why aren't they saying anything? The actual leaders of churches. That's a very good question. I think that this, when it comes to a litmus test for a self professed, a self appointed Christian leader, you couldn't ask for a better one than this issue in particular on the gender issue. What we get from a lot of people, David French is one of them. If they're going to wade in to this topic, it's going to be, it's going to do the tone policing thing. It's to say, well, there are excesses on that side, people that are pushing, they're excesses sure, but we have to be good Christians. We have to be nice and compassionate. What you don't hear them ever do is actually take on the ideology itself, which tells you everything you need to know about them. One other, let's see, we have several other things, we have a lot of other things, we're going to have time to get to. So instead, we'll just go right to this. The airlines are celebrating Women's History Month. And here's a quick tick tock, another tick tock video, this one's from Delta and their Women's History Month celebration with us. Did somebody say slave? Okay, that was it. That was the whole thing. So that was, is a bunch of young female Delta airline pilots and mechanics and flight attendants, dancing and lip-syncing. And you know this fills me with visceral terror, I have to admit, and it's not because I'm sexist against female airline pilots. I mean, I am as I've admitted, but I also want to make clear that it's okay because I'm also agist, okay, when it comes to airline pilots. Young airline pilots terrify me as well. As I've said many times, every airline pilot should be a man between the ages of 40 and I'll say 65. And I believe they should all have mustaches. Every pilot should look like, you know, a version of Captain Sully, who landed the plane to the Hudson. That is the classic airline pilot look. And that's what I'm looking for. It makes me feel more comfortable. I was on a plane the other day and there was a, there was a young guy in the cockpit. I try not to even look. You know, if I, when I'm walking in and the door is still open, you can see the pilot is, I try not to even look anymore because I'm, I most of the time these days, I'm terrified by what I see. I happened to glance in and the guy, he looked like he was just at a middle school. Like this was his, they just took the training wheels off and I'm on his first flight. And I get the guy to start somewhere, but just don't start on the plane that I'm flying on is my point. But my other issue with this kind of thing is this marketing strategy of airlines, and you see a lot of this. It's not just like the wokeness. It's also the, the lack of seriousness. Okay. What happened to seriousness in our culture? I don't want an airline advertising itself with lip syncing and dancing. I just, I don't, I don't want, I don't want, I don't want TikTok videos from an airline. I want a little bit of seriousness. Cheerful. Okay. You don't want gloomy. You don't want to be gloomy, but you want a, a cheerful, but serious disposition from your airline, I would say. That's what we're missing in our society in general, but especially with airlines. All right. Let's get to the comment section. Comment says, late one night I was making a door dash delivery to an apartment complex. There I encountered a young lady who had ingested illegal substance of some sort and had a very adverse reaction to it. She was screaming and rambling incoherently, wandering aimlessly and began removing her clothes. I was at a safe distance on the phone with 911 to try and get her some help. Meanwhile, a couple of knuckleheads were nearby close enough to perhaps provoke her further, filming her on their phones. I yelled at them to keep their distance. This was not for their entertainment and that, and that I was trying to get her some help shaking my head. Yeah. This is the, it's, they, they call it the bystander effect and we talked about this yesterday and there's some comments pointing that out. This is a, this is something that's been observed in human psychology since the dawn of time pretty much. People when they're in a, in unexpected situation, potentially life threatening situation, you know, a traumatizing situation, whatever it is, people tend to freeze. And especially if they're in a group, they kind of freeze and they stand there and they're waiting for someone else to act, but everybody is waiting for someone else and so that no one does anything. That's the bystander effect. Uh, and I, and I understand that that's always been a feature of an unfortunate feature of human psychology. I do think that it's gotten a lot worse. And of course what we are more aware. So there's always this question of, uh, well, are things worse in society or are we just more aware of how thing bad things are because we can see it all on video when in the past that was never an option. There might be some of that, but I, to me, it does seem like it's gotten worse because of this technology that allows us to see it. It encourages more of the bystander effect because now people are also taking other phones in their filming, even in situations where that there's no acceptable rationale for filming. Now there could be times when someone could claim, well, I want to get this on film because it's important that those other police will see it. So often it's, there's, there's, there's no value to the video at all except as just content. And the really disturbing thing is that normal everyday people, because everyone's chronically online, so normal everyday people are experiencing the world this way. They see the world as nothing but an opportunity to make content for the internet. And this should be, that should be the kind of temptation that is really only experienced by people like me who make a living delivering content. And so yeah, that's a pull that we can feel sometimes that there's this need to constantly churn out so much content. And so then you start seeing all of your life as a, as a, as a, you know, an opportunity to harvest more content. And then, you know, so you got to put these kind of barriers in place so that you can live as normal human being. So I understand when you're, when you're in the business, there is that temptation, but you have people that don't even make a living this way. That's still how they see it. Everything happens. And the first thing they think is, Oh, I got to get, I got to get this on. So I got to get this online. Why? Now the comment says this episode hit me hard. Not only do I lack communication skills, but I'm also a lazy reader, always skipping through a bunch of words, looking for the main point. Also everything I listen to has to be concise. But here's the good news. We know that's not true because you listen to this show. So that can't possibly, if everything you listen to had to be concise, you wouldn't be listening to me right now. Talisa says, the pink and blue thing is real. They consider dainty powder blue to be a baby girl color and a more robust red, not pink to be for boys. I forget when and why they became swapped, but it doesn't answer the question anyways. Yeah, but that actually shows that even the associations of color with gender are not actually entirely arbitrary. The color represents, right, the attitude or demeanor that society associates with each gender and the association of the color to the demeanor might be arbitrary. So he said, well, they associated blue with being dainty back in the, whenever in the thirties and now they associate pink with that. Well, that part is arbitrary, whether it's blue or pink is arbitrary. But the association of the demeanor to the gender is not. So it's like everyone, all societies have agreed on kind of what feminine and dainty and other good like, we associate that with women and with girls. But then we have different sort of symbols that are meant to stand for that and indicate that the symbols might be arbitrary. But the thing that they are symbolizing is not arbitrary. And I think that's a fundamental confusion that a lot of people have these days. Finally, final fantasy says Matt needs to go on to the whatever podcast, he would also be great on the PBD value attainment podcast. Well, on that latter point, I can tell you, stay tuned for next week. It's a little bit of a teaser for you. If you only listen to media or leftist activists, you think changing your identity as often as you change your underwear is a perfectly normal thing to do. If you listen to people who live in reality like me, you know the truth. But I'm not the only one pointing this out. In Jordan's new five part series, Vision and Destiny on Deliwire Plus, he articulates this better, better than even I ever could. In fact, it's a psychological wake up call that we all need. And just to show you, we're talking about here's a clip. Check it out. The idea that identity is subjectively defined and that each of us is only what we feel we are again, whatever that means, especially allied with the notion that that can change at a moment's notice again as a consequence of subjective whim is so psychologically preposterous that it's a miracle of stupidity that it's ever been accepted at all. This is why our Jordan Pearson continent on Deliwire is so popular because of insight like that. And that's just a little taste of it. The third episode of Vision and Destiny is out today. Two episodes are releasing every week, but it's all exclusive for Deliwire Plus members so you can join out at deliwire.com slash subscribe to watch Vision and Destiny. Now let's get to our daily cancellation. As we established in the open, this is Women's History Month or at least Women in Name History Month. There is also, as mentioned, the recently concluded Black History Month, Gay Pride Month. At least it's not the only identity groups that have their own nationally recognized months of celebration. For example, May is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. September into October is National Hispanic Heritage Month. November is National Native American History Month. We live in an inclusive and equitable time, which means that all identity groups are celebrated and all people are encouraged to be proud of who they are and of what their group has achieved and contributed to the world. Well all groups accept one, of course. White males are not invited to this party. There is no Men's History Month and there is no White History Month, which means that if you belong to both identity groups, then the only way to be a part of the celebration is to claim membership in a different group. And this, as we've seen, is a viable option for men these days, but it still leaves us with the fact that you cannot be celebrated while embracing your identity in your actual group. Now all of these history months are, of course, to use the scientific term Extremely Cringe. There is a large part of me that would rather make fun of the months than have my own. Actually, the entire part of me feels that way. Still, this is a microcosm of a larger issue. In our society in general, the message is clear. Every identity group should be applauded, should be proud of itself, should be celebrated for its history and its heritage, except for these two. And especially except for those who belong to both. The months are just another thing codifying this cultural policy, you know, cementing it in place. In fact, this doctrine declares that white males who even speak of their history or heritage or who say that they're proud to be who they are, proud of their identity must be decried as bigots. That is, if they simply engage in exactly the same sort of rhetoric as everyone else in every other group, if they do and say exactly what everyone else is doing and saying, no different, they are condemned. No, no, they're told. See, see, if we do this, it's good, but if you do it, it's bad. And we're supposed to accept this rationale. They can't, no one ever explains it. We're just supposed to accept one of the many things that we're supposed to accept as if it's self-evident, why every group should be able to celebrate themselves, accept this group. Now, it would be one thing if there was, say, a culture-wide push away from all forms of tribalism. I don't know how plausible or even advisable this kind of push would be. There's never been a post-tribal society, and I doubt there ever could be one, but it would be consistent if nothing else. We could at least respect the consistency, if not the realism, of, say, messaging that said, hey, humans are humans. We're all one family. We shouldn't be dividing ourselves into groups or singling groups out for special commendations or condemnations. It doesn't make any sense to be proud of or celebrated for the identity that you were born into. You should be proud of what you yourself have achieved individually and proud of others for what they've achieved, regardless of their race or gender. We are all one. Goomba et cetera et cetera. Yadda yadda. Now, say what you want about this kind of talk. It would at least be sincere if it was applied to everyone, but it isn't. These warnings against tribalism are only issued to white people and men and white men in particular. If a white man says, I'm proud to be a white man, then he's told that such talk makes no sense and so on and so on. But if anyone in any other group says, I'm proud to be in this identity group. He's applauded for his positive attitude. But the thing is that when only one group is warned against tribalism, that is a form of tribalism itself. That is a tribalism where all the other groups say to the hated group, you have no tribe, you have no identity. You are, in the words of our friend Faye Johnstone, just bodies taking up space. This kind of message is a real problem for many reasons. We'll just talk about one of them. It is simply true that men have achieved many great things. White people have achieved many great things. And white men have achieved many great things. The refusal to acknowledge this and to acknowledge it specifically, actually say that white men have achieved many great things and to acknowledge it in the same way that we acknowledge the achievements of black people and women and so on. This has led to the widespread impression that in fact white men have done very little. This is the impression that our cultural elites want us to have when kids are constantly told, hey, listen to all the great things that black people have done and women have done and as bad as it have done, but they're never ever ever told, hey, listen to all the great things white men have done. The kids will come to believe that white men haven't done much at all. In fact, you'll often hear this kind of reasoning offered by people who are trying to defend our cultural prohibition of white pride and male pride and white history month and men's history month. So just one example, I googled men's history month just for the sake of it. The very first thing that popped up was an article from a group called Parents Together. And it was an article that like many others, you can pick any random, they all kind of say the same thing. And this article is trying to explain why there's no men's history month and why there shouldn't be one, even though there is a women's history month. And one of the reasons they offered is this. They said this. The truth is that women have achieved plenty throughout history, but men often got credit for their work. Here are just a couple of examples. Male scientist Rosalind Franklin was the first to photograph the double helix structure of DNA, but two male researchers used her work with out permission and won awards for the discovery. Female R&B singer, Big Mama Thornton, was the first to record the song Hound Dog. When Elvis Presley later covered the song, it became his number one hit, selling millions of copies worldwide and helping him become the ultra famous king of rock and roll. Okay, so we hear this kind of thing all the time. The white men were thieves. They stole the achievements from other identity groups. But the people who make this claim can only ever provide a few very dubious examples. And that's because in reality, white men were and still are indispensable to our civilization, which is an understatement. A huge percentage of the greatest inventors, explorers, discovers, scientists, philosophers, political leaders, artists, authors, poets, pioneers who built this country and this civilization were white or men and very often were both. And not because they stole the work of others or they claimed credit for what others have done, but because they did it. They achieved it. They built it and they passed it down to us. This is simply a fact that should be acknowledged just like it's acknowledged for every other group. It's a fact that many in our society, especially younger people, actually don't know because we're not allowed to specifically acknowledge it. Kids grow up with resentment and suspicion towards white men rather than gratitude and the kind of gratitude they should have. And in fact, this attitude is so ingrained. It is so pervasive. It is so poisonous that for me to even say that they should have gratitude will be considered incredibly sexist and racist. Everything I'm saying right now is guaranteed to end up on Twitter with people expressing outrage and derision. Grateful for white men. How could you say such a thing? Even though they would have no problem and would applaud me if I said we should be grateful for any other group of people. Let's be grateful for black for black Americans. Let's be grateful for women. Let's be grateful for native Americans. Let's be grateful for non-binary polyamorous and Mexican Eskimos. All of that would be met with approval. But then if you add, let's be grateful for white men. Shock and shrieks of heart. This is again a real problem and it really matters. It's not about merely pointing out a double standard because this is not just a double standard. It's about pointing out a real and extremely successful effort to demonize a certain group of people and to erase their achievements. You hear so much about groups of people being erased and their achievements. That's only actually happening to one group and that is white men. The only group of people in this country that are being erased in any kind of meaningful way historically are white men. And then people that are being erased in another sense, women by the trans activists. Those are the two ways in which people are erased in this culture. But those are also the ways that are never acknowledged. We are not the first society to single out a group this way. We won't be the last. And that's why we know where it leads and we know that it doesn't lead anywhere good. And that is why today in women's history, the effort to cancel white men is instead canceled. That will do it for today and for the week. We'll talk to you on Monday. Have a great weekend. Godspeed. Godspeed."
