    "text": " Welcome to the Meghan Kelly show, your home for open, honest, and provocative conversations. Hey everyone, I'm Meghan Kelly. Welcome to the Meghan Kelly show. Today on the program, we have got a treat for you. A team of reporters, social commentators, and stars of the hit podcast, blocked and reported. Jesse Singell and Katie Herzog. Now, I first fell in love with them through Katie, who is the funniest thing going on Twitter. I mean, you've got to follow her on Twitter. She's a reason to join Twitter. She's just got a sense of humor like none other. And he's right there with her. He's just actually come out with a new book, which you might find interesting to talk about a little bit about bad psychology and why it can't cure our social ills. What? Just when you thought you had life solved. But these two are sort of, I think I described them the other day as sort of disaffected liberals or sort of liberals who have been kicked out of the liberal crew because they're not taking the same approach to issues like, I don't know, transgender rights as others. I mean, they're totally pro trans rights, 100% pro. But they write openly about some of the issues that have been caused like, but what happens when somebody detransitions and what happens with some of these puberty blocking drugs? Is it as safe as people would have you believe? Actual journalism, that's all it is, but they get hammered, right? They get hammered. Unless they persist and they haven't lost their senses of humor along the way. Their podcast is described as, and I quote, part politics, part pop culture, part obsessive dissection of esoteric internet slap fights and sporadically insightful. Anyway, you're going to enjoy the conversation. We'll get to them one second. I promise you'll like them. But first this. Hey guys. Hey. Hi. Thank you so much for having us, baby. The pleasure is all mine. I'm so excited. There's so many things I want to ask you, including this one, Katie. I love you on Twitter and I don't understand why you are you wearing a scuba suit in your little Twitter? What is it? What are you wearing in that little picture? It is a so I was a I had a show on the local like PBS station. And at one point they forced me to put on a wetsuit and a scuba mask in swimmin' a tank with salmon. This is what this is what PBS this is what taxpayer money goes to. So that's just see if they were swimming upstream. I don't like why they make you do that. It was it was it was like it's sort of an environmental kind of show and it was I don't actually remember what the exact episode was about. But but it was an an actual tank like a like a holding tank for like baby salmon that they would eventually release into the water. It was very weird. I love it because to me it bespeaks of a lack of vanity which to me. You cannot relate. But I admire it in other women. Well it also has the added benefit of not showing my face. So there's that. Well I saw something funny you tweeted out the other day maybe it was I don't know it was recent but you said something like I love taking flights to was it. Oh, I just got back. I just got back from bail. Yeah. Yeah. Because it allows me to keep up in the latest developments in plastic surgery. Also for lots of fur and veil. Oh is that right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It's a whole thing. I don't do veil a lot so I didn't know that. You know it's ash been light. You know same vibe. Okay. I what I do know about I think it's veil is when you go out there and you drive to you know the mountain. There's a big liquor store called Beaver Lickers. It's kind of fantastic. I'll have to stop by next time I go. Right. Right. Anyway. I go out to Montana which is actually pretty nice. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm going to I'm going to look at it in a new light now for for new plastic surgery advances. I had never considered that but every time I go to Scottsdale Arizona or LA. Yes. I have the same feeling as you. You know and probably only noticing the black the bad plastic surgery because you surely don't actually notice the good plastic surgery. Well can I tell you I think that might be the difference between like New York and LA because the women here I think are vain but they they just don't look like they've been trying too hard you know in LA. Yeah. You see a lot of those huge lips and the huge boobs and the huge butts. Yeah. In New York it's sort of more like an effortless like wow was she why does she still look 20 when she just had a social security card. Right. In Seattle it's just it's just flannel and in place there's it's not a very vain city. I don't think I could make it there. No way. I live in a I live in like a navy town outside Seattle but that's where I was for until I bought a house out in kind of the suburbs but yeah. Okay. I don't I mean you tell me but whenever I do a story about like some conservative who got run out of Seattle for a bad tweet or a bad well I'm like I I'm not a conservative but I think I'm associated enough with the brand that I don't think I'd be happy. I think people wouldn't like me. You would be you would be run out of town. I mean I'm not kidding when I say like Alex Jones was in was in Seattle for I think like five five minutes before somebody threw a cup of coffee in his face. Oh my god. Wait. Yeah. You're not getting. I'm not I'm not equating to I'm not equating the two not at all. I mean I saw couldn't couldn't really live there. Right. Stickers all up calling her turf and everything. Right. If I'm problematic he would be incredibly problematic in Seattle. Yes. Where are you Jesse? Where do you live? I live in Brooklyn. I'm doing this for my parents outside Boston. I'm visiting them. Okay. So how did you two connect online? We we met first through email I emailed Jesse when I was working on a story about D transitioners and then we became Twitter buddies. We get asked that question a lot and I think we should start giving different answers every time. Say we like we met at Twitter rehab or something like that. We were married briefly in the night. It's a long story. Yeah. We met at Adult Swim Camp. Oh no. I like that. Yeah. Okay. So it was Twitter love that brought you together which I like Twitter love. It was Twitter love that brought me together with you too. Yeah. I fell in love with both of you guys just you're so clever. Your approach to humor is so you're just you're just you're not afraid to say anything which is rare in a journalist. You make fun of anyone and everything which I also love most of all yourselves and each other. So there's something kind of endearing about your act. You know like just the two of you mocking each other in a loving respectful way. But there's something very fresh underneath the Twitter stick. There's no actual personality. So we need to get those from. That's it. So now are you the other day when I was teasing you guys I'm like how should I tease these guys and I went with something like what did I say like ostracized liberals or heterodox. I know you hate that word liberals but like you would you am I correct to say you're more left leaning but you've kind of been kicked out of the club because you've reported honestly on certain trans issues that have led people to say terrible things about you. I think that's fair. I mean it's weird. So the reason I bristle a little at heterodox is like when you look at the views we've actually expressed they you know 95% of the country would find them uncontroversial what's so weird about media right now is like you need to be in that 5% to remaining the good graces of sort of everyone on Twitter and yeah I mean I think we've tried to push back against the idea that that we've said anything all that controversial although the fact you haven't treated as controversial tells you something yeah. Well so let's talk about that because this is there was a great piece about you Jesse in Colette that I recommend everybody read and it's called the campaign of lies against journalist Jesse single and why it matters and and it sort of lays out what happened to you but one of the points I want to start with is the guy makes a great point the other makes a great point about how all the stuff you've said I've said it a lot of people have said it and it's not a thing if you're at all affiliated with the right you don't get in trouble for saying all the stuff you've said and reported if you are affiliated with the left they come for you so why do you think that is why why do you get in such trouble for reporting that it's not even like hey you should consider detransitioning if you're trans it's hey some people have detransitioned that's like you're reporting in a nutshell. Yeah I mean so I think this is a flaw that emerges in a lot of political movements there's definitely been versions of this on the right but it's this whole thing of like you attack whoever is immediately to your left or to your right instead of you know taking a bigger picture approach so in recent weeks Katie and I have both been getting attacked as though our writing inspired the state level laws seeking to ban youth transition but Katie and I have never come out against youth transition in that manner we've just said kids should be well assessed before they go on you know major medical treatment so I think like maybe from the point of view of people on the left like there's nothing they can do about Mitch McConnell but they can sure as hell try to drive us out of the club and have some impact on our career in a way they can't on Mitch McConnell's which I would argue is maybe not the best approach because we're sort of not the problem if you look at it correctly but it's a I don't know I do think there's something very peculiar about online politics at the moment and there's this real drive to purify your own spaces. I think I mean you tell me what you think Katie but I feel like it's twofold they feel betrayed because you're quote supposed to be seeing the world you know as they do on their side and also they feel more threatened because your sphere of influence is their people you know like they don't want somebody saying something they don't approve of in the circles in which they travel it's one thing if you're gonna be Tucker Carlson you're gonna influence you know a bunch of folks live Mississippi they can live with that but they can't live with you influencing Seattle and you Brooklyn. I think that's totally right I think both of you are right you know it's this sort of narcissism of small differences where you could you could agree on 95% of the issue but that 5% just becomes intractable and that becomes so threatening that there's this this impulse to try to remove you from the conversation and it's really unfortunate because we should be debating these issues in a way that's evidence based and it's good faith not resorting to personal and tax on people because I think you know in in reality we all do want the same thing which is good outcomes for everybody but our ways of getting there are very destructive well and even if you take away sort of the overall goal of good outcomes for everybody you're journalists you report on the facts the facts you don't make the facts you you can sure you could say I'm never going to report on anybody who's transitioned but why would you do that I mean the news is the news this is a whole this a very large movement in a very large cultural development that the trans rights movement over the past 10 years in particular and we have to be able to report on it and you don't get to just report the news that is pro one piece of it or it's not even a pro or anti it's this is a piece of it this is part of what we're seeing it's made a lot of news just recently because of Kira Bell this gal over in England who's really ticked off that she feels she was rushed through this process and detrain and transitioned from female to male and had a double mastectomy and is mad that not more people in the system stop to say you sure you want this as opposed to yes yes a firm yeah and well it's so disturbing about it is is I I Katie and I both see ourselves as journalists you know opinion journalists but we're not we're not activists it's not our job to only present one party side or the other and the complete collapse of scientific journalism on this one subject where it's just not treated like the it's basically like a biomedical ethics question is really complicated to know how to best help a 20 year old 12 year old who is in genuine anguish but the only tools you have in your tool belt are these treatments that are experimental according to the UK government there is not great evidence for them I happen to think that they are the best bet for kids who would otherwise suffer a great deal but there's a genuine conversation to be had here and it depresses me that we've gotten to the point where I almost have to point people to right wing outlets that I on other issues don't trust very much at all because our side of the aisle just isn't covering this issue well and covering this issue well does not mean invalidating these kids are saying they should never go on hormones it just means treating it like any other scientific controversy I found that really demoralizing and infuriating. What can you talk about because you guys you're pretty brave I have to say especially given that you've taken such a beating both of you for your reporting but I did hear you guys talking about recently these I think it was puberty blockers and how there really are risks to these and I will confess I was in the camp of like I heard people say that they could have potentially bad effects but it never really researched it seemed like a drug is it Lupron that's been around a long time to you know for precocious puberty when somebody starts you know if a girl's gonna get a period of eight they'll give it to her or that kind of thing so I'm like how bad could it be and that gives the kid another couple of years to figure out where they are mentally if you're using it if you think you're trans I learned a lot from what you were saying in terms of the long term studies that have been done on that for kids who have received it for non-trans issues and they're a little scary Katie. Yeah so Lupron has been FDA approved since the early 90s as a pain reliever for women with endometriosis as well as for precocious puberty but if you it's sort of interesting so Jesse and I did a show about this a couple I guess last week specifically about these bills in North Carolina and Arkansas in a couple other places that would ban puberty blockers for children and even for adults in some cases or ban cross-sex hormones for adults and if you if you google Lupron which is which is the brand name of this one particular puberty blocker and side effects what you find is that there are some very serious side effects in fact it's apparently so toxic that it's not recommended for use for more than 12 months in a lifetime I found an article from a Las Vegas news station that says that there are that the FDA has listed over 200 I'm sorry 25,000 adverse reports for Lupron and that and there are really serious side effects like suicidal thoughts stroke muscle atrophy joint and bone and joint pain some people say that it's affiliated with vision loss and you can find lots of articles about people saying like people who are prescribed a stroke or precocious puberty or some other reason who are saying they were I was harmed by this drug but if you google Lupron transgender which you mostly find not entirely but what you mostly find are these sort of you know this is reversible this is a this is a life-saving drug for young does for children and they're not talking about the side effects some well but but most don't so you get really two different sides of the story just by doing that one exercise and it's interesting to see this because what you see in most mostly left leading media is this is this thing repeated over and over again this is here this is reversible this is just a pause and it turns out that that's probably not always the case and if you really care about trans kids and I'm not saying these activists don't care about trans kids I think they really do care about trans kids but if you care about them in a smart way we should be acknowledging the potential side effects because to not do that is going to cause actual harm to the kids that you are supposed to be helping and this isn't to say that puberty blockers shouldn't be legal I'm really both of us are very much against these state bills we don't think that the state has any business getting in between you know patients and doctors when it comes to this or really other issues other healthcare issues so that's not the answer either but we really do need to grapple with the with the very real effects of this medication and we need to do it in a way that's honest and not sort of you know not turn it into a culture war issue and this has become a culture war issue and that is making it harder to actually get to the bottom of what's going on right now well it's so crazy when you list those side effects and you think they just stopped the J&J vaccine for six incidents of blood clots out of seven million vaccines right six six blood clots and one death though we don't know the circumstances of that so but I mean at a seven million vaccines it's a minuscule amount and look at all the side effects you list on this on this one drug very popular and being dispensed at the ready but I just one point I want to follow up on is I think that the reason some of these more red states are feeling like they need to pass these bills and the bills I'll be honest they make me somewhat uncomfortable but I think the reason they're feeling they could have to do it is because the doctors have surrendered to these far left scolds who just tell them they have only one option which is to affirm and then prescribe otherwise they're going to be in trouble they'll be in trouble with the licensing board you know the the the massive medical industries like the AMA and American Academy of Pediatrics they're sort of leaning on these doctors now to prescribe the drugs as requested and to just affirm and I think that's scary too to a lot of parents who would prefer to have an objective medical take on where their kid is I mean this is one of the real problems right now is like trans health care is just a complete wild west in the US so the story I got in trouble with about this stuff on was for the Atlantic it was a long story I highlighted several clinicians who are seen as affirming clinicians they are seen as the good guys in my view they did a very good job helping kids work through these issues decide helping them decide who would benefit the most from blockers and hormones so I hear what you're saying I think some of these clinicians are quacks and are not doing a good job but the problem is there's no real standards of care all the standards of care we have a completely non-binding we don't have a national health care system so it's just like the care you get in rural Oklahoma versus the Bay Area it may be awful in both places but in complete opposite directions there's just if you're I feel so bad for parents going through this because it's like a role of the dice whether the doctor your kid goes to or the therapist your kid goes to has any idea what they're doing and that's like that's not a good situation well and Abigail Shroude just tweeted out something a study a couple days ago about how they they looked at female-to-male transitioners who had actual surgery and the number of complications in those cases was stunning it was more than every single case had a complication it was like double of those who had the procedure had serious complications and complaints and some complained of you know pretty significant deformities and so on and and she was kind of making a similar point which is this science is so untested and trying to find doctors who are honest and actually know what they're doing is very sketchy anyway the way through all of that historically has been to be open and honest about it for the medical profession to report the the errors and the problems and for the journalists to fearlessly report on them so people have real information just feels like we're not in that place Katie right so I haven't seen Abigail's tweet or the study that she's talking about but and you know there are different medical procedures so top surgery if a trans if a trans guy you know wants to have his press removed that's a double mastectomy that's a that's a common surgery it's been done for a long time you know I'm sure there are complications of that but there are more experimental surgeries like phalloplasty which is the creation of a penis and I've interviewed people who've had this procedure and there can be really horrific side effects just it's an incredibly difficult surgery and there can be really terrible side effects the thing is if someone like Jess here I reported on this we would be accused or Abigail Shire we would be accused of being transphobic and trying to deny trans people health care if Jezebel or some other some other outlet or a trans person reported the same thing you know they would be they would be lauded for saying for trying to happen Jess about that a piece of this horrible surgeon who who just horrific outcomes but that we should want that kind of reporting yeah we absolutely yeah and but when Jessi and I do it or when Abigail does it it's it's seen as transphobic when other people do it it's seen as elevating trans health care which we should all want we should not want people to have these horrific outcomes from their surgeries we should all want the same thing but because this has it has been so filtered through these cultural or lenses and some people are good and some people are bad you know it becomes sort of impossible and as Jessi said you know some of the some of the only good reporting on these issues is being done in the conservative media because the mainstream and left media is terrified to report on these things well and not only that but the that as you guys know the other narrative that gets thrown back at you as a journalist and others anybody poking these bears is you're gonna cause children to kill themselves I mean they play that the ultimate trump card any parent who needs to be done on Twitter yeah right like that that's scary to hear you obviously nobody wants that but it's it's also it doesn't seem like an appropriate card to throw out there so cavalierly no it's dangerous and we also don't know that it's true that if you if you tell a kid no you cannot have purity blockers at the age of 13 that does not mean that the child is going to kill themselves and and and that's a very irresponsible way to report on suicide and this goes against all of the all of the acceptable standards of reporting on suicide you do not want to spark a suicide contagion by telling children that if they don't get what they want when they want it the inevitable outcome is suicide it's everything's sort of what do they say ass overhead when it comes to the reporting on this stuff but I it's gotten personal with you guys and Jesse I confess I didn't realize quite how bad it was until I read the the piece in Quillette um so I hope I'm not I love Coleman Hughes you guys know him right yeah um so he had me on his podcast and he refused to ask me about my NBC cancellation and that whole thing because he was and he said he didn't say it when I was on the air he said it later when he was taping the intro and I heard it when I listened back to his intro um I'm I'm not going to ask her about it because one of the problems with cancel culture is you re traumatize the person when you keep asking them about it and making them relive it and I was like yet another reason alone Coleman So I don't mean to you know bring up Just the awful things Jesse so forgive me But I did want to ask you because what they're trying to do these sort of trans activists I guess they are trans journalists are not even necessarily trans journalists some of these are just um like one of the ones he talks about in his piece is a A quote popular parenting to calm this name Nicole cliff Who have come after you in really and I want to stay up front zero proof for any of this It's it isn't true But I mean stuff like he's sexually exploited at least a dozen trans women and that one's true That you were sending out dick pics not true Really that's verifiable, but I mean they went to the place that hurts. Yeah, I will say I mean one of the And I don't mind you asking it's not traumatizing. I mean it's infuriating um Yeah, basically This started in 2016 sort of the light version of it after I wrote another controversial article about the um A gender clinic in Toronto that was closed, but uh after the 2018 Atlantic article a lot of a weird so-called sock puppet accounts popped up on twitter Basically trying to contrive some sort of me to a vena gets me They would say that I had sent inappropriate pictures That I had sort of tried to hit on trans women just basically anything from the Sort of me to playbook you can imagine all of it all of it fabricated and I was able to ignore it because it was mostly just Weirdos and and you don't necessarily want to give oxygen to weirdos By by responding to them aggressively But things really escalated when slates parenting advice columnist nicole cliff publicly announced that I was obsessed with trans women and that I had um Repeatedly tried to get them to meet me for lunch under shady circumstances I've laughed because I hate I don't like people. I don't like meeting people for lunch Intermittent fasting he would never honestly I'm a grab Worked by the way. Does it the intermittent fasting? 100% we have to do a show on that it's it actually works Starvation is yes is a good way to lose weight totally as it turns out. You don't actually eat you lose weight Hi, I never put two and two together like that. I eat I just don't eat between the hours of a p.m And new and then I eat like a fiend and it's awesome. All right. Sorry. Keep going Jesse So yeah, bodega cheese. That's more your thing by yourself Exactly not with real people. I hate real people. Um, no, and so just just seeing this stuff escalate and and always with no proof Uh, and it gets so ridiculous. I mean One one trans writer accused me of slut shaming her and the start and the finish of that allegation is I complimented a piece She wrote about dating as trans I just I So There's a really good book called galloway was middle finger by a woman named alastrigre I believe katie sends it to people who get sort of publicly shamed and and it's about what happens on the left If you're seen as crossing certain lines and most of the book is about The horrific rumors that get spread against people often with no proof for For doing this. I'm lucky that this all happened to me in my mid 30s rather than my mid 20s Because I genuinely think it would have ruined my career. Otherwise if I hadn't yet been established as a journalist and had good editorial contacts who who would want to Commission a piece from someone like me with all this stuff floating around online. I just It infuriates me. There's no accountability for professional journalists who spread these lies Delete the tweets never apologize If we can't agree that journalists shouldn't spread public Slender about their perceived enemies What's left with the journals and why should anyone trust us? So that's what's that's what's really got me about this people can misinterpret my work. They can call me transphobic, but to just Fabricate lies about someone that it's been an unpleasant experience Well, and I see you fighting back now sometimes and I like it there was somebody out there Um, her name is I guess she's a video game developer Uh briana woo who treated out about you. She she piled on and said I have my own jesse single stories I've never shared publicly one day. I will and I have receipts as if like You gave her a receipt after you harassed her or we're creepy tour I'm like and here's your receipt for my treatment anyway I love it because that is so It's disgusting because that's like a middle schooler. So So Scaller But it's been done in the me too movement where people say I've got my own stories about this guy You know one day I'll tell them and sometimes they come through that happened in the andro quomo case with the accuser number one Um, so I think it has this tendency of getting people to believe it and you were you quickly Responding briana should share these stories immediately. I think it's really important to get to the bottom of this Oh, what a shock no receipts were provided. No additional claims were made and they never will be Well, the great the the great thing about that particular story so briana woo is not just the video game developer She ran for conga congaise twice. Um, did not win as as clearly Um, but one of our followers offered to put up a thousand dollars if she would share the receipts and then other people started started pledging money It was the safest bet you could have possibly made but we got like 60 thousand dollars of pledges that You know people would donate to the charity of briana woo's choice if she could just provide the evidence that she claimed that she had Um that jesse had you know done something untoward to her and she just you know never happened so that's amazing Right, so I think that she was actually harming trans children. I mean think of how many trans orphans 60 thousand dollars could have could have uh been good point Coming up in one second. We're going to get into lgbtq. What does what does q mean exactly? I've heard different things they're going to walk me through it and we're going to talk about why there are so many letters Is it necessary? What does it say? Is that virtue signaling? Should the b still be in there? Well, we'll get into all of it plus we're going to turn to the latest police involved shooting out of minnesota Um as you know this officer kim potter now Uh had discharged her weapon instead of her taser and she killed a young man dante right and there have been riots and There are now charges and we're going to talk to our guests about it, but first this Now katie let me ask you about being a turf This is what jk roling is claimed to be they've used this term against you Just explain what it is and how you get labeled that Sure. So a turf is a radical Trans exclusionary radical feminist i'm not trans exclusionary and i'm not a radical feminist So this does not apply to me whatsoever. I don't think it applies to jk roling either It's interesting, you know jesse gets these uh he gets allegations or rumors about this sort of like weird Sexual innuendo because he's a straight man and i'm a lesbian so people call me a turf Um, so it's just it's so it's basically stereotypes. You're just applying stereotypes to us Uh, which seems problematic to me. Um, so so this is a term that is used a lot of people say that it's a slur I don't totally think that it's a slur, but it is definitely not a term of an end of endearment and it's used just to shut down conversations It's basically it's a it's a synonym for transphobic So in my case what happened was that in 2017 i wrote an article for the stranger Seattle's alt weekly um where i was a staff writer on d transitioners And it was a it was not an opinion piece It was just sort of a profile of six or seven of people who had gone to this experience And I I regret it recently and I realized that it was sort of I I went kind of overboard A reassuring people are trying to reassure people that the existence of d transitioners doesn't in any way invalidate trans identities And I think trans adults should have access to health care and and really sort of hedged Um in a way that I probably wouldn't do now Um, it's sort of embarrassing to reread that and see how sort of cautious I was Um with this piece, um, but there was a really crazy outcry and it wasn't just online Although of course it was online, but people Uh somebody burned stacks of the newspaper and sent me video of it People put flyers all around Seattle calling me transphobic. There are stickers around Seattle calling me Transphobic, there's another one calling me a Jordan peter cinemologist. Um, there's a picture of my face Uh that says i'm a Nazi sympathizer And so this sure right and this is Seattle's a pretty small town Um, and so this was not just you know, I lost tons of friends. Um, I was basically ostracized I heard at one point. There was a there was a photo of me Somebody printed out a photo of me and put it in a urinal at a gay bar in Seattle A gay bar that I had that I had been to and enjoyed um, so so this went, you know It was online, but it was also offline in the way that was very disturbing Um, and if you read the piece I think anybody who who like actually reads the piece will see that it is there's nothing transphobic about it And in fact argues in favor of adequate, you know, good health care for trans people Um, so it was just this it was a very bizarre experience to see sort of this caricature of myself Um as a you know an evil transphobic bigot Emerge from this from this deeply reported story that actually had transensitivity readers Um, not a word that I've had time. Can we be honest about there? There's something going on With lesbians and the trans community activists I distinguish the activists from the community large because I just don't think they were represented by these very loud Very bullying activists, but there's something going on because you know abigail talked about this in her book And in on my show when she was talking about how it's no longer considered cool to be lesbian. Sorry katie I know I know We're over lesbianism. That's true. That's true. Right. This has actually been true for for years Um, you know queer it's cool to be queer. It's not cool to be a lesbian because lesbians are seen and they i'm sort of generalizing here Um, but in many circles lesbians are seen as as exclusionary because lesbians are you know female homosexuals who are same-sex attracted Who sort of by definition or the old definition? Um, you know males Trans women would not be would not be included in sort of their their sexual interest. There are plenty of lesbians who Date trans women or trans guys and call themselves lesbians. That's also a thing Um, but it's where the old definition is often seen as seen as a problematic Um, yeah, so so I mean aren't you by by definition exclusionary is exclusionary if you're a gay man or or a lesbian woman I mean, yes, you're exclusionary. I mean, or a straight person. I mean exclusionary too is a straight person right? There's only one right one by like in that way. That's what's so weird about this is I I've not like straight men seem to be No one seems to be focusing on straight men who are a much larger group than lesbians and what our sort of Preferences are it's this weird focus on lesbians per se that I don't I I've had trouble understanding 100% I've noticed it too. Go ahead kitty So it also doesn't so there's lots of drama within sort of the lesbian community or what would have been formally noticed the lesbian Community was just sort of queer queer women. Um, there's lots of infighting and drama about whether or not, you know Lesbian spaces should be allowed to be female only You don't see that in gay male spaces. So if you have a like a dance party that's for specifically for lesbians Chances are there's going to be some complaints if you even use the term lesbian and you're advertising or whatever because that's seen as exclusionary You don't see that in gay male spaces. So wait You're supposed to say queer instead Right, right. What's the difference? Can you just explain how how is that term? The way it's used? What's the difference between being a lesbian and being queer? I mean now queer is sort of meaningless because queer has expanded to also mean like heterosexuals who are polyamorous or kinky So it's basically anything that isn't like a monogamous heterosexual sort of traditional relationship because people want to opt into it I think because everybody wants to be special Um, so you have you know people who would not have been considered queer a couple years ago have now opted into this into this And it used to be a slurf now. It's been a race now. It's like you're allowed to say that now I mean, I mean, I'm not if you're not Yeah, you do. Yeah, can I say it can somebody who streets I do. Yeah. I mean it is It is the acceptable term now. It is a way of like signaling your allyship is to use the term Is that what the queue is on lgbtq because somebody told me the queue is actually questioning. I was like I thought it was clear I don't understand. Yeah, it just depends on who you ask. I mean that's queued on actually They're there now Very inclusive. Yeah, exactly. I'm sorry But if it's if it's queer didn't we cover it with buy sort of and it's like too many letters They I don't think that questioning by the way should get its own letter. That's right. They shouldn't get a letter lgbt is enough That just means that you're an adolescent if you're questioning and and buy is now problematic too because buy Pre-supposed is that there are only two genders So really what you if you're if you want to be like the best You know the best queer the best ally which you are is pan Which means you are attracted to all genders all 47 genders So it's gonna be lgbtq soon. Right. We're just gonna get rid of the l and the b. It'll just be q&p from now on Yeah, so Lots of tension within the queer community and I should say there isn't really such a thing as the queer community um, there's You know just like there's no such thing as the black community or the white community There this is a population that oftentimes doesn't get along that oftentimes doesn't like each other and doesn't socialize Um, but yes, there's lots of tension and a lot of it tends to be generational where you have older gay men And lesbians who sort of don't understand or don't appreciate the new the new rules being imposed I wrote about this for Andrew Sullivan's newsletter and did not go over well I will to put it mildly But there is a thing and this isn't just lesbians, but there are lots and lots of females who are Either opting into to sort of the non binary identity or transitioning and I've seen this in my own Friend circle in a way that is kind of mind blowing I mean, I should keep a spreadsheet Of everybody's pronouns now because it seems like half of the women that I know are now trans or non binary and how to You know have changed their names some of them have gotten surgeries some of them Haven't and just sort of opt into this non binary thing But it is it is a trend and even saying that it's a trend is something that people Think is offensive, but I do think that this is a trend it's a social contagion And that makes sense because Lots of human behavior is I mean most human behavior all human behavior possibly is socially influenced And there's this idea that if you think that there is some social influence on on what is happening that that is somehow deeply offensive because no It has to be about This deep internal identity this deep sense of who you really are and there can't be any social influence on that So if somebody says that they're trans or non binary It can't possibly be influenced by the people around them by their peers, you know, but that's just everything we do Everything we do is offensive now. I mean like you guys know that everything we do is offensive You can't if you cannot tip toe through the line through to the landmines of life in 2021 america without Stepping online. I mean you're just they're everywhere. So you're gonna offend and by the way I love that on twitter. You say your pronouns are me me me It's about pronouns me me and back to me Well, there is a narcissism about this You know this identity Identarianism that we're seeing right now I mean when I was when I was a younger person and sort of coming into my own sexual identity The idea was to get rid of labels. We would talk about how labels didn't define us And now it's like the more labels you can put on yourself the higher you are in the hierarchy I know I I I refuse to do it. I I'm supportive of the trans community. Love you Supporting you rooting for you, but I'm not gonna say my pronouns Figured out if you want say your pronouns you want to tell me privately what they are I'm happy to go buy whatever your pronouns are but I'm just not gonna run it walk in a room Say my pronouns and if that makes me a turf. Huh. Oh, well, I've been called worse Um, all right Let me shift gears with you for a second because I just want to hit you guys up on your For your take on a couple of the things in the news today Um because I think you're left leaning but I'm interested in your in your opinion on things like uh What's happening in brooklyn center, minnesota you you saw that this 20-year-old man, uh, dante right was killed by a police officer there a white woman He was black Because she pulled what she thought was her taser This is her explanation, but it was in fact her gun And she shot him and he died And now that we've had a couple of days of riots in min in minneapolis or in this town brooklyn center, minnesota And 60 people were arrested for the riots there and so on and so forth. I am I we're going to get into this in a second, but I don't understand why the city manager had to be fired Because he said he's a black man by the way city manager because he said I think we should you know, she's entitled to do process now. She resigned the cop resigned And he just said before like the mob comes for her because it was at this like city hearing He's like she's entitled to do process. He got fired just for saying that And I have to tell you it disturbs me. No one's defending the woman's If you believe what she said mistake and it sounds like it was genuine because on tape she goes Oh my god, she goes taser taser taser than she fires and she goes. Oh my god I shot him it was in my gun So it's pretty clear that it was a mistake, but we'll see well why shouldn't we have an investigation? Why shouldn't we have due process? Why must we just appease the mob immediately by saying yes, she's awful and apparently We've got to go with racist and she's afforded to no process whatsoever Yeah, it's super disturbing. I you know, uh, Chelsea Handler during the shohan trial tweeted something about like why should we have trials? If this whole thing was on video Um, you know, which is sort of the same point, you know that Due process is somehow doesn't uh doesn't apply or shouldn't apply Um, if we think that the crime was bad enough, which is just a terrible trend You know, I think this was one of my sort of um criticisms of me too You know, we need to have due process claims should never just stand on their own We shouldn't hashtag believe women or hashtag believe victims We should always do an investigation And defending that principle is incredibly important or should be incredibly important Especially for liberals, especially for people like us And one of the things that disturbs me about this trend that we've seen in recent years is that liberals are Are giving up that mantle the mantle of actual liberalism or due process important free speech is important that we Defend the rights of people who have done terrible things because the principle should be more important in these individual cases And uh, we're not seeing that right now Yeah, and you you've got people like rachita taleeb who tweets out after this happened And I quote it wasn't an accident. Okay. She's gonna be the arbiter. I like she just knows she's in the woman's head It wasn't an accident policing in our country is inherently and intentionally racist Dante right was met with aggression and violence I am done with those who condone government funded murder No more policing Incarceration and militarization. It can't be reformed that this literally is what black lives matter in their chapter in your neck Of the woods in seattle has said explicitly open the jails get rid of the justice system No more courts no more prisons and we've heard on a wider basis No more cops because it's it cannot be reformed and it's government funded murder This is a sitting us congresswoman this person is insane because as we all know what would happen if if her world Came about is those of us with any sort of money in our pockets would be just fine And people who live in the poor communities would get killed in astronomical numbers Right. I tweeted something about this about how uh, how you know sure like let's do this and rich people will hire private security And poor people can do like community watch or whatever This is also a losing position when it comes to democratic politics because if you look at polling including polling of black populations They don't say that they want You know the police defunded they don't say that they don't want prisons to to exist anymore What they say is they want better policing and sometimes that actually means more policing They want their neighborhoods to be safe like everybody should want their neighborhoods to be safe I mean, that's what's so frustrating about this is there's been decades of polling suggesting as you would expect That if you're a black american in a low-income area, you have like a tortured relationship to the police I think police are abusive all the time I I'm from an upper middle class white family and my own family members and myself have had multiple run-ins with with police who were jerks and not obviously not as bad as being assaulted or killed but It frustrates me that this is sort of seen as like the Left position or even the like person of color position when polling shows that black people want police to show up to protect them on average We can't speak for every member of a group, but they also don't want to be treated poorly by them They shouldn't be a surprise if you just look at the polling So I think that a lot of the reporting on this has been terrible and has been very Frankly soft on this abolitionist position that is is really half-baked like they can't answer basic follow-up questions about What it would mean? It's also a distraction because someone was just killed for basically no reason because of a horrible error And we're talking about police abolition, which is not gonna happen versus how to try to make sure that doesn't happen again I don't even know how you make sure that doesn't happen again I feel like this woman when I first saw it, I thought okay, so she must be a newbie You know, she must have just panicked in a tense moment and the guy was resisting arrest And that's a that's an intense situation for any officer. She'd been on the force for 20 years I think she did the right thing in resigning. There's no future for her in that police department the police chief also resigned That's just a political move He didn't need to go she made a terrible mistake if I make a mistake in this job I have the opportunity to come back on and correct it and you know write the record you guys too in your jobs It's not the case for a police officer and certainly in this environment mistakes aren't aren't quote allowed Right. They're not going to be allowed at all. I have no problem with this woman losing her job Um, a man lost his life. She can at least lose her job, but people are saying they want her to be charged It's like, okay, so We can do that Then we will have due process then there's going to be a system to figure out whether in fact She committed any crime because all the evidence we've seen so far suggests It was an accident and none of the evidence suggests It was racist. She was white. He was black, but he was resisting arrest That's why and even the officers on site were saying A taser would have been appropriate given what this guy was doing It the fact that she reached for the wrong thing is awful But I don't know we jump immediately to racism in all these Situations now when the the race of the person being arrested is black I think that you know, the media is very complicit in this because here's an example So I live in a small town in western Washington Over the summer a couple months after the the death of george floyd a guy was killed by police about 13 miles from me And we don't know this we don't know the full story He was uh, he was sitting on an on an overpass apparently and something happened He was unarmed and he was shot and killed by police The seattle times the local newspaper didn't even send a reporter the 13 miles across the water To report on this story. It got almost no press locally Why is that? Well, the guy was white if he had been the been black It would have been a major story There would have been riots and protests in the cities And if you look at the data and I know megan you've talked about this on your show If you look at the data what we can see is that white people are also killed At at you know at significant rates actually not even significant. This is all actually pretty rare By cops, we just we know that it is not only people of color who are being killed by police And we also know that white cops are not more likely to to kill unarmed people than uh than cops who are you know black or brown But instead of the media contextualizing this and saying, you know george floyd was one of 14 or 15 i'm not sure what the member with the number is but 14 or 15 You know black men killed by police in 2020 every time they talk about these incidents They leave people with the impression that there are many many more police killings of unarmed people than there actually are And i've done this i've asked people i've said, you know, how many how many you know unarmed black men do you think we're? We're killed by police last year and the answer is always at least a thousand Because the media doesn't actually contextualize this and if the media started doing this I think it would give people less of a skewed perspective of what's going on And the thing is if you want to if you want to stop police shootings ending racism doing implicit bias training Isn't the actual isn't gonna do it. That's not gonna do it. Not nothing at all. It will do absolutely nothing at all I mean, I do think de-escalation training. Yes, it's clearly needed. I mean that is a thing and I remember I interviewed for African-american female police chiefs from that It's sort of the north carolina quarter that that area rally germ and They were saying how they very rarely had physical confrontations on the job because as women who tended to be more slight You know in stature they had to learn de-escalation They they really had no choice They they knew they weren't gonna be pulling their gun all the time and they wanted to get to a point where they could handle and one of my favorites Um, she was hilarious. She was like she showed me her beautiful long beautiful nails and she goes Do you think I'm gonna mess these up on some loser suspect? Anyway, we need more of that for sure But we also have to understand this is inherently dangerous job and another lesson in all of it in most of these cases is Don't resist arrest Go back later fight it later if it's a bad cop if it's a racist cop if it's a bad arrest You can fight it on the scene All the odds are against you all of them. So it's just There is a responsibility within the black community within the white community both To teach our especially our young people don't resist arrest. It's a losing proposition You're never gonna win you're never gonna successfully flee the police. That's definitely true And there's also we need to also be talking about mental health, you know, there's also a correlation between police react, you know, police get called because of a You know sort of a mental health welfare check and somebody ends up dead, you know, there are ways to reform the system Um that don't involve defunding the police and actually might involve giving them more money in some cases Or reallocating it in different ways But yeah, this idea that we're just gonna get rid of police get rid of prisons It's never gonna happen as as jesse mentioned And so it just seems like a distraction away of sort of signaling how uh how how progressive you are on this particular issue When it's not gonna help anything it's not gonna happen and if it did happen it would probably make things worse for the very people who you should be protected So jesse's got a new book out uh talking about it's called why fad psychology can't cure our social ills And um, it's that's sad to learn but it can't and it's better to know rather than continue to practice some of these ridiculous techniques Thinking you're helping yourself when you're not and uh my old pal sharell samberg in her book lienin included One of these and jesse is ready to debunk it Are you doing it right now? Are you wasting your time thinking this one particular thing's gonna help you at home or the office? Stay tuned to find out what it is. But first I want to bring you a feature we have here on the program called sound up And this is where we play you a sound bite that we think you should hear that's been making the rounds And we'll talk about it and in this particular case it is the sound of the city manager who got fired the one and we were just talking about at a minnesota who got fired simply for calling for due process For kim potter the police officer Who has now resigned from her position after what she says was an accidental shooting listen in response to the question about termination Uh all employees working for the city of brooklyn center Are entitled to due process with respect to discipline Uh, this employee will receive due process due process Discipline will be determined if I would say anything else Um, I would actually be a contradictory the idea of due process This guy got fired for saying that fired What is happening to us? One city council member who who actually voted to oust him came out and said I did it because I feared retaliation by the protesters If I had voted to keep him in quote. He was doing a great job. I respect him dearly Again, this is a black man who loses his job In the wake of the shooting of another black man who was resisting arrest not to justify anything But just for perspective on why the situation was so tense and so he says let's you're asking if she's gonna be fired We're gonna give her a process. No, not only is that not okay. You're fired too Please chief's gone right and now When we when we taped With jesse and katie. I actually didn't know this but just moments moments after we say goodbye to them We just found out Kim potter's being charged with second degree manslaughter The the now former brooklyn center mini-appellist police officer kim potter is going to be charged with second degree Man slaughter. That's the same charge one of them that darik shovans charge with so Somebody thinks that his kneeling on the neck and everything that happened in that case for nine minutes Weren't the same charge against this woman where which we all saw unfold on camera Where she says taser taser taser and somebody says she was absolutely reckless In pulling out her gun and firing it now I guess you could make the case did she not recognize what she was feeling was a gun and not a taser Um, well if you want to do process for that to figure it out You gotta go you're gonna lose your job too. You have to be quiet and just accept whatever Whatever punishment the mob wants. That's how it's gonna be got it mob rule The mob threatens the city council with riots which are underway And they just do whatever they think they need to do. It's not about conscience. It's not about the law It's not about procedure. It's about avoiding the wrath of the mob He's fired and maybe you'll be fired too. If you say anything the mob doesn't like That's our country right now and it's pathetic back to our guest in one second but first this Now one instance in which the police did a very good job was when they arrested bernie made off That's just a really good segue I realized this has absolutely nothing to do with really that our subject matter But I just I want to talk about it. He's he's dead bernie made off died And I was just looking through the facts. You know on the the it's not a no bit Yeah, but just the right quick write-up so that about his death and his life Who's 82? He had been treated for kidney disease that was terminal when i'm sure you don't treat anything too aggressively when you're in prison and he He stole they estimated 65 billion dollars from people he had 37,000 victims in 136 countries Everybody from steven spielberg to kevin baken to le wizell, which is truly disgusting um, you know, no, no, no, but prize winner and holocaust survivor And He died and I just like that story was so big he was arrested in december of ole And I just think about like the carnage left in his way. His son killed himself um, the family was just completely Ruin the other the other son died pretty young of cancer after bernie went to jail anyway, and he thoughts on i'm bernie made off and That his passing and his life Rest in peace bernie How how he inspired our podcast You just got very dark. That's the next stage of the blocked and reported empire is uh, is financial investment Yeah, can we announce our new uh pyramids team on your podcast? Send what does that do with that go fund me? This is after going to go fund the go fund me is actually to fund your career as a budding rap artist, isn't it? Exactly. Thank you for mentioning that clearly white call of color crime does not get the attention it deserves Um compared to the you know, low level drug crime or things like that Katie people question our sense of morality a lot So we should just take this opportunity and use megan kelly's platform to say that we disagree with what he did We do we except when he ripped off ela was elle that was fine I i'm like constantly having this side step katies just endless anti semitism on the podcast So i'm i'm sorry this came up. It's identifying as jewish jesse. I'm i've opted then What speaking of that? What's your rap name jesse? Juicy how many listeners You can say because you're jewish Exactly. Yep Aren't those the rules? How's it going so far? You have a lot of fans Yeah, we um so when we launched the podcast Uh, or the patreon which is sort of our premium subscription Service a almost a year ago now I said that uh if we got to a certain level of dollars per month I would release a rap about psychology's replication crisis, which is also the subject of a a book of mine a quick fix that just came out That's where we're going next. Excellent. Um, yeah, and then I was um I think a mere eight or nine months late, but I finally released it Uh the day my book came out actually and it was I had some help from a psychologist named david pizarro at cornel who made me sound Less like what you're hearing now Uh, and I thought I don't know katie thought it wasn't horrible and I I trust her judgment Oh, yeah, i'm a real connoisseur of rap music. You should really trust my judgment My I was actually impressed with the length that was like almost five minutes and lost with the words rimes Um, I thought it was going to be much much worse than it was it was sort of impressive Yeah, and if people want the uh what access to that for whatever reason um they can join our patreon people should we should use that as a quote for our podcast I thought it was gonna be much much worse than it was New dad line So can I tell you I I was listening to you guys and some terrible music started and I hit the fast forward fast Until I got past it and I heard you talking about what it was and I almost rewound but no I didn't so You should listen to it. It's actually it's actually impressive It's the it's been linked to birth defects in my 17 states All right, can we talk about your book because I'm interested in this you basically are Tell us the name of it and tell us which my take is you're sort of debunking some of the crazy pseudoscience that we've been Depending on in this country to make ourselves feel better about ourselves for the past 30 years But you're not totally like shitting on it. It's not like a there's no potential merit to it But you're like major asterisks on all of these self-esteem research and all the stuff that's gone down That's that's my take you'll do a better job of naming the book and explaining it Yeah, so the book is called the quick fix why fad psychology can't cure our social ills It stems from Before katie herzog dragged me down into culture war hell with her I I worked at New York magazine. I edited a vertical about behavioral science And I sort of carved out a niche as someone who would be skeptical of the Press releases you would get from harvard or the university of pennsylvania touting some incredible new finding about human behavior So I decided to write a book that will basically help people You know cut through the overhyped claims we often get from psychologists on issues like You know the implicit association test which can supposedly reveal your hidden racism, but but has very little evidence behind it I do talk about the decades-long self-esteem craze which Claim that like all sorts of societal problems including crime could be solved by improving people self-esteem There's also a military program that costs about 500 million dollars that it supposedly reduces PTSD and suicidality among soldiers, but no evidence to support that and just sort of a giant waste of money So there's like I don't know if you look around the world There's a lot to be skeptical of it and my goal with the book is to just help the average reader who might not have much of a background in social science Have the right questions to ask when their work or their school adopts one of these ideas So basically you've taken away hope from millions of people. Yeah, that's what we do. We're the we're the hope Steelers Just those things you thought might get you out of this crazy ass life and make you succeed from whatever miserable life you're in wrong not if it's gonna work Unless the system radically changed you're completely screwed However, if you listen to blocked and reported you can't your your teeth will be wider your skin will be clear your finances will improve Exactly. Well, so one of the things my editor nudged me on really helpful is like a lot of these ideas do have some merit behind them. There's a kernel of truth there and We have you know for individuals things like cognitive behavioral therapy seem to have some evidence behind them What doesn't work is the idea that you can give everyone an implicit association test and address You know a problem of racial discrepancies that that dates back hundreds of years or that you can improve self-esteem and suddenly They'll be better students a lot of these ideas when you actually save them out loud like it's sort of surprising anyone believed in them in the first place But what about grit that was the one I was like so I think of grit. I don't think of grit is like Doubling down determination like i'm just gonna try try try to get an A on this test. Although I I understand that's a definition I see it more as like Stan tall take life's punches forge forward stop looking your wounds and feeling sorry for yourself, but How are you defining grit because that's one of your targets saying yeah This one's too a little shaky Yeah, don't don't try don't put effort in anything adopt the Jesse single technique Um grit was this new scale developed by a social psychologist named Angela Duckworth She wanted a cart of genius grant for her work on that and other stuff she basically claimed that like Perseverance and passion matters way more than we think as compared to sort of innate ability IQ SAT scores physical ability and this really caught on especially in educational circles No one really bothered to do the like careful research required to test if this is actually true Until recently at least and it it just turned out to be very overhyped obviously if the choice is like Train your kid to be hardworking versus not hardworking team hardworking helps But the question of how much it helps or how much that matters relative to their innate ability The answer there is maybe like not what we want it to be the fact is that intelligence In a lot of settings might matter 30 to 40 Might be 30 or 40 times more important quantitatively then Powering if you don't see you don't have if you don't have a high IQ You're screwed. Well, no I think there's so many other things that can factor into your success in life and especially if you can find the right niche and find what you're good at IQ itself Only explains like 40 to 50 of success. There's still a lot of room there for other stuff But the question of whether you can just like train yourself to be grittier and that on its own will make you much more successful That's what i'm skeptical then I realize like not everyone wants to hear that But again, if you're if you're a science journalist you sometimes have to deliver bad news What about um the power posing can you explain that? Power posing is this idea that if you stand like super woman Superwoman wonder woman with your hands on your hips or in some other legs apart legs apart some sort of expressive expansive pose for a minute or two A psychologist named amy cuddy and her colleagues produce research suggesting this will help make you more Assertive it'll help make you better negotiation settings And it sort of looped in with the sheryl sannberg lean in movement as like a way to help women Improve in the workplace There's basically no evidence to suggest this is true not to be a bummer again And that one makes perfect sense to me what that First of all if you're standing like a wonder woman and leaning in it's not going to end well for you. You're definitely It's very dangerous It doesn't make any sense that the way you stand at work is going to and i understand they don't like crossing arms It projects like you know, you're closed off, but you know what's really so comfortable to stand with your arms crossed it just is Yeah, yeah, there's nothing wrong with it. Um, what about squatting jessie? Do you have any information on that? That's how i usually like to do my meetings. Yeah, everyone should just be squatting all the time No chairs squatting and grunting It's a caveman side You laugh, but i was subjected to one of these very classes when i was in one and seventh grade and one and tenth grade jessie And um, it was called my oh short for myself and others And we were taught about self-esteem And we were taught how to be an active listener and one of the things on the list I remember this was friendly grunts and you say that to a group of 11 and 12 year olds And then make them practice in the whole room was like Oh, you don't say This is not appropriate interaction This is why it helps to grow up in sort of like a secular jewish household because you get home from school from all that uplifting Like here's how to be a good person. You get a lot of sarcasm and cynicism to balance it out I feel bad for all you gentiles No, are you kidding me if you're catholic? I mean, i feel like i'm about the catholic's even worse. Yeah, please I feel like that's the Jews in the catholic are like right next to each other on the other other than the jesus being christ thing We are the same and the afterlife the mommy issues in particular like they're very similar and the guilt And the right the and the inability to be happy all those things All that stuff Um, so what kind of reception have you had because that's like do people close this book feeling Because I always say like it's better to know the truth, right? It's like if you thought you had this great friend and then you find Um some letter they wrote about you some email they wrote about you that's like I actually can't stand or she's horrible It's better to know the truth, you know, the truth is whatever it is It was the same yesterday as it is today. It's just your knowledge may advance And so I feel like this book is in that vein, right? Like Sorry, but that stuff is actually not scientific and you know, it's if you want to use it to convince yourself Otherwise go for it, but the truth is it hasn't been proven out Like what are people gonna feel when they when they close this book? Again because of the influence of my editor. I think there's like a fair bit of optimism in there amongst all the debunking Which is what I want. I want people to feel like Science is this powerful thing that can help us. We just need to understand it and understand its limitations so You know, the reception has been good and and I think people don't like the idea that they've been hoodwinked and The military one really gets to me because when you think about half a billion dollars What the good that could have done For a population that comes back from war totally traumatized if that went to a program that can In my view be fairly called pseudoscience. I think anyone should be outraged by that Mm-hmm Now before I let you go can I ask you guys because some of your tweeting and some of your banter about enjoying the pandemic has been absolute gold You're you're not necessarily anti-lockdown Explain what you've most loved about the past year I haven't put on hard pants in a year. That's been really nice I sort of live a pandemic lifestyle. Anyway, I don't particularly like the mask, but not interacting with people It's totally fine with me. I have a live a podcaster life podcaster lifestyle and pandemic lifestyle are very similar Mm. It is nice being on your own. I mean, I'm I'm in my children's playroom every day and it's awesome Nobody bothered me except for Abby and you know, I had her before so it's fine. Yeah I mean, it's we this is part of the reason I'm a lefty. It's like If you have some resources at your disposal We've just been able to shield ourselves from all the worst parts of it. I mean I can work from anywhere. I I just I don't know not to end on a downer note but so many people have been hit so hard from this and I feel so guilty that it's been relatively easy for me to ride out and um, I think maybe we can talk about this some other time, but I think that's one of the fundamental provides that that would make it hard for me to ever be Conservative like not not that conservatives are arguing differently I just I sort of feel strongly that we don't have the protections in place We should given how wealthy a country we are and I feel guilty that this has been relatively easy for me to to um Ride out so there's just a last little bit of basically virtue signaling as I Thank you She was just get just keep trying to get those liberals back on your side. Jesse you work it. Exactly. Yeah, I'm sure that'll do it Well, listen, good luck with the book. Thank you both so much for being here and uh, I hope we talk again Thank you Megan. Thanks for having us. It's been really great I So don't use our show on monday because we've got former wisconsin governor scott walker This guy was a star in republican politics. Now. He's heading up a young america's foundation Which is a conservative leaning group that sort of tries to get the good word out to young people about The joys of being a conservative and sort of argues with folks on principle about why they think they have the better ideas And tries to get Um, too young people to make sure they know this is an option for them, right? Like you don't have to join the progressive side in order to be a good person There are lots of good ideals on the other side as well and he's got a plan right now his group has forgetting Organized on college campuses to fight back against some of the some of the woke stuff that we're seeing and some of the messaging And it's actually beyond college campuses k through 12 They unearthed a shocking story out of aims, Iowa Just a week or so again a go which we'll talk to him about and there's a fun moment in this interview Which we just taped you know, he helped prepare mic pence for the vice presidential debate And he's got some thoughts on kamala harris and how she did and whether she's going to be the nominee For the democratic party in 2024. Oh, and by the way, is he gonna run because he can throw his hat in that ring We get into all of it. Uh, it was a delightful exchange And I give him credit for coming out because I think I've said before that he was boring But he he wasn't at all He was actually really interesting and interesting and we had fun and I liked the guy and I think you will too So that's next time Thanks for listening to the Megan kelly show no bs no agenda and no fear The Megan kelly show is a devil may care media production in collaboration with red sea ventures You"
