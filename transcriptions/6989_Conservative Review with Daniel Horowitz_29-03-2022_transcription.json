    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash the blind. Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true. The conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minutemen on this fine Tuesday, March 29th to the one and only CR podcast. This is your host Daniel Hurwitz back in the house for another day of independent conservative talk because we are independent given that we have two political parties that are more of the same. It's just that one party is more for the current thing than the other. And in this case, the Republicans are more for the current thing. They are more emphatic about supporting the corrupt regime in Ukraine getting more people there killed sucking us in destroying the buying power of consumers for sanctions that are just meaningless. We always knew this would head towards diplomacy. It's just a matter of how quickly and Republicans dragged it out. While meanwhile, we have people under duress, the discrimination. I have a crazy story of people being denied kidney transplants, kids being taken away for not getting shots. There are so many important issues we have to deal with crossing a million border incursions less than a half a year into the fiscal year. I mean, I can go on and on, but on all the major issues of our time, elected Republicans, if you think about it, are actually to the left of your average Democrat voter, say average who's not involved in politics. We saw this in the Florida poll with the anti-grooming bill, barring teaching of sexuality to young children in Florida public schools. That bill was supported by Democrat Floridians 52 to 36 percent. Yet we can't get such a bill passed in most Republican dominated legislatures. So I want to talk about that today. How again, across the board, it's already the end of March. Most legislatures are going to wrap it up soon for a whole another year. In most states, you can't even introduce new bills. We've barely accomplished anything. Now we will have on a legislator from Kansas who is making some progress on some medical freedom. And it demonstrates that the difference between success and failure is literally a hairline. If you get enough focus, it's all about focus on the right issue at the right time, you could catch lightning in the bottle and we could do a lot. But if we're just going to be a bunch of obsequious Republicans and be captive to the Fox News narrative and news storyline of the day, that has nothing to do with the most important issues that we could influence and we could affect, then things are just going to get worse and worse no matter who wins. It's focusing on the right legislation, the right issues, the right primaries. And I want to start in the general election too, running candidates as an independence. This is where it's at. If we don't focus on that, what do we get? What we get when we have an Idaho, which I want to talk about in a moment. Today we're sponsored by Birch Gold with inflation at 40 year highs. And it is here to stay because of what the government's doing, the monetary manipulation, the spending like crazy. You have to protect your savings now and hedge against inflation with gold from Birch Gold. Because our government is sabotaging the value of the US dollar. Birch Gold is the only company I trust and I recommend for precious metals. They will help convert an eligible IRA or 401k into an IRA backed by real gold. I actually just did this because I owed some extra money. So I always put it into an IRA, but typically I put it in the stock market. Why do that at this point? With thousands of satisfied customers and eight plus rating from the Better Business Bureau, you can trust Birch Gold to help you protect your savings to do so. Text Daniel to the number 989898 now to get a no cost, no obligation info kit. It's a comprehensive guide that reveals how gold and silver can protect your savings and how you can buy them under an umbrella of a tax sheltered account, especially now as you complete your taxes for last year. So text the word Daniel right now to 989898 never play again in the casino of the stock market. So if you remember last year, there was this story of a man, actually several people from Christ Church, September 23rd, 2020. They were arrested for gathering as a church choir outdoors because they didn't social distance and wear a mask outdoors. We forget that this was going on. And again, it wasn't like those frantic 15 days in March, April. This was September 23rd. This was months after we knew the fallacy of even if you agree with all this to outdoor transmission and masking and everything, this sounds very Australia, right? No, this occurred in the city of Moscow, Idaho. Now, I know some people are going to say, well, Moscow is a college town. So it's run by Democrats. But again, the governor is Brad chicken little of Idaho. That's what a living nightmare Idaho was. Yet the state has failed to pass a single significant piece of legislation reversing the current tyranny, much less immunizing the gem state from this happening in the future. They have four to one majorities in a legislature. They have a Republican governor, but he is literally a Democrat. The one bill they've managed to pass, you know, the Senate leadership blocked almost every good bill, nothing on treatment, nothing protecting people who are prevented from getting kidney transplants. To this day, the Idaho Department of Health is promoting masks and shots, just like HHS, just like a blue state. But they passed Senate bill 1381. It would have barred businesses from mandating employees get the cloth shots. And it only would have done it for a year. And I think that's a very good bill. It's watered down and it doesn't even apply to, you know, obviously anyone who's under the CMS mandate, the federal mandates, it explicitly exempts us or doesn't challenge the feds. But if you're a private business that's not under the feds, we're not going to let you do it in the state only for 12 months. Okay. Just, just for a year past the house 4523, the Senate 2411. So it only passed about two to one, not four to one because there were a lot of rhinos that joined with the Democrats. And yesterday, governor chicken little vetoed the bill and he waxed poetic about, oh, I'm vetoing this legislation because I'm a lifelong advocate of limited government. I don't like telling businesses what to do. So this is a man who literally had a ban on assembly, you know, of right to assembly in the constitution, he banned assembly for, I believe, 10 months, it lasted, it lasted in Idaho longer than it lasted in, um, in, uh, my home state of Maryland. This man shut down businesses had business capacity, church capacity. They were arresting, you know, again, a church, church service outdoors, outdoors. And they'll say, well, I didn't do that. Yeah, but you had cities doing that and you didn't stop it. So you are for you want to talk about limited government. This was literally the Soviet Union. And this guy has the nerve to wax poetic about limited government. But again, it's not just hypocrisy. As we've noted throughout this pandemic, none of this, the private sector would never have germinated this germ of tyranny without the government grooming them. Brad chicken, little and his health department groomed the state and the businesses like a child molester does throughout 2020 that this is what you need to do. You need to do the social distancing and the lockdown and the capacity and the masking and then the shots. So he's like, well, I never mandated it. Yeah. But you did have mandates on get togethers and gatherings and all that stuff that grease the skids for businesses to think this is where the liability is. This is what you do to be in, in the right with the state. So in order to equalize that you need equal and opposing force and then you have the feds down right mandating on some people. So the slate is not even. It's not a free market. We've been saying this all along. It's similar to saying you oppose the Civil Rights Act. Okay. And the reason why people supported it, despite the fact that typically you can't tell business what to do is because the government spent decades boxing blacks out of their ability to have property rights and engage in commerce. So in order to even up the score, you need to use that power to meet the power that government wrongly used to begin with. And I think a very nice touch on this bill is it doesn't do it indefinitely. So it's not to start a president definitely, you know, but it does it for 12 months to get it out of the system because it's only in the system because Brad chicken little and his health department support fauciism in the state of Idaho and he thinks Idaho's California. I've been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operation employees with limited interference. Really? Wow. That really comes as news to all those people that were regulated. And then when Janice McGean, the lieutenant governor is running for his position, challenging him in the primary for a second term, when she got into power for a day because, you know, according to state law, if the governor leaves for a day, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor and she barred mass mandates on children. He reversed it. So he got up there in the same veto statement. He said, Oh, you know, I've been very limited. I've never had mass mandates. What are you talking about? You allowed every city. This is the game they play. They allow every city to do it. You're governor. You're in control. Don't give me this. Oh, the city's control it more over their health department, which is a part of their administration are downright pushing it and pushing the pseudo science to this very day. His health officials are just as illogical, immoral, illegal and inhumane and unscientific as Fauci and HHS are. And he says he's for a limited government until very recently kids all over Idaho were in mass. He is for a limited government. And yet he limits your right to breathe and free restriction of movement. But this is what we have in Idaho now. So this is a big deal. SB 1381. SB 1381. There's enough Senate. They need 24 votes in the Senate to override the veto. They had 24 the first round. So hopefully it won't peel more off in the house. We're at 45. We need 47 to override. Um, what there, there's two people who are absent. My understanding is one is a co-sponsor of the bill. And for whatever reason, it wasn't there. So he should be able to vote to override. That's 46. And then there's 12 remaining Republicans who voted no. So one of those 12 need to be picked off. If you're in Idaho, call them now. It's SB 1381. But this is what we have. It's truly unbelievable. Now, by the way, one of the things that we couldn't get past was early treatment, preventing doctors. We're going to have later on a Kansas Senator who passed a bill like this. We couldn't get a bill passed. You know, making sure pharmacies don't discriminate and practice medicine and that doctors are able to practice medicine. So you got to take your own health in your own hands. That's why I support Z stack from Dr. Vladimir Zelenko. It's a formulation of an immune boosting supplement that includes zinc, cercetin vitamin C, vitamin D. And it comes from the doctor who had one of the original protocols on COVID. Z stack has been scientifically formulated. It's GMP certified. It's produced right here in the USA. Now more than ever, you have to take control of your health and your family's health. So go to zstack life.com slash Daniel and enter promo code Daniel to get a discount on your first order. Um, you know, another important thing to point out here is that in 2021, little veto to bill that limited his emergency declarations to a generous 60 days. Okay, very modest bill said you only have 60 days and you could renew it with the legislature. And then also the governor can't change any laws during that declared emergency. He vetoed that bill and he's looking up into eye and saying he's for limited government when he thinks he could be a king. Are you kidding me? He also vetoed HP 135 that session, which among other things would have prohibited the governor from quarantining the healthy, shutting down businesses and churches and banning assembly. Okay, I'm for limited government, but I support banning assembly, banning businesses, banning churches, quarantining the healthy, but I'm pro business. What in the world? This guy's retarded. And then also let's not forget this slate is not clean on anti-discrimination law. You can't discriminate against someone because they have AIDS. So certainly you shouldn't be able to discriminate against someone who doesn't have a disease, especially and just for not getting Pfizer's poison when it's proven not just to be poison, but now according to the UK data on some age groups as negative 368% efficacy against infection transmission. And again, the slate is not clean. Is is Brad little going to stand up against OSHA and ADA and all these labor laws? Suddenly his laissez-faire when it comes to the most immoral, illogical, inhumane thing an employer could do in violation of the Nuremberg Code, suddenly then you know, you know, let's say the left starts a fad that everyone everyone going in front of for an interview has to have sex with the employer or something as it's part of the interview. Let's say the Department of Health groomed society to do that. And then we would want to build to block that. We say, well, I'm for limited government. I don't like telling businesses what to do. ADA 36.201, no individual shall be discriminated against on the base of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services without retaliation of coercion, covering any condition, whether physical or mental impairment, where in mere presence does not constitute direct threat, even if contagious or non-contagious with transmission, transmissible diseases. That's directly in there. That's if you have a transmissible disease, you cannot be discriminated against. That's ADA. Do these laws suddenly not apply? Truly disgusting. But this is why we can't have nice things. Republican governors and Republican officials are to the left of Democrats, Democrat voters on on given issues. That's the reality. It's disgusting. You know, I wanted to go into this a little bit just when we talk about, oh, it's the, you know, I don't like telling the private sector what to do. But what do you do if there's one big public private governor, government partnership promoting this stuff? It was a article on Politico. As President Joe Biden granted his science office unprecedented access and power, one outside advisor to that office has attained what staffers describe as an unusual level of influence. A foundation controlled by Eric Schmidt, right? He's the former CEO of Google, has played an extraordinary, albeit private role in shaping the White House office of science and technology policy over the past year. More than a dozen officials in the 140 person White House office have been associates of Schmitt's, including some current and former Schmidt employees. So we have one big incestuous cesspool. Science is owned by corporations and they work together with government to set these policies. I'm just giving you one example of the fact that this is not natural, that a bunch of, you know, mom and pop businesses or mid-sized businesses are like, yeah, you know, this might be a good idea to make sure everyone has these shots. No, it comes from the same source and it's not going to end with COVID. It's going to be with the social credit. Are we now going to say, oh, working with government, they're boxing out truckers or anyone who donates to a cause they don't like, they're discriminated against. You're boxed out of banking, you're boxed out of food, you're boxed out of kidney transplants. Oh, a private business can do what they want. So you could shut down a business, you could destroy a business, you could regulate the free movement, you could regulate the human breathing. That's not a violation of principles of limited government. But somehow you could work together with government to groom the society to where businesses will then violate individual rights and human rights. And that's totally okay. We can't have Republicans like this running red states. It's truly disgusting. And speaking of disgusting, you know, I got this text from someone in Michigan. And truly, truly heartbreaking. I have a church family that needs our help, their daughter, whom they actually adopted from Ukraine, desperately, desperately needs a kidney. They've exhausted all options after traveling around the country, trying to get a doctor to allow her a kidney without getting the COVID shot and everyone in the family. So everyone in the family has to get it. Okay, regardless of their danger, regardless of the efficacy, regardless of the side effects, regardless of their immune status, everyone has to get it. And they can't find a doctor to do this. Okay, this is a 50 state problem and has not been solved. I mean, the new Hampshire house passed the bill on this. In Tennessee, they did a couple of states here and there, but most of them have not dealt with this. Idaho certainly has not dealt with it. One of the hospitals tipped them off, tipped off child protective services and they will medically kidnap her and force injector so she can get a kidney transplant. I might have the family on later this week, but this is what's at stake. And what are Republicans? What are they concerned about? So yesterday, yesterday, Joe Biden released his FY 2023 budget blueprint, which means nothing. I mean, it's just, it's a meaningless document. And you know, you can imagine it's full of communists, full of communist. What was Mitch McConnell's concern about it? This is from Newsmax McConnell rejects Biden budget as inadequate on defense. It didn't spend enough money on the woke military. Talk about this last week. We have a woke and broke military, green energy, social engineering, gender bending, anti-Christian agenda, and now kicking out the best soldiers for an immoral, inhumane Joseph Mengele, Pfizer mandate. And they want to just throw more money at it. They're not spending enough money. That's all they care about, probably for their defense contractors. On this vein, there's another article I want to share with you from Politico. Rand's latest stand undercuts GOP's Ukraine message. We're talking about Rand Paul. Republicans are basically ticked off at Rand for not joining their idolatry. They're, um, you know, some, some Republicans and so-called conservatives have called us Putin puppets. Well, they're Hunter Biden's B.I.T. CH's, if you get what I mean. I mean, the connection between metadata, eco-health alliance, DoD, gain a function research and corruption in Ukraine and Hunter Biden, it's grown based on the emails on his laptop that have been discovered by National Pulse and daily UK Daily Mail. I might talk about that tomorrow. But basically, here's what they say. The idiosyncratic GOP senator is undermining his own party's message by single-handedly delaying a revocation of normal trade relations with Russia, thereby slowing efforts to further incapacitate Russia's economy. It's not incapacitating them. It's incapacitating our economy, but whatever. Paul is refusing to allow a quick vote on the bill absent a deal to narrow presidential power to enact sanctions and ask that leaders in both parties have spurned. And he's done this many times. Paul is not budging, underground bipartisan pressure. Somebody ought to read the bills, don't you think Paul said in a brief interview? Most of this is symbolic. And they talk about, you know, Paul and everything, what he's done. And then they quote other Republicans trash against Senate minority whip, John Thune, throwing up his hands when asked if there was anything GOP leaders could do to move him. Senator Joni Ernst, the jerk from Iowa, who recently traveled to Poland said Paul has the right to do it, but it's not helpful to the party's message. Senator Wickerbasket from Mississippi, it's what we've come to expect from him. You know, it's truly disgusting. It's just truly disgusting. They quote, Crapo, Idaho jerk. They're all, they're all a bunch of leftists. They literally don't care about us. You know, I always said, here's the irony. You put one of these Republicans in front of a traditional Democrat voter, but somewhat getable. They won't even look at the guy because they don't want to vote Republican. So we get the liabilities of these people, but not the benefit. Whereas if you had a fresh face that ran on actually what is causing the inflation on the crime, on the border, on medical freedom, no labels, these people are eminently getable. You pull these issues. Most people agree with us. Republicans don't care about any of this. This whole thing is truly disgusting. And again, you look at the Democrats when they have control of a state, man, the contrast to Idaho is unbelievable. A lot of the medical freedom doctors are putting out a warning of 10 bills that they are pushing in California. And again, what they're pushing is just the tip of the spear because the reality is, as you well know, most of these things are never enacted in legislation. They use that as a messaging tool of what they're going to do executively by administrative thea. AB 1993 requires proof of COVID vaccination for all employees and independent contractors working in California. AB 1797 creates an immunization tracking system, giving all government agencies complete access to vaccination records of all citizens. SB 1184 authorizes school health personnel to disclose children's health information to a third party without parental consent. SB 1390 prohibits any person from making statements the government deems misleading or any ads. SB 1479 requires schools to create long-term testing plans, test children without parental consent. SB 1464 requires law enforcement and force all public health guidelines or lose their funding. SB 920 authorizes medical boards to inspect the doctor's office and medical records without patient's consent. SB 866 lowers the age of COVID vaccine consent to 12 without parental notification. AB 2098 classifies any medical opinion that runs contrary to the establishment's COVID narrative as misinformation subjects physicians expressing such views to charge of unprofessional conduct. Folks, we should have bills in place in these other states to criminalize this and make sure it doesn't happen. But this is happening on some level in areas in all states. But that's the thing. These are all winning issues. They actually really speak to classical liberal sentiments. This is the thing Republicans think, Oh my gosh, it's a losing issue to allow people to have life-saving treatment or not to discriminate like they think anti grooming bills are losing issues. Again, that Florida bill, they won't touch anywhere with a 10 foot pole. All these states and Utah, the governor vetoed the female sports bill, although the legislature did override his veto. So it did become law. And again, these are very modest bills. You know, my view on that, that the whole thing has become about fairness in sports, not about fighting life, since just de civilization gender bending. They just pick it, you know, they just make it out fairness in female sports. Like the female sports issue, it's not a female sports issue. That's one of the many ramifications of the gender bending de civilization, licentious Canaanite agenda. But it's cultural Marxism that needs to be fought at a cultural values level. It's not kind of a technicality of fairness in sports. But that's the only way these stupid Republicans even feel comfortable broaching the issue. And then you have red state governors that don't even feel comfortable with that. Again, you, you, you, you pull the average person. I don't mean your Democrat voter that literally watches MSNBC every second. And yeah, I mean, that's the 25%, 30% you're never going to get. But I'd say from like 30 to 50, the 50 yard line is the, you know, middle of American politics, kind of that zone, very gettable, very gettable on our issues. But our issues are unfortunately not the GOP leadership's issues. But I do want to share some good news, bring on our guest coming up. So we've been talking a lot today about the Republican Party and how really in a state level, federal level, not only are they not focused on our issues, they're not focused on the terrible medical tyranny we have in this country that still has not gone away. If anything, it's intensified in many ways. They actually focus on the other side's issues. And they feel that Biden's not being enough focused on Ukraine. And they want to do more, they want to spend more money on that. And it's hard to find good victories. But you know, we do need to spotlight some of the areas where we are making some progress and where brave legislators or governors stand up to the establishment and accomplish things. You might have seen last week in the state of Kansas. One state Senator sponsored a bill, not only making it clear that medical boards cannot punish doctors for prescribing off label, but that pharmacists must fill such a prescription. And this is a bill I've been pushing in many states. And honestly, it's very, very difficult to get it passed. But we do have one state where we now have it passed in Kansas. So with no further ado, I want to bring on the sponsor, Dr. Mark Steffen, who is a state senator from the Hutchinson area in Kansas. He's a licensed anesthesiologist. And he successfully got this bill, HB 2280, passed both houses. We're waiting for the governor's decision there. Dr. Steffen, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, it's my honor. I appreciate your having me. Well, it's not every day where we succeed in a battle on medical freedom. I want to start from the beginning before the legislation. This is very personal to you, obviously, because you're one of the legislators who is a doctor and you were helping people through the virus. Could you describe a little bit what your experience was, what type of patients were coming to you, what you did about it, and then the adversity you were met with by the state medical board? Well, between last session and this session, we had a real peak in and in Corona cases. And it just became more and more obvious that mainstream medicine was abdicating their responsibilities and just saying, go home till you're closer to death and then go to the hospitals. Yeah. And that's just not a tenable approach to this. And so, I've been battling this from day one, clear back into 2020. But when people call me and what help, it's my responsibility as a human being and as a physician to respond. And so, I was routinely prescribing Ivermectin and was doing so quite successfully. But then pretty soon in the Reno County area, eBix were coming down through the big chain pharmacies in particular. Saying that their pharmacists could not prescribe Ivermectin in particular. And so, I would call in, I'd have a sick patient, I'd call in a valid prescription, and then I'd get a call back saying they wouldn't fill it. And man, that was then it became a full out war. You know, I take pride and I never yelled at any of these pharmacists. I've never custed any of these pharmacists, but I made them all cry because this is about patients lives. This is about preventing suffering and death. And to be a weak need physician or a weak need pharmacist who doesn't have the fortitude to help people is beyond my belief. And it just got tighter and tighter and tighter through the summer and into the fall getting Ivermectin into people's hands. It was, it was, it just amazed me that doctors and pharmacists would allow people to suffer and die. And they did. I had multiple reports of that happening. One, it happened to one of my patients. So it's a, it was, it's a brutal deal. And I continue to struggle to understand the reasoning behind it. Could you describe that case, that progression, we all know that is the cytokine storm kicks in, you know, days five to seven, especially with whatever that delta wave was last year. You know, that's really when it goes into high gear, you have the micro cladding, the pulmonary inflammation, and time is really of the essence. Could you describe some of the runarounds you had to make with patients where, you know, typically you just call it in boom, you get it into them. And you know, hopefully within 12 hours or so you see an improvement. How were the pharmacists literally killing people by blocking these prescriptions? Well, you're 100% right. Time is absolutely of the essence. And I'll deviate for just a second. One of the things we have clearly established in the state of Kansas, that the standard of care is early treatment. It's not saying go back home. And, and one of the other issues we ran into, or I ran into with patients is they go to the doctor and they would be prescribed monoclonal antibodies. Well, that invariably be on a Friday and they'd schedule them to get the monoclonal antibodies on a Monday. And, and I saw that over and over and over and it was just this complete lack of understanding. But yes, I simplify it. I call it early middle and late. You know, and it's like a fire. It's just like a fire. You know, if you've just got a fire that's barely getting started and you throw a bucket of water on it, you're going to put it out. And that's what early treatment is all about. And yeah, you know, you call in, you know, a lot of times people, people invariably deny the fact that they have this virus for a few days. And then, so you're already kind of late to the party by the time they call you and you get to see them and talk to them and educate them. So, you know, you're already a little late in the game when you call the prescription in. And so when the pharmacist denies it, you know, then you're scrambling trying to find a pharmacy now that will fill it. And that became harder and harder. That added to the delays and more delays. And some patients even gave up on trying to find it. And those people, you know, I've, I've walked in through the halls of the Capitol here in Topeka. I've had multiple representatives tell me about friends and family who never did get it and progress the hospitalization and such. So you're incredibly right. This is all about timing. And again, what we imprinted have imprinted on this state is that early treatment is the standard of care. No early treatment is malpractice. It's malpractice exactly. And I just want to describe before we get to the medical board and the legislation. You're an anesthesiologist. You've practiced for many years. So obviously, relative to other specialists, you really would obviously use very hardcore heavy duty drugs. Could you describe throughout your career? Have you ever had issues prescribing drugs and compare some of those relative to hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin? Yeah, no. I absolutely have not ever had problems. And I would challenge anybody to find a doctor who has ever had problems before COVID. In fact, we had a 40 plus year pharmacist come testify on behalf of our 2280 bill and said that she had never seen an off-label prescription denied in her 40 plus years until Ivermectin and the virus response came along. So this is just one of the handful of absolute embarrassies that developed in the middle of this virus response. So I can't think of a greater emergency. We destroyed the entire world for this virus. We pulled our hair out. We had no treatment to this day. Nothing works. The vaccines clearly, I mean, I've personally gotten treatment for so many that got three shots, didn't work for them. They needed treatment. So it's not like we have alternatives. I'm not exactly seeing paxlovid and malnapearovir. Do anything. I'm not hearing any stories about that. So that's kind of interesting. It's not like we really have to this day. Good treatment. You would think this would be an emergency in every Republican control legislature. But frankly, most we can't get anything. Some we have weak bills. So describe HP 2280 and how you got it across. But also, if you could first go into your personal situation, so you were met with resistance by the pharmacist, when did the medical board start going after you? Well, medical boards started coming out after me way back at the very start of this guy. I understood how we were getting off on the wrong foot. And it only escalated from there. And there was a crash follower and a person who pursues the truth. I just met it right in the face and started battling this from start. And when I came out against masks, when I came out in favor of hydroxychloroquine, when I came out in favor of trying anything basic and simple to prepare oneself to survive this virus, I met resistance. And I was turned into the board by a journalist, the board of healing arts by a journalist, who then wrote an article bragging about turning me in. And the way our board works, they were happy to immediately start an investigation. And I've had multiple complaints now of which I stand by everything I've ever said and never done. And just very recently, I was turned in for prescribing actually, as turned in by another doctor, who heard me say I had prescribed ivermectin. Well, I proudly tell people that I've prescribed ivermectin and still will. It's still my drug and choice, both prophylactically and for early treatment. When you when you run it side by side by the Pfizer antiviral, I still think ivermectin's person's best choice. So, you know, they've been digging at me from the very start. Your biggest issue in all this is the lobbyists. You know, there are Kansas Hospital Association, or Kansas Medical Society, they're all on board perpetuating and creating this propaganda. And, you know, they're deep pockets. They control a lot of campaign donations. And a lot of politicians are puppets that are the strings are pulled by those who control the campaign donations. And I guarantee you, that's what kind of shut things down in other states. I'll guarantee you. So, in your state, you know, you you battled them. You got this HB 2280 passed. It passed 2116 in the Senate. Obviously, you have 29 Republicans who did lose a number of them. But there's enough of a margin. You're still able to get it passed to pass the house. How did the hearings go? Obviously, you're a doctor. So, it helped that you're the sponsor, the bill in other states. We have doctors opposing it and non doctors supporting it. So, you know, they could play that card. But can you describe for the audience why? Your bill is an outpatient bill. You know, we've pushed other bills to try to get right to try in the hospitals. And I think that's important too. But this was outpatient. Why would the hospitals oppose that? Wouldn't they want to alleviate the pressure on the hospitals? Well, that's certainly the trillion dollar question. And I don't completely understand that. This transcends all sense. You know, I say it's the perfect storm of fear, greed, politics, and stupidity. And I stand by that statement. But, you know, our hearing on HB 2280 in the Senate is particularly noteworthy. We had 400 proponent testimonies, which is an absolute Guinness Book of World Records for any bill heard, at least in the Kansas Senate, all about anywhere. We literally had 400 people who've sent in written testimonies. We had all the oral testimonies. We wanted people who are passionate. We have a incredible, we have multiple grassroots organizations in Kansas that have answered the call and are desperate for preservation of individual rights and for preservation of medical rights. And so, you know, this thing was overwhelming when it was heard in the Senate. We had lots of doctors there. We had them there in white coats. We had them there in scrubs and there was cheering and yelling and screaming. And there was a lot of emotion and passion in that room. And we have a very good conservative Senate Public Health Committee. And this, they came out of our Public Health Committee very, very easily. And it was thanks to the grassroots, the groundswell of support. But what tamps down the grassroots is the special interest groups. And, you know, it's right now you get inside the Capitol and I still think the lobbyist groups win that. Wow. So that's pretty amazing. I'm picturing the ultimate battle of David and Goliath. You have, you know, basic just citizens that not just support something because in the abstract, they feel it aligns with their values, but because they're lives. And the lives of their loved ones were saved by this. They give testimony to it. So then what's the other side? The hospital medical cartel comes in and says, no, it's not like anyone's forcing them to get Ivermectin like they are with the shots. And like they do with Remdesivir in the hospital. It's purely optional. You don't like it. Don't take it. What was their argument? Well, and they ran it through the Kansas Medical Society and the head and person of that organization stood up and said, oh, you know, it's not needed. This isn't needed. And we wouldn't dare handcuff the Board of Healing Arts like this. You know, we don't ever want to get in their way of policing good quality care. And the pharmacist came on late. And amazingly to me tried to make the case that this was about them. This was about their right to refuse to fill prescriptions. And it was like, are you kidding me? You really expect me to care more about your ego than preventing suffering and death. And that finally calmed down as we did make some tweaks in the bill to make sure that the pharmacist still have a responsibility to verify validate, authenticate the prescription, but they cannot refuse to fill it solely based on known or assumed diagnosis of COVID. And they finally came down which, which, you know, I was, I was glad because they were just making themselves look like the most egotistical entity on the face the earth. I found them embarrassing. It really is, it's disgusting. I mean, it's just, it's just totally indefensible. Because again, they're the ones forcing their choices on other people. Nobody is forcing them to take this. And it's not like they have other options. So could you give us a broad look of what other things you've been pushing, some of the things that you feel you've successfully gotten through with the mandates, things that you haven't successfully gotten through? I want people to get a sense of a super majority Republican state. It is a little quirky because you do have a Democrat governor, but that kind of cuts both ways. So where do things stand on some of the medical freedom legislation? Well, and that is a great question. And just quickly, it kind of goes back to philosophy, you know, is your philosophy that you want the government to control you or do you want to control the government? And really, when we came in at the start of last year's session, well, I brought in a very, very foreign philosophy and that was with an infection like this, that the government's responsibility was to educate and recommend only, not mandate, and not quarantine, not imprison people. And so, you know, I've spent two years now kind of educating people as to the to that new philosophy. And we actually moved that through a Senate bill for 89 in that we we removed the powers of mandating, particularly quarantines from away from the Secretary of Health and Environment away from the local health officers. And we gave them the task of educating people and making recommendations to people because they're number one, they're unelected officials. Number two, that's government's role. You know, you're not in a democracy, you don't have people making those kind of mandates. And so, we did get that bill passed out of the Senate. We'll see how it how it does in the House. It's actually going to be heard on the House floor today. We know we have another bill that kind of came out of judiciary that says no governmental entity can mandate masks, period. And and I got them on the floor to define governmental entity in this broadest sense, meaning governor, county commissioners, school board members, superintendents, anybody. So, you know, we're on the on the cusp, on the cusp of doing away with mass mandates in the state of Kansas. So, you know, we've got some great conservative minds here. We've got a whole bunch of rhinos and we've got too many liberals. So, so I was going to ask you this an interesting proposition. I want to know if I'm exaggerating this. So, I've noticed a lot of states in the Great Prairie, the, you know, the Prairie area, Great Rocky Mountain area, Idaho, Wyoming, we talked a lot about Idaho, where you have, you know, super majorities, often four to one GOP majorities in the legislature, you have a Republican governor, and we can't get anything done because the we, we're a minority of the majority. And, you know, on the one hand, they are Republicans, but on the other hand, they're really not. But the people think they're Republicans, so they don't face opposition. And they kind of do what they want, which is never a good thing. Whereas in your state, you're really the only super majority Republican state. I guess Kentucky would probably be the other one. But generally speaking, it's a rare anomaly. You have a Democrat governor. And it almost seems like she's a little bit more reluctant to oppose some of this than even some of the Republicans because she knows she's on a short leash. So, is that sentiment true? And do you think that she might sign some of these bills? Well, and that's a great assessment on your part. And, and I certainly want them all on her desk. I want to find out, you know, you're 100% right. No, she has not tricked anybody into thinking she's a conservative. And so, you know, she's got a very, very small base. So her, her decision making on these bills is, do I appeal to my small base? Or do I try to expand my base by passing some of these bills? Now, she's given us every indication in other bills that she's trying to appear to be much more middle of the road, even conservative. And so, you know, I want these bills on her desk. So she clearly defines who she is coming into this election. I suspect she'll pass some of these. I suspect she'll pass the HB 2280 if it makes her desk because of multiple reasons I won't get into now. But, you know, she cannot afford to, to, to, to aggravate 75% of the population to try to appease 25%. If she does, it's going to be to her demise. And you're right, you know, our big task, when I'm not talking about this stupid virus, what I'm talking about is how to identify a rhino. You know, I am, I love to hunt big game of big bullhutter, but this rhino is spelled R-I-N-O. We've got to teach the populace how to recognize a rhino. And it's very simple, you know, at 30,000 feet. If, if they're a candidate who is always talking about every, all the committees they've served on and all the things they've done before and never talk about what they believe in, the rhino. And then, you know, then we got to empower people in our part of the world here in the heartland. We don't like to be confrontational. And so we don't like to look somebody in the eye and say, are you for abortion or are you against it? But, and I'm encouraging people to get over that. You know, we need to ask the hard questions. We have to teach the grassroots how to identify a rhino from a good Republican. We're not in Kansas. We really don't need the word conservative because you look up the Kansas Republican Party platform, read the 12 basic tenets. And that's a conservative. So either in Kansas, you're a Republican or you're a fraud. Exactly. But I sense there's a lot of complacence among the people in Kansas and similar states where they know they don't like the Biden administration. They know they don't like that. But most people will run as a Republican whether they really are or not. They're, they're really leftist a lot, a lot of times. And it's just they find a way of, of playing games. Is there a need to break away from that brand there? So in other words, for governor, you know, you would think this would be the biggest pickup opportunity, right? It's probably the red estate this cycle represented by a Democrat for governor. Wouldn't you obviously have someone who could easily defeat her and represent your values? And if not, is there a chance someone will maybe run as an independent? Well, I'd say yes to all the above there. Or I'd say all that. I'll take the selection D all the above. Yeah, I think, I think there's lots of states that a strong charismatic grassroots candidate that had access to some reasonable funding could make a lot of hay. I do. And, absolutely here in Kansas, if if an independent runs, we're going to have another four years of a Democrat governor is what will happen here. And I think everybody knows that. That's the, I think that's the worst kept secret in politics in Kansas. Interesting. Well, you know, at least you're doing your job in the state Senate. Who knows if we'll ever have a legitimate Republican candidate to represent those values, but we know you'll be fighting for us there in the Senate. Thank you so much for your update. And please keep us abreast to, you know, what else is going on? These bills will definitely get them before people. And, you know, we're trying to create these strike force teams where people could get involved in the legislature's understand who's who, like you said, disentangling the rhinos from the real people and get them to support the proper legislation. Well, I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and I'll look forward to staying in touch. Take care. God bless. So folks, again, that was Dr. Mark Steffen, state senator from Central Kansas. A very interesting perspective. I mean, there he actually helps control the health care committee. So it's actually a good committee, which in most states, it's bad. Um, so he does have some successes, but even then, I mean, you see, he does have kind of the problem that Idaho has where everyone's a Republican, but all the Democrats run his Republicans. But it boils down to one thing was very interesting. He said, what is the difference between a rhino and a non rhino? It's all about special interests. It's not everyone thinks, oh, you're conservative, you're more conservative. I guess that those terms are really nebulous. It's those who think the system is awesome and those who know it's corrupt. And at the end of the day, most Republican elected officials, it all gets back to the money and the special interests, chamber of commerce, the industries, um, the hospital associations, those are the ones that run everything. The people don't matter. I thought that was very profound. 400 people testifying, life-saving treatment. And the hospital was like, screw that. We don't want that. When you would think, well, why would you oppose outpatient treatment? Again, this wasn't even telling the hospitals what to do in the hospital because they are corrupt and they're willing to have people die for their corruption. And I thought that was also interesting with the Democrat governor. She's actually, because she's on a short leash and knows that in a very bad year for Democrats, it's going to be hard to hold that governorship. She's willing to go along with things. We kind of have a hostage. Whereas in these other states, I don't know what to do. I don't know how we educate people on primaries, but I could tell you no one cares. No one's focused on them, which is why I think you just need to get out of this entire thing and run in the general as an indie. I'm going to start developing that over time. By the way, just one other thing I wanted to share with you will actually two things before we call it a day. Number one, so again, I have confirmed I will be going out to the next Patriot Academy defensive handgun training in Riton, New Mexico on May 22nd. It's a five day training. This is the funnest training you will ever find. It's drawn from the holster. It's clearing malfunctions. You know who you are. A lot of you guys that have been owning guns forever, even carry guns, and you don't really know how to properly win a gun fight. You were never trained, had it properly. Draw from a holster. It is well worth your time, especially if you guys are retired. It's a great vacation opportunity. Beautiful country there in Northeast New Mexico. It's at the Whittington NRA Center. They rent out their area that is Patriot Academy. The easiest way to find out the details is about $100 a day. Still about 70-80% off the typical cost of such training. Very rigorous training. The easiest way is to just type into your browser Patriot Academy constitutional defense course. I'm making my ticket today. Look, hopefully the mass mandate will be gone by then, but it's the best way to meet me, other members of this audience. The camaraderie is great. The salt of the earth Americans will be out there and it really is the most useful, fun training. You could bring your kids too. A lot of people bring their teenage kids, especially if you have a kid in college. Most colleges are over by then. That's a good time to get a head start in an early summer vacation. Those of you who are in Colorado, Texas, you're much closer than our previous venue in Nevada. I look forward to seeing you guys there. Another, just one story we're talking about early treatment. Do you know that now we have it confirmed? I mean, we had it confirmed before, but a study from George Washington University found that aspirin is effective for moderate illness in the first few days in the hospital. Think about this. Something as simple as an aspirin. Not only works early treatment, but even mid level early stages of hospitalization. They studied a hundred thousand COVID patients and found those given aspirin had a 15% lower risk of dying within 28 days. Patients were in the early 60s around 15,000 were given aspirin while the remaining 96,000 had normal hospital care. That's a huge sample size. Those who got the painkiller had a 29% reduced risk of blood clots. Patients who appeared to benefit the most, including patients older 60 older than 60 and those with comorbidities. The study found it was published in the jamma. So now it's okay to do this. Okay. Cluted 112,000 patients. So a couple of things I want to mention. The overall mortality risk sounds kind of low. You know, 15% reduction, but look, I mean 15% of a million deaths is 150,000 people, but moreover, this is as simple as aspirin. So you don't need a hospital. The starting point was they were already hospitalized. Imagine if you would have given the aspirin early on outpatient. The first few months into COVID, I thought I had it. You know, I didn't know any better. I didn't have it, but I thought I had it. First thing I did, I never have aspirin. My house only have Advil. I went out and got aspirin took an aspirin. Another interesting thing is they used 81 milligrams. That's, that's a baby aspirin. Can not the whatever 300 or so milligrams. So I would imagine that would have made a huge difference. They said they reduced blood clang by 29%. I would imagine if you would have had the real dose, you could probably would have been well over 50. Okay. So that's a huge deal. This is a giveaway, a freebie, something that simple that we knew about two years ago. Finally, they publish it. And again, what I'm telling you is higher dose earlier on would have been much bigger. And again, that's just one thing. What if you have the aspirin with the Ivermectin and hydroxy and phenofibrate and pepcid and do the nasal spray and have your vitamin D and vitamin C and zinc up your Z stack with, with doctors, a Lanko, you put that together, then, and you do it early and you get people's levels up that starts creeping up close to 100%. Genocide, utter genocide is disgusting what we've gone through, but we are out of time. We're gonna have some special guests on throughout the week. Some of your comments, questions, concerns, dharowitz at blazemedia.com or danielharowitz at startmail.com. If you have any questions on our defensive handgun training out in Mexico on the 22nd of May, you could email me as well with your questions. Until tomorrow, God bless you all and thank you for listening."
