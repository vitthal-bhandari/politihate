    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren Plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Welcome. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whidlock. I am Jason Whidlock, your host. Happy Tuesday, half the day after Memorial Day. Happy, happy, happy. We got a four-day work week, and we're looking forward to it. We have an awesome show playing for you today. Big round of applause to Mika Michelle and Scotty on with us today, and we'll be here for the next three days. Is that right? Yes. And so, Mika, what did you do for Memorial Day weekend? Did you do anything fun? Yes, we had our Family Reunion, and we sang the song Family Reunion, I think it's by the OJ's maybe. And first of all, that was long and dull and boring. The entire song going through the talking part, which I had never noticed that he actually said exactly what we talked about though on the show. Oh, really? Yeah, that the father is the head of the family. Oh, they don't allow music like that no more. Yeah, they cut that off too. I had never heard that part on the radio, but he talks about the father being the head of the family and the woman standing next to the father and how the kids are under them. So, that was my first time hearing the entire version, but the rest of... I'm getting trouble here. Keep talking. Yeah, the rest of the family, it was just a really long drawn out song, but it was great to get together with my people. Oh, yeah, I remember this. Yeah. So, my cousin insisted that we sang this, but if you go all the way to the end, it's fearless. Like, that's exactly what we talk about. And it was my first time, I guess the radio probably cuts all that talking off, but that was my first time hearing. And I said, oh, looking at the lyrics because they had it in our program. Oh, he's right. That's what we talk about. We need to get back to this. We don't even make music like that anymore. I can't wait to... When we get to a commercial break, or when we get to a break, I'm gonna listen to the whole song again, just refresh my memory. But anyway, Steve Kim is going to join us as well. We will start the show as we always do with a fire starter. So, let's get this party rolling. A time comes when silence is betrayal. That time has come for us in relation to biological males competing in women's sports. That time has come for us in relation to male athletes avoiding the topic of biological males competing in women's sports. All right, I'm obviously stealing from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's anti-Vietnam war speech. It applies to transgenderism too. It applies to America's assault on common sense. We live in a time in which the prevailing sentiment is that everything is for everybody. It's not true. You can't have it all. You shouldn't desire to have it all. The mindset is testament to greed's power to overtake a culture and man's willingness to submit to cowardice in pursuit of financial gain. On Saturday, USA Today published a column attacking ESPN broadcaster Samantha Ponder for a tweet that supported University of Kentucky's former Riley Gaines. Gaines are in popularity speaking out against the trend of gender dysphoric, biological males competing in girls sports. She swam against William Leah Thomas in the NCAA's. Last week via Twitter, Gaines shared a handful of messages she received from California parents and young girls upset that biological boys were competing against girls in the state's high school track meet. Ponder retweeted Gaines and added a comment. I barely said anything publicly about this issue and I've had so many people message me stop me in the street to say thank you and tell me stories about girls who are afraid to speak up for fear of lost employment being called hateful. It is not hateful to demand fairness and sports for girls. This tweet sparked a nasty rebuke from Nancy armor, a USA Today columnist. Nancy wrote, Don't be fooled by the people who screech about fairness to cloak their bigotry towards transgender girls and women. The transgender girls and women who have the audacity to want to play sports in particular. This is and always was about hate, fear and ignorance. According to Nancy armor, Sam Ponder is a bigot now because she believes biological boys and girls should compete in separate sports. Armor berates ponder for agreeing with a Megan Kelly tweet that ridiculed a transgender woman going to see a gynecologist. Armor complained that ponders likes are a cesspool of transphobic tweets. In April, Ponder tweeted that she regrets not speaking out sooner in support of Riley Gaines. Where are the men at ESPN and throughout the sports world speaking out in support of Samantha Ponder and Sage Steele, another ESPN employee who has been vocal on the trans sports issue. Why are jobs, sports pundits and men betraying ponders stealing gains? If mean at times gets a mean tweet about her lack of qualifications to be considered an NFL insider, the white and black knights of ESPN rushed to Twitter to protect their Asian queen. There's no rush to publicly rally around Ponder or Steele because there's no money or social media clout to be gained. Can't elevate your corporate equity index pointing out the absurdity of men competing against women. Every male ex-jockey ESPN knows it's unfair for biological boys to compete against girls. They're experts on the topic. They know far more about competing in athletics than they do about law enforcement, the criminal justice system and American history. They can't wait to hop on television to second-guess law enforcement. They can't wait to offer bold opinions about subjects they know very little about. But boys competing against girls? Hmm, silence. It says fundamental at topic as there is in sports. It's the equivalent of debating Jordan versus LeBron or the NFL careers of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Why is ESPN avoiding the subject? Because the executives running the network are petrified of the alphabet mafia and the on-air talent for your social media backlash. It's collective cowardice. Two women at ESPN, Ponder and Steele, have more courage than Mike Greenberg, Stephen A. Smith, Ryan Clark, Dan Orlowski, Jaylen Rose, Max Kellerman, and all the other men combined. It's embarrassing. This is what happens when everyone is chasing the bag. It empowers social media to eliminate common sense. I have sympathy for men and women who believe they were born the wrong gender. But common sense makes it clear that not everything is for everybody. A boy who thinks he's a girl doesn't get to compete in girls sports. That's life. No different from how I've long thought I would look great in a size 32 skinny jeans. They're not for me. They don't fit. The solution to dysphoria is not pandering to someone else's delusion. It's helping them come to grips with reality. And the reality is the silence of men on the issue of trans athletes speaks to our betrayal of women and God. That's my fire for today. Hats off to Samantha Ponder for joining the fight. There's other closeted believers over at ESPN. I'm glad Sam has come out of the closet. Maybe she'll inspire some of those men to do the same thing. They need to. All of them need to. We'll bring on Steve Kim here in a minute and Shamika will have some thoughts on it as well. But before we do any of that, I want to talk to you guys about my friends at Patriot Mobile.

Look, and we're going to really get into this this week all month about this whole CEI, Corporate Equity Index.

Well, my story is about as messy as they come but it turns out our movie The Blind is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. Wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. Own The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. All right, welcome back. Time for some Korean Co-Sell to help me unpack, help me, and Shamika unpack my fire starter. Steve and Shamika, I'm going to start off with a softball. Why the men at ESPN? Why is ESPN avoiding a topic that is this easy, this relatable? You want to do a topic that moms and dads and grandparents and everybody on the planet can relate to. You don't have to know anything about sports to have an opinion about whether biological men should be competed against girls in sports. And ESPN won't debate or touch this topic. Why are they avoiding? You know, I would say just like a lot of the men, they're weak. You know, they're scared. This is the topic that you talk about when you want to get canceled. When you want people to come after you and have something to say. So I think a lot of them are focused on their jobs and their own personal job security opposed to what's right. You only have a few people actually willing or have the guts to speak out about what's right. And thankfully these women are especially rally games. I mean, she understands what it's like to compete against a man. So I appreciate her for that. But a lot of them just won't speak out because they're weak. The same reason they won't stand up to their wives and their girlfriends. The same reason they've been over any other time. They're weak. Well, I think it's very simple. They're not allowed to. And most of these guys are very, very fearful that they have no other options. But I think this goes back into something much greater and deeper. Let's go back to who really owns ESPN. It is a subsidiary of Disney. Now I saw something very interesting over the weekend on Twitter where they showed a clip from Disneyland where there's some shop where little girls can get dresses made. And the greeter was this obvious male with facial hair dressed up in a dress acting as a female. And he was the one kind of leading these girls and saying, Oh, hi, how are you? Would you let them like? Ah, so when you think about that larger agenda that exists, it's all a trickle down effect. And I know this maybe even greater than you, Jason, because you're at ESPN longer, yet bigger stature. But I was there much later into this whole woke movement. I was there from 2018 to October 31st, 2020. I know this for a fact, when you tweet anything that is not part of the accepted messaging, which means anything to the right of center, anything like Thomas Soul, anything that's not pro BLM and now pro trans, you are simply rebuked. I had it happen to me firsthand. I had to get the heck out of there. So the bottom line is a lot of these men are emasculated and they understand that is part of the deal. What do you think happens to Samantha Ponder? Do you think an exec gives her a phone call about supporting Riley Gangs? Samantha Ponder will now be one of the most polarizing figures at that company. I give her a lot of credit. It took a lot of ovaries for her to come out and just blur that out. One of the most obvious things. And I actually think, you know what's interesting guys? And tell me if you disagree. She's very attractive. There's no doubt about it. I think the fact that she's incredibly attractive, very, very feminine, angered certain people like that USA Today columnist. And just to go to that, there's a reason why nobody trusts the mainstream media anymore. They are so divorced from reality. They are in on this. It's not just a taciturn endorsement. They are part of this now. They are part of that agenda. They're part of that movement. But as it relates to Miss Ponder, that's a very good question. What I would like to know is, I believe she's raising a family. I'm assuming she has kids. Maybe this is her way of saying, you know what? I'm good. I'm done. It's time to raise my family. Or again, because I don't know all the particulars. Maybe she just says, you know what? It's time. I don't care. And I'm secure enough in my position. Those are the things I would like to know when we'd have to ask her herself. I do feel confident. She's a person of faith. I think she's talked about that in other interviews. I mean, I want to ask you this and Steve, you kind of put it on the table. Do you think her attractiveness plays a part? Save still? Also attractive? Riley Gaines? Also attractive. Yes. And it's like, if you're an attractive woman and you don't have over the top animus towards men, then you're perfectly comfortable with traditional gender roles. And if you're unattractive and you're not as comfortable and you want there to be this fluidity. Yes. I totally agree with that. I laughed when Steve said it because that was one of the first things I did. I went to look up the person who wrote the USA Today article about her. Because I wanted to see what she looked like. And when I saw her, I thought, oh yeah, she wants me to be a part of it because it allows her to fly under the radar. Like she doesn't look better. If she's confused, then it's better. Exactly. So it made perfect sense. It's always the ones that don't look like anything that have no problem with men coming into their spaces because it allows them to be a little rough around the edges, a little less feminine fit right in with the men. I mean, as soon as I read that, I pulled the picture up and it made perfect sense. It's always that way. I'm going to be sympathetic. Hold for one second, see, I'm going to be sympathetic towards I hate to let's enter into the record that I'm unattractive. And so now we've said that, but now I can say what I'm going to be sympathetic towards unattractive women. And say that this visual era we've gone into with social media and Instagram in particular has changed the standards for beauty and for what men are interested in. I think before Instagram, before social media, before the internet, things were better for unattractive women than they are now. Now every guy feels like, seems like he wants a woman that's 118 to 130 pounds and looks like Jennifer Aniston or Holly Berry or whatever. And I think we've elevated the animosity of overweight or unattractive women because of this era we're living in when there's so much focus on physical beauty. You know, I think I always focused on physical beauty. And I think men always desire that. To me, social media has made it where people that are not as cute get to be put up on this pedestal. Like we get to see people with skin diseases, you know, now put out on you talking about that under on commercial. I just saw there's a woman there's some kind of under on where they show a woman that's got some kind of skin defects. Yeah, we get to see that. We get to see them handicapped. We get to see them fat. Even when they changed the Victoria's secret, you know, took away the angels. I was very upset about that because I'm like, that was something I aspire to look like. I don't want to look like these fat chicks that y'all are now pushing, you know, for Calvin Klein and whatever. I don't want to look like, you know, my skin is falling off or I'm bald headed or my teeth hanging out in my mouth. But that's now it's like, oh, we got to come up with a different standard of beauty now because we can see all of this stuff before it was fine for men to fantasize about Halle Berry. Now you're criticized if you fantasize about her. You got to be fantasizing about the fat ugly chick now. So I don't know if it, I don't know. I don't feel sorry for ugly women. I think everybody has to understand you may not be every man's cup of tea. Like, I don't think I'm ugly, but I'm not every man's cup of tea. I may be too thin. I may be too dark, you know, whatever. And you just have to accept that people are having a hard time accepting reality. You said it in your monologue, like, you know, you would wear a size 32. Like, I would love a rack like Jeff Bezos fiance, but I don't have it. And so every now and then I'm checking to make sure my breasts haven't said I'm tired. We don't want to sit up anymore because I don't have that. And people are having a hard time just accepting what's real. And so we're supposed to buy into the delusion. See, um, Shamika, I just want you to know, I unapologetically still and more attracted to Holly Berry than Liz, though, just just just for the record there. But Shamika, I have to ask you this question. So it is true that women are more critical of each other than men. So that's absolutely true in your view. Yes, absolutely. And for women that say, you know, I just do this for myself. You really don't you do it because you want the other girl to know you're a little bit better than she is. You look a little bit better than she does because I do think men a lot of times don't notice some of the things that we noticed. Like I can notice even with myself like, Oh, you know, you see my cellulite or something and I'm like, Oh, I don't see that. Yes, you do. Because I saw it on Tasha and Tasha's cellulite look really bad. Like we are very critical of each other as women. A lot more than me and are. Why aren't and again, you already answered it. You think they're not allowed, but over Twitter, you're telling me Ryan Clark, Dan Olofsky that they can't tweet some sort of support or Samantha Ponda. They certainly do it anytime. Mina times gets a mean tweet. Yeah, you know, there's a part of it where these guys just want to talk ball, like especially Dan Oh, Dan. Oh, just wants to talk access and knows he wants to talk about how to attack a cover to what the man beat and stuff like that. And I respect it. But here's the thing and we to talk about what you brought up Jason. I believe that most modern journalists or pundits they do what I call gerrymandering their opinion. They don't say what they really feel for the most part because they want to be accepted by everybody. I will give you myself and coach JB credit in a sense that when we tweet stuff out, we don't give a damn about who hates it. I mean, literally these some of these guys are so cowardly and afraid and gutless that they can get a thousand retweets, a thousand likes. But if they just get five people to disagree and vehemently tweet at them in anger, it bothers them. And they're afraid of the heat. They're afraid of getting ratioed. And these guys intrinsically know, given where they work, who they work for in the climate of that place, that that's a no fly zone. And like I told you, a lot of these guys are afraid, in my view, of negative feedback, even one santilla of it. Here's what here's what they would say. Let's take Ryan Clark or who's, David Rose loves to play the race car. And they get negative feedback for that. It's not massive, but there are people that sit on Twitter and on social media and attack them. When Jalen Rose says, hey, let's don't use Mount Rushmore anymore, he got attacked. In his mind, though, that's a positive attack. He's pissed off white races. That's a good thing. Right. And Jason, but again, there's the corporate approval. There's the approved messaging. So that goes right into what you said, you're absolutely right about that. They here's the issue. If you stand up and make this bold proclamation that men should only play against men and females should only play against females, you are going to raise the ire of the hyper liberal woke contingency. That's who they're afraid of. Now everybody else, Common Sense America, which I still think populates the silent majority of this great country. They don't care. They're looking to inflame them. So think about this. If you want to rise up the ladder at most corporate legacy media entities, if you consistently anger the people that you talked about, the supposed white angry racist mob, you move up the ladder. Now, if you are consistently angering the other side, you probably get taken off the air. So again, these guys are playing a game and they're understanding what plays to my career and what plays to my supervisors, what's going to get me promoted and what will get me demoted. I want to move on to another topic that I think everybody can relate to, to some degree, although it's baffling to me. Scotty Pippin continues to attack Michael Jordan. Scotty Pippin has said, you know, Jordan's a horrible teammate. He was a terrible person to play with. It's all odd and baffling. I don't see a win here for Scotty Pippin. And so I want to walk us back to Scotty Pippin going into the Naismith Hall of Fame. And what Scotty Pippin said about Michael Jordan, when he was, when Pippin was getting into the Hall of Fame and when Michael Jordan introduced him at that Hall of Fame speech, let's start from that foundation. Let's play the clip. MJ, you have touched so many people lives, but none like minds. Thank you for being the best teammate. I will always cherish that experience and I will cherish our relationship forever. Thank you. So that's him going into the Hall of Fame by 10 years ago. Here's some of the more recent comments. Let's play them back to back. Here's some of the more recent comments from Scotty Pippin about Michael Jordan. You know, I remember a few relationships have never been strong, you know. I respect his coaching. He's great at what he do. But he's just a different kind of guy. And I just never felt away from the game that he was in my corner. Hey, speaking of other guys, you played for Scotty with even with the game, you know, I was back in my years playing with the Bulls and how things sort of ended up like, I just don't know if he was ever in my corner, you know. And I say that to say him as well as Michael, just kind of how things were handled the last couple years going through a contract like, they want one more year and this and that, you know, and I'm just sitting over there like, okay, how many years they give you? I'm out of here. Wow, you know, so that was, you know, he just really turned sour to me his last couple years of coaching, not that that took anything away from me as a player or how I played the game or anything, but it was more he became selfish. And when you're around selfish people, then things just, it really was the breakup of our team, to be honest, you know, one selfish guy on the team, another selfish guy coaching the team. It just, it was time for a divorce. When LeBron James leave the game, he will be the greatest statistical player to ever play the game. Look at my point this day, probably 15 years later, because I said it when he was two, three years in the game, because he was filling up the stats every game. And so they made the comparison, who's greater, him or Michael, like LeBron will be the greatest statistical guy to ever play the game or basketball. And there's no comparison to him. None. So does that make him the greatest player to ever play the game? I'll leave that out for debating because I don't believe that there's a great player because our game is a team game. And one player can't do it. Like, I seen Michael Jordan play before I came to play with the Bulls. You guys seen him play. He's a horrible player. He was horrible to play with. He was all one on one. He shooting bad shots. And all of a sudden we become a team and we start winning. Everybody forgot who he was. So we go from the Hall of Fame speech to hot shots at Mike in virtually every interview. Here's where I want to add some sympathy for Scotty Pippen. Scotty Pippen was married to a woman named Larsa for more than 20 years. And now Michael Jordan's son is dating Scotty Pippen's ex-wife. I think they just got divorced in 2021. I'm sorry. I would feel some sort of way about my former teammate and good friend if his son started dating my ex-wife. And perhaps was a reason why she is my ex-wife. I don't blame Scotty for getting a little emotional and irrational. And I know this criticism of Jordan started with the last dance, but you never know when the thing with Larsa Pippen and Michael's son started. There may be some synergy there. Steve, your initial thoughts on what's going on with Scotty Pippen. Well, first of all, as they say, Larsa's frustrates. But anyway, look, here's the thing with Scotty. He's a brilliant second banana. But I saw something on Twitter, and by the way, I believe everything that's on Twitter. Do you know his Chris Scoring average is like 16.1? Let's not make him out to be Kobe to Shaq here. Okay. He was a really good complimentary player, incredible wing defender, great finisher. And everyone brings up 1994 to one year. The first year of Michael Jordan's kind of, what do you call it, the break where he was in Memphis over the Birmingham Barons, right? And he let them to 55 wins. But the next year, they went right back to media awkwardly without Michael Jordan. And the one thing that I'll always remember about Pipp in that great season they had, Game 4, they need a last second play. And the guy pouts because Phil Jackson said, we're going to use you as a decoy. We're going to give the guy a cool coach. And he just pouted. That, that to me right there was a big character defect. The other thing about Jordan, look, you know what I think of Jordan? When Jordan had great teammates, he was a really good ball distributor. And in fact, you go back to the first championship they won in 1991, the deciding game Jordan did an unbelievable job of setting up packs and out on the wing, the drive and dish. And when he had teammates that were capable, Michael Jordan, like Kobe, they could actually distribute the ball and make guys better. It took Scotty Pipp in about four years to become a reliable teammate. The guy was afraid of his own shadow and he was certain afraid of the pistons and there came a time. He couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat in Detroit. Let's be very honest. Michael had virtually no help until him, Scotty Pipp in and Horace Grant developed. They were important. I do not want to take away what they brought to the table because Michael would not have won it without him. But again, Scotty Pipp in did not even average 20 points a game throughout his career. Let's not make it sound like he was something that he wasn't. And by the way, Scotty never led another team to anything really tangibly big. Maybe the the blazers that blew that big lead in game seven against the Lakers in 2000. Hell has no fury like Pipp in Scorned. And I think you're absolutely right, Jason, the situation personally. But it all goes back to like you said, when Michael said Scotty was being a little bit selfish in terms of this contract. But Jason, let's add some context to that discussion. That bad contract that locked him in as being the 150th highest paid player. Guess who signed that contract? Even though the Jerry Kraus and Ryan's George said Scotty, this is not a good deal. Shorten up your deal. Oh, yeah. It was Scotty himself. He gave himself. And here's the other thing that I hated about him. The worst thing that used to be before this, they used to call him no tip and pippin because he was terrible to waiters and waitresses. He would never tip. That's a character flaw. So he gets a bad contract. And every server now has to bear the brunt. And he has to become frugal at their that that's terrible. Scotty bad luck, brother. You are more petty than Tom and Richard. Sorry, I've lost all respect for you. Sort of anyway, that's it. He also never made an all star team without Michael Jordan. That's another damning statistic against him. Tamega, are you like me to cut him any slack? Jordan's son is dating Scotty Pippin's ex-wife. No, I don't cut him any slack because I am a Michael Jordan fan. I've known him since I was a little girl and Scotty Pippin is a lion wonder. He is so jealous of Michael, it makes his ass itch. Like to get up here and say all of these things when I saw something where he actually compared him and LeBron Michael and LeBron and he said Michael was asked to score. If he was asked to be an all around player, he could have done that as well and that there was no question. Michael is the greatest player of all times. So now for you to be a man scorned. You just look like a bitch because y'all are over. Let her move on. I tried to put myself in his shoes and I asked myself if one of my maybe somebody I was jealous of or an enemy's child started dating my ex-husband. Great. I don't care. So no, I don't give him any sympathy and I've been upset with him since the last dance when he complained that he wasn't in the documentary enough. Get your own documentary, Mac tonight. I'm just sick of him whining like a little girl. Listen, I get the comparison of thinking what if it was me but Scotty Pippen is written about and talked about in the sports world constantly and a locker room environment. You got a bunch of guys that love to talk trash and Michael Jordan's son is tapping your ex-wife. That's a lot to deal with in-guy culture. Even though she's used up. Like an old spare tire like you know. She got your four kids. But he didn't want her. Well he probably didn't want her because maybe she had a wandering eye. Well Michael Jordan's son. Well that's Bobby. Jason is playing and she had a wandering eye like Cicero. Yes. All moons in the stars. But anyway, here's the thing about Scotty Pippen. And again, I want to give him credit. He was one of the great complimentary players of all time. But I've seen lists where Scotty's made the all NBA 50 team, the 75th anniversary team. Ask yourself this question. Honestly, if Scotty Pippen was the true number one alpha on any team, does he make those lists? I don't think so. Certain guys are meant to be second bananas. As for Michael Jordan being a difficult tough teammate to play for. I would argue that most guys at that level are. Last December, throughout this winter break Jason, when we took a little vacation, I read the book by Sam Smith, Jordan Rules. I thought it was a brilliantly done book. I don't know what took me so long to read it. And they're making no bones about it. It's no secret. Michael Jordan was a biting guy. He was hilarious. And if you really couldn't play, he would ride you like the boss. I mean, there's this one story where Stacy King, who just took so many of his jokes, what brought in a box into the locker room. And Michael goes, Hey, Stacy, you got a jump shot in there? And just like, and he would just be consistent about it. And there was another point where he didn't trust Bill Cartwright. He thought Bill Cartwright was Edward Scissorhands. He had bad hands. He turned the ball over. He couldn't finish at the hoop. And I think it was text winner was trying to counsel Michael about, come on, you got to trust Bill, we got to dump the ball in. And Michael just blurts out text that mother couldn't score. It was the only guy in the gym. And there's like 50 lines like that from Jordan throughout. That's just one year. That's one year where they actually won the championship. What do you think he was doing in 1989? And these guys, and Scotty needed to be toughened up. Because the one thing I do remember about Scotty was in the three years that they lost to the Pistons and the Pistons were a better team. And it is a team game. Jordan had some bad games, but he had to bear the load of that offense. And Scotty always shrunk from the moment until it was 1991. That's the reality. There's a lot of truth in that. I just, all the fish in the sea. And Michael Jordan's son has to go get Scotty's old fish. I just, I just, I just don't get it. Well, Scotty could go get new fish now. I have a fish in the sea. Go get you a, you know, tenderoni. Right. I think he liked this particular dollar fish. God. He liked that catfish. I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, all right. Last night, game seven was a disappointment between the heat and the Celtics. Jason Tatum gets hurt in the first 20 seconds. Play through, but not the same player. And game was kind of around and uninteresting. But it does lead to a question about the NBA finals, the Miami Heat, Denver Nuggets, the Cola Yokez, Jimmy Butler, big enough stars to carry and draw attention in these NBA finals. Before I answer that, I just want to say one thing. Jaylen Brown was so bad yesterday. I think the Boston fans want to protest him now. Gee, he, I would be very wary of paying that guy. But anyway, back to your show, I just got done with my show. Yeah, you're right. If you are Adam Silver, secretly in the back of your mind, you are going to, uh, uh, war and trouble. Because even though Miami has a championship pedigree, it's not Boston. It's just a little bit different. But Jason, I'm going to admit something here. Someone that did not watch any NBA basketball with any type of regularity till about a month ago when you forced me to and me being the great fearless teammates. See, this is what Scotty Pippen should be. I understand my role. See, I'm playing second banana. I subjugate and I sacrifice. See, Pipp, take a lesson. The NBA playoffs. And gunpoint. Yes, you do. He's going to make me talk about this. He's at gunpoint. This man had me on the floor. He's like, get someone else. Get you an NBA expert. I'm not doing it. I'm like, okay. But you know what? But you know what? I wasn't like Scotty Pippen in game four. I said, all right. All right. Gift. Koo Coach, the bomb. By the way, Koo Coach made that shot and Bill Cartwright was about to kill everybody while he was crying. But anyway, the NBA playoffs have actually been pretty interesting. Jason, I don't, I disagree with you. I found game seven last night, even though it was a blowout to be fascinating. And I'll tell you why. On Saturday night, when Miami blew that game, didn't you think the heat were dead in the water and they had no shot of winning and to see them actually show character and to reverse it and to say, you know what? No, no, we're not just going to lay down and play dead. I actually found that to be pretty enthralling. I stuck on the thing. You know what? I said, my meat showed me something. Now, with that said, that Denver is a bad matchup for them. I think Yogech is going to have a monster series. And me and you, Jason, we're going to have weeks and weeks of Kendrick Perkin discussions, and it's going to be fun. Jokech, don't, don't let us down. Don't let us down, big guy. We are fearless is depending on you. I, if, if Denver is going to be so well rested and or sluggish, but I think well rested, yeah, I can't see them not winning this series in five or six. Yes. However, having said that, I, I'd like BAM defending Nicole Yokech. I actually think if the heated wrapped this up in five or six games, this would be a very interesting final series. I think Eric Spolstra is a heck of a coach and, and you know, there is something about the Miami Heat and the way they develop players and the culture they have there that is completely different. You know, and maybe it's both of these teams because the Denver Nuggets are a developed team that they're not somebody that traded for superstars. They develop these guys and yeah, the heat traded for Jimmy Butler, but they got a lot of players they develop. They, they picked it for undrafted guys in their eight man rotation. This will be a fascinating series. I just don't know. Are we going to be reading stories every other day about how they're breaking records for ratings? Haven't been this low since 1988 or how do you, do you think the public is going to buy into this series? If Denver wins the first two games, if I'm Adam Silver, I am swallowing my pride and I'm calling Tim Donahay. Say Tim, why not call Eric Lewis or Eric Lewis the new guy. Eric Lewis's team is out. He doesn't care about he's like me now. He's like me for about eight months. He's like, I don't give a damn anymore. Look, Denver's fascinating to me because they're actually a fun style and I enjoy a team that actually just attacks the basket a little bit. It's not just everything is a three-pointer. I mean, the Boston Brick Party yesterday was fascinating to watch. Jason, I didn't know this. I saw the box go. I think they were eight for 42 in three-point attempts. Eight for 42. There comes a point in time where if you're mazool and you got to say, guys, we can take a layup. We could take a 15-foot pull up and just see them just consistently shoot themselves out of the game. I actually felt like, wow, this is what analytics get you. Analytics is great with AI and I guess we're going to have that in 10 years. Much of robots playing. No one misses a shot, but this is a game still played by human beings. And I saw Jason, if you look at Yokage, what is the one final piece that is not there on his trophy case? Because he's done a lot. He's going to do a lot. He's still in the thick of his career. It's a Larry O'Brien trophy and an MVP finals trophy. And if he has the series that everyone is expecting, there's going to be a host of NBA analysts and pundits and journalists that are going to be gnashing their teeth. And when we start getting into who was the player that is going to define this era, post LeBron, now that James is kind of now into the twilight of what's been a spectacular career, there's going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth from the NBA media. And I'm here for it. Wow, you've raised a heck of a question. Would it be Yokage? You think that's the guy that's going to define this era, post LeBron? Not Yonis. Not Yonis. Not, I'm trying to think of who other job maran has lived himself on fire. Zion Williamson has eaten himself out of the league. Where are the other candidates? I mean, Jason, let's take a look at how a style ages. I talk about this in boxing a lot. Guys who rely on athleticism, quickness, and reflect, just think of Roy Jones, they are spectacular in their prime. Maybe their peak is better, because of what they can do athletically. But once you lose that, it is guys like Bernard Hopkins that have this sustained longevity. In my view, Giannis is spectacular. He's great. But ask yourself this, if he starts losing some of his elasticity and his twitch, does his game age as well as Yokage? I would say no. And it seems to me like Denver has a lot of good complimentary parts that play well with them. This may not be the last NBA finals we see Denver in. Here's the other candidate. Now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, Luca Donkich, I mean, he's got to win. I think they got to win. I think they got to win. I think he's got to lose some weight, perhaps. But Luca would be the other candidate. What if, I mean, this is fascinating. What if the end of the LeBron era is the beginning of the white European era and it's Yokage and Luca Donkich? If they're the most, the two biggest draws in the NBA. And even I would put Giannis in that category, the Greek freak, he's a foreigner. And so what we're about to usher in is the foreign era of the NBA. And I, wait a minute, Jason, did you hear that? That was Kendrick Perkins screaming. Yeah. I mean, but this is fascinating. This is somewhat of what David Stern's vision was to take this game international and make it global. But how will this league sell itself here in America? I went through this, man, this is, you've given me a lot to think about. I went through this with the Indy 500. I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana and the Indy 500 lost its relevance and traction in America because AJ Floyd and Johnny Rutherford and Thompson Eva and Al Unser and Bobby Unser. They all got one out. And the next thing you know, it was a bunch of people's names. It was hard to pronounce. And everybody went over the NASCAR. And the Indy 500 was no longer as big a deal. I just is America ready for a foreign star dominated NBA. Where's Joel Embiid from? He's not, isn't he from Cameroon or something or? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. This is, man, this anyway, you know, it may be time to bring Jeremy Lind back to the NBA Steve. Yeah, we had a good 15 minutes. We had a good 15 minutes before Carmelo Anthony just said, no, that's over with. But like I said, long live our vittest of bonus. It all began with him, our vittest of bonus. This is for I got to give this some more thought. We'll be back on this topic. That that that's interesting. Steve, finally, Steve, I know what you were most excited about this weekend. I know you'd love the NBA playoffs and all that. But your favorite new television show, Succession came to an end this weekend. And I thought the series finale was solid. I'm not going to put it in the great category. I thought it was solid. I thought the second to last episode Logan's funeral, I thought was trash. And so I don't think I don't think this thing stuck the landing in any way. I think it's a very it was a good entertaining show. But it does not belong in the same conversation with the wire. Oh, the windows. Come on. It doesn't apply. You would put it in the same category as the wired. All right. Go ahead. All right. More higher than Game of Thrones. I'd say on the same level as Game of Thrones. Oh, come on. Game of Thrones. That's three years old. The first four or five seasons, the first four or five seasons are Game of Thrones, blue succession away. But those last three seasons, the minutes, the minutes Game of Thrones. But you would put this on the same level as the sopranos and the wire. Let me just say one thing. Boys to Kim has to say it's so hard to say goodbye to Logan Roy. Yes. I mean, look, I actually liked the ending that I think about it because it played out inconvenient. But it also tried stayed true to what the storyline was about a bunch of kids that are ill equipped that were very entitled. They're very, very flawed. And they would eat their own to gain that power, which is what Shiv did at the end. And look, I don't expect every episode to be perfect. But I was ill. After the episode where Logan Roy passed away, it was a little shaky. But by the time the kids started making their moves and we saw how flawed they were, what their weaknesses and strengths were from a personality standpoint, I found it pretty interesting. And about the funeral, I loved it when the two old guys were like, Hey, you like Logan, right? Yeah, I guess I like, did you like? I thought I was so honest, because the guy was kind of a grouch. So be no, no, no, I thought that that's what I found so completely dishonest. There's no way you work for somebody for 20, 30 years, make millions of dollars with that person and get to his funeral. And you got nothing good to say? No, no, they were. Oh, yeah, by the way, when when your boss, every other thing he says to you is F off, trust me, you're going to have conflicted feelings. I think they like the old guy. By the way, if there's a breakout star of that series, it has to be that actor, Brian Cox, I saw something at the end of the third quarter of last night's game, where Brian Cox was doing a direct TV commercial. And it wasn't Brian Cox being Brian Cox, it was basically Logan Roy for direct TV, his mannerism. Then I had never really heard of the guy, but he was a distinguished actor from England, had a really great career. And he found his signature role. Jason, okay, you can say all you want that this show is not on the Mount Rushmore, sorry, Jalen, of HBO shows. But Logan Roy is certainly on the Mount Rushmore of great HBO characters of all time. Agree or disagree? Totally agree. Totally agree with that. Totally agree with that. Here's here's my problem though with the conclusion, which I I halfway liked because Tom is the only guy on the show that I that I had any sympathy for and thought like actually a halfway decent dude that married into this nutty crazy family. But what I what I leave four years later with Tom coming out on top, I don't feel like I know anything about Tom. I don't know anything about his upbringing. I don't think they should have developed that character a bit more over the course of four years so that the payoff of him winning would have been richer. And there were some just some wasted episodes along the way that that could have made the story even better because I just I found she is so unlikable and so but but I needed to understand a little bit more than what they gave us a little tiny bit that obviously Tom's power hungry and would do anything to move up the corporate ladder. But I I would have needed a little bit more back story on Tom. Well Tom was a small town room that saw life in the big city as a race to the top and attaching himself to power. And I love that last scene where Shiv made a decision like oh my god I don't want to be a single mom and Tom is now the guy and I thought it was actually very poignant how he put his hand out and she put his hand on his but they didn't necessarily clasp hands and it was an admission that this is a relationship of convenience. I thought that was incredibly honest. I love that ending. I found that interesting you didn't watch any of this Amika. Nope I was gonna say though that I saw people comparing it to the wire as well. Yeah. Oh don't do that with Jason. He takes that oh my god you've done it with Jason now. Don't don't do that. You don't you don't compare it to the shield. Don't compare it to madmen. Don't there's a bunch. Don't compare it to the Larry Sanders show. Don't don't don't I can go through a bunch of I don't think this is a top 10 show. I enjoy it for the time. It was too woke for me. So when did it get woke? When did it get woke? It was woke the whole the whole point is that Logan Roy is evil and every every guy that's made a dime or money is evil and we must save them and then the whole little Donald Trump character winning the presidency at the end. Missed me with all that. Well I'm going to end it like this and the immortal words of Logan Roy off. That's what I think your review of that great show could read off. Thank you Steve. Great job.

went home as well I like to go home visit my mom my auntie some other family and we love to play cards I mean we play bidwiz you know you're the game bidwiz yeah I find answered you know there's a big pile of money to be won if you're the winning team or whatever but anyway we mostly do it for the conversation we had a very interesting conversation that relates to the topic we're going to get into here about these pranking videos and and it's a it's we weren't talking about this we were talking about I'm sitting with a bunch of 80 year olds and older people hell I'm older myself now we're all reminiscing about how great our childhoods were and so I'm listening to these old people my mother her sister and and all the talk all of it so we had so much fun and this and that and I'm thinking they're in their 80s and so one of the first thoughts that went through my mind is like we sit around all day our people sit around all day on social media complaining about what life was like 60 70 years ago and we're old reparations they were mistreated and the people that actually lived during that time or they loved it they did and they did and miss it and wish the things like and they said oh we was the first people in our family in our in our neighborhood to have a phone and everybody came to our house to use the phone and it was a party line and you pick up other people's phone calls and you'd listen blah blah blah and and we have rent parties and blah blah all this stuff and it was great and we were so safe you could walk down the street at night and blah blah I'm just this is all you hear from us how great things were and I started thinking about like okay and then I started thinking about my childhood and how great it was and and what has changed the most dramatic change I think we've had is this social media deal because my auntie started complaining about when she her grandkids or whenever they get together go out to dinner and everybody's just staring down at their phone and they're not engaging with each other it made me think that one of the biggest issues we have right now is that people aren't living their lives for the attention and the approval of the people who are actually in their lives right when when you know you go back 60 70 years ago all you had was family to entertain your entertain you you spent all your time thinking about what's mom and daddy gonna think what's grand daddy gonna think oh boy you don't want to miss you don't want to piss off your grandma now people sit around and obsess about what social media am I going to get retweeted is this going to be like is this tiktok video gonna go viral and we're doing all these things for people will never meet or know right and the approval and the attention of people will never meet and know and we and then it's also shaping how we view the world and how we view the world used to be on okay there's this my family who I engage with the most then I got friends who I engage with then I got some teachers and coaches that I engage with and then I got my church family who I engage with and now it's it's someone in another state maybe in another country or maybe it's just a bot that we're catering all of our behaviors towards their approval and their attention and we're wondering why we're at each other's throats and why we have such a negative view of the world because it's like when I go home and get into that little bubble of family and just talking to family or whatever I'm like oh man this feels good this feels normal right this this is what life I'm surrounded by people that love me I love them and man you leave out of there and you're feeling good and then you step back into this matrix that they've built the internet and it looks like the wild wild west and everybody's trying to kill each other yeah for sure I sat with my grandmother siblings this weekend and listening to my aunt who is 87 just talk about how for her entire you know life or childhood she thought they were rich you know there wasn't this message of oppression or that they were beat down and that everyone was so racist she actually talked about how good her childhood was and as I looked at like pictures that were on the wall and I saw how well dressed they were and how they carried themselves with class I can see why you know like people such as us which say what would my grandmother think what would my mom think because they carried themselves in a way that you wanted to impress them because they were impressive you know and I look even just at the kids today they don't care what their parents think you're absolutely right it's all about social media and of course people being on their phones constantly my friend my kids have asked me mom how did y'all entertain each other because we did you know we didn't get together and get on out we didn't have phones back then and so now me and my classmates we get together a lot we don't have our phones out because that's not what we're used to we get together and we talk and we laugh and we crack jokes and we talk about old times and we enjoy each other now people can be right in the same room and we'll text opposed to talking you know or upstairs mom can you take my drink out the freezer or something you know it's like kids just want to text now and so they claim that they've made communication easier but we definitely communicate less there's no substance there there's no real connection because everything is about the phone and I was telling you earlier before we went on air how it was just nice to watch like my my oldest uncle danced around he's 94 years old I didn't post any of that stuff we do have some video clips because of course we would like to share you know years from now but it wasn't like he wasn't doing it for social media it was for us as the family and as we danced and we laughed and we talked it was really just about us being in our little bubble and enjoying each other and being comfortable you ain't got to be on because this is the people that know you you know and we we are missing that now I was as you were talking I was sitting there thinking about going over to my grandmother's apartment as a kid and how much entertainment we would get and let's say we went over there once a month but virtually every time we would get out her photo album and spend an hour just clicking through photos we've seen before and having conversations about and so that was anti-ev what was she blah blah blah conversations and all that and it's like we don't we think like Facebook is superior but it's not because you know people are taking pictures of every meal they eat they posted on Instagram and it's all inconsequential things but mostly what I think the internet is done again it's it's disconnected us from the relationships that God actually wants us to have he wants a parent's voice to be the loudest and most powerful voice a child hears the internet has made celebrities right the most powerful and influential voice a child hears and and and that celebrity doesn't care about your kids will never meet your kids and all these other influencers and so this is all a long segment into we were talking this morning about these viral prank videos that are going on and and and I'm just like why would kids do this why why would they run around and and prank people over tick-tock and all that but again they're constantly doing things for the attention of people who don't care about them they're not doing they're not doing these prank videos to show their mom and dad or their brother and sister is to get attention and go viral and so I we were gonna I wanted to play some of these uh this is I think the first one's a video of some

bitch you stay out of this yeah i don't think you got to do that i don't want to do that you almost died you stupid son of a bitch my guy comes out pulls his gun on the guy i don't blame me i mean this is lunacy that this internet has us out doing for attention i think there's a guy and maybe this isn't America maybe it's australia there's some guy that's walking prank walking into people's homes and having conversations with them let's play that james james james it is where the study group is thank you no what the numbers this no well this is not what i studied for kids man well you got kids on saturday oh i thought this was study group i actually and it's the study group this guy gets and i don't know what country is in but that happens in american a guy gets shot and the next thing you know all this racism exactly it's but this is why i i just go to this whole internet social media has everybody acting out for the attention of people they don't know will never meet and shouldn't be concerned with i don't i don't know if we're ever going to recover from this era and what it's it's done to young people's minds and our ability to even engage with each other honestly right because that that's the other thing i've been talking about for years is that social media has turned everybody into a performer and it's a stage and so people lean into dishonesty and they start saying things that will sound good on twitter or on social media that don't really reflect their true feelings right i was looking at this and i was thinking a couple things one pranks have really evolved because i remember me and my friends as young girls we would pull out the white pages and we made what caused somebody in there and say hey mr you know johnson is your refrigerator running and when he said yes oh you better go catch it or you know a little bit more evil maybe was when we saw a married couple and we would say hey uh glad it's this is bopra uh tell your husband the baby needs some pampers you know we would do the head at sleepovers but we were never making people feel like their lives were in danger and yes they are doing it for clicks i think the the camera phone was the worst thing to happen to people you look at kids now when they have fights back in the day if you thought you were losing the fight or you know maybe you would surrender and walk away and it is what it is now kids know that they have the camera on them so they won't walk away from a disagreement they're going to go above and beyond just in case it goes viral they don't want to look in bears so they'll go through with things that they may not have gone through it just for the likes like you said and i think the camera phone has been terrible for society but especially for these teenagers who can't uh decide quite yet between right and wrong and all they think about is my my ego or my popularity could be ruined from this and so i've seen kids that i know are not fighters i just saw a young lady who i was uh i grew up with her dad she's not a fighter but she had all of the cameras on her and approached a teacher to fight the teacher this is something that i think normally kids wouldn't do and i certainly would not have done it growing up but now kids feel there's pressure to perform for the cameras it's so dangerous too when so many kids are wired to think that disrespect is is the worst thing they could happen it's you're not going to disrespect me and i'm willing to fight over it and and anything can be seen as disrespect and you're right you've just given me a different way to look because i've seen a lot of videos of incidents in schools where i've seen you know kids punch teachers over their cell phones and things like that and and you're right if there was no camera if they didn't think they were being recorded i think they would not do a lot of the silliness and stupidity that that they're doing obviously a lot of that because you would think a camera would provoke you into more responsible behavior in turn like i'm being videoed i'm not going to do something that makes me look iraq but but people exist in a world where again the audio world star hip-hop is their audience yeah and world star hip-hop loves stupidity and violence and just random acts of chaos i don't know it's it's really sad it gave i've thought about this quite a bit again over the weekend just talking with older people in my family and us just sitting around reminiscing about how great things were but before all of this technology and before again because kids don't even know how to entertain or engage with each other in an entertaining way and and it's why i love going home and playing cards and talking people been doing that for probably 300 years right longer who knows right and we can just sit around and talk about anything or nothing and it's very entertaining we didn't do that this go around at our family reunion and my kids were disappointed so they said so we're not going to go to the hotel and sit out in the lobby and talk because they look forward to that that's not something that they do with their kids but everybody was tired and we had a birthday they were going to the casino so we we don't do that anymore but i love those opportunities and i like people who have no phone environments there are a couple parties that i've been to in my city well they don't allow you to bring your phone out for one that makes you engage but number two so people can be relaxed without feeling like everything i do is going to be recorded and put on the internet like we're so busy behind the camera that we don't really enjoy the moment so it's like the memory is gone because it wasn't there to start with i wanted to like restaurants if there's not some restaurant that should start a trip and did i did i just go to house of cards here in Nashville and i think they said you couldn't bring out your phone i think that was one of the stipulations don't bring out your phone because people don't want to be photographed or and they said no pictures but i wonder restaurants should maybe start with if there's a no phone environment because i think i see those videos of people out in restaurants and some random woman will come up this happens like down in Florida these vacation place and someone will come up and they'll start twerking in South Carolina and and it's like if there's no camera i don't think they would do it yeah i don't either because it's not for the people around it's for social media land yeah all right that's it that's all for us today we'll play some tomorrow and we'll see you tomorrow no no go she has to my system or relation we just want to have freedom thinking i'm gonna never been gonna break my back for freedom bless we are living get back we are receiving all the seed when we all want to be free we want freedom i just want i want to be i just want i want to be i just want i want to be you"
