    "text": " Joining me today is an evolutionary psychologist, an author, and associate professor at the University of New Mexico. Jeffrey Miller, welcome to the Rubin Report. Hey Dave, great to be here. Good to be with you, my friend. I realize I've had evolutionary biologists on the show. I've had Brett Weinstein and Richard Dawkins. I've had psychologists on the show, Jordan Peterson. I've never had an evolutionary psychologist. Never. No, first. There aren't very many of us. How many are there? We're almost extinct. The big international conference, we get maybe 300 people. Versus a big neuroscience conference, we'll be 30,000. That's got to be a tough crowd. It's a tough crowd. We get a lot of flack from all directions, but I wouldn't want to do anything else. It's an awesome field. I can't imagine anything more fun than studying human nature for a living. Yeah. You're studying and I've written about so many incredible topics. I usually don't have to look at my notes when interviewing somebody, but you've had so many things that every now and again I am going to be glancing down because I don't want to miss anything here. Usually the way I like to start, this is just finding out a little bit of someone's history what brought them to the place of expertise that gets them in that chair. Just tell me a little bit about growing up, education, that sort of thing. What made you interested in all this? I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. I went to undergrad at Columbia University. I studied psychology and biology and just anything that grabbed my interest. I started out in neuroscience and I thought the brain's fascinating. Then I drifted into cognitive psychology, which is studying human learning and memory and perception and how we categorize stuff. Then I got really bored with that. I thought, I don't know, I'll go PhD in that anyway. I went to Stanford, started doing cognitive psychology. When I was there, I met these two brilliant postdocs who were working with my advisor, Lita Cosmities and John Tooby, who had just come from Harvard. They basically invented the field of evolutionary psychology right there at Stanford in front of my nose from the ground up. They were like, we're going to take evolutionary biology, anthropology, cognitive psychology, merge them all together and make this new science of human nature. Yeah, so let's slow down for a second. What does that synthesis look like? What does that even mean when they're talking about this? How do you take these things that are thought of as their own institutions and put them into one box? It's basically like the key insight is if you want to understand human nature, whether it's anything human sexuality or emotions or how we relate to other people or other groups, you can always ask the question, where did we come from? What challenges did our ancestors face in terms of surviving and reproducing and raising kids? And what exact structure did those challenges have? Like what was ancestral life like? We don't know every detail, but we do know a lot from anthropologists who've studied hunter-gatherers. We know a lot from primatologists who've studied chimps and bonobos and gorillas and the rangtans. And you can kind of triangulate on a picture of prehistoric life and figure out, yeah, like why do we fear certain things? Snakes and spiders and bears and whatever. Well, it's because there were certain selection pressures. Like if you don't fear those things, you die. Why do we look for certain things in mates when we're choosing sexual partners? Well, if you don't look for those things, then you have bad relationships and bad kids, etc. So it's a way of looking at the past to inform our understanding of the present. And that's not what most of psychology does, so it's quite a novel kind of approach. But I think we've gotten enormous leverage out of it. Was there pushback from people within each discipline going, whoa, whoa, whoa, we've got all the answers right here. Why do we want to put these things together? Because I would imagine there's always a certain inherent competition amongst all of these different disciplines. What if I told you that you could get key insights from the top four books you've been putting off reading? In the time it'll take you to finish this podcast, Blinkist solves your long list of must reads once and for all. Blinkist is the only app that takes thousands of the best-selling nonfiction books and distills them down to their most impactful elements. So you can read or listen to them in under 15 minutes all on your phone. With Blinkist, you'll expand your knowledge and learn more in just 15 minutes than you can in almost any other way, plus you can listen anywhere. Listen to Blinkist while you're driving to work and your mind is open, fresh, and caffeinated. The Blinkist library is massive from timeless classics like Think and Grow Rich to current best sellers like Tools of Titans. My personal recommendation is to check out 12 Rules for Life in antidote to chaos, because who doesn't want an antidote to chaos and you know that Jordan Peterson guy ain't half bad. Right now for a limited time Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience. Go to Blinkist.com slash Rubin to start your free seven day trial. That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T Blinkist.com slash Rubin to start your free seven day trial Blinkist.com slash Rubin and now back to the show. Yeah, evolution of biologists kind of hate it because that was going to be my next question since I know there's a couple of those guys. They're happy to go, here's how other animals evolve, they're happy to go, here's how the human body evolved, here's how the human immune system evolved. But once you get above the neck, then they're like, you're just going to make trouble for us in biology because that's where things get politically controversial is when you start explaining human behavior or individual differences or sex differences or human emotions or stuff like that. So the biologists don't like it. The anthropologists had a lot of the same issues. Like we've spent the last century trying to get anthropology kind of away from biology in a way. So please don't drag us kicking and screaming back into that. That swamp of controversy. But we just kind of plowed ahead and and I think it's been a big success story in the sciences in the last 30 years. So what were the things that were intriguing to you that had sort of bored you from the other discipline before that? I think the fact that sexuality is central to evolution of biology and evolution of psychology, it's how we get our genes in the next generation is choosing mates and having babies and raising kids. And if you ignore that, you ignore I think one of the core driving forces in human nature and human culture. Now most of psychology kind of ignores mate choice and sexuality and reproduction, except insofar as it's kind of like seen as politically relevant. So like you'll get a little bit on while there's sexual discrimination against certain kind of groups, which is important to address like gang lesbian rights and so forth. But they don't really see it as central to who we are and to what motivates us. So do you see it as the real pillar of what's motivating us? Like if we were sort of looking at this in concentric circles. I think it depends where you're at in life. I think for young single people, what we call mating effort, like the attempt to attract other people, whatever your sexual orientation, that drives an awful lot of behavior. How you dress, what ideas you adopt, why you bother to learn things, why you bother to get credentials. I think a lot of that is driven by mating effort. But then if you settle down and you're in a long terminoegamous relationship, you don't kind of need to do that stuff. But that's exactly when people get lazy. That's where people let themselves go. They don't say in shape, they dress more sloppily, they kind of don't bother reading serious nonfiction anymore. Why? Because a lot of that sort of creative display has already accomplished its purpose. So in that way, that's not in real conflict with evolution or biology, right? Because you want to look your best to get the best mating. So in that way, you guys are on the same track. So where does that deviate it? Well, so when biologists talk about courtship displays, and here's the power bird building its power, and we talk about ideological displays, and here's people showing off their virtues through virtue signaling, the biologists know exactly what we're talking about. And we know exactly what they're talking about. It's just often they don't want to get in the trouble follows if they kind of make these analogies too clearly. Have you had any of these conversations with Brett Weinstein? Not directly. No, I think I'm going to have to facilitate that one probably. That would be a lot of fun. Yeah, we'll do that for sure. So it's interesting. Okay, so let's focus on the sexuality parties for a little bit because it seems like so many things that we used to be able to talk about, we suddenly can't talk about, or that academics are self selecting out of and things of that nature. Now I said to you before we started, you're one of the few people I see on Twitter, I'm like, Oh, he kind of gets what Twitter is because you put out some smart stuff, you're kind of funny on there at the right time, you know, when to go with snark and all of those things, that to me seems the only way that you would be able to have any of these conversations online. I think social media is actually really good for addressing some of these very tricky issues like human sexuality and how it's playing out in the modern world. As long as you do it with humor and self-deprecation and a little bit of absurdity, which is what I try to do in my Twitter game. Because if you approach it like, well, here's the next paper on like sex differences or the next paper on how courtship works or oh awesome, a new virtue signaling paper. People will quickly tune out and often think, well, you're just kind of being doctrine heir here. But the thing you quickly realize if you study evolution at all is evolution is a very weird process that often produces completely absurd results. You watch any David Ottenborough natural history, you know, documentary and it's like these animals are insane. What they're doing is crazy and humans are no different. And if you don't have a sense of that absurdity, then it's very easy to get terribly, terribly serious and sensorious and ideological. And that really has a lot of that. Doesn't it's going on? That doesn't really help anybody. Yeah. All right. So let's let's pause on sexuality for a second. I don't want to get off that topic so to speak. But let's just do the two minute Twitter portion of the show, which is is there a evolutionary explanation to the way we're behaving with each other? Is there a psychological explanation to the way we act one way on this medium and another way on another medium? And how that has evolved because of the types of communication? It's a great question. And I think honestly, social media blindsided everybody. I don't know anybody in the 90s in psychology or any behavioral science who's going, here's what the internet is going to turn into, right? It'll become this massive global system of very rapid fire, interactive, snarky virtue signaling that drives everyone nuts and yet we can't give it up. Yeah, I may feel in K Dick probably would have thought that but maybe nobody else. Yeah. Okay, Dick, maybe William Gibson, a few other folks kind of had the insight, but honestly, nobody was derived and kind of from first principles. Well, we are a social primate and we love to gossip and we love to show off our virtues and our intelligence to each other. And therefore, obviously, there will be this thing called Facebook and Twitter and whatever. And it will play out in this way and moreover, it will revolutionize politics or culture in some way. Nobody thought that. So we can come up with post hoc reasons why that might have played out that way. But I wouldn't only do that with a very high degree of humility. Like, I don't know, I don't know. Now that we're here, you can kind of a little bit make sense of it. Well, it's almost like you can see the evolution of Twitter, you know what I mean? Where you now see people, I'd like to include myself in that, where they're trying to clean it up a little bit. It's like we all did this unknown thing of snark and everyone was trying to destroy each other and one up each other and virtue signal about the things we care about and all that. And it's like, now I'm seeing a growing group of people that are like, whoa, how do we deal with reality in the confines of social media, but maturely and honestly, and without just wrecking everything. And that almost strikes me as an evolutionary function. And it's evolution that's happening so fast and on such a huge scale. I mean, who could have predicted that the more amateurish looking a visual mean is the better it would spread, that's completely bizarre. Or the fact that I can get more engagement if I do a really surreal poll on Twitter about something where all four categories are just completely insane. People are more into that than they are even my starchy comment about political issue X or Y. So what does that tell you about the psychological state of how we interact with these things? Like the meme one's really interesting. It's not the slickly produced quick thing, really sharp looking images that go viral. It's a frog on a black and white idiotic thing or crudely drawn this or that tree or whatever. Like there's something really there to that about how we react to images. There's also something kind of charming about the artlessness and amateurish quality. It's almost like if I'm kind of fascinated by stand-up comedy and the stand-up comedians who are overly slick are never that funny. And the ones who are a little bit shambolic like Steven Wright back in the 80s. Hilarious. And he looks like he's always on the edge of complete failure or a psychotic break. And yeah, that's what makes it work or I guess Seinfeld's in the 90s. The show was also kind of had this artless quality. Yeah. All right. So let's jump back to sexuality now. Okay. It's getting harder and harder to talk about these. There's a set of people that think we're all exactly the same and then at the same time they're obsessed with all of our differences. I mean, this is what seemingly is the most potent idea of the day right now. What are the things that you're thinking about in the realm of sexuality right now that are intriguing? I'm thinking, I'm especially concerned about the fact that nobody seems to know what a successful long-term relationship is seriously going to look like in the early to mid-21st century. That we don't really have a script for that. We've kind of inherited the script of monogamous lifelong marriage, but nobody really believes that that is going to solve all of our problems. And people don't enter into that very early in life. They spend their teens and 20s doing casual dating. What is that? Nobody quite understands what the rules or the ethics of that are. And that at a certain point you kind of get tired of that and you find a partner and you kind of settle down and go, okay, we're going to buy into the wedding industry now and do the wedding thing and the ring bubble. But there are all these subcultures in America and around the world that are exploring all different aspects of sexuality and kind of how to incorporate new insights into relationships. Things like BDSM or Kink or polyamory and open relationships or the whole red pill manosphere subculture. And then on the other side of the book... What does that have to do with sexuality? Well, it's a certain way of men and women interacting, right? The sort of red pill vision of male-female dynamics is that there's a really deep sexual polarity, masculine and feminine. And if you don't understand that polarity, your relationships, if their heterosexual are going to fail and burn out and not be satisfying to either person. So there's a bunch of subcultures. They're all exploring different parts of human nature, human sexuality, different possible ways to run a relationship. And I think they all have valuable lessons that we can kind of learn and incorporate. Like even if you're vanilla and monogamous and straight and you don't believe all the crazy manosphere stuff, there's still important lessons there. And that's kind of my interest now is sort of going around and being eclectic and gathering those up and figuring out which of those might be useful. We all do it. We make those New Year's resolutions that we can't keep like eating healthy, going to the gym or slowing down. But what if 2019 is the year we all learn to actually slow down and be more mindful?

People stay in those scenes for a lifetime so I can see where somebody you'd be in whatever your thing is and I'm not passing judgment on anything. Whatever your thing is, you do it for a while and then eventually I guess it sort of is the venue sort of get tired of it so you move on to something more traditional. Is that just part of our psychology? Like nothing kind of lasts forever. Some people do that. Certainly there's a life profile of openness and experimentation where you try a bunch of stuff in your teens and twenties and a lot of it deviates markedly from the traditional culture you grow up in and a lot of that hurts and it doesn't work and it's heartbreaking and then a lot of people kind of drift back into the mainstream. On the other hand, you get people who marry young and they try the standard vanilla monogamy thing into their 30s, 40s, 50s and then go, this is not working. I need something different, better, more open, whatever. And I think it can go either way, the psychological research on all these subcultures is lacking. We don't know even which lasts longer of an augumous relationship or an open relationship. We don't know. There's not good data on that. There's lots of anecdotes. There's examples on both sides. But I think it's almost scientific misconduct not to ask those questions and instead to ask like, let's do study on which alcoholism treatment works. Let's do the 5,000th study on that before we do the first study on what kind of relationships last longest. So basically, because you think if we could address some of those issues first, perhaps the studies that we're focusing on related to alcoholism and the rest. Yeah. Relationships, satisfactions, really, really important to people. But it's one of the things that's not entirely taboo to study it, but it's pretty hard to get federal research funding to look at something that's kind of a cornerstone of American well-being. So when that New York Times article came out about Jordan Peterson and they said he was for enforced monogamy, which in effect just means marriage. And it had been used a couple times in the times before just to mean marriage. But everyone thought that man he wanted women in chains to be dragged around by their husbands. The argument that people that are forced monogamy or marriage basically make is that this is the best way to build a sort of functioning healthy society and that you can reproduce and have other generations and all of those things. You just think we don't have enough information basically or enough study on the information to know if that really is the best way to build a human society. Right. We don't know. There's good reasons to think that monogamous marriage has been important in every major civilization. It's kind of the most common way to arrange pair bonding. And I'm sure Jordan Peterson has read the same articles I've assigned even in my polyamory class that's about here are the benefits of monogamous marriage and there are many benefits of it. The question is once you have contraception, once you have safer sex and STI testing, once you have paternity testing, once you have a lot of other technologies, right, that can solve some of the same issues that monogamy used to solve, then what is monogamy still optimal? Probably is for a lot of people. Probably is for a lot of people. How much of it do you think just comes down to how you're wired? I think there's a lot of that. Some people are just wired to go, man, I just want a pair bond. I want my mate and I want to keep it simple and that's good enough for me and I will get a lot of a companion at love and attachment and it'll last a long time. A lot of people are very happy with that and that's great. But a lot of people either want more sexual novelty and variety or they have a higher tolerance for sexual jealousy or they just kind of get bored in long-term relationships. I think those people should not be prescribing rampant polyamory for the monogamists but the monogamous shouldn't necessarily be prescribing our way is the only way for everybody else. I wonder how this is all related to the gay community because I don't know the dare I mention the name Milo but when I had Milo on my show years ago, really before he was Milo on my show to speak, we had about a half hour chat on this where me as the married gay liberal and him as the unmarried gay conservative which is already sort of a flip on things. His argument was that he wasn't really for gay marriage because he felt that by being the outsider the gays have come up with art and creativity and music and comedy and all of that incredible like just gestalt of it all that made this incredible community like a diverse community in the right sense of diversity. And my argument was well you've got to at least give people the opportunity to be equal under the law so that they at least have a choice. I'm not denying that the gay community has come up with all sorts of incredible stuff but like you got to make them equal and then let them go either way on that. Do you think there's legitimacy to that and have you done or have you seen any studies on what the effects of the marriage on the gay community have been? I haven't seen a whole lot but I guess it's probably too soon. I mean my understanding and some of this comes from Dan's average right is that a lot of gay couples have a kind of monogamish relationship where it's like we're parabonded we love each other but there's also a negotiated agreement that we can have outside lovers once in a while under certain conditions that we kind of mutually agree to. See it's funny I hear that all the time and I don't know and the gay couples that I know that are married or you know really together I don't know ones that are like that or at least that I know that they are like that let's put it that way. But I know that this is something that's tossed out there so we can go with this for... So but I'm sure there's variety and I'm sure that there's also kind of social assortment right so that the more monogamist gay or lesbian couples will kind of be more comfortable with each other and they might know those crazy monogamish folks down the road. Or you just don't know your friends that well I mean anything's possible yeah. Yeah and honestly it's not that different from like the way even heterosexual relationships work in a lot of Europe where a lot of those are tacitly monogamish and there's a sort of understanding that monogamy doesn't necessarily mean sexual exclusivity for either partner. America is extremely puritanical and kind of rigid about that and we think anything that happens outside the pair bond is almost by definition unethical and there is research on sort of anti-polyamory stigma where people actually are more prejudiced against people in open relationships than they are against almost any other group in terms of orientation or race or religion or anything. That might be gradually changing but I think it's a it's a huge social problem especially among Gen Z and younger millennials. Yeah where does the trans part of this all fit in because I remember years ago when everyone started saying the LGBT community I remember thinking I have no more insight into the tea part of this than a straight cisgendered heterosexual male would you know what I mean? I just I don't. Maybe I have somehow slightly a little more inherent empathy by being an outsider at some level but I don't have any more knowledge of it and now it seems like the trans issue has almost superseded all of the other issues at least in the last year. I mean everywhere yeah everywhere you go there's you know every time I open the Twitter search bar it's another trans story or you know someone's being fired for this joke or that. What do you think happened there that catapulted this so quickly and what are the issues around it that we're kind of afraid to talk about right now? It's a really complicated topic but I think I think like the legitimate issue about trans is there are people who are trans or feel trans and they want their rights respected and that's totally legitimate and good for them and raising awareness about that is fine. There's a much larger group of people who I think are using trans issues as a kind of wedge to destroy the gender binary or to kind of muddy the waters or basically as a weapon to beat up evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology to say there's no such thing as sex really there's no such thing as biological sex or sex is totally dissociated from gender etc. So when someone says that the next time someone says that on Twitter what's the answer that the person watching this should give? That maybe Twitter is not the best one for it. I mean male and female are evolved strategies that exist because over thousands of generations they were like the paths to successful reproduction. If you're not clearly male and functioning as a male or you're not clearly female and functioning as a female you're a genetic dead end. So selection hammers against any ambiguity there. So it's not surprising that the vast majority of humans alive today clearly identify as one sex or the other. It doesn't mean everyone should it doesn't have any kind of moral implications about that but just descriptively it means there is a gender binary and it evolved for good reasons and everyone who teaches biology hopefully knows this and it shouldn't be that controversial. Now if we want to like genetically engineer people and use CRISPR and whatever to destroy the gender binary for the 22nd and 23rd centuries we could do that we could talk about that. I don't have any particular attachment to the kind of male-female dichotomy ethically but I think descriptively it's really important to kind of accept it and to go it's here it's valuable to understand and we shouldn't necessarily try to pretend it out of existence or pretend that we're doing it in the name of trans rights. You can have trans rights without saying there's no such thing as sex. So this gets to the heart of what I think is really happening in this country right now which is everything has become politicized to the point that the experts in the field seem afraid to talk about these issues. You right now are taking a risk by talking about these issues. Are you seeing this across the board? Are you seeing this amongst colleagues of fear to talk about these things? Yeah absolutely. Now the vast majority of people like at my university don't really touch upon anything that's particularly politicized they're just teaching civil engineering or law or immunology or whatever and most of that isn't really politicized yet however. Yeah it is the key word right? Yeah right. I mean you get a little bit about what's the gender representation in certain fields but in my department in psychology you do get almost everything having a kind of political edge and I have colleagues who are frightened to teach certain classes. Like I teach psychology of human sexuality and I'm pretty up front and outspoken about what I cover and what my view is but a lot of my colleagues will not touch it with a barge pole because there's so much risk that students will just get upset about one little thing you say and complain to a dean and then you'll get called into the office and so what would be that type of thing but beyond what you just said about the need and the evidence of gender differences what are the other type of things that just talking about are scaring the academics? It's very awkward to talk about sex differences in any mental traits or motivations or preferences it's hard to talk about sexual coercion, rape, date rape, harassment, stalking, etc. That was being incredibly difficult one at college. Yeah yeah it's hard to talk about aggression in general either between individuals or between groups and how that relates to sexuality like why hunter-gatherer tribes go to war right it's not typically about land or food it's about women and that doesn't fit the kind of Marxist picture of prehistoric warfare right and then if you talk about stuff like pregnancy, child care, parenting are you being you know overly pronate a list and sort of family values for talking about that stuff is that alienating to certain students who might be homosexual or infertile or adopted kids or whatever but it's so interesting because I obviously hear these types of stories from academics all the time not only in here but but online and people email me all the time and it's like god we've failed I mean the university really have failed at that point like if you're afraid to talk about child rearing because that might upset a gay person yeah Jesus I mean what's left at that point it's so frustrating and it means I feel bad for the students but I also feel bad for the parents who are often footing the tuition bill because the parents have faith that if I send my kid to a state university and I pay tens of thousands in tuition and they take a course on topic x like human sexuality that they're going to get professors who are willing to profess to say what they really think and often they're not getting that so there's a kind of bait and switch where universities are pretending to be these bastions of free speech and inquiry and honesty and in fact everyone's kind of running scared and these kids are not getting our best insights they're paying money but we're not delivering the service how much of an infection not just in the classroom do you see this as but I think correctly for more I think you've written around 110 published papers is that right did I get the exact number right is it a hundred more or less more more or less you lose count at some point I'm sure you're well aware of the Peter Pelosi and so-called hoax that it's not just what's happening in the classroom that's causing the chaos but it actually may be what's happening before that related to all of these papers that at certain disciplines basically have I don't think I'm overestimating they almost have no standards yeah at this point that that is got to be just incredibly frustrating for someone that actually has published some things legitimately it's kind of frustrating but I can see you don't get frustrated easily but like it doesn't bug me as much as maybe it bugs some other people partly because I spent a lot of my undergraduate years taking courses on critical theory and I read a lot of Derry Don Foucault and Lea Tard and all those French dudes and one reason I loved those courses is it was so easy to get an A by writing a kind of bullshit paper using the right terms and using sufficiently obscure syntax right that so I know that game God that's real very well it's really real and it's great fun I understand the appeal of that stuff it's just I can't imagine spending my adult life doing nothing but that and that's what's happening in a lot of the humanities so it like if those folks want to do that and get paid typically not a very good salary to do that I don't it doesn't really viscerally find me the only danger is when is when they turn into activists and they give people like me grief based on not understanding what I do yeah well I would imagine a lot of it just then leaks into your classroom and then and all bets are off it's weird it doesn't actually leak in like when I teach human sexuality right the kids have a sort of vague um political correctness that they've absorbed mostly in K through 12 public school I think but if you actually ask them have you had any courses on gender feminism no have you heard of any of these leading figures from critical theory or history feminism or even history of gay rights I know nothing about so it's not like they've been indoctrinated at least not in big state schools but they've kind of soaked up some stuff from high school I think that influences how they interpret everything this episode of the Rubin Report comes to you with support from our friends over at Bravo Company Manufacturing in the Second Amendment the founding fathers guaranteed an individual the right to protect themselves owning rifles and awesome responsibility and building rifles is no different started in a garage by a marine veteran more than two decades ago Bravo Company Manufacturing or BCM for short builds a professional grade product which is built to combat standards this because BCM believes that the same level of protection should be provided to every American regardless if they're a private citizen or a professional Bravo Company Manufacturing is not a sporting arms company they design engineer and manufacture life-saving equipment BCM assumes that when a rifle leaves their shop it'll be used in a life or death situation by a responsible citizen law enforcement officer or soldier overseas so quality is of utmost value to them every component of a BCM rifle is hand assembled and tested by Americans in heartland Wisconsin to a life-saving standard BCM has always put people before products they build their products because they feel it is their moral responsibility as Americans to provide tools that will not fail the end user when it's not just a paper target but someone coming to do them harm because of this BCM knows that making reliable life-saving tools is only half the story they also work with leading instructors of marksmanship from top levels of America's special operations forces to learn more about Bravo Company Manufacturing

shiny blue shirt let's talk about evolutionary aesthetics cool people don't talk about aesthetics yeah that much but you think that sort of the things we're looking at in the west or maybe not as exciting as they should be and that there's a problem there is that fair to say yeah I've been really into art for a long time and I think art and beauty are important particularly the places people live and work and I think as humans we kind of deserve the best from artists interior designers um stylists whatever architects that make our lives as pleasant as possible and I think basically ever since about 1910 art and architecture has failed and has not done a very good job of delivering visual environments that are actually humane and appealing and enjoyable and that kind of promote mental and physical health what happened around 1910 modernism man um if you look at the way domestic architecture worked up until about that period it was all sort of human scale and arts and crafts and there are places you'd want to live where you didn't have to be educated into a particular elite notion of what a house should be in order to appreciate it right and then you get the Bauhaus international modernism white structures crisp hard lines um bad acoustics and suddenly that becomes the fashion right that becomes what people think are is the future and nobody likes it yeah but it's kind of imposed pop down by the elite you must live like this like it or not is that top down from the leaders that just that often those things are just easier to build probably and cheaper to build or maybe that's the same thing actually well the irony is like you could have taken cheap easy to build reinforced concrete structures and built a lot of awesome cheap houses that were okay or you could do the traditional route but instead what you get is every house must be distinct and must have its own shape and there can't be any um standardization so the houses end up being expensive and experimental and hard to maintain and they leak and everyone's miserable so they're not really serving the needs of the the people at large they're just great for architect egos yeah it's interesting because i just spent a couple months bouncing through a lot of different countries in europe and you know especially on most of these countries because the history goes back so far you see incredible architecture you see even you know i see chairs that were 150 years old and like the woodwork that would go into it and the craftsmanship and it was like i don't think we could do this today or if we could do it today this would have caught this chair would be in our dollars it would be like a six thousand five hundred dollar chair where then you know this is what a guy did it took him a couple days and he could sell it and earn a wage and it's like we've just the economics of everything have gotten out of whack yeah and like nice table here and this slab probably is the new slide you clap it on the table right when you walked in so i know you mean it yeah um i've made a few pieces furniture in my day and that that's pretty cool but yeah it was a visual art in particular um the economics mean like abstract painting just is so much faster to do than representational painting right if you're a young aspiring artist and you want a career and you want to give your gallery a certain flow of work that they can sell it's a lot harder to do that if you're doing representational paintings that take a hundred three hundred hours then an abstract work that takes a tenth of that so the economic pressures that are also in that direction yeah um but people have um kind of voted with their feet and like they don't like elite abstract art they don't like conceptual art um but is like the word the right word they just don't they just don't know or it's conditioning or it's that we all like to like what everybody else likes sort of thing i think everybody knows that they're kind of supposed to enjoy going to like while we're visiting this city we should go to the contemporary art museum and they get there and there's a bunch of terrible video art and there's a bunch of very puzzling conceptual art and they read the little descriptions on the walls and they go this makes no sense because it's written by an art curator for other art curators and it's all completely alienating and that's that's sad because it means they're being told this is the highest expression of your culture but it's completely inaccessible to you so what uh what do you look at that gives me some excitement or can still sort of renew your spirit let's say well there there is a movement of kind of neo-traditionalism in in art where there's certain places like New York Academy of Arts that are actually teaching students how to draw and paint and sculpt and and do the sort of traditional um skills that people associate with art um it's just a little hard to get a foothold in the like the New York or London gallery system if that's the kind of work that you do um but my hope is that like the Bay Area billionaires will start collecting that stuff I think the Chinese art market is has got a real thirst for good representational art and I think that's going to start to dominate the art world pretty soon so what's the evolutionary need for a good art I mean what's the psychological I mean I know you're okay there's an expression of something that can't quite be said but what's like the driving force behind that so yeah on the one hand there's why do we bother to make art on the other hand why why do we like certain kinds of art and there's been a lot more research on why do we like certain kinds of patterns and colors and forms and compositions and whatever but there's no sort of unified theory of aesthetics in fact I would say there's more good stuff published on that topic between about 1870 and 1920 than since because that's when people were sort of very inspired by Darwin evolutionary aesthetics was a field there were dozens of books published on it and then modernism came and everyone forgot all that how could this be connected to the earlier topic which is sexuality so for example my gay male friends generally speaking have a much better eye for art or for style or for fashion yeah you know you could get away in that crew you know what I mean like you got a nice thank you on you got a nice shirt like that you know what I mean that is a compliment like where again just broadly speaking it's like my straight guy friends all kind of wear big shirts and they don't know exactly how to do their hair and they're you know so there's some connection between sexuality and artistic vision I think that's absolutely true and it's not what you would predict from first principles it's really weird if you look around at other species the males are typically much more ornamented than the females they have the amazing plumage and they do the incredible songs and dances and the females are usually kind of drab and and not that aesthetic the powerbirds that make these incredible kind of insulation works that's all the males then you get to humans or at least american males american straight males and it's like can't you even find clothes that fit or like colors that is the big jerk and like what is up with your house you know and when I did the um i joined jordan peters and so to the copies to tell people clean their room yeah so I have no idea why gay men have better taste than straight men I think that's a fascinating there's some there has to be something going on there um but I think men can level up obviously because like british and european men aren't as hopeless if you grow up a young man in italy you kind of absorb some ideas about style and even the british um kind of aristocrats land of gentry class have a certain look that it's a bit traditionalist but at least there's taste I don't know if this is going to quite make sense but we almost getting there say ten years ago with the rise of the metrosexual yeah then it sort of crashed because I guess maybe it relates back to what you said the beginning about where we are more puritan so there was this idea there was this like mocking of them like they're just gay but don't want to admit it or something like that and that whole thing seemed to crash like there was this little brief window where straight guys were like dressing better yeah had cooler haircuts or something something well even five years ago when I lived in new york for a little bit and uh hung out a lot in brooklyn there was sort of that was peak hipster in in brooklyn and the guys there the straight guys put a lot of effort into grooming and haircuts and authentic style and this or that is in fashion and I thought this is really cool this is like a europeanization of male taste and culture but it was also very masculine it wasn't sort of like late 70s disco culture or early 90s rave culture or or burning man culture you were sort of more old school masculine school like I want to go to a proper barber and get a proper haircut and like it's all flannel and boots and whatever and I love that stuff but I think it kind of had its moment and evaporated on and it just in case they just priced themselves out of the market and broke the problem yeah yeah or they just got all too busy on twitter well that it always comes back to that let's talk a little bit about me selection regardless of your sexuality there seems to be this new thing right now where if you're not open to dating absolutely anyone under any circumstance as no matter how they look or how they take care of themselves or whether they brush their teeth or whether they have a penis or a vagina or any combination of anything but if you are just open to anything there's a pretty loud and growing voice out there that is trying to frame everyone as a figure which is the reverse of what choosing a mate really has been about it's insane I mean for 500 all right I got you I got emotional Miller there we go 500 million years right our vertebrate ancestors have been choosing the mates selectively because that is the highest stakes decision any organism makes is who do I recombine my genes with right and so all the way through the core dates and the vertebrates and the mammals and the primates you get particularly females being choosy about you know who they breed with who sires their kids but then as soon as humans start doing pair bonds million two million years ago and the males start investing more in offspring start forming longer term relationships then we also have incentives to be choosy about our female mates and so this is the one domain where if you have even a shred of libertarian in you or you respect freedom of association at all or you think it's okay to care who you spend your life with and like what kind of children you you create then mate choice should be a kind of domain of freedom right like this is a good place to be prejudiced so to speak right like you should have some you should just be discriminating yeah have judgment um discriminating taste and you can always be open to the idea that maybe the current set of criteria that I have maybe could be nudged or improved or tweaked or maybe I'm subject to certain stereotypes and maybe I could overcome those true of course people tend to get better at mate choice in their thirties than in their teens but for someone to start lecturing you politically like you shouldn't be attracted to women you should be attracted to anybody or any any kind of being or in what any species any age like no let please let me be attracted to I'm attracted to because that should be like the the pinnacle of human freedom yeah if you don't believe in freedom anywhere else you should believe in mate choice freedom it should be a fundamental human right I think and where you get horrible totalitarian societies really infringing on mate choice freedom like you're not allowed to marry that person or you know you have to do an arranged marriage to that person we kind of recoil at that and go that's horrible and yet in America we have busy bodies the virtue signalers um telling us your mate choice criteria are too narrow so where do gay people fit in all of this then at a biological or an evolutionary perspective you've brought up the point of passing on genes many times now gay couples or gay people whether you're a couple or not don't do that at least biologically speaking so what what do you make of that condition is that even the right word now i'm going to get i'm going to get us both in trouble probably just for me asking the question let's call it a trait trait traits pretty neutral okay all right traits pretty neutral well here's a fascinating thing about homosexuality is people have been developing or trying to develop theories of male homosexuality and it's kind of evolutionary origins and functions for 30 40 years and there is no good theory of it yet it's a complete mystery i've never seen any compelling explanation of male homosexuality so so what would be a compelling? a compelling argument would be okay there's costs of being like exclusively attracted to your own sex and therefore not typically having as many kids but there's some counter-vailing benefits of some sort maybe benefits to your extended family or benefits to your group or something else but nobody can make the math work enough to kind of explain that female bisexuality is much easier right you can go well as long as a woman is sometimes attracted to men enough to have kids then also being attracted to women might be no cost at all or it might even be a benefit in terms of social networking making friends sex is a great way to make friends if a lot more males were bisexual that would be equally easy to explain it's the exclusive homosexuality that's very hard to explain it certainly exists it exists at a you know a percentage that's much much higher than you can explain is just well it's just mutations or it's just maladaptive that won't work so this is where i'll be kind of epistemically humble and say man i have no idea huh it's an it's a fascinating problem maybe somebody will crack it within 10 or 20 years right it's interesting because if you were coming at it from another perspective like a religious perspective let's say you would find that to be a moral quandary that then you could extrapolate all sorts of different judgments on but i can see the way you answered it's like just is the thing yeah maybe we'll get more data on it but it is but what do you make of the fact that there are seemingly many more bisexual women where i don't know any gay couple that one of the guys is sneaking out a night to bang a woman you know they've never heard of that but you have heard of obviously straight couples where the guy is you know on the dl or whatever yeah yeah well my girlfriend diana Fleischman has a whole theory of female bisexuality that's that's to do with the the social networking benefits but then the question is yeah why don't demand do that too because like if if you're a guy and you kind of swing both ways then like doing gay sex can be a great way to make male friends also and it's well now i know we have our our promo for the show and so in a way the quandary isn't why do any male homosexuals exist the quandary is why aren't all males and females bisexual and do you think some of that years from now we might look back and go whoa that's just societal pressure it might be i think certainly there's a huge amount of stigma against male bisexuals from both sexes but especially women female bisexuality used to be stigmatized maybe 30 years ago not so much anymore yeah so it that could change what what are some of the other topics that are that are really on your mind these days let's let's hit up effective altruism yeah let's talk about that um i don't know if you've had many guests on talking about effective altruism but it's not a time actually it's sort of my hot topic of the last few years so it's a social movement a moral movement it's some of the smartest young people i've ever met and their basic goal in life is do the most good they can based on reason and evidence rather than sentimentality and virtue signaling i've done a little bit of this sort of in an anillary way with some of the libertarians that i've done yeah yeah and so the kind of major domains they tend to focus on are things like how do we get charities to be more effective at reducing global poverty or promoting global public health how do we overcome factory farming and be nice to animals and promote animal welfare and so a lot of the effective altruists are vegan um for ethical reasons and then a lot of them are focused on just survival of the species how do we reduce existential risks to humanity like nuclear war bioweapons um and artificial intelligence risks so maybe the most distinctive thing they have is this kind of ultra long-term perspective that's like we are just these transient little beings the thing that really matters is what does humanity turn into how long do we last do we colonize the universe or do we fail and the folks who think most seriously about that think it's actually that lasting minimizing existential risk that is absolutely crucial and everything else is just kind of fluffin' bullshit so is this where like the transhumanist crew would sort of fit within this is there a risk so I love this stuff because I'm a sci-fi guy every I mentioned Philip K Dick before I mean every one of his stories or books are about the inevitability of all of these things is there a risk though of always looking at what's beyond the horizon instead of going on right now I don't really think there's a risk unless like the vast majority of humans became effective altruists there's already so many people who are obsessed with um you know diversity and equity and inclusion and economic growth and all the ordinary problems that politicians talk about that's covered this already a lot of smart people working on that the the big neglected topics tend to be the kind of science fictiony topics where you need a sort of cadre of genius aspies right to work on it when nobody else is taking it seriously yeah well speaking of the aspies that's that's an interesting one if we wanted to get into one that's a little a little controversial as well um what is that all about that so many of the creators now or the people that are coming out of the tech world even though you can obviously make plenty of arguments that the tech world is now in this sort of implosion and certainly not the creative place it was yeah say ten years ago but that so much creativity came out of a world that had so many people that were seemingly uncreative mm-hmm I think it's fascinating um I sort of identifies moderately aspies myself kind of high functioning asperger's and I've written some stuff about how um neuro diversity issues like being aspies kind of rub up against free speech issues because like people who are aspies don't always do a good job of understanding the beliefs and desires of other people and particularly what they might find offensive right so they might just say something so they might just say shit and then be really surprised that it was distressing to someone and so if you have a model of speech that says you must never cause offense that assumes you can anticipate what will cause offense and a lot of people can't anticipate that because their brains don't work that way so you either need to say okay aspies you can never say anything or cut them some slack and say we understand you'll offend people once in a while but that's okay because that's you just that's part of your deal man I've never thought about this but does this somehow explain what's going on in Silicon Valley right now you have a bunch of people who are somewhat socially awkward let's say yeah created incredible technology that allowed us to all connect but then when voices that aren't supposed aren't supposed to that's a horrible way framing it when voices that are a little out there or a little contrarian or whatever that might include us actually get out there the only way they can deal with it is to shut that voice off or something like that like which is why we're seeing so much de-platforming and silencing right they have to be overly systematizing about they have to be like oh man I can't I can't navigate these gray areas if I'm running a social media platform or patreon or whatever right so I'm gonna just have a hard and fast rule that says if I get enough complaints I de-platform that person or I don't know the difference between porn and erotica and just slightly sexy art so I'm gonna say no nipples or whatever that's a kind of aspie response to getting blowback from people where you like you don't really know why they're upset so in a weird way if you have a bunch of the creators of Silicon Valley that are coming from that world and then you suddenly bring in a bunch of executives that come from the social justice world that really shows like a that's a match made in hell right it's just matter anti-matter yeah it's um it's terrible and what I hoped would happen is that maybe five or ten years ago it seemed like like tech is dominating culture generally and tech is dominated by aspies so hopefully aspie values uh-huh of being kind of tolerant and eccentric and nerdy and like getting weird little enthusiasms that that would kind of trickle down and create a more tolerant culture is that what you would have predicted say ten years ago yeah really and instead you have the opposite you have the the social justice activists taking over and basically saying all of that quirky freedom that you you ask people value we're going to legislate that away you you can't have that um and it's it's tragic I hope the pendulum swings swings back but as long as the leaders of the social media platforms don't have the guts to say look this is our people outspoken eccentric slightly socially oblivious people and that's okay and the rest of you just have to kind of suck it up and deal with it that's what they should be doing yeah it's interesting I'm at the point with all this and you know how frustrated you have been with youtube and twitter and patreon and the whole thing I'm really at the point of this where I actually believe that that solution is gone I don't think it can come from the top anymore I really don't believe that I think that thing has become so corroded that I would say the only way it can come is now from the bottom and then the people will basically rise up against these things and I know that's like it's sort of high in the sky because what does that even mean do we all sign off on the same day do we all you know whatever that means but I almost see that as the only way to do this because they've had we've done everything else or or the government will get involved and that certainly rings all the bells that I'm not happy with on my libertarian side yeah I I think at least in terms of universities the only solution to to some of the university problems is the government actually saying at least to the public universities that are in principle bound by the constitution you guys have to obey the First Amendment yeah or you lose federal funding I think that's the only leverage yeah and I was really kind of hoping that POTUS would do that at some point in the last year or two I'm pretty disappointed that he hasn't won a weird way he almost benefits the more that they go against there right yeah because that feeds his base of yeah aggrieved and politically correct yeah you know that they see political correctness running amok yeah something like that all right before we finish up give me give me one thing where at the beginning of 2019 right now give me one thing that we should be sort of thinking about that we're not thinking about right now I love the thought experiment of like once Elon Musk succeeds and we start colonizing Mars what what are the relationships and social structures in the Mars colonies gonna look like I'm fascinated by this this issue like yeah that's cool are the colonies gonna be like communist utopias are they gonna be libertarian aspirational states are they is everyone gonna do monogamous lifelong marriage is it gonna be crazy polyamorous kinky stuff I think it's great to think about this stuff before we attempt it and I think Mars is gonna be this amazing experiment we're like this colony gets formed based on these social and sexual assumptions and this one gets formed and this one fails catastrophically or or it like it doesn't work well enough and it just borrows the organization of this other place so I think it'll be this incredible kind of behavioral science laboratory and I can't wait to say that's not too far from the way the america was set up right that the states were supposed to be those places of experiment yeah um it's yeah it's the way the east coast was 200 250 years ago and I think um the difference now is the colonies will be able to communicate with each other and with us and be able to measure a bunch of outcomes and deliberately experiment and I think we need to kind of get out ahead of that and start like rereading all of our classic science fiction and figuring out how is this gonna apply for reals now now that we do it yeah which is so related to why you think art is important because fiction is just as important I mean you realize it all ends that eventually they figure it out they have their tea party and then we blow them up like yeah but they do beautiful art nouveau like domes in the meanwhile yeah Jeffrey I'm so glad we finally did this and let's do it again for sure and if you want to see a good combination of bright smart thought and snark on twitter follow Jeffrey at prime o poly"
