    "text": " I'm Dave Rubin and joining me today is a senator from South Carolina as well as the author of the new book America a redemption story choosing hope creating unity. Senator Tim Scott finally welcome to the Rubin report. Well thank you David it's good to be with you thank you very much for having me I look forward to our conversation we have lots to talk about but the good news is I'm excited to finally be on the show. Thanks for having me. Well it goes both ways we've been trying to get you on for quite some time the schedule is having quite matched up but here we are so let's dive right into it. Yes sir. Because I want to talk about the book but obviously want to talk about current events and election and all of that stuff and you know some of the things you're doing right now but first the general point of the book is positivity it is decency it is something that seemingly everyone talks about but nobody does particularly well I include myself in that sometimes I try to do it I often fail can you talk a little bit about how your life led you to writing something based on that idea. You know Dave the America redemption story is a book that I see as a positive view of the world as it is not as I hope that it will be and the truth is that what I learned through life is that the pain that I've gone through has helped to clarify my purpose that my obstacles have become the opportunities and frankly the mess I made of my life has become my message so the truth is that yes it's a positive book but it's not one of those pine and sky hoping that something will be different than it is it's the reality of what is there is a way for us to bring forth a positive message in the midst of the chaos and frankly I'm sure we'll talk about inflation and some of the other challenges that we see today as the kid who grew up during the Carter years I thank God Almighty for Ronald Reagan and so the truth is that I learned why I love President Ronald Reagan because of the misery of high inflation even higher interest rates and scarcity not a mentality but at the gas pump so the truth is that when I think about the hardest times I've seen in my life somehow some way a silver lining appeared and that book talks about that silver lining in race it talks about it with the former president it talks about it in winning and losing elections it talks about it through this economic challenge that we're going through right now so I find the silver lining when it's there when it's not there I just tell the blunt truth that it's not there so so it can be tough to find the silver lining with so many of the things going on right now between inflation and supply chain and the war not war in Ukraine and all bunch of other stuff but do you think do you really view us in that Jimmy Carter moment right now which maybe could cause you know sort of a red pilling of Americans the average American that didn't realize that maybe big government doesn't work and printed money doesn't work and the rest of it well Dave you're you're a you're right big government has not worked and we have a history to prove that it doesn't work inflation is lead by this one concept that you talked about spending money you don't have buying things you don't need how do we prove that well one point nine trillion dollars on a covid relief package with one percent for covid vaccines that led to pouring literal gasoline not little figurative gasoline on the fire right give them give them some time when they're getting rid of your research yeah and then you go one point two trillion dollars after that in an infrastructure bill that had 10 percent for rows and bridges over the next five years you you follow that up with a seven hundred and thirty nine billion dollar plan call reduction inflation reduction act and it's really the inflation acceleration act and not only does it in cell accelerate inflation but it actually adds more fuel to the fire by having the IRS come through your file so to speak targeting people under two hundred thousand dollars a year so the truth is this is like the Jimmy Carter years in that gases I inflation is I an interest is creeping up and that's a problem that causes a recession when combined with the overspending in Washington so anytime I have a Republican on congressman senator doesn't matter I I basically ask one question always which is do you think they are doing this intentionally do you believe that they think this stuff works or is this you know what people are calling sort of like a calculated implosion day that's a great question I can't say that the the rank and file Democrats have a strategy to have the economy implode because of the pressure of inflation the pressure of interest rates what I can tell you is that the strategy to slow roll interest rate increases had a lot to do from my perspective of people being up for reappointment it had some to do with trying to satisfy the the whims and the wishes of the Biden administration and that combination rather intentional or not led to an acceleration of inflation in a way that we haven't seen since the Carter years so I don't imagine that they have a grand design to completely destroy the American economy I do think they have a grand design to change the very DNA of the American people when you look at what's happening it's undeniable that what is clearly happening is a centralization in decision making and in spending when you take the power and the money and you put them in the same place that is by design and that is bad for everybody outside the beltway so when you talk to or or if you talk to say a Democrat governor maybe I just fled California now I live in the free state of Florida if you were to talk to Gavin News somewhere if you have talked and we're just one of the Democrats who chill up in New York Whitmer whoever it might be yeah I mean do they think what they're doing is good I mean putting aside whether it works or not I mean just the intention I am still I'm still unclear on this I just can't figure it out well Dave I I have to hope that their intentions are good I don't know the mind of the person so I try my best not to decide whether their intentions are good or not but what I can tell you is that if you're living in California or Illinois let me say this way Dave and the words of the CEO of McDonald's headquartered in Illinois they are very concerned not just with the taxes but with the violence they literally say people are overdosing in our restaurants that violent crime is happening in our restaurants if this is the Chicago and the Illinois that is in our future we're concerned that we can't stay that should have reverberated throughout all of the country and specifically in Illinois governor Pritzker should have said OMG McDonald's is now speaking out about the crime McDonald's is speaking out about overdoses in their restaurant whatever I am doing in this state I should apologize and quit or if I'm not going to do those two things apologize and do 180 degree turn in the opposite direction here's what we know works we know that rule of law works we know that objective standard for the rule of law being applied equally works we know that no bail doesn't work we know that defunding the police doesn't work we know that creating tribalism doesn't work so if we know these things don't work why does Gavin Newsom not know that why does governor Pritzker not know that I don't have an answer for what's going through their cranial cavity I can tell you it's time to stop yeah so and that's why I asked you sort of the same question in two ways because when you see 350,000 people flee California which is what happened last year you think Gavin might go I don't know maybe this has something to do with my policies but okay ran to Texas from California I mean yeah on muscas now in Texas I mean there are some breadcrumbs being left by some really smart people they should just pick them up and see what they lead I keep telling people I would have paid an entry fee to get into Florida I don't want to give that eye now I that was a Floridian I'm okay with that idea but you know it's all right so I want to talk about the Protect Kids Act because you are leading on this from a legislative standpoint related to all of the gender nonsense but before before we do that let's do one other social justice thing according to my notes here you are black is that my mother and my father have confirmed the fact I am black okay well well wait a minute senator according to mainstream media you can't be black in republicans you know I have tried to figure that out I looked at the polling information and the polling suggested there's 82% chance that I'm black but the chances are 100% here's what's happening and this is really simple anytime an African-American who happens to be conservative starts making common sense on TV the left must and nullify the very existence of someone they wished was a unicorn but I am not I am real I am not a fairy tale I am actual really here in front of you the truth is that the most dangerous site they've ever seen is someone who actually fights for the very people they say they represent and produces results like opportunity zones when you think about bringing poverty to the history of america 2019 think about the fact it is the year that the private sector invested 29 billion dollars through opportunity zones in those marginalized communities leading to an 8% increase in wages a 20% increase in property values which closes the it shrinks the gap between the haves and the have-nots and oh by the way it led to the lowest level ever recorded for poverty that scares the blue dickens out of the blue the left it's a strange thing but it works we have the proof is in the pudding black conservatives that stand up for folks living in marginalized communities represent something that msnbc and sometimes CNN they just can't stomach it but here we are they can't you know I don't know if you know this but I campaigned with alongside Larry Elder when during the california recall and I would open for him at some events and you know I'd read the headlines and they'd say you know all the supporters are white supremacists and he's the blackface of white supremacy and i'm out there in front of thousands of people waving american flags cheering him on and they're calling them the white supremacists like man you gotta get the watch this here's the funny thing is here's a guy who ran for congress in 2010 against the son from Thurman in the birthplace of the civil war Charleston and because of the evolution of the southern heart I sit now as the united state senator for the great state of south carlana if we were talking about racist not supporting candidates of color I wouldn't be here nor would a successful west leehan who won his his primary in texas by the way primaries are typically republic primaries are more white than the overall population so if you want to test the theory of race and politics go to places like texas or or Charleston south carline or john james in michigan and you start noticing there's a trend that people actually judge you based on the content of your character not the color of your skin ask meira flores or young him or michael steel and you'll get the same conclusion that americans are far more interested in what's on the inside than we are the outside but democrats the tribal nature of identity politics requires them to start on the outside and use these these these these characteristics to come to an artificial conclude consistent with the very theory of progress we are the land of opportunity we are the place where hope breathes eternal do you think it's possible that republicans or conservatives whatever you want to call right leaning people was it a was it bad messaging on that side or was the messaging of the left just so effective to create these untrue memes that you're describing because it's not i can tell you as someone that was left in my whole life came across the aisle now and it's like i meet the most decent loving open actually more open-minded even than the purported open-minded people i mean that's one of the things i found to be quite interesting is the definition of any words used in politics today like the inflation reduction act actually increases inflation or the fact that you hear people talking about the republican party being a group of racists or deplorables and the truth is when the guy from the black lives matter a leader showed up at the trump rally they gave him the stage i mean yeah so they applauded him for the things that they agreed upon and they didn't boo them they they treated him with respect and deference on the areas of disagreement he was stunned and we say in my office shook us which is a tims got internal phrase for i can't believe that happened so literally what we find happening all across the country is people of good intent they welcome debate they actually welcome disagreement what they don't welcome is indoctrination what they don't welcome is you telling me that because of the color of my skin i'm gonna press her or you frankly telling me because of color of my skin i'm a victim both are offensive but people of good intent they don't judge you based on these superficial things they judge you based on how the heart responds to the crisis of the moment all right so speaking of the crisis of the moment let's talk about your protect kids act i've done a ton here on the gender stuff obviously all the woke stuff first off how did this even get to your desk is there an issue a real issue with this in south carolina are you just kind of modeling this off what the santis is doing down here or how did i get to i celebrate all the governors around the country who take very seriously the importance of relationship between a parent and their teachers and governor de santis has led on this and we should give him a lot of credit for doing so what i've seen across the country i've i've been focused on school choice and empowering parents for the last nine years i love the model that uh jeff bush had and rick scott had and now ronda santis has in in florida but the truth is that governors throughout the country including kim rennels uh in aila they're all focusing on school choice and one of the reasons why is i had this panel and i i had parents from around the country one from virginia come down to trolson south carolina and she says to me i need basically a foyer a freedom of information act request just to get a copy of my kids curriculum i can't get into the school and then you hear these parents in aila and in virginia who are concerned about their kids being indoctrinated from a gender perspective i decided that the problems are not just in one state they seem to be in many states so one of the things that makes common sense to me is the parent is the person who should be in the biggest most powerful position possible in making decisions for their kids big labor unions and bureaucrats are in the way of those parents making the decisions and then working with their teachers to carry that out i want that to be nationwide not in one or two states where the governors are taking that issue seriously every single state when you're talking about a 12-year-old the parents should be engaged in the decisions of their kids uh that's just common sense in my house so where i grew up i wanted to be common sense all across the country when you talk to the democrats in south carolina and you bring this up and you talk about transparency and okay the power back to the parent did any of them get it i mean again i guess it sort of gets back to that other question we talked about but to me something about the one with kids maybe is a wake up sort of like what we saw happen in virginia with youngkin winning uh when it didn't look like he was going to win just a couple weeks before the election absolutely i'd the parents do i think parents democrat parents get this issue as well as republican parents this is an issue that actually unites parents across the board in south carolina they were stunned by the developments across the country as it relates to your ability to have a gender identity group and to have teachers feeling like they're forced to provide instruction that is just antithetical to what's in the best interest of a child to exclude the parent from any conversation around those very important topics and so this legislation would pull money away from schools who refuse to comply with what the law by the way of the land already is uh minors don't make decisions in a vacuum that requires a parental supervision to make those decisions i have to reinforce that by pulling the money away so that we can make them pay attention to what the law of the land already is i always think it's funny because i remember when i was a kid if you if they took us to the zoo or something at school or we went down to dc you'd have to have a parental slip but somehow now you can literally talk to a kid about gender identity privately and hold it for six months it's not center i should have asked you but i should have just googled before i started how old are you if you don't mind me asking because i think we're roughly around it's my birthday i am 57 today's your birthday yes sir i said what can i do to celebrate my birthday and the only thing i could think of dave wow half my people call you and beg you to have me on today this is pretty sweet man this is pretty sweet all right so you're 57 57 right that's you're by 47 i would be 46 so we're close enough you're you're sort of on the i guess that would be like the high end of gen x i'm kind of right in the middle of it but do you think the reason i ask though is because as i'm listening to you and and as i've you know heard many of your speeches before uh it seems like the message that you've got and you're literally your age that you are not in your late 70s 80s where we're being governed by all of these people that it seems like our generation was supposed to take the reins and somehow we missed it did something happen there that skipped us over in a weird way you know that's a great that's a really great question i am one of the older generation x-ers that's true i will say this i don't know what quite happened by the way i'm not sure if we were too many were asleep at the wheel and just missed that opportunity i think we should be fully engaged in shaping this country i think we have enough experience enough education enough nixon bruise is to look back and help those who are coming and to look forward and to know what we should take from our parents and what we left on the sidelines so i think we are in the perfect age range to help recalibrate this country for its best output yet what do you make of the the general thing that's happening across the country which is that the states really do seem to be going in very different directions i mean i feel like i live in a different country honestly i don't mean that to be from california florida you from almost a different country it seems like i mean literally you know 3 000 miles but truly it feels like a different country obviously if you live in south carolina that's going to feel very different than living in new york kovid exacerbate a lot of that are you generally okay with that concept well i listen i think we've had uh we've had very unique and interesting times in in american history where the states felt a tension that at sometimes was not healthy and that we overcame that i i do think we're in another one of those moments where we're seeing the states divide amongst themselves naturally i mean the good news is when you can work and live where you want to you move from california to florida you know or you should have stopped by the way in south carolina and called it home we say those folks who move from like new jersey to calif to florida and then they come back to south carolina that's what typically happens over time we call those folks halfbacks i was all the way down they went all the way down to came halfway back so jricky haley did a number on me too it was on the list it was on the list honestly i have family in florida and that really was like the final self they can move up in south calina too no problem we have room for for your family as well we like red voting cards they're very first i have a newly registered republican for the first time in my life i had 46 years i love it so all right so let's do a little bit uh uh projecting going forward here obviously these midterms are coming you know most conventional thinking is there's going to be some kind of red wave the incumbent party never does that well in the midterms uh what do you think is going to happen what do you want to happen well if i had my brothers we would win the senate with about two or three seats to spare uh we would have the house with about when i came into the house in 2010 i think we had 63 new seats in the house uh that was a banner year without any question if i had it my way we'd have that kind of a red tsunami what i think is going to happen i think we will control the house at the end of this election and there is a decent chance that we can control the senate as well we need to execute on the field the the game is coming down to the last two minutes the score is going to be close to tie tied and i want to make sure that when you give the ball as a quarterback and you turn and you give your ball to your running back i'm i'm hoping that Herschel will be jumping over the the the the goal line in the air with the ball secure no fumbles and wins back georgia and i'm very confident that Ted Bud will will do a foreign out and score on his two two-minute drills out there and i'm hoping that dr. Oz will be the coach on the sideline and drawing up the play and and will execute as he was the harvard quarterback so maybe he'll roll scramble to the left and and he hit the receiver for a three-year score and and then jd advanced i know he's a good author so i'm not just a play football but he can kick the extra point hex fire and win that i gotta tell you i'm more of a basketball guy but the references are all working i'm uh follow up good good i'm about done because i started with Herschel i know nothing about basketball but maybe we can just get jd advanced in the dunk the ball uh after someone else spikes it i'm sure you don't spike a basketball you don't spike a basketball all right so but okay so if that happens let's say you get something close to what you want even if it's even if it's not that that you know three senators over etc but you get some of that exactly what do you think changes here what do you think honestly changes well the first thing that should change if we control both houses is that we start oversight we an oversight objective to reign in this very unwieldy group of democrats running this country in the abidin administration they need oversight like a three-year-old needs a parent to say don't do this literally we need to bring the oversight hammer down number two we have to be the party of parents the one thing that is manifest today throughout this country is that school choice and parental involvement is now more important than it's ever been before i think it is 67 percent of democrats 68 percent of the independence 70 percent of african-american 74 percent of Hispanics 80 percent of dual income working families all support some form of school choice after looking at the devastating learning loss and the precipitous drop in scores we have to lead for parents that's the second thing we should do and the third thing we have to do in my opinion is to control our southern border and build a physical impediment it is a national security risk it is a fit and all and drug risk and it is two and a half million illegal cross-state in the illegal immigration risk and finally what is obvious to all of us if you just turn the spending off i believe inflation comes down in a real and manifest way if you start talking about tax policy that makes sense and and predictability in the regulatory state people with certainty and predictability they go back to creating jobs they go back to making sure that they're making long-term investments that helps to spur the economic engines in a way that attracts jobs back to america and high-tech manufacturing and the stem future becomes ours i know that no senator wants to be asked this much less on their birthday but uh i mean the national ambitions well like it's it seems like you fit in there mad i mean it just seems like the message the tone as i said the age like it seems it seems right to me you know uh they've i'll tell you my national ambition is to travel this country for the next seven weeks and my home state in order to win the majorities in the house in the senate i am a guy that i figured out one thing several years ago applying for jobs is the worst way to get a job the best way to get a job is to do that job like no one's ever done it before and that's one of the reasons why in the last three weeks or so i've been to florin's and mertle beach and columbia and charleston and anderson south kalana as well as rock hill and i'll be in greenville and spartan berg and columbia again in the next couple weeks but i'm also in aiaua nebraska uh wisconsin michigan tennessee florida uh georgia and north kalana in the last just few weeks and i'll do more the same in the next few weeks because i believe that the most important thing i can do with my time and my good health is to invest it in the future of america because one day there will be kids like yours running this country and we need to make sure they start off looking at the city on the hill that doesn't have an on accident and i think for the last few years we've thought of that is that the sort of scariest part of what's going on that we seemingly have given up just what that flag right behind you represents just almost like that like we just don't i know we do and the people watching this but so much of the ethos of america seems to have given up on that dream and that aspirational message you know there's there's something about and i don't mean this to be negative and i don't mean this to be insulting i just mean it to be real this concept of being a global citizen where everything is all merged together is really unhealthy for the united states of america the thing that has always been a part of american exceptionalism is not standing apart only it's standing above it's leading the world not being a part of it i want to help other countries succeed beyond their wildest imagination but that starts by having america succeeding beyond our wildest imagination we are the standard when the standard becomes average the world becomes subpar senator i'm going to let you go because it's your birthday and i said a half hour and we're right there what do you do on your 57th birthday besides hanging out with dave rumin i mean what's going on tonight i assume i assume you're getting out of the office in a minute you you know i am i'm going
