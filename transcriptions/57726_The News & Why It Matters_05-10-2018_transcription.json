I always worry that he's too young I hate to give you advice on it, I don't know how comfortable you are with guns in your home I come from military family I may not have one, but it's like biometric safe, very careful that, you know He doesn't know that it's even there So I have, from around that age, that's about the age that I started teaching my kids Because we do have guns in our house and I've taught them, you know, you never point any weapon at anybody Even a Nerf gun, you never point at somebody They learn that from a very young age, my kid could break apart my Glock when he was, yeah, about six years old And put it back together, but he's more safe than probably 90% of adults that have just gotten a gun And are messing around with it, so I personally think that's very, very important Wow And Jean-Carlo, before we get into it, I want you to just tell the audience just a little bit about yourself in your background Sure, so my name is Jean-Carlo Sobo, it's awesome to be here and sharing a beer with you guys Cheers Yeah, I'm 35 years old, born and raised in Miami And I work in public affairs and communications, helping companies communicate throughout Latin America My background was actually in politics, I started out working on democratic campaigns earlier in my career And then over the years I transitioned to the private sector And now I'm just over these past few months with everything that's been going on I've been increasingly worried about this sharp move to the radical left within my party And I'm just trying to pull people my way toward a more sensible center, if you will I need to ask security how we let a democratic film film That is unbelievable, it must be stopped Alright, I want to get into the latest on Kavanaugh, but just as a caveat for the audience There are still a lot of moving parts right now at the time of this taping So I'm sure you may be listening to this at like 8 p.m. and something's completely different But as of right now, the close show By now, Karen Toph could be in the Supreme Court, we don't know Yeah, no, it's been a crazy day, watching the book come down live on the radio show today 51-49 You know, the moving parts there, there's four really that were questionable Mansion as the one democrat who kind of crossed the aisle and voted with Kavanaugh Mr. Jim Murkowski from Alaska went the other way, voted no And so it was 51-49 as the final vote, Collins voted yes, Flake voted yes As we go forward, as you point out, you know, this is really in It's constantly moving at this point, but what we expect to happen is this vote to hold There is one really weird wild card, which is Steve Daines from Montana Who is going back to his daughter's wedding, and it's a weird thing We kind of talked about this a little bit on radio, and that My first reaction is like, this is a big deal, this is a Supreme Court justice, right? You need to figure it out, I always say this about, you know, I'm an Eagles fan, I love football, I love baseball You're in a world series game, you're in a Super Bowl sort of situation You're at the game, like this is your thing, this is what you do However, when I really stopped and think about it, and I thought about my daughter, Ainsley, like, if it's her Wedding, I screw America, I'm there, like, that's really my top priority So I really kind of have come to the position that I really like Daines for this Like, I like the fact that he's like, you know what, it's my daughter's wedding and I'm going to it That's a normal guy Yeah, like, that's what you should be as a father, right? Like, this is really what's important And in the end of the game, like, 51-49, without Daines, 50, it should be okay You know, even if we get a switch or whatever, they can wait the boat out, and it should be okay, even if he comes back to Washington I mean, Kavanaugh should get through, I think we'll find out later on what this actually means, you know, I mean, you know, look, Clarence Thomas went through this, right? Clarence Thomas went through a very similar process, he was approved 5248, but he was approved 5248 at a time where they could have thought about it The Democrats decided not to do that, they could have at that time, they let him through with only 52 votes And, you know, obviously I believe that was the right thing, Thomas I think has been a very good Supreme Court justice And over time, that does fade, but there is a situation where we have really turned this institution into a political animal And, you know, it's not really what it's supposed to be You know, I don't fully understand Kavanaugh's approach when he comes to going on Fox News and writing op-eds for the Wall Street Journal I don't know if that's the right thing to do, I mean, I kind of would like him out of it, but I understand his instinct to describe himself Right, exactly, and that's why I kind of give him a pass on that, is I can't even imagine if people were calling me the things that, you know, I mean, a pedophile Yeah, which is, that's not even a magazine Right, exactly, right, that's what I'm saying, like, so I'm getting smeared that much That's going to be my natural reaction, too, is to come out and be like, hey, I'm a human I'm an actual person that you're talking about, and I didn't do these things And that's the biggest thing here, I think, where the left overplayed their hand is not treating him as if he was a human I really think Murkowski, Collins, Flake, we're all very gettable on this I mean, like, with this sort of situation, there's a bunch of unknowns, we don't know what really happened in that room that, right, million years ago You know, they were gettable, but they played, they overplayed their hand by so much They made it so ridiculous, they convicted him without any evidence And I think that made people like, you know, Collins, who is not a conservative Stand back and say, wait a minute, what standard am I setting here for America if I vote against this? What am I saying to, you know, every, you know, little boy in America as they grow up? I don't think that she might have gotten gotten She was definitely gettable, and she might have gotten gotten I'm still not completely convinced that she is not going to flip I don't know, she could have just voted yes, because she could come out She's called, I think, a 3pm Eastern time press conference I don't understand why you would, like, why would you, if you voted yes, then why you... She's the only one, I think, calling a press conference We were taking this slightly before then, so we don't know the outcome of it, you may know at this point But, I mean, it is a weird approach, for sure I just don't understand Yeah, where I'd say, like, my team really overplayed a tan was with Michael Avenatti And then parroting his accusations, I mean, those accusations, look, I went to a private Catholic school too And I could appreciate the culture a little bit In terms of, like, hey, this is, you know, it could be a little bit fratty sometimes, right? But to allege that a group of 15-year-old boys were running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school That an adult, she not only went once, then she continued going, like, at least ten times Oh, look, they're gang rapping, I think I'll come back Yeah, see you next time The punch is so good, I have to be sure Which, again, that was one of the other accusations, spiking the punch, because usually you go to these parties Punch is just Hawaiian punch with no alcohol, that's a normal part That's what they go for Punch a high school part, isn't it? Did the high school, like, homecoming committee cater to these parties? Punch? Yeah You're not gonna have punch unless it's... They're making this guy kind of seem like, like, Biff Tannen when in reality He was more like George McFly in high school This guy was a dork, he was like a jock, like, a dork, you know? Well, an Abinadi is a disaster, he's one of those people, anything Abinadi touches turns to dust, right? Like, he is... Is that the fecal touch? He does, he does Everything he touches, not the mightest touch, fecal touches It's slightly different, yeah, no, it's true, I mean, you know, and people forget, there were, there were, people talk about it There were, people talk about the Ford allegation, and that's the main one that's, that's probably obviously she testified in front of everybody But there were five allegations against Kavanaugh One person who went on Twitter and recanted their allegation One person who wouldn't even sign their name to it One person who was an Abinadi client who was making ridiculous accusations One person who said they saw it in college When they went to the person who was supposed to confirm this, they themselves said they had no idea of this allegation And then the fourth thing where we've seen the lack of evidence there I mean, even if you believe the Ford thing, which is highly questionable at this point You know, we have to remember that there's four other allegations that have basically gone up in flames And, you know, we want to believe the best about people, we want to believe that, you know, if you're Ford, why would you come forward with this? Well, there's a lot of a line, there's a lot of motivation there And, you know, I mean, I hate to say it, but I mean, you pointed this out yesterday and we've seen in letters to this effect today More and more, it seems like this was an accusation that she made And I don't know what happened to her in her life, we don't know But this accusation seemed to have the stench of politics all over it from the beginning And, you know, even though she was convincing in her testimony, she has nothing else other than that And that's what's kind of interesting here We, you know, I said this before these testimonies happened We have a Supreme Court Justice here, we have someone who is supposed to decide massive constitutional issues And we turned it into performance theatre Here are two people going up in front of the country, who's going to be most convincing? One person is very emotional in saying something terrible happened to her, another one who's very angry and saying, I did not do this That is not the way to decide constitutional issues here You know, we turned it into anger versus sympathy, that's emotion versus emotion Neither one of those things, no side of that should have emotion attached to it And making, you know, sort of logical, constitutional decisions on this And when it comes down to it, there's just not enough evidence for anyone I think to really make a concrete belief When it comes to believing, ford, or any one of the five accusers Yeah, and before we get to break, I do want to bring up just because you kind of touched on it right there The latest on the ford testimony and all of her statements that she had given Was that, you know, as we know, Leland Keeser, she named as a witness to this party And Keeser, of course, said that she was not a witness and she did not, she said no, this did not happen Well, apparently, ford's other friend, Martha McLean, who is former FBI and then who else did she, she worked for Chuck Schumer And Pre-Bara And Pre-Bara, so she's very politically connected with the Democrats So she apparently was someone who went to Leland Keeser and asked her to please clarify her statement Just kind of prodded her to, hey, you know, you didn't really give her enough backing, I think that you need to change your statement That was released in the FBI investigation, and apparently the FBI obtained text messages between Leland Keeser and Martha McLean So at this point, you really have to be thinking, okay, something stinks here Because when you've got a friend of hers who is very politically connected, going and telling someone who did not corroborate the event That, hey, you need to help her out, that doesn't all add up It's a bad look Yeah, it's a really bad look And we're about to see a lot more of that, I think, to gracily wrote a letter to her to Ford's attorneys Saying that they want all the communications between all the different accusers, Ramirez and SWEETNIC SWEETNIC So obviously something that must have come out in the FBI investigation, he already knows, now he wants it on a record Yeah, all right, back in a minute I just believe everything I've got about this, that's kind of an awesome thing, right? I got that shit feeling weird Oh, you're okay Glendback is coming live, to talk about the right path forward, and to make fun of the people standing in the way We might not be able to save the country, but at least we can all go down laughing Glendback live, be addicted to outrage tour, on tour this fall Oh hello, I didn't see you there, I was busy drinking my wine You're drunk Before we get into the rest of the show, I want to make sure to thank our sponsor, my Patriot Supply So emergencies happen, right? We've got hurricanes where you could be flooded and lose power We've also got you gentlemen, if your wives go out of town, who's gonna cook? Yeah, there's a good place down pretty well And so you need food, and we can't expect you guys to get up off the couch Oh god no, I cook in my house, I just want to Do you? My fiancee is the cook, too Oh really? Yeah, it's amazing I don't even know where the kitchen is in my house, okay If society breaks down however, Uber eats does not deliver That's true, I think Jason's wife was out of town for like two weeks A little while ago, and the kids were so tired of having pizza, was it pizza every night? Well, they got so tired of all the places that Uber eats delivers from That's what they got sick of Please stop it So you can either use my Patriot Supply as it's intended for emergencies Actual natural disasters, or you can use it for when your wife has to leave And you're just too lazy to make food, it stays good for 25 years And guess what? Now you can get a two-week emergency food supply for $75 That includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner So that's kind of a no-brainer, and that's way less than you would spend on Uber eats For two weeks? For one meal, let's say Uber eats Even if $5, that's a steal You can go to preparewithnews.com That is preparewithnews.com Jason, you said that it was an interesting anniversary Yeah, the way things line up sometimes It really makes you, well for me, I'm a religious person Things just, I don't put it off the luck or to happenstance I always see usually a spiritual element in it So we are having the biggest thing that's happened I remember when I was a kid, I was a political science major in freshman year in college And I remember they were saying this is history This was so big, they were talking about the Clinton impeachment Wow, I am old That was crazy So they were talking about the Clinton impeachment Well nowadays I get the same feeling from watching the Kavanaugh hearings And it's huge It's front and center, it's the ring of the circus It's crazy Well this date is the same exact date the Me Too movement began Wow October 5th last year Exactly the same, same date It's been exactly 12 months to the day Now, let me caveat this, we're saying Me Too movement, right? It started off very, very serious Everything it's wine, it's horrible It's backed up, it's corroborated, there's evidence for it And many other cases that will come out of this will be, you know, a positive It's good that there's a spotlight on this because of this However, there has been some not so...how do you put it? I don't know, I don't think everything No, it's impossible that all of these are, I think a lot of these are like Kavanaugh's There's been, to date, I don't remember the exact number, but over 400 It's 420 something, accusations made Over 400, now, and those are just the ones They're not just like from notable celebrities These are notable, okay, right? These are notable, these are like the wine size I'm saying, I've seen way more than that, don't Twitter or something So the number is even, but the number is double Once you, it's well over 800, once you start going into the lesser known It's just insane And it's kind of like, it's just where we've gone from to where The Me Too movement went from being something very serious, something we actually should look at Look at, to you are guilty because you have been accused of being so You are the accuser, so now we are going after your head And we are going after you to destroy who you are, your reputation, everything about you And I just thought, in my mind, I was like, it's crazy that at this point We are seeing basically the culmination It was almost like it was served up to us on a platter It's an actual perfect example of where we've come from Where we are now, this is where we're at You were looking at my beer or something like that No, he's got a pumpkin in there I'm like, I'm not getting that In the middle of that point, I was like, wait a minute I was like, wait a minute, cause I was here early Oh geez, sorry about that But it was a perfect example of where Me Too has devolved into What it has devolved into, it has devolved into this thing Where this person is guilty with no evidence whatsoever But we are going after him and everyone is calling him Everyone is calling him a monster and the other person a victim Based off of nothing Where do we find the balance on this? Yeah, I think show me specific instances of sexual harassment And of sexual assault and I will stand there with you Show me evidence, there was plenty of evidence in the Roy Moore case, for example I don't think any of us looked at that and thought, oh this hasn't been corroborated Because it was corroborated There were a lot of people, I will say, just because I like to try to be objective At least here at this table There were a lot of Republicans who excused all of this corroborating evidence And I think we were the ones who said, you kind of have to look at all of this and say, yeah, he probably did do it Yeah, but we didn't, but there were Republicans who did defend his behavior And I spoke out against them at great lengths Yeah, Me Too, right? And so I think it's important to look at a case-by-case basis And not judge by guilt based on association or guilt by gender So I think, like, in the evidence in the Brett Kavanaugh case You have to approach it with a prosecutor's mind, a dispassionate prosecutor Who just looks at the cold hard facts, right? When you follow the evidence, it does not point you in the direction of guilt That doesn't mean that you can't oppose Brett Kavanaugh because of ideological reasons or philosophical or whatever But you can't call the guy a rapist, it doesn't make sense Yeah, there's nothing virtuous about collective guilt Cusing Brett Kavanaugh because all white people are bad There's nothing virtuous about that It's not something you should be proud of And we kind of have come to this point where, look, there have been a lot of accusations, a lot of real things And I think we can come to something really good out of this whole moment And I hope it's going forward instead of looking back I think so far we've focused on, like, hey, what happened in 1978? That person who did that thing in 1978 should be punished Or that person who did that thing in 1982 should be punished But, Mike, more importantly, we should look at what's the truth going forward And if we can come to a point with the sort of MeToo movement Where we say, hey, back in the day, there was maybe pressures against women who didn't want to come out Because it was really tough for them and they maybe did get blamed And maybe they did get treated unfairly and weren't believed in powerful men were able to squash them Let's end that, let's get rid of that going forward and say to women today If something like that happens to you, please go to the police We're going to take you seriously, we're going to look into your claims and take them seriously And hold, no matter how powerful they are, the men responsible, if they do that Because the only way to actually litigate these things is to actually have evidence Ford could be telling the absolute truth, there is no way we can punish Kavanaugh for it at this point Because we have no evidence, we have no witnesses, we have no idea what happened And she also had corroboration on Kavanaugh's side I think that there's definitely a path forward for this, I think it could be a good thing Although it's horrible for Dr. Ford, her life has been ruined just as well And they're going to kick her out as soon as they can It's horrible for Kavanaugh and his family But I think one of the good things that can come from this is we have seen Of all the numbers that I just threw out, the 400 plus accused, over 800 doubled Those numbers are easy to find, the numbers that are hard to find are convictions No one reports that, I couldn't find it this morning when I just did a really quick Google search No one's reporting on the convictions Hasn't even been convicted, right? Right, but I mean, but what we haven't seen is one of these things fully play out Okay, you've been accused, let's get a bird's-eye view into the courtroom And see how these things actually play out We've seen it with Kavanaugh, which I think is a very, very positive thing going forward We've seen it, look, there needs to be a burden of, they need to show evidence In these cases, you can't just convict him, dish off of an accusation And if it sounds and looks really bad I mean, it's positive in the sense that so far, again, as of the stapling so far It seems that justice and truth and fairness has prevailed But there was still a large part, you know, all Democrats minus one still voted against this guy And are still smearing him, and to me that's a little bit scary Really quickly, John Carlo, so how do you think that this is going to play out for the Democrats in November? I think in some districts, in some congressional districts, it's going to play favorably But I think as a whole, particularly in some Senate races, it's going to energize Republicans Yeah, I feel like it's going to help them in the House but hurt them in the Senate Yeah, do you think that's accurate? Yeah, I think that's fair It might help them in some swing House districts, but in the Senate seats that are in play right now It'll boost the Republican challengers Alright, back in a minute Yeah, one more thing was that there has to be some kind of consistent standards There's no...

It runs on its own, right? We just need sensible regulations and people can move the economy forward Through their own individual incentives That is great news for the country, regardless of who's in office, right? I know what Trump's going to take credit for it Great economy, you told me You know, and I know a lot of people in my side are going to say it was all Barack Obama Whatever, who cares if we get credit? It's great news for the American people and that's like something that all of us should be excited about Especially if you're talking about a family that was unemployed Also for minorities, black and Hispanic unemployment is at an all-time low That's awesome Yeah, it was a 3.7% for unemployment overall, which is incredible And I think we need to get back to a place in which we all sort of recognize that the President doesn't run the economy by himself It's really pulling levers Yeah, exactly, you could really look back at Barack Obama's last couple of years And they were really strong with growth and job growth as well as Trump's first couple of years But it's not their responsibility Like Donald Trump took, you know, office on January 20th That doesn't mean that he was responsible for every job that came in in February It's a ridiculous standard because we build these people up into kings It's the exact thing we ran away from I don't know if I remember this 1700s, we kind of ran away from the king thing And I wish we could get back to that because the story here is no matter how much we screw it up Capitalism brings us to a point, you know, over time Where things are really positive We've brought a lot of people out of poverty globally, billions of people out of poverty all over the world This is a really good thing and it's almost hard to screw up Yeah, unfortunately though, I feel like this story has been buried lately With all of the Kavanaugh stuff that's going on, I had a heart A lot of stories have Yeah Alert investigation, having one of that thing Roastings of humor and Rosenstein? Yeah, I don't even know what happened to him You brought up the year anniversary of me too And when you're going to that, I was thinking about, you know, one month ago what happened? One month ago today? There was an anonymous op-ed written about how evil the children were Oh, wow, that was a month ago It feels like it was like 1974 That's crazy Like the anonymous op-ed saying that there was like the resistance inside the Trump I remember how big of a story that thing was I mean, it just feels like ancient history now And we never found out who it was, which is amazing And apparently we don't care anymore Yeah, I was not So Orrin Hatch was kind of bombarded Yeah, you know, I felt like this is like the ultimate addicted to outrage moment You know, Glenn's book is out, now he can get it in stores, please do But this is interesting Now Hatch is trying to respond to you, but look at Look at the, I want you to look at the protesters here The protesters are just dying for a moment they could be outraged about No matter what he says, no matter what he does They just want to find some meaning in their life Some way they can get a viral video of screaming at a senator Watch this Don't say it, please, everybody Why aren't you brave enough to talk to us and exchange it with us? Don't you wave your hand at me I wave fire hands at you When I grow up, we grow up You and I, you talk to women that way This is embarrassing It is! I'm laughing I'm laughing I'm laughing I'm laughing I'm laughing This is a screwed up world when we have videos that are making me like Lindsey Graham and Orrin Hatch I don't like this world But it's interesting, first of all they say He goes, I got it He's just saying, I got you I know what you're trying to do Shrink it, Lee I get it And they're like, don't you wave your hand at me I'm waving my hand at you Like, why are they offended by him waving their hand at them If they're already waving their hand at him Right, like, when's yelling at him? Right, they're the ones yelling And then he says, look Even when you grow up, I'll talk to you Oh my God, did you say women have to grow up? I mean, it's obviously all they're looking for is that moment, right? It's not real, you know, I mean, look, I think there's something kind of quaint and likable about the idea that people in the halls could just walk up to these guys as they get on the elevator There's something I like about that But like, it's not real, there's not real discussions going on there It's like trying to get this viral moment It's trying to just scream and shriek at a senator And it's just fake And it's just as fake as politics You know, these protesters who go to these places are just as fake as it is in politics And, you know, he didn't do anything wrong there He didn't do anything that was horrible Anything that would make you shriek for five minutes at an elevator It's just, it's not real And I think people... I'm gonna let you in on a secret It's a Twitter secret Okay Or in Hatch's Twitter account Oh my gosh, it's really a lit line It's a new supplement It's a person who runs his account Like, I want to be best friends with that I know, you're so good Did you see the fun dip or in Hatch? Yes I died Someone did a poll that was Who do you like better? Cocaine Mitch And then they said like, Cocaine Lindsey Graham And then there was another person who was a cocaine someone I think it was Chuck Grassley Cocaine Chuck Grassley And then Orin Hatch's office wrote Fun Dip or in Hatch So fun Yeah, they did a good job with him He kind of like makes fun of himself for being old and like... Remember when he tried to take glasses? Yeah, exactly That's pretty good And they did a good job with that Alright, so there was a poll That came out on theblaze.com That showed almost half of millennial Democrats Identify as either socialist or democratic I'm in the other half Oh, thank you Nice, there we go I guess it's fine to let you into the building So what's your take on that? I don't know what's happening I mean, I think part of it is at like my generation So I'm 35, I was born in 83 by the time I started having like my own thoughts Cold war was over So I think, I don't think these people Grew up understanding the existential threat That existed in the world During the Cold War And also, it was very, also like very present To me because my parents were Cuban Because I grew up in a family of people who like fled Can you tell that story really briefly? Because I think it's a very compelling story Sure, so my mom was actually born in the US But she was raised in Cuba Because they had to go back to the island To care for an ailing grandparent And then she was stuck there for like 20 years And my dad was in the Bay of Pigs invasion And his dad, my grandfather, I never met him Because he died in one of Che Guevara's prisons So I grew up having that very present in my life And being extremely skeptical of socialism And so did, I think most people in Miami We understand that Because we have Venezuelan, stick-roggins And people from all over Latin America But you know, like most of my generation Is completely detached from that So when they think socialism, they think Oh, Denmark Or, you know, or like, hey, like, you know, like, I smoked pot When I went backpacking in Amsterdam And that's not what socialism is, those are like capitalist countries Yeah, they have nice welfare states Which I think we can debate those issues But that's not socialism, socialism is something different And the people who are actually really pushing socialism in this country Like, groups like TSA, they know what real socialism is And that's what they're pushing But they're pushing it under the guise of Oh, we just want the US to be more like Denmark Yeah, and they added democratic Right, right Democratic socialism, so it's different Yeah, it's super different, it'll work this time Which is the democratic socialism It's the exact same label that Hugo Chavez used In Venezuela, when he was alive in that Nicolas Maduro uses now So those of us who are like, our families Are from Latin America, we know exactly When they say democratic socialism We know exactly what they're talking about And we don't want none of that Yeah, it's not worked out so well for now There's also a democratic people's republic of Korea Also known as the North Battery Yeah, Jason, tell us about manufacturers Okay, so this kind of goes along with what you were talking about with the economy But the National Association of Manufacturers Otherwise known as NAMM is a like to call They just released a survey that they did Of all manufacturing companies in the country And workers and everybody High, you know, from the executives on down And this is 92% of them were favorable for the coming year On output And how many jobs they're going to create Raising wages, everything They are very, very confident And it's a huge bull market for them And supposedly this is the only, this is the highest it's ever been Their enthusiasm for this year Is the highest it's ever been Since the NAMM or NAMM Has been doing this survey And they pinpointed specifically the tax cuts And deregulation As why they're saying that it's going to be so great This coming year Which I agree with, I don't know if you agree with that But I tend to agree with that But there's something that I don't agree with I think they're kind of jumping the gun a little bit There's several big warning signs That they should be looking at For one, the new NAFTA Or USMCA or whatever That is I think in the very beginning Might be positive for them But eventually as goods start becoming more and more expensive That's going to hurt them Now it may not happen initially, but that's going to happen Over the next, I don't know, would you say 24 months or something like that? This is just a guess Tariffs, is this thing going to continue to go? Because if the tariffs continue to escalate With places like China or the EU, then again It's going to make things more expensive to make here in the United States Which again is going to hurt their output And it's going to hurt jobs It's going to hurt everything as far as US manufacturing So anyway, I hate to rain on the parade It's good news that their enthusiasm is high right now I think it will be great for them to start off with But there are a lot of big warning signs that we have to look at And again, it all boils down to our ridiculous trade policy right now Yeah, well, it comes to I think To the government choosing winners and losers Like if you go back to the Obama administration Like they prioritize things like solar power And clean energy And so those parts of the economy were optimistic And I think Trump does, I think, prioritize manufacturers here in the United States I just don't think these are workable policies, though I mean, you look at the new NAFTA thing Gives us access, I think, to an additional 0.34% of the dairy market Which people are talking about, like this is this big thing However, the tariffs that we put on China They put reciprocal tariffs on us That have talked much more Multiple times as much as far as damage to the dairy exporters That were going to China So, like, so yeah, we can set a little bit more to Canada But we can't send that amount And we're wind up getting hurt overall With this stuff going to China You know, these agreements are I don't think we, I don't think it was a disaster, right? Like, I think what Donald Trump wanted was to be able to say He got rid of NAFTA and we can call it the USMCA And honestly, at the end of the day, I'm fine with that If he takes that as a win and leaves it pretty much alone, I'm cool with that So you're a rebrand? Yeah, exactly If he wants a rebrand, I'll give him the rebrand, we'll say, hey, good job, they're done And if everything works out, fine, I think we need to open up these markets Because one of the big problems I have with this whole trade agreement And I think we've talked about this a little bit Is, you know, we were supposedly putting these giant tariffs on Canada To renegotiate NAFTA Well, we've renegotiated NAFTA, and all of those tariffs still remain Like, this was apparently not a negotiating tactic This is stealing aluminum are still intact It's still intact, and it's a real problem It's causing us jobs It's causing real damage to our overall economy And in an environment where we have 3.7% unemployment God only knows what could happen if that worry went away Yeah, and I think one of the big concerns that I have on this Is that the new administration that's coming in Mexico now Is pretty left wing Yeah, yeah So what's going to happen, so this president that they currently have, Enrique Benoniento He's going to try to push this, his congress as quickly as possible And he's got the votes, but then you're going to come down to the implementation, right? So what's going to happen then, and also Mexico's tax system is one of the most complex in the world So we can have this free trade system, but if US companies doing business in Mexico Mexico also has to reform their own tax policies Because it's one of the most, it's one of the most complex systems Sarah, could you say the incoming Mexican president's name as authentically as he just said it? I can't Why are you just saying this all of us? I know, I can't You're supposed to be able to do that I, but well, I mean not as well as he can I could do it, I'm half Sure, you're half as well You're just going to roll your, I mean I can do that Definitely not going to do it right now So Donald Trump Jr, did you guys hear the statements that he made on the news about worrying for his son in this day and age Where you can get accused of something? Well, of course, the view I'm sorry, I'm sorry to do this to you everyone The view had some remarks to say about it, but I want to bring up something that Whoopi Goldberg said That is a little bit interesting if you go do some digging in her history Let's watch what she had, what Donald Trump had to say and then what Whoopi had to say after that Go ahead, I got boys and I got girls and when I see what's going on right now, it's scary for all things I mean, I wouldn't want my Who are you scared most for? Your son's your daughter I mean, right now, I'd say my son The other problem is that for the people who are real victims of these things When it is so obviously political in cases like this It really diminishes the real claims He's worried about his children, his kids are little I think nine and five Yeah, so I mean, you only worry about this for your child If you think your child has these tendencies No, your child is not someone who's assaulting people It shouldn't be a concern for your 8-year-old, oh my god A lot of 8-year-old rapists out there And so what she had to say was basically insinuating that Donald Trump Jr's sons must be, must have tendencies of being rapists The point of this is that you're worried about them being falsely accused Right, it's not about, if my son grows up to do some terrible crime, I want him to go to prison I mean, I also love him to death But if you commit a crime, you should go to prison It's when you're innocent and people can accuse you and you pay the price for the crime when you didn't commit it That's the issue Right, so interestingly enough, you know, you got to know not to mess with Donald Trump Jr You got to know he's going to use his sources and do some digging and find something to do to use against you So let's take a look at what would be had to say when talking about Roman Polanski No, it wasn't rape rape Yeah, there is a child in the last maybe I'm not sure it was something else But I don't believe it was rape rape And when we get all the information, somebody will tell me right here All I'm trying to get you to understand is when we're talking about what someone did And what they were charged with We have to say what it actually was not what we think it was What he said he did Interesting He gave her qualutes, he gave her champagne She was drugs, she was 13 years old They were sick, he was a trans person That's what I'm saying, you're 13 years old She was still a child I actually, excuse me, initially he was charged with rape, go ahead And then he played guilty to having sex with a minor Okay, and he went to jail And when they let him out, he found a case And when they let him out And he said, you know what, this guy's going to give me 100 years in jail And that's why he left So that's why I wanted to be really quick because I wanted to know exactly what we were talking about Interesting, interesting I for one do not trust pixelated whoopi Goldberg So we find out now that if it's not rape rape Right, that's okay, we get a pass What is rape rape exactly? I feel like you'll need the one word of rape No, but there's rape and then there's rape rape Yeah, I don't see a huge distinction there There's statutory rape and then there's rape rape Rape rape, which apparently statutory rape is fine It's not rape rape Right, right, that's a, yeah, I mean she's the last person in the world who should be talking about this Obviously I've got those guys That's just disgusting to me, like it's just gross I think that the Me Too movement is doing a lot of harm on itself By letting stuff like this fly and also by letting stuff like Keith Ellison fly Yeah, like we need objective standards because it's important to keep people accountable Who do terrible crimes? It's also important to protect women who are the victims of crimes And if you politicize it, it's like what if you accuse, right, so right now if you accused a like Bernie Sanders Or, no, I don't know if anybody would Right, but like what you're like, nobody's gonna pay attention to you, to your accusation Yeah, and I don't think there's a look Republicans and Democrats can both commit horrible crimes They can both commit murder, they can both commit rape, they can both commit sexual assault But like we're at a point where like On the right Who are the people who have been involved in the Me Too movement? You know Roy Moore, right, was one of the big ones, Brett Kavanaugh, which again we don't think I mean there's been a couple, but most of these people have been in Hollywood, right, and they're not conservatives over there The idea that like she can pick out the one Republican and say well their kids must be rapists When she's making excuses for people like Roman Polanski who is Is well beyond the Me Too movement, right, the Me Too movement is generally speaking pointing out things that were not prosecuted This one was, it went through the court of luck, he pled guilty to it Read his testimony from that case He admits to all sorts of abhorrent things He admits to the people Other than the stuff that he admitted to, it wasn't rape rape Right, we have nothing, it's not rape rape I've said this before, but I think the absolute worst thing for the Me Too movement is that it's based in Hollywood That the people that allowed us voices are coming from Hollywood and then it started in Hollywood I don't even know that I would say, I mean I get where you're going because I know we've had this conversation before And you've said it's just really hypocritical I would say the moment that Democrat leadership got a hold of it and weaponized it would be really where it started going downhill Because you could at least say in Hollywood Okay, they may have turned a blind eye to it before But at least these are things that actually happened Right, these are things that actually happened and regardless of who said what at the time At least we're finding this out now With, you know, after Me Too became weaponized by Democrat leaders I think it's very similar to the way that the fringe left weaponized Black Lives Matter In that Black Lives Matter at the beginning, they really did have, you know, their cause was, I think, just And I think that they did bring up instances where we should have looked into certain matters more carefully Because it's unfair to say racism is not, you know, alive in the United States It still happens and we should take an examination of that And I think the same way that the fringe left has, you know, has latched onto the Me Too movement now And so now everything, you know, where Black Lives Matter, everything's racist Everything a white person does is racist Now it's like white men are guilty once they get accused And I just, I feel like with Hollywood there was still some good being done, right? Even if Jay will be hurtable by not reacting in a moment I don't know, and I say that because the hypocrisy is so bad that it's so easy to call them out Like Don Jr. is either one that released this thing with Whoopi It's so easy to catch them, they did not believe this before There are no, I lived there and worked there for a long time in LA There are no secrets in Hollywood Everyone knows everything about everyone Everyone outside of LA doesn't know But all of those people in that group, if you're over the hill, how they say Everyone knows everything that's going on over the hill It's like it's so ridiculous, you can't have Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh Doing this hilarious thing and starting out live When your career was built off the back of Weinstein You can't, it's the hypocrisy is so awful and everyone knows this We're like guys shut up But you would say that it's still a good thing that all of this Weinstein stuff finally came out So yes, definitely, I always had this good argument too for Trump to not be spouting about it You know what I mean? Like I avoid this I'm avoiding it completely Like turning this into a political issue means that people are just going to take sides We've seen it with Kavanaugh There's no reason for our, you know, for Republicans or conservatives to try to do this It is supposed to be, it should be a legal issue, it should be a right or wrong issue It should not be a left or right issue Alright, I want to get to the Balazee comment of the day Remember podcast listeners, if you're new, new subscribers You can tweet us any questions, comments you have using the hashtag The Balazee Why The guys really like it when you get super personal and ask them really private questions about their lives They love it Love it Okay, so today we have a tweet from, I think it's Saves But he did the Who wore it better He did the Who wore it better last week Or I guess it was Monday And today's Who wore it better Oh god For you podcast listeners, it is a picture of Colonel Sanders Next to a picture of Glenn Beck Because they're both wearing the white shirt I do see some similarities there I was watching the Facebook Live and that was all the comments Oh my gosh, Colonel Sanders I love it when people say that and they think that they're the first ones I know, he's the one that first said that I just met him, I don't want him to kick my ass I'm so mad I'm gonna stay quiet on this one And then today's poll we mentioned earlier the All of the Millennial Democratic Socialists now Who identify as that Will all of these self-proclaimed Millennial Democratic Socialists actually show up at the polls Let us know on Twitter, it's at the blaze I don't know that they will, they might be like sleeping in that day I just don't Super hungover and they might just forget Yeah, totally What do you think?
