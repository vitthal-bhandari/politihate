    "text": " Team welcome to the freedom hunt the Monday November 22nd edition. Thanks for being here. We have lib media reacting to the written house not guilty verdict You have a driver mose down people murders people during a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin thief mob mobs target high-end retail stores and vaccine mandate protests erupting around the world Fauci says get ready for Vax every six months here in this country. I mean we have so much to talk about today and I'm Honestly, I feel like I'm not gonna have even close to enough time But let me just get to a few things here for hard-working Americans Finding health care can be an expensive struggle can feel like you don't have any real choice at all That's why I'm introducing our friends at one share health as a Christian health care sharing ministry There are non-profit dedicated helping thousands of Americans find affordable health care and support their members communities through Charity and volunteer missions their ACA exempt programs are perfect for small business owners the self-employed or anyone who's just fed up with a Broken traditional health care system don't worry about ridiculous Obamacare mandates or penalties get the most out of your hard-earned money with health care for just $115 a month for you or $239 for your family get seventy five dollars off your enrollment fee with promo code buck call 833 230 445 now or go online to one share health calm for a fast quote in seconds That's a 33 230 445 five or one share health calm with promo code buck for your special offer live well pay less See how much you'll save put the freedom of choice back in your hands So we have it not guilty verdict for written house, which was the right verdict. It was obvious Should have been that way all along no one should have had any doubts about the outcome here But the libs did the libs did because the facts did not Matter they simply do not care that it was clear self-defense that there was video of it That the prosecution was running with theories that didn't even make Legal sense that they undermined written houses constitutional rights none of that is supposed to matter Somehow the only thing in all of this that matters is Are they scoring points for their team? team left team Democrat and They keep going with it. It doesn't matter. They don't they don't care what the reality is. I mean here is yes I know if you're looking for crazy on TV joy read is really The the absolute top. I mean joy read is doing dangerous things for America these days the amount of of just dishonest pandering and Inflammatory statements about race that'll be made on her show is truly astonishing But here she is after the written house verdict instead of the takeaway being hey, you know what? We probably should have reported on this differently or hey, maybe there's something we should have thought about here that we didn't it's oh, no Well, here you go listen to it what I am concerned about is the precedent this sets for what people will believe that they can do Underlaw when black lives matter protests happen in the future and that people may use this as an excuse to start going out of state and doing What this teenager did believing that they'll get away with it and in some cases getting away with it I want to keep on that point joy Paul. That's the first thing that occurred to me That the first thing that occurred to me after this ruling is oh, well, okay now It's just open season like if I'm walking around and I'm a white nationalist You know coward little kid with an AR 15 and I see somebody drive by with a black lives matter bumper sticker And I feel threatened I can open fire if I go by a youth group standing outside the local target and they're chanting black lives matter And I feel threatened I can open fire That's not even a little bit what happened here. I mean that's a completely alternate reality doesn't care doesn't matter He does not care She does not care. They will say things that are utterly preposterous. They don't feel bad about it. They don't care The purpose here is to help team left and to attack The right Republicans conservatives white male conservatives particularly That is the only reason for this kind of analysis They make it sound as though he showed up and just started shooting people no we saw literally saw because there's video By the way if there wasn't video cow written house Probably goes to prison because of the narrative not because he did anything wrong He did nothing wrong, but we had video that showed if they didn't have the video they would have lied They would have said written house charged them It would have member with member with the the Michael Brown case. Oh Executed with his hands up There was no video, but there were eyewitnesses There were eyewitnesses who testified to the truth that Michael Brown charged the police officer there and Here we had video which was even more powerful than any eyewitness testimony could be under the circumstances and that is why I'll cut a why Kyle written house walked From this that is why he was able to leave the courthouse a free man I Want everyone to know though that even after what we just saw people like Joe Biden Kamala Harris still pandering I mean there's no way you could have seen this trial play out and think anything other than Kyle written house is not guilty of these charges Here's here's Kamala though criticizing the written house verdict play five Majority of my career working to make the criminal justice system more equitable and clearly a lot more work to do What kind of a bull crap statement is that? Clearly we have a lot more work to do why? Say what you mean Kamala is written house guilty is that what you're saying? I mean clearly that's what she's implying But why not just say it justice was not done here because this man is a murderer say it Have a little courage for once in your life Biden for once in your life Kamala say what you mean Why won't they? Because they want to they want to be able to signal to their Democrat Supporters they want a signal to them. I'm on your side. I hate written house to the facts of the case don't matter to me That's what they're hoping for here So everyone knows what Kamala and Biden think but then when people like me say look what they said They said they just said the justice system needs more work. Just gaslighting it like we're all idiots And that brings me to the situation in Waukesha Wisconsin speaking of them speaking to us like we are idiots Here's what we're being told as of now remember I'm speaking to you. This is Monday morning Pre Waukesha press conference. So I don't have all the details that a lot of you have with your listeners later in the day Here is what we know as I'm speaking to you There was a horrific mass murder because that's what it was a mass murder by a guy who was an aspiring rapper and long-time criminal long criminal rap sheet who ran into a Darrell Brooks 39 years old from Milwaukee ran into an annual Christmas parade in the town of Waukesha He killed at least five injured at least 40. He crushed people including old ladies and children under this car Now I know people have already sort of look at at this individuals social media and yes, there's BLM stuff and some pretty crazy political stuff on there, but that alone doesn't tell us the motive It's an indicator, but it doesn't tell us the motive. We don't know the motive right now specifically what we do know is What the media is telling us happened here, which is that he was fleeing another incident This is the official media storyline as of as of me talking to you Monday morning on November 22nd fleeing another incident and drove in some kind of a panic into this Christmas parade and Just was mowing people down. I mean there's video of this too Let's be very clear about this. He did not drive at high speed and happened to run into a parade because he didn't know what was coming The car basically lines up behind the people marching and drives right through them at high speed and mose them down He doesn't hit the he doesn't hit the brake He doesn't get out and say oh my god. What have I done? He's mowing people down cops in one case at least shot at him to try to stop him Now how many times so so the story we're supposed to believe is this guy had no Animus it was not any kind of hate crime against the individuals he ran over it was not any kind of a terrorist attack or any kind of Reprizele attack for what happened with the written house verdict. That's what they want you to exclude all of that and they want you to believe That this guy was fleeing some kind of a knife incident. We're not even sure if anyone was anyone killed in that What he pulled a knife on someone or someone pulled a knife on him. We don't have details Fled some kind of a knife incident and then in in in Waukesha. I mean this isn't Midtown Manhattan In Waukesha found the single most crowded place possible with the single greatest concentration of helpless innocent people packed together And mowed down about as many of them as he possibly could with his car because he was trying to get away from the other incident Does that make any sense to you now? What are the scenarios which maybe they're gonna tell us that he was you know, he was high on Opioids and alcohol and something else and was hallucinating, you know, maybe they have some explanation For this that I have not yet seen But fleeing a knife incident this guy's a career criminal long rap sheet his idea of escape Is to commit vehicular mass murder That's how he's trying to get away from the other incident As if he's gonna run all these people down and they're not gonna find him. They're not gonna track him I mean the knife incident who knows if that's gonna be you know, we still don't even know what happened there But so he runs into a parade and mows down all these people It's hard to think that the media is not just insulting our intelligence. Here's an idea. Did he flee the knife incident and have some kind of a rage breakdown and decide, you know Screw it. I'm just gonna kill a whole lot of people That may have happened But this notion that he just Accidentally was trying to evade a different encounter if you see the video It just doesn't seem credible that that story doesn't seem credible So what are we really dealing with here? Well? This is what happens in cases like this the left wants to delay the motive narrative as long as possible or to shift to a narrative that is Not accurate but is more to their more to their political preference Because if we don't find out that this guy actually was let's say acting on some political motive here Maybe even the spur of the moment. Maybe he decided like I said screw it I'm just gonna kill a whole bunch of people because I'm angry about x. I'm angry about why If they can delay that a few days, maybe a week or two that recognition the left things the democrats think the democrat corporate media believe They have done a good thing Don't ever forget That the fbi removed references to allah and isis i'm not saying this is a at all i'm not claiming this is an isis or al-kaida inspired attack, but i'm just saying they're willing to Change the facts to change the narrative they they remove things from the transcript of the uh, pulse nightclub shooter They still have never told us why the los vegas shooter Kill as many as he did. We still have never been able to know that motive they say they have mill figure it out But you'll see that when it comes to the democrat left. We may never know the motive Is their fallback if they don't like what people may take from the story meanwhile with cal rittenhouse They were lying about him as a white supremacist white nationalist terrorist right away With no evidence for whatsoever. Notice this No evidence And they play this game in the media where all if you go too far If you say this is what i think it is and you're wrong then they jump all over you because they're trying to prevent people from interfering With their narrative control and creation So they want to make everybody scared from weighing in on this they want to make everybody feel like oh gosh I can't I have to wait you have to let them flood the zone with their propaganda And only that are you allowed to say wait hold on this doesn't happen. Ah, sorry Look at all the ap headlines. Look at all the the order of furniture says a tragedy This was mass murder This this wasn't a tornado This guy irrespective of motive Is a alleged for legal purposes mass murderer Why aren't you seeing vehicular mass murder as a term in the media right now? That's what this is Kill five people ran over dozens Some of them will never be the same some of them might still die from their wounds They're gonna tell us this was an accident And an accident it's not an accident. This guy is a mass murderer And now we just need to know why but that's not how they're all now. He was just fleeing you see he was scared And then we get to the he's a career criminal Why is this guy even out and about he was just released A couple of days ago. He's out on bail from a couple of days ago Oh, but it's so awful to keep anybody in custody. You got it. You got to make sure that they're all You know, they're all let out right away.

I think we should call them thief mobs You got thief mobs that gather together and they run into very expensive high-end stores And once they're in they steal the most lucrative merchandise possible in orchestrated fashion they run out I mean there was one of these there's so many of them that I can't even remember them all here I'll tell you some of them You had a you had a thief mob in sent a san fran union square San Francisco's union square louis vaton store Another I think a louis vaton store in chicago um A mob of 14 went to the store in chicago the police say the group made off with a hundred Thousand dollars of merchandise in a couple of minutes You had 14 people involved in a grab-and-run at the louis vaton store in uh oak brook center mall near chicago That's the one and then a Nordstrom. This is the other one at walnut creek in the bay area I mean people just going in huge mop stealing tens of thousands of dollars of merchandise Because it's theft is is shoplifting even really a crime the left says Should we really punish people for this? Isn't it our fault That there are some out there who believe that they need to steal in this way. We owe them more We should feel badly about this. This is on us. That's what they want you to believe That is what they want you to believe the left the soros prosecutors Which is why they do everything they can They do everything in their power to make it really hard to keep people who are criminals Behind bars and paying a real price what they're doing in society Yeah, you could always make the argument. I mean does it does it destroy louis vaton for one ten thousand dollar handbag to be taken? No but What does it do when this is happening on a broad scale? What does it do to civilization? When individual acts of theft are treated as no big deal because we don't need laws We have social justice to pursue It's appalling What is going on here? Absolutely? appalling And it's not going to stop anytime soon either. It's really awful uh, by the way, there was a bill mar um, there was a bill mar uh Antiwokeness screed over the weekend. He's he's good on this topic I give credit where it's due. He's good on this topic. He's wrong on a lot of stuff But he's good on this And here he is trying to explain to democrats you got to stop being crazy Or you're going to get annihilated in the next election I know liberals think this country is full of dumb white people But in our democracy dumb white people make up a substantial portion of the vote The median voter is a white person in their fifties who didn't go to college their favorite tv show is nci s And their pronouns are what I don't know what the f*** you're talking about and get away from In 2008 republicans only won four virginia counties by more than 70 This month in the governor's election there. They did it in 45 counties And this is what a lot of democrats were told was the reason for that Glenn yunkins win proves white ignorance is a powerful weapon Racism still works in virginia. Well, I haven't worked up an official democratic campaign slogan for 2024 yet But I tell you what I have ruled out is vote democrat because white people saw He sees what's going on here Democrats in many cases do not they do not have an understanding of what's happening They are clinging to the illusion they can continue in this way Pushing these ideas without political consequence, but it's going to cause them enormous problems Uh, you may have also seen Over the weekend there are some places in europe where there are huge anti vaccine mandate and now anti lockdown protest europe is lost It's mine australia, which I know is not in europe is transporting people in military trucks now to quarantine centers mandatory How's that sound to you You notice how fauci never comes out and says well, that's crazy. We would never do that here. Why? Why does fauci never stand on the side of freedom? Not once not on one issue. It's always we might have to It'll be for your own good. I can't promise we won't we may get there He never Never says this is too much Find me one time where he goes we've gone too far or they Even the case of our european or australian allies have gone too far against covid with him There's nothing that's too far As long as he's in charge as long as his side's in power. That's what matters and now they're finally saying uh that you're gonna have to Get a booster every six months. This has been what i've been warning about four months now I've been saying this why did I know this before fauci said it Why am I right and fauci's wrong? every single Bleeping time Well, here he is play play 20 telling you every six months if we need it get ready for it It's uh 20 We would hope and this is something that we're looking at very carefully that that dirt shot with the mr Nae not only boosts you way up, but increases the durability so that you will not necessarily need it every six months or a year We're hoping it pushes it out more If it doesn't and the data show we do need it more often then we'll do it Notice how he says hoping you know why he has no evidence for that whatsoever But without that he's already admitting now. Oh, you're gonna have to get the shot every six months Oh, no, we're hoping that the booster will last a long time. They also hope the vaccine would last a long time. Were they right about that? The booster will last hopefully longer. Why? If anything what we see is covid mutates very quickly and the vaccines fail very rapidly So in what world can we really expect the things are gonna get so much better with this booster? Yeah, exactly exactly Total bull crap get ready for boosters to be fully vaccinated every six months That's what we're heading toward the worst terrorist attack ever to take place on our soil was 20 years ago on 9-11 When 2,979 people lost their lives brave americans responded We all remember the images of firefighters police officers port authority and so many others who wanted to help Many even stepped forward to enlist in our armed forces since then more than 7,000 us soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice to the war on terrorism They fought for us, but never came home The tonal the towers foundation honored those men and women who gave everything by reading their names allowed for the first time ever in a new Annual ceremony on veterans day this month tonal the towers is making sure their sacrifice is never forgotten The foundation season of hope runs from this thursday To thanksgiving to new years at least one mortgage free home a day has been given away for 37 days to honor america's greatest heroes Do good in their honor donate 11 dollars a month at t2t.org That's t the number two t.org tunnel the towers foundation Just a little bit more here on The vaccination and covid situation here's fauci telling everybody That you know i'm letting you me meaning fauci letting you enjoy thanksgiving if you're if you're booster you then you could actually enjoy it Vaccinated for sure and hopefully boosted too If you're vaccinated and hopefully you'll be boosted too and your family is you can enjoy a typical thanksgiving meal Thanksgiving holiday with your family. There's no reason not to do that The thing we are concerned about is the people who are not vaccinated because what they're doing is they're the major source Of the dynamics of the infection in the community and the higher the level Of dynamics of infection the more everyone is at risk But if you're vaccinated you look at the day to mothy It's absolutely clear the likelihood of getting infected getting hospitalized or dying If you're vaccinated versus non vaccinated ways very very heavily in the protection of people who are vaccinated Yeah, what are those numbers fauci? What are the numbers? Notice how he also molds together there Hospitalization death and infection well, those are all very different things, aren't they? Very different outcomes just getting infected is a long way from dying from the virus What are the differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated right now in terms of just baseline infection? How many breakthrough infections are happening? What percentage of day-to-day infections right now are quote-unquote breakthrough? How can fauci not have that data? It's all falling apart for the pouch Evil little lab coat turd that he is That's gonna be it for today folks back with you on Tomorrow's show of course i'll be doing this every day but thursday so or maybe not friday We'll figure that out but definitely today tomorrow wednesday So please pass the buck tell people about the show this week at thanksgiving great time to be like hey What's your favorite podcast bucks exit show podcast first thing in the morning drop to tomorrow shields high?"
