    "text": " And we're back with Keep It. I'm Ira. I'm Kara. I'm Louis Fertel. I actually pronounce a Verdel. Don't tell anybody. It is days after the scandal. Seriously for now. Uh huh. Louis, you've never seen scandal. Have you? No, I do think the posters look intriguing. You haven't seen any of it? I have to tell you, in college, I watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy. And ever since I've built like a Shondaland Immunity, I just did. It's a lot for me to take. I don't watch a lot of drama period. Okay. I live a while. It ended. Kind of. Are you satisfied? No. And I've heard reportedly that Shonda wanted it to be a two hour finale. It should have. I was surprised. I was surprised that it was only one hour. I thought it should have been two. But their deal is also up. And so maybe she's probably petty because she's had Netflix now. I gotta say though, I didn't know much about Bellamy Young until a couple years. She's amazing. She's great. Why don't you watch her on Skadong? Well, Portia de Rossi. I mean, they had like the ladies on that show were stacked. And by the way, Bellamy Young destroyed Josh Gad on Celebrity Jeopardy. And it is worth a three watch. She keeps answering questions and being like, is it this and keeps being right? Way to get Jeopardy in there. When we were talking about something that had nothing to do with Jeopardy. And here we go. Yes. You've seen news radio before. Of course. Candy Alexander's on Skadong. I love Candy Alexander on news radio. Joe Morton is just constantly doing like she experienced a little quiz. It for no real reason other than he can. Also was a really important show just because when Carrie joined, it had been the first time in 40 years since a black woman had led a prom time drama. And now, look at us. Right. Every show has a black woman. You did it. I agree with Skadong. Fine. You know what? I think we just need you to watch it. Yes. Because then you'll love it. Here's what you need to do. Watch season two because I had gone back and kind of review. I'd written about it and I gone back and reviewed. And season two is perfect. It's just like the perfect Shanda soapiness with like those big speeches and Carrie looks amazing and like she's making out with Tony Goldwynn who looks great. And like I think I think Jake rolls up. Yeah. Thoughtfully comes that season. It's just it's a good it's a good season. Because the first season reportedly ABC like only gave her six episode order even though Grey's Anatomy was a huge hit at the time. And so everything she wanted to do is just like truncated into six very weird episodes when you go back and watch it. There's also a character there who we never see again. Doesn't appear in this show. No, he does appear at like during when she gets kidnapped. Yeah. And like season four or five he makes like a random appearance again. But season two of scandal is like oh and I remember like pouring my red wine making some popcorn just it was real into it. Her shows like you just sink into you're like yeah take me over. Yeah. She was really scandal was one of the first shows that really got it with like using social media too and the hashtags and who shot Jay or who shot the president and you know like where is Olivia like they really they made it such an event. Now every show does that like madam secretary is like hashtag where's the portfolio. We have to start talking about Katia. I don't want to. I actually thought that we were done with him once he started hanging out with Donald Trump. Which people seem to not remember. They forgot about the time and no one insisted on bringing it up again. It was ridiculous. It was seconds after he won. Well, I think it was also because he did that and then he sort of went away for a while. Kanye did. Right. We don't know exactly where Kanye went but we know that he went to regroup after he you know had a meltdown in one of his concerts and canceled it halfway through. Yeah. Yeah. And he's and he's back now he's tweeting. He's Kanye's tweets used to be so fun and they actually started when he sort of returned to Twitter. It was like, oh look, Kanye's being Kanye again and then have just slowly devolved. It's like if a fortune cookie got stoned and started regurgitating atlas shrubbed like that's what Kanye's tweets are starting to sound like. He said that he was right. Well, he first reappeared after an 11th month absence and started tweeting weird sort of like like you said fortune cookie tweets and then he revealed later that he was writing a book in real time. Apparently some sort of philosophy to give people advice. A book written in real time is not a book, by the way. It sounds like he's saying I just won't be editing it. There's not a book. It's not a book. You can't just say that something that's not a book is a book. A bunch of tweets are not a book. And and you'd like he's gonna have to open staple them. Come on. Also, like how long does this process take? Like, are you gonna write this book for six years? Are you gonna tweet for six years? Is this just gonna be like a tiny coffee table book where in a month you'll collect it and there'll be 15 pages? He's just saying things that don't make any sense. And there is slowly devolving to like now you have the alt right of Twitter is suddenly all Kanye stands because he's tweeting crazy shit. Because one of his tweets was praising Candace Owens who is a black woman. I had never fucking heard of him. And I'm really upset that I know her name now. She is part of the alt right. And she is a huge critic of Black Lives Matter. And she wrote this in saying. Oh my god. I'm living that for the Stanford advocate called the title black men getting shot by police isn't about racism. And the opening is just it's lunacy. Like I date a white guy. Hold on. And then I'm not a stereotypical black girl because you can pronounce my name and I read books. Literally that bitch said that. And then she goes, but at the same time, I am a stereotypical black person because a bunch of my family members are in prison. That is literally the transition she made. My mother kept my head in novels. So I don't speak in colloquialisms. Does it make sense? That's the other thing. People people speak in colloquialisms because they read fucking Jane Austen. It's just people guys. These things don't make sense. And there was even there was an article about this in the Washington Post. It was written by a writer who apparently covers identity politics for the Washington Post. And he said he's talking about Kanye. Yeah. And at one point he was like, you know, you know, West used to be praised by black thinkers. And I'm like, who? What are you talking about? Nothing these people are saying makes any sense at all. Nothing Kanye is saying makes any sense. Nothing Candace Owen is saying makes any sense. And we need to just collectively agree on that. Like this is nonsense. Also, don't conflate black people liking Kanye's albums with black thinkers thinking that Kanye ever said anything other than Kanye's. Everyone like Kanye's music. Kanye's music is fucking incredible. That has nothing to do with his his and his just shitty politics. Because he is always been basically an idiot. You share care shared on Twitter. Like the other day, there was a quote about from back in 2009 where he talked about how he doesn't read books, which is insane to me because his mother was an English professor. He said I so it was in an article that Damon Young at Very Smart Brothers wrote a really great article called Kanye's Politics or What Happens When You Don't Read Books. And there was a quote from Kanye where he said, I am a proud non reader of books. I like to get information from doing stuff like actually talking to people and living real life. That doesn't make any sense. He's very proud of not having actual information on hand. I have to say that doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything. A proud non reader. You talking about also he just is somebody who clearly values narcissists with bluster. I mean, like that's why he's into Donald Trump. He loves celebrity. I mean, like you can say he's actually actually in love with his wife, but face it, part of the thrill for him is like, isn't it crazy that I'm a media juggernaut and she's a media juggernaut and we're doing it together. He just that's his one track mind. He admires that. There was a point when everyone was like, I can't believe Kanye is getting mixed up with the Kardashians. And at this point, I cannot believe Kim Kardashian is mixed up with his ass. I can believe Chris Jenner is sitting up in this house while he's tweeting and over there just like, what does she think? No, it's like a beautiful mind. Does she have the support of wife and he's like the crazy genius of doing all the horrible things. Yeah. Is he stealing her big eyes? Portrait. I don't know. I'm really tired of people. You know, as we continue to have to deal with this because he does not seem to be stopping any time soon, I'm tired of people making excuses for him. Mainly, we know that Kanye has had mental health issues and conflating supporting bigots and racists with mental health is that's not the way to go. Like there are people who have depression, who are bipolar, who deal with anxiety, and they don't support Donald Trump. And so conflating those things is wrong and it doesn't make any sense. You know, blaming Kim Kardashian. I don't even, you know, don't even like her blaming Kim Kardashian for whatever he's going through is kind of sexist and unfair. And like just it's just him. Also, she campaigned for Hillary to selfies with Hillary for someone who is married to someone who doesn't read oddly enough. Kim is always randomly tweeting about a book that she's trying to read. It's weird to me that she reads. Also, he doesn't. On some level, Kanye West has always been a celebrity like this is the first person who came to mind share where it's just guys once we're once we're out of share, there's nothing to replace these people. They're like one of a kind celebrity. And so they're valuable on just a memorable level. And so in a way, you root for him because how many celebrities of color get to have that kind of bluster get to take up space and be just assholes, you know, when like white men have done that for years, you know, but that's sort of where the appreciation ends because for him to espouse this like, I just don't think there's such thing as being benignly a male narcissist celebrity anymore. Like they've ruined our lives. He also started tweeting video clips from the creator of Dilbert, who is the worst, like top five worst and all right, like hero. It's the other thing I saw people also saying that if Barack Obama hadn't called him a jackass, you know, and if Barack Obama had embraced him, maybe we wouldn't be in the situation. This is not Barack Obama's fault. Okay, you people need to stop blaming everyone but Kanye West for his no reading ass, having all of these ridiculous opinions and thoughts. And also, Barack Obama was talking about when he interrupted Taylor stripped that award show. I mean, it was an Asinine stunt anyway. Imagine my superhero origin story being Barack Obama called me a jackass. He really does sound like a graduating senior obsessed with his yearbook quote. I mean, just he can't get over it. Do I sound wise now? Is this wise yet? He's going to get there, I think. He's in the other thing is because his fans or the people who have continued to support this similarly do not read anything and are as uninformed about things as he is. They're all they're they're like, you guys don't get it. You don't get this genius. You don't get what he's saying. It's like, no, we get it. And that's literally the problem is because we see exactly what's going on here. It is and it's part of the large problem too is that we find Kanye amusing in the media. It's the same reason I had to watch that goddamn Rachel Dola's all documentary for work because people want to click on whatever idiocy she does. And it's the reason why these people like Candace Owens get to do whatever it is they do and not just be called out on it, you know, because it's like you're able to write awful racist rhetoric about black people and we're just supposed to be open and let everyone have a yeah, everyone have, you know, free speech or whatever, but free speech never falls into informed speech. And we've really just gotten to a point thanks to Trump, where we have to keep pretending that so many uninformed people who don't know what they're talking about and come up with, you know, Barnum and Bailey leaps to justify racism are people that we can have an equal footing with when we have debates. I think I think also we could go back to like a Sarah Palin effect because to me, she was she was the dumbest person I became aware of who was at potentially going to have so much power. Like that woman was almost the heartbeat away from the presidency with someone who was sick. She seems whimsical, man. And she was so it was the first time I was like, Oh, wow, this person does not know anything. And they might they could be the president of the United States. And it was treated. It was kind of like it was funny. And I think we were all scared, but not in a no one really thought that that was going to happen. So we didn't take it as seriously. But I think I think we're going to look back and see that Sarah Palin kicked off this this era for all of us. Luckily, I still have faith that people will never throw their support behind a woman. So don't worry. Yes. We're all safe. When we're back. Time's up. Or is it? So last week, Rodent Vero, Jodi Cantor and Megan Tui were all honored with the Pulitzer Prize for a public service. Thanks to their reporting on the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. But now that we sort of made me to a cultural moment, honored it, it seems like all the other high profile men who are accused of sexual assault who aren't Harvey Weinstein are slowly planning their combat. After a weary four fucking months, that is how long it has been since we found out at most of these people. And these men are like, yeah, it's time's up. Yeah, time's up. That's about that's about it. And because and they get to do this under the guise of seeming benign compared to Harvey Weinstein, who was the emperor of rape. So because they didn't organize like years and years and years of assaults, somehow they seem more palatable compared to him. I think this is charming. Right. Page six has reported that according to sources, Matt Lauer is quote unquote testing the waters. And that's why he recently appeared out of his Hampton's home. You know, he pulled the Hillary and started wandering through the woods waiting to see if anyone was there to take selfies with him. Mario, Mario Batalia is thinking of starting a new company, allegedly. And the villager reported that some comedians in the New York scene think that Louis C K's return is inevitable. And they've recently been seeing him appear at the comedy seller on McDougall Street, but he hasn't gone up on stage yet. He's circling the stage. He's like putting his hands on the stage, just showing up and caressing the stage. Oh, you know, it's interesting though, about these people who are staging comebacks, Louis C K is an is not an example of this. But someone like Matt Lauer, like, that's an inessential celebrity, I have to say. And also, if you're making $25 million a year as he was on that show, and you f it up to the degree that he did, I just think it's all over. Like, there are plenty of other people we can give $25 million to who understand the news and will also direct people to the weather and won't, you know, close a door with a button while they drop their pants. The thing that is most sort of demeaning, I think, about the suggestion that these that these men have the opportunity to make comebacks is one, how little time it has been. It's the fact that none of them have expressed any contrition for what they've done, any real empathy for their victims. They've not made any steps to try to that we're aware of to try to better themselves to make it up to the people that they've hurt to fix the institutions that they broke with their behavior. They don't seem sorry. They seem sorry that they got caught. They seem sorry that they got fired. They seem sorry that they don't get to be on TV anymore. They do not seem sorry for any of their actions. And there's no road to a comeback without any of that. Are you saying you weren't swayed by Mario Batali's cinnamon roll recipe? It didn't quite do it for me. And no one it's like such a short period of time. Like, I've always said that where I, you know, rich, powerful white men, they'll be back in some capacity or another like, it's not what I want. But I understand the world we live in. I understand, you know, what we allow for these people. And I've never thought that like, Matt Lauer wasn't going to find his feet again, unfortunately. But it's been a second. Like, can we at least pretend like these men give a shit about what they've done? But we saw that. What systems do we have in place to even phase out men in popular culture just anyway? You know, women routinely age out at age 31. You know what I mean? If you become a famous man in any area of entertainment, we basically, you're, you get a free ticket for life. You know, we see when you're 40s, we see when you're 50s, whatever. So it's rare that we just tell people that go away period. How it loves you when you come back in your 60s. If you're a man, you can be very old men. And when Oscar for putting on the state club marshmallow man suit. And then people will attack you on social media for not liking Gary Oldman. I was that so yeah, you know, I've heard. But it's also a sign that we've seen because even before this, you remember the multiple men in Hollywood who just sort of innocuously in interviews said, you know, if someone tells really sorry, I could maybe hypothetically, potentially, possibly, I don't know, see a way for them to come back and join the Hollywood community again. It's why were we asking people that shit two months after yeah, the Harvey Weinstein allegations there. They're immediately looking to they're like, okay, yeah, he was a bad person. But why don't we just now talk about how we could all move on from this? It's like, that just said, I think people are uncomfortable. I'll quote, quote, holding a grudge against some man who has done something horrible. You know, there's even something about again, why people support Trump? It's because he's so unapologetic and so forceful about how he should be believed that people in a way feel polite submitting to somebody like that that it's just it's more comfortable for them if they allow that person to be, you know, as venomous as they are mostly because Hollywood is about not holding grutches against people. Yeah. Done you. And I think one of the arguments people make too like that was always the thing with someone like Louis C K where they're like, you know, he wasn't as bad as Harvey Weinstein, which that is not the bar people, by the way, monster is not the bar that you should be looking to clear. But unless you're, you know, an actress trying to talk, shall we? Is there a good board? But like, I think it was Gia Tolentino wrote for The New Yorker about how we treat when she was talking about the assumption that women can't see the difference between a Louis C K and a Harvey Weinstein, like we don't have the ability to understand no one's saying that what they've done is the exact same thing. Like we know the difference between rape and sexual harassment and we're not the ones conflating them. And we treat the, we give these men so much nuance to say, well, you know, he didn't actually do this. He didn't do something that, you know, with Aziz, for example, he didn't do something that was criminal. It was just creepy. And it's like, yeah, that's actually a conversation we should be having. But then you also don't give women the opportunity to also understand that they have a nuanced approach to this and saying, like, they're not saying that this is as bad as that, but they are saying that this is something that's important and something they should be held responsible for. And they're not saying we're throwing these people in jail, but they are saying, like, this is something that needs to be handled and we need to deal with it in a serious way. Exactly. It didn't help that part of the conversation surrounding this was the New Yorker and the New York Times were getting so much attention for their Harvey Weinstein reporting. It basically made entertainment journalism for a few months first after these stories. So the nuance was lost when you have editors and writers trying to find anything that a man has done in Hollywood that's even remotely bad and relates to sex. And then you get things like the babe dot net article where you're being like, Aziz I'm sorry, attacks, you know, and then when those stories get rewritten on other websites, they lose the language that's even in the initial piece. And if you were just googling it now, you would think that Aziz probably raped five women. You are more conjecture enters the equation via these other aggregate articles. Yeah, it reminds me years ago when I was more kind of formerly an entertainment journalist, there was like every once in a while, you know, people care about Roman Polanski again as they should. But I just remember for a time you'd be on a red carpet and like in around 2010, it would be a valid opinion just to ask any celebrity, you know, what do you think about Roman Polanski and whether or not they support him was a good sound bite. So it would get asked again and again. And meanwhile, you're losing the nuance of what actually happened with Roman Polanski, you know, years and years and years ago, I'm not saying Roman Polanski should be allowed to do anything. But it's just you're right, there's like a novelty value to these sort of heavy stories. And we report them sometimes more impetuously than with a lot of context. You could definitely see which outlets shifted their general coverage of the entertainment industry to every piece was about one of these sexual assault crimes. And it's at a certain point, if you're just writing 10 pieces about the same thing, it it loses any sort of importance. Well, the other thing I think is interesting about this in the comebacks is, you know, I think it was the Louis CK one. No one was anyone asking about how Louis CK was going to say to come back. I don't remember anyone expressing that they gave a shit about that. And when you cover it, like this is even writing the story, Matt Lauer, Isaac, come back, like there's kind of a problem with that. Like who cares about his comeback? We can't if we're really going to say that these are people that we are going to hold accountable for their actions and the Me Too movement is something that we're going to take seriously, then you don't even need to be writing an article about that. What is that adding? What is that helping? You are only helping to clear the path for a matter of power to make a comeback. And when you treat this like a serious story that we should all be entertaining. Even that language, like putting the word comeback, like is already making it palatable in a way, you know, you're already setting up a narrative and sort of. You're doing the job for them. And I can't, I have a hard time believing that Matt Lauer and his team, whatever, whoever is still standing by him, didn't have something to do with that story being written. And so it's also understanding that these men who want to make their quote unquote comeback, like they, they kind of have a blueprint for this. And when you see these stories, they probably had something to do with them. They probably gave access. They perhaps, you know, offered sources who could say the things that they wanted them to say. Like you have to look behind these stories and see it as part of a larger plan that these men are probably controlling. Mel Gibson still seems to have some power is all I'm saying. You know, I want to say it's because people have a short memory, but it's more that people don't care enough to stop him. They joke. And that's right. You know, it was pointed out in one of the pieces, the Vox piece that all of this talk has come from the media and none of them in themselves. You know, there was really no reason to be reporting that Lewis CK is slinking around the comedy seller, eyeing the stage. Who cares? You know, yeah, he has to exist somewhere. It's just now it's shifting. There's no new stories to write about people at the moment. So let's focus on those men again and see are they kind of come back? And your editor might voice it in a way that's like, oh, how dare this person try and make a comeback? It's gross. We should write about it to let people know that this is a gross thing. I'm like, people already know it's a gross thing. You just want the clicks from someone clicking on a story about this person, which in turn makes you part of the problem. What is sort of the next stage of me to look like then, you know, what's not this? What do we think has even been missing from the past few months? We've seen a few black women have been talking about. One of the problems is there's just too much gatekeeping in the sort of times movement. And Fandy Newton gave an interview recently about how she felt turned away and rejected by the times up movement just because she said that she had been talking about being assaulted by a casting director, you know, back when she was 18. And it's something that she used to routinely bring up. And women in the industry told her this isn't something that you should be talking about. You know, and so now that the times up movement has happened, she's like, well, where the fuck were y'all when I was talking about it? Same thing sort of with Gabrielle Union, who's been talking about being a sexual assault survivor for years. And you aren't really seeing these women of color at the forefront times up. You're seeing the same people. And you're also not really seeing a lot of visible change happening now. It's weird that we're in a point where you're talking about men possibly making their comebacks. And so many of the women who were largely assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, we don't even know if they have movies coming out again, or if they're able to be back in the industry. Well, I think, you know, this is not something that is a quick fix. And I don't think that when times up formed that they expected this to be something that was a quick fix. This is also a shift in like, this is the way society looks at women and values, women that has to that has to change. And that's not something that times up can do on their own. I think for me, my biggest hope is that, you know, times up does have some prominent women of color. I mean, Kerry Washington and Shonda Rhimes and are a couple that I've seen just visually when times up as something that's being talked about. And what I would hope is that as we continue to talk about this, the people in the organization and the leadership can recognize that, yeah, you do have someone like Adreel Union, who's talked about her experiences for a long time and say, hey, we weren't the first ones and we want to now give them some country to speak. And in the same way that I think that's something that we saw with white feminists where they're saying, hey, these are issues that black women or women of color have been talking about for a long time. And I want to I want to make that I want to give them the credit for that. I want to give them space to just to say the things that they need to say and recognize that they've been saying this for a long time and that I'm in a position of privilege. And so now when I say something people listen, and I don't think that times up has been doing a bad job with that. I think also, unfortunately, like there is just so much stuff to talk about and so many issues and so many women who have been heard. So many layers levels. So many clocks. How can you stop them all? There's just so much that, you know, it's it shouldn't also be just on times up. You know what I mean? Like that's we should there's also the me to me to movement like there should be this should be a battle we're fighting on a ton of different fronts. Yes, I mean, like I even think about years ago, Ashley Judd had talked about, you know, she had alluded to Harvey Weinstein in certain interviews. So it's just the fact that certain people have now become lightning rods. It seems like the future of the me to movement is people in positions of power like finding, I mean, to be trite more ways to be intersectional more ways to bring up people without access who, you know, poor people who don't live on the coast, aren't in entertainment, things like that, you know, making making this movement more visible to everybody and seemingly more applicable to everybody who still don't, you know, don't feel invited basically to it. And I think a large part of it will also just be the industry and also consumers putting people's, you know, feet to the fire on things like this. You know, this week, this week, there was the report that Fox may get rid of lethal weapon and not bring it back next year because Khalid Kline Crawford has had, you know, sort of bad behavior on set. And it's just, it's wild to think that just because the white co-lead on lethal weapon is being wild on set, you would get rid of hundreds of people's jobs. I just want to say if I were writing a sitcom or a movie about a horrible white guy leading a show, I would invent the name Kline Crawford for it. It almost seems like he made this story up as a fable to tell us about the horrors of men on set. So, you know, just moving forward, let's hold those people accountable and don't let other people be affected by what these men are doing. Yeah. Lewis, it was Sunday morning in Vegas. We were on our way to brunch and the news broke that should I give an interview with the Guardian where she said, I would have voted for Donald Trump because even though he was offensive, he seemed honest. I sure do you want straight or polite? Which, by the way, could be the name of a Shania Twain album. You want straight or polite? Honestly, over the course of this brunch by the time it was over, she had already issued an apology on Twitter. And she numbered the tweets, which was very professional of Shania. Yeah, she wasn't tweeting that. Yeah, I want to see who was at the keyboard. Who was doing that? What possessed her? It's just, I don't understand why anyone who has any sort of real career would even, like, if you're not going to, why are you saying anything at all? You're not American. You didn't even vote. Why does your hypothetical vote matter? I think she literally lives in a castle in Switzerland. Does she not? I mean, she's deeply out of touch in an anyway. It so doesn't matter. Why would you even go into that? How do you not already foresee how this story plays out? I mean, this is a woman who has built her career on just song titles with parentheses and exclamation points in them. And while I'm happy for that, she should have maybe realized I have not an authority on this. And she basically acknowledged this in her apology. But just, yeah, shouldn't I? That's a very strange idea. You know, you know, it's always a good idea to stay in your lane. Yeah. Stay in it, find it, live in it, be in it. We don't need you veering. We don't need you stepping outside of it. And Shania Twain, the politics of Donald Trump, girl, that's not your lane. Right. No, there could be a Shania Go put some leopard print gloves and stand in the desert. That's what we need from you. I was extra hot about this interview too, because just days earlier, she appeared on RuPaul's Drag Race as a guest judge. Right. Going from that to Trump, I was like, what are you doing? No, and for her to be on RuPaul's Drag Race and voice her support for Bedazzle Denim onesies, which was basically the theme of that challenge. And then say this was among the most ultimate of betrayals. I keep thinking literally, Kara talking about Shania Twain, you could turn all of this into Shania Twain album, song titles. Hey, if you're not staying in your lane, pull over. Also, where are her people? Honestly, at this point, if you're raking in the dough and shutting the fuck off, if you work for anybody, and you're in the room, where they're being interviewed, and the interviewer is like, what do you think of Donald Trump? And it starts to come out of their mouth. You know, I would have bam, you knock them out. You chloro for everybody in the room. And say, wow, that was a great interview, guys. I mean, like she's the kind of rich where, I mean, of course, she's going to be the most out of touch. Come on over still the number one album by a woman ever. That's 20 million copies of You're Still the One. I mean, that's that's among the most mediocre of pop ballots. And I may stand for how do I live wait till she drops Magra? I feel like a woman. Oh, yes. Okay. So you're the most qualified candidate in American history. That don't impress me much. Speaking of Shania, who Americans still love, you know, I was, I was extra shocked to find out how many black people rocked with Shania, when that news broke on Sunday. Who are some people who we would classify as a problematic fave then. We could classify Shania at least as a problematic faith because she at least isn't hanging out with Trump, like Kanye or retweeting alt right thinkers. I think I think I think the door is closed on Kanye West. But Shania, do you two have any other people like her who, you know, have done you wrong, but you still support them? I feel she hasn't done me wrong, but I, Cardi has said some things. Cardi, I also, she's so young. This all of this was so new to her. I forget how young she is. She's 25 years old. She does not have, I think, I'm going to say a particularly seasoned communications team in place. And she loves being quippy. And she loves me. Yeah. And so she has, she's sort of said some things that I wish she hadn't. But I do think her, it's a net positive for me. Totally. And she's so young then. And it's plus she grew into fame by being on Love and Hip Hop. So she's just used to sharing every single thought. It's a little like Tiffany Haddish is obvious was a rowdy stand-up for years. And now when she's talking about Beyonce as candidly as she's talked about everything else, now there's this step back moment. Yeah. My problematic fave, I mean, I have problematic, I have problematic movies, songs. There's literally a Birkback rec song called Me Japanese Boy I Love You, which is among the most terribly offensive music ever released. Carol King wrote the song he hit me and it felt like a kiss. Carol King usually writes music that you can pet a cat to. And this is extremely offensive. I think my number one problematic fave and she veers into this territory from time time is Madonna, which is, I mean, if you didn't have Madonna, you wouldn't have so much pop culture of the 80s. You wouldn't have such a version of, you know, what used to be called Third Wave Feminism, whatever in popular culture. However, the sheer amount of times Madonna has been Asian is a problem. Just every four years, she'd be like, you know what, I am Japanese. I am, you know, Gaysha in Red Patton Leather. Which is not busy being Hispanic. Right, please. That was the beginning of it all. And she's like, God, do I look good with like a dark lash? I'm going to be from Mexico. Also, the nerve of her having a song called La Isla Bonita and then singing that with a Spanish accent while mispronouncing Ila is just the mystery of all time. She also was just from time to time seems that girl didn't the grill the girl need to happen. Yeah, that's I mean, yeah, there's a lot of changing her name to $M. I think she I think she may have she may have appropriated some basketball fashions at one point that weren't shall we say racially appropriate? Two two pox ghost told her it was okay. Yes, exactly. Oh my god. Does she bring up to Pacalot now? But I mean, she's been so I hate that people pin ageism issues on Madonna, but she's been really articulate about how people's expectations of her are disgusting. People keep asking you're like, are you going to retire anytime soon? And they never asked that to Steven Spielberg or Salvador Dali who she or Pablo Picasso's who she brought up as if she knows she's on that level. You know what? Maybe she is. Were people asking Pablo Picasso please stop Pablo. Where are you gonna retire? I think mine is to be a fan. Interesting. I still really love 30 Rock and she's a genius, but there are so many episodes of 30 Rock that are borderline racist. And I really don't like how Tracy Jordan was in that show at times or how she wrote black women. And then Kimmy Schmidt, she basically jumped out the window with a bunch of episodes and the Native American storyline was she's she's problematic because she's not there are certain celebrities who at least when you call them out on something, they reflect and they say, I'm sorry, I want to learn from this. When you call Tina Fey out on anything, she sort of recoils like Yurtle the Turtle and she says it's your fault. I think her thing is she has a blind spot and she knows it and doesn't care. And there's something sort of honest about that. That's why she left social media too. She said she was tired of people pointing out her blind spot. Yeah. And so I roll to how she deals with backlash. Yes. And I and I she's a smart person and she's so talented. And so I know she knows, but it is her sort of saying, like, I know I don't get this. Or, you know, I know that I didn't handle this that way, but I don't want to talk about it, which, you know, I guess. And compared to somebody who is very rad when they have dealt with backlash and I'm thinking of Sarah Silverman, particularly, it's like, no, everybody can be better at this. I mean, Sarah Silverman is somebody who continues to like hyperbolicly impress me as the years go by. It's just slowly chipping away at that black fist. When we're back, keep it. Cara, what are you keeping this week? So this is sort of a early preemptive keep it because I know it's coming. But the trailer for Crazy Rich Asians came out this week. And I already know I'm just waiting for the trolls to come out and be like, how come there are any white people in this movie or this movie is racist. They tried to do with Black Panther. It didn't work. You were not going to do it with Crazy Rich Asians. I am so excited for this movie. Constant Woo is looking like money. Henry Golding looks like a Disney prince. Michelle, you know, I mean, Aquafina is in there acting for her life. My friend, like Santos is in it. I don't want to hear it. I don't want any of this bullshit. This movie is going to make money. It is going to do well. There are no white people. You're all going to be mad about it. And I don't care. So preemptively, it is a keep it. If I see any of these damn petitions again, like you did with Black Panther to whatever it was to tank the rotten tomatoes or any of other any of that asinine bullshit, keep it. It's not going to happen. The movie's going to do well. I'm so excited. You cannot ruin this for me or anyone else. They also did some secret advanced screenings when they dropped the trailer this week. And word of mouth is already great. So I am pretty sure that we'll be able to. The books were so fun. Yeah, the books were great. They were so fun. I'm so like, the fact that in this year, we get Black Panther and we get Crazy Rich Asians is like, it is in and it's embarrassing to say it feels like an embarrassment of riches because we shouldn't be so geeked out just to have movies with people of color in them. Like it should be a more common occurrence. But more than anything, I think this movie is going to, that was always one of the things with Black Panther where the fact that it was so financially successful really matters in terms of things changing in Hollywood. And I think Crazy Rich Asians, I hope does the same thing. I hope it makes a ton of money. I hope that you cannot go into meetings now and have executives tell you that like, oh, we can't put and can't just star. There's no white people in this. No one's going to buy tickets. They're going to buy tickets. It's going to be amazing. Shout out to Constance Wu forever. I'm offended by this conversation, Cara. And your remarks, I read why because you haven't talked about how the man in this movie is blazing hot. We just said that. I just want to say, we need to dwell more on how many abs are in this trailer because I think it's in the dozens. It is shocking and it is brutally erotic. We literally talked about how hot he was. Lewis, you're busy. But you did. It's my words. Me, Lewis. We didn't say brutally erotic. Yes. Just because you were drifting off into space thinking about what Carly Simon's ordering for breakfast this morning. You know what, Carly Simon is a rich live performer. And I can't believe you would make fun of that. Martha's Vineyard resident. Are you keeping this week? Okay. Well, first of all, we mentioned this before, but when we were watching J-Lo, we were in this pit surrounded by people who just, I just don't want to move or like aren't excited by somebody singing on the floor or other pit bull aided anthems. That was shocking to me because I had to stand on behalf of the entire crowd. I had to wrap the whole fat Joe big part of feeling so good for everybody. And that is a weight that is heavy. And if you look at me and my, it was heavy to experience. I'm sure I'm sure Lewis lost his damn mind at this concert. No, he was, I kept motioning to J-Lo. Like just focus here. I've got all the standing you need. Wait for tonight over here, J-Lo. And then also big, keep it to the new royal baby. Sorry. Because I already sense an attitude just from the fact that it's a man. It's a baby. Just from the fact that it's a man. Second of all, here's the thing. There is this Charlotte person who we have not given enough love to. I don't know what she's going to do. Is she a seamstress yet? I have no idea. But the first royal baby, George, and this has become kind of a hack Twitter thing. I even contributed to the hackiness yesterday. But is such a glamorous four year old. And we do not properly exalt him in his little shorts in his wispy Christopher Robin hair. In his giant Fisher price little person eyes that are constantly staring at you. Like no matter where you are in the room, they're on you. It's like one of those paintings. And he just is constantly over being photographed while the look on his face is just famous. So boring. So wait, you think you know what? He's right. You think we haven't paid enough attention to the two royal babies that already exist so that we there's no bandwidth for a third. I think we're maxed out. Yeah. Okay. I feel it is selfish them to have the third child. Just wait. Listen, just wait. You're Megan and and Harry get out here with these little these little brown redheads that they're about to. That's going to be exciting. I don't know. We might replace you for the royal wedding episode. Oh my God. I don't even care about. I mean, I don't royalty is not a real thing. I don't care. But here's my thing. I don't think I care. But when that wedding comes around, I'll be there. I will be there. I want to see dresses. Well, this is also American. That's not what I said. Okay. I'll care about this one because there's an American scamming her way into this ridiculous institution of royalty. Like this is a real thing. I'm proud of her for that. That's taking tips from Black China. My key bet is well, my my tiny one is James Comey, who I have had it with. He is Gail Weathers and Screamhawk in that book. He is everywhere. I'll send you a copy. Slap or a punch. He is everywhere. Everywhere in the way that Omarosa was, but no one seems to be dragging Khloe and he's just like on Colbert and joking around with every late night host. I'm like, you know what this man did, right? Like, I'm not here for treating him like he's a whimsical figure now. I've heard the word charm used in reference to him several times. Like, we not treat him like, he's it girling his way of the latter here. He's just a homestone. But by a real key bit. Another problematic. True. You've never seen a low hot, so boring. I'm not moving on. But my she auditioned for Crazy Rich Asians. Waiting for that cameo. She plays most of the characters, actually, you can't tell. My real key bit is for Kim Zolziak, Beerman, on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. No, I'm tardy to this party. Please explain. I think she is finally gone from the show. But during the final reunion episode, after she was challenged by all of the women on the show for basically being crazy and starting drama with everybody, she fled the couch, had Andy come in, Andy Cohen come into the bathroom to talk to her alone. And she said that the women on the couch owed American apology. Racism was overblown because of social media. She's never been racist. And then she said, you know why you've never been able to get another white woman on the show. They wouldn't be dumb enough to come on here with these five African American women just going at her on the couch. I don't hear a problem there. Go on. It was like her. It was like her. It was like her funeral that entire episode. And I lived for it. But I also just never need to see her. She needs to hope those lips don't explode and just go on and live her life girl like enough. She kept talking about how she's on tardy for the party. She has her own show. It's like, it seemed like the underlying reason you have your own show is because you didn't want to be on the show with black women and pointing out why you can't find some other white woman to sit on the couch. We don't need another white woman on Real Housewives of Atlanta. And I always found it weird that they initially plugged a white woman into the all black show when they don't plug a person of color into the other shows which are all white. Ever. Yeah, right. Exactly. There are no other shows with just a black cast, a single black cast member. Am I wrong about that? They had on New York. They had who was that very sad then woman. Jules who was Asian. And DC was one season. And DC was mixed for one season. Yes. Yes. I would watch a play called the very sad then woman. I just want to say Edward Albie is a very sad then woman. Bravo viewers do not like integration. Sorry Southern Charmed New Orleans. And that is Keep It For The Week. Thank you all for joining me. Follow me on Twitter please. I'm doing such a good job.
