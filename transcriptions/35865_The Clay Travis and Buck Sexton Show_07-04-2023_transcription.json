Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show Podcast. That is for all of you. Also a lot, pardon me, my voice is a little raspy. I started to lose it last night on Gutfeld Show and it's still a little bit so I got clay here though and I'm good to go. We're going to get through it to be just fine. But the individuals who were kicked out of the Tennessee State House, a lot of pushback now from the Democrat media over this saying all kinds of things. Barack Obama himself weighs in on Tennessee State House members being voted out of the Tennessee State House for their part in a rowdy and stupid anti-gun protest. So we will address that for sure. I'll also, since we're talking about Nashville there or Tennessee rather, the Nashville manifesto as I believe is still not out yet Clay. I know they've talked a little more about what's in it, but they still haven't released it, still have not shared a motive. I think we're going to return to that here in a moment because there is now a full-on allegation of a trans terrorist plot by a William Whitworth that we'll discuss who plan to shoot up three schools and churches stopped before able to engage in this plot. We'll discuss that. We're actually going to start with another issue. You know, it's interesting, Clay, the Biden White House has also put forward this Title IX rule. I'm sure you saw this. Oh yeah. So now the way they're doing it is well, you can't just ban, you know, they always say people who menstruate, we say people with penises, you cannot ban people with penises from competing against women outright in college athletics or you'll lose your federal funding. It's a Title IX violation. So you have to do it on a sort of case by case basis and take into account the fullness of identity. So this is just incrementalism. And this is important to understand because of what happened. So you've got that issue coming down from the White House about trans Title IX expansion. So now Title IX will include men who think they're women. That is what Title IX, that's what the White House is trying to do. So making a mockery of equality for women in athletics and decades and decades of precedent. But let's start with our friend Riley Gaines Clay who was speaking at San Francisco State University and was just talking about this issue of, again, the Title IX issue comes into play here separating men and women from competing against each other, biological males. I just think men, I think we got to just go back to basics here, folks, men and women. Yes, sir. Yeah, no, I just think we need to explain again who Riley Gaines is because how did she come to be a spokesperson on this issue? Riley Gaines is a was a swimmer at the University of Kentucky women's swimming. She competed directly against Leah Thomas who was Will Thomas. And remember, I think these contexts matter. This is how she found herself as a spokesperson in this arena. Will Thomas swam for multiple years as a man for the University of Pennsylvania men's swimming team? Then he decided to identify as a woman flipped and began swimming for the University of Pennsylvania women's team. And he became an NCAA champion and won the 500 meter and Riley Gaines competed against him at the NCAA championship. She is a lifelong swimmer, elite women swimmer at the University of Kentucky. And after doing that, she said this is wrong. And she had the courage to speak out. She's been on this program. She is now going around the country saying men should not be able to compete against women. That's the background. That's the basis of horse speech. She's doing it as a former women's college swimmer who had to compete against a man with tremendous biological vanishes over her. And so Thursday night, she was at a turning point leadership Institute event speaking about saving women's sports from male competition and trans activists. And the video, I mean, Clay, you shared it. I shared it on Twitter. Do we have the video up at clay and buck.com? We do. So anyone who has you need to see this video, everybody, go to clay and buck.com. It is up there. And obviously, if you see if you follow us on Twitter, you've seen it there too. You need to understand the ferocious psychopathy of this mob. And here's some of the audio of this as they attacked or these trans activists play it. I mean, honestly, it's, I want people to hear it. I want people to hear it because it's, it's, it's demonic sounding. I mean, these people, these are college students at, you know, a state school that has a name. People know it. And they are losing their minds and actually, one male with long hair calling himself a woman physically attacked her, hit her a couple of times. So this isn't just the usual college campus screaming, shouting, being babies, not believing the First Amendment stuff, Clay. This is a violent mob of trans agenda lunatics attacking someone invited to speak at a college campus. I guarantee none of them will be expelled. Nothing is going to happen to them. She needs to press full charges, Buck, because if you attack, I mean, think about where we've gone. We just, we have gone from, let's make sure that we protect women to now allowing men who identify as women to take the moral high ground and actually physically assault women. And I want to, I want to speak out on this because I think she needs to, first of all, all these people need to have significant consequences for what they did. They should be expelled, in my opinion, absolutely, all if they're students, they should be, they also surrounded her when she was in a room and refused to allow her to leave. But here's what I'm a little bit encouraged about Buck. I just saw, a lot of you may know, Sage Steele and Samantha Ponder, who are two of the biggest names at ESPN. And both of them have shared this video and now are speaking out about this, which is unheard of because remember Buck, last week ESPN said that Leah Thomas was one of the women of the year athletes. Remember, we aired that clip. They have totally bought into this lie. Here's what Sam Ponder said, just while yes, Riley, so many of us are cheering you on. I imagine this has felt lonely at times, and I'm genuinely sorry for my own cowardice in not speaking out sooner. Say strong sister. Here's what Sage Steele, that is Sam Ponder at ESPN. Sage Steele said, stay strong, Riley Gaines. You have more people than you know, supporting you and standing up to this madness. And then Sage Steele at ESPN said, are there any other women with public platforms willing to stand up for Riley Gaines and the millions of female athletes? Or do we only stand up for those who fit certain narratives? All caps, ladies, where are you? Media, Hollywood, hello, we all caps must come together on this sharing this video of Riley Gaines being attacked. So, but my hope is that this is such a viral video moment that you can be attacked now in this country for just saying men shouldn't be able to compete against women in women's sports. This is where the trans agenda is. It wasn't one person. It was a mob. So everyone needs to understand this is not just a one off lunatic. Yes was a an angry and violent mob of obviously trans activist students, most of whom, maybe all of whom, by the way, I don't know. I mean, well, there was one guy who says he's a woman who actually hit her, but most of them are not trans themselves. So these are just Biden voters who get a kick out of thinking that they're in the new civil rights struggle. They've convinced themselves, everyone has to understand they were yelling things, you could other than the curses, which we had to bleep out for you. And, you know, I got to say, as a guy, you know, you see a guy with long hair recall, you know, his name is Bob who calls himself, you know, Sally or whatever, and he hits Riley Gaines, that person's, you know, you got to step in, you know, this is when there are salting women as a man watching this, a man assaulted a woman. I think it actually gets to the reality of what happened here. I'm sorry that that man is deeply emotionally unstable and troubled, but you cannot attack physically a woman because you don't like her sports policy, which is what happened here. But so many of these individuals, Clay, these are just college kids who vote for Biden and post left wing TikToks. And I'm sure they were all, you know, triple masking. And this is now just part of the apparatus. This is the board. This is the hive mind chasing this woman and physically attacking and threatening her. I mean, the school should be ashamed. Where are the sit-ins over this? Where are the, you know, the camp? Where are the deans of diversity saying this isn't who we are? And remember what they're attacking her for, because I think this is so important. And I've seen this coming for years. This is coming from the world of sports. And I think it's kind of a crystallizing moment for many of you out there, men and women. She's being physically attacked on a college campus for saying men shouldn't be able to compete against women in women's athletics. That is not remotely controversial. Every single one of you listening out there to us right now understands why men's and women's sports are separated because men are bigger, stronger and faster than women. And if men were competing against women, men would win. This is not some revolutionary, incredible insight that has suddenly occurred. This is basic biology that everybody understood for hundreds of years of athletics. And now she's being physically attacked for standing up for the idea of men and women's sports. They're shouting in the hallway as they chase her. They chase her away from an event. And they're shouting trans women are women. And I keep saying this to everybody because you need to understand this is not about accepting someone's lifestyle choice, cosmetic decisions or whatever. It's not about that is that is irrelevant. That's cross dressing. That's irrelevant to this, right? Yep. That's somebody who wants to dress. They want to wear their hair. They want to change it. And that's fine. They're not even saying you need to represent, you need to understand this person identifies as trans or is a trans individual and need to be just nice that person that way. Because everyone sort of sits around and say, okay, fine, that's not that's not the issue. They are saying this is a woman. And if you say anything about this person being different from in any way a woman, you are the enemy. They are they are stating the most object and the most objectifiably obvious lie, objective lie. And you're supposed to go along with it. And if you don't, you're a bad person. I mean, this is a moment. This is a civilizational moment for America, folks. I hate to have to put it into those terms, but can we understand the most basic truths and will we defend them? Yes or no? That's what you saw in that hallway, the mob saying, no, you're not allowed to and Buck, I think when we come back, we can also point this out at some point, inclusiveness begins to exclude. And I think that's where we are. What I mean by that is on the bounds of inclusiveness, men who identify as women are now replacing actual biological women real from women's athletics. Their inclusiveness is now excluding women. That's where we are. Asset managers, names you know, they're using your retirement funds to further their ESG agenda last year, state treasures across the nations and a message to stop playing politics with our pensions by divesting $5 billion from these companies. 25 states are suing to block ESG nonsense from endangering your retirement. Republicans on Capitol Hill recently passed the bill blocking the Biden administration from allowing huge asset managers to use your hard earned money to further their ESG agenda. But while conservatives in the house and Senate have your back president Biden used his veto pin to kill this bill a couple of weeks back, that's when Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who voted to block ESG investing, blasted Biden's veto is infuriating, charged it put a radical and progressive agenda ahead of the country's needs. These firms have a fiduciary duty to maximize returns. They should be held to account for playing politics with our pensions and doing it without our consent.

Welcome back in play Travis Buck Sexton show. I think it's starting to cut through Buck that when you're called anti-trans and I just want to make this clear I was just on Fox News and I think I think I'm gonna that clip is eventually going to be circulating and people are going to be like oh it's going to be fun um my little spicy out there but it is not anti-trans to believe that there should be limits to the transgender agenda. Buck and I both would say if you're an adult and it makes you happier to identify as a different gender you should have that right we're not saying like that shouldn't be able to occur but there's a difference between saying hey if you're 24 and you want to decide that you're a girl that's okay and saying hey if you're 14 your breast should be removed to ensure that you are able to be a part of the trans agenda and also there's a big difference between saying hey your inclusion now is so expansive that it's excluding women and that's where I just think this is going to be a crucible moment because I think it's going to really strike a lot of people out there that simply saying men shouldn't be able to compete against women and athletics is worthy of getting beaten up like what's happening to Riley Gaines. I mean I would agree I think with everything there I would just would I would add that you know no because because the whole identify as trans thing you can change your name dress however you want do whatever you want with your hair you know all that stuff that is all fair game for anybody we live in a free country but I don't the pronoun thing no not going to do the pronoun thing the you know when you change your pronouns the I want to change in the locker room with the sex that I identify with no not going to do you know you got it you got to draw the lines on these things and be willing to deal with the pushback which as you see these people it was a psychosis in that hallway against Riley Gaines. See these people completely lost their minds I wouldn't act that way you know you know I mean I I had I don't even want to say I can't even think of an issue in contemporary America that somebody would be invited by college students to come speak at a college and I would think that I could form a you know a mob in the hallway I mean what do they think they're doing? You're right I mean and this comes back to in general if you protest a speaker you're a complete total loser in my humble always opinion right on a college campus because college is supposed to be about confronting all different sorts of ideas and exploring them right you may not like it there are all sorts of people who showed up on college campuses buck when you and I were there that we would have disagreed with I'd never in my wildest imagination would have been like I have to go shout them down so that their opinions can't be heard. I had to go from class to class at Amherst to hear some hateful commies talk about how much they hate America the professors okay yes so this idea that I can't handle what they say I just sit there while they spewed nonsense about all kinds of stuff I remember when a professor told us on 9-11 when people were finding out that loved ones weren't going to make it out of the rubble that it was America's fault that's what they said to the whole school at my school yeah all right my friend's inflation continues to push the prices up on everything there's an exception to that though and it's pure talk cell phone service for more than four years now their plan hasn't changed for $30 a month you can get a limited talk text and plenty of data the average size family saves almost a thousand dollars a year when you make the switch from AT&T Verizon or T-Mobile to PureTalk you're going to discover how great their US-based customer service team is keep your phone and your number PureTalk cares about supporting our military CEO is a US veteran and when you become a PureTalk customer you have an option to support America's warrior partnership to help prevent veteran suicide PureTalk is an all-American company that cares about creating American jobs make the switch today it's what I do it's my cell phone company dial pound 250 say clay and buck and say 50% off your first month dial pound 250 and say clay and buck welcome back to clay and buck so just to recap where we are right now the Biden administration put out a title 9 rule change now this takes a while there's a comment period but they are intending to make it so that there can be no blanket ban on the men competing no one's word we always point this out bureau you know a trans man who's a biological female you want to go play on the men's teams good luck see if you can make them at the college level that's not really a concern I guess it could happen but obviously men dominating and therefore destroying at the elite level women's athletics is a problem it's very real the Biden administration wants to make sure that there are 230 pound guys with long hair who can play women's rugby and crush all the females on the field Biden thinks that's inclusive Biden thinks that's you know what what mean what needs to happen in this country what it means to be a good person and we had Riley Gaines as we talked about in the videos up at clay and buck.com you do need to see this video if you have not already it's troubling I mean you know I talked to some family members who saw it this morning it's it stays with you because you can tell these these people are all of them not there's a trans individual who attacked Riley physically which is a crime by the way this isn't just oh but they disagree that is a violation of law and that person should be punished but everybody who was shouting at her screaming at her is crazy there's something wrong with these people there is a vicious mob mentality that's on display and there's something bigger that's going on here too we still have not been told what the motive was for the Nashville school shooter we've been talking about likely motives from the verse another trans in this case an alleged trans terrorist whose name is William Whitworth goes by Lily so this is a male to female I'm just gonna say they make this really hard when you're reading through in the Daily Mail and these other places clay the pronouns are you know it's a she but it's a he but it's a William but it's a and they say how dare you dead name or whatever you know James is my first name I don't get all upset if somebody calls me James all right they need to calm down with this dead naming thing so it's ridiculous okay adults don't get so upset when they're called by the name that's actually the name on their driver's license or has been for a long time but play this individual transgender transgender by the way they're describing as a transgender teen 19 also known as an adult yeah all legal purposes and all 50 states okay except for drinking and renting a car but a transgender 19 year old in custody William Whitworth was planning multiple school shootings had in his possession the communist manifesto left his own manifesto about the shootings that he was going to commit at multiple schools and churches planned all of this out this is all according to the reports right now this is all alleged obviously hasn't been this hasn't been proven in a court of law called Donald Trump a con man said the sandy hook shooter Adam Lanza was smart this is all from so this information's already come out just about this individual so we have a left wing communist trans would be terrorist in custody people are starting to wonder how many of these incidents do we have to see before we get to have a national conversation about the social costs of elevating severe mental illness and telling people who have a condition of mental illness that they are on the brink of extermination because of Christians and right wing people it's it look the Biden administration has tried to convince you for years that white men are the biggest threat that America faces today that Donald Trump supporters are trying to destroy the fabric of this country the fact that we are coming up on two weeks since the trans shooting in Nashville and that we still do not have that manifesto is to me frankly unacceptable also buck look at all of these different trans shooters that we now have I think this is like the sixth or seventh different trans shooting given how tiny the percentage of trans shooters are in America there is now an argument to be made that on a per capita basis the most violent people in America are trans and so and again I think this is important for people to understand out there we talked about this last week they are being sold this trans community which features let's be honest many people that are mentally unstable because let's be honest as well the decision to change your gender is not something that is typically undertaken very often right particularly with surgeries and everything else but what they are selling what the democrat party is selling to the trans community is when they talk about anti trans bills if you and me and everybody out there who has a functional brain says hey we shouldn't allow trans surgeries on minors you shouldn't be able to get puberty blockers you shouldn't be able to get your breast removed when you're 14 years old they consider that to be genocide in their mind we are trying to erase the trans community by saying you need to be an adult when you make these decisions about trans surgeries and trans treatments and they're even trying to refer to it as gender affirming care as opposed to mutilation which is what it actually is but they are being encouraged to take up arms they're angry they're mentally unstable they are being sold on the idea that they are being erased they believe that there is a trans genocide underway and they are being told that they need to take up arms literally to oppose that and you're seeing people do that now tucker did a segment so everyone can go see a few days before what happened in Nashville about this this uh like crayon data agents group that no no the transgender group that was that was all going out and and training with firearms because yeah they're so look i'm all in favor of people enjoying their second amendment rights responsibly and learning how to defend themselves but the whole purpose of this group coming together was there is this genocide of violence against us as trans people so we have to defend ourselves that is a lie there is no genocide of violence against or genocide of any kind and there's no concerted violence against trans individuals whenever they talk about the trans murder rate in this country if you don't in i mean when you actually see what it is it's overwhelming involves people who are working in the sex trade which means that you have a higher level of violence in general for obvious reasons illegal activity people doing things you know outside of of uh what is what is lawful and it's just not even true and you look at the numbers that doesn't exist but how do people who are already unstable and unwell react when they're told society is out to get you and trying to harm you which they're hearing that from the White House they're hearing that from Joe Biden they're hearing that from cnn from the New York Times editorial page we just imagine for one moment i mean i know this you know you play the well what about this side what about their side clay if an angry 19 year old guy with a you know trump had and you know gadsden flags all over was found with a manifesto muttering about how he's going to commit violence to people around him and had detailed plans about multiple school shootings and a church and it was all about how evil the democrats were and you know the the political ideology was very clearly right wing it would be the lead story on cnn it would be the main thing talked about in the country right now does anyone want to take a guess is there anything on this cnn website right now about oh what is the main story on cnn is it the averted mass casualty school shooter attack by the trans would be terrorist no it's that Clarence Thomas took trips with a rich friend of his and didn't disclose them this is why cnn is trash this is why these organizations should never be trusted or taken seriously i mean it's unbelievable by the way it doesn't require disclosure he's allowed to you know go on vacation with a friend the whole thing is ridiculous but you know i just want everyone to see what's really going on here is there anything even on their web page i'm looking for it right now i'm looking to see if there's anything about no nothing not on the whole page clip so apparently a mass casualty school shooter attack thwarted by police is not a story to see in it thank you police in colorado for catching this well i think the family and friends call the police yeah turn this person in and by the way that's the right thing to do that's the right thing to do all right let's switch gears to your friends small businesses are known for being resourceful you're doing a little bit of everything in your time is valuable get refunds dot com

gentleman um you know you had a caller earlier this week that asked um where are all the men at um in regard to push back of you know the woman's face and the insulting of women and all that and i wanted to tell her where they're at uh for the last few decades um they've been completely indoctrinated uh emotionally castrated and they're on the sidelines where they were told to go and shut them out they're not causing problems and you add to that a couple of generations of feminazi type mothers raising boys you don't have to do a deep dive into froy to understand the type of psychological damage that does and you're seeing it manifested right now and and the whole gender dysphoria thing uh it's if they tell me what are the odds are but you're an odd guy or a clait what are the odds that 90 of all these people who have gender dysphoria um their parents voted democrat what do you think the odds of that are that's a great thank you for the call um you know i look i will say i will say this i mean i think when it's when people are very very young there's a very high correlation with the politics of the parent right the eight year olds who are coming out as transgender yeah all have at least one if not both left wing activist parents you know nine ninety nine times out of hundred but then as they people get older it's the system it's the colleges it's the society it's the people around them i went to college down the street from two women's colleges and there was a a militant indoctrination of women toward lgbtq plus ideology in a whole range of ways i mean there were stuff going on at those schools i tell people they said that's not true i'm like oh look it up you'll see they invite women clay to desexualize this is true they invite women at freshman at smith i'll start nayman naybs at smith college they call it sex-abition and they ask women to take really unattractive naked photos of themselves and paste them around campus so they won't be thought of as sex objects they post naked photos of themselves publicly so they won't be thought of as sex uh it's crazy the stuff that goes on at these places yeah no that's a really even producer alleys like really i'm like oh it's a real thing i've never heard of that that sounds awful by the way it's not good it's not good yeah i'm i'm i think what he's getting at and we talked about this some from the male side there is this idea of embracing beta maleness which most men reject because again men look up to other men who are bigger stronger and faster than them to the badasses of the community whether it's special forces whether it's athletes whether it is supreme masculinity right radio hosts right yeah it's true incredibly attractive radio host great voices this is like the alpha male experience let's be honest but the idea that these kids should not be able to embrace being men because it's toxic has taken root to a certain extent but on the riley gains front buck i actually think most men recognize better than even a lot of women would how crazy it is to allow a man to compete against a women and women's athletics and so really this i think is about a women are going to have to fight like my question on there's all these people out there who are feminists talking about how important title nine is joe biden just redefined title nine to include men i don't know if you want to talk about toxic masculinity i can't think of anything much more toxic than taking one of the true success stories of women which is women's athletes deserve essentially equal scholarships and then allow men to come in and take them away imagine if there was a move on the right to say that all affirmative affirmative action programs to be federally compliant have to take into account those who identify as a race outside of their visible racial or ethnic group imagine what the response of a left would be right if a republican came in and said you you want to apply for a minority scholarship play if you say that you're a minority yeah you have to be able to be considered for that scholarship they would lose their minds correct that is what has happened here except it is gender and not race they can't answer that question everybody is actually more complicated than gender as we've talked about before oh i thought more so but i mean you can easily use as an example Rachel dole is all who was yeah absolutely ridiculed for identifying as a black woman victor in colorado wants to weigh in on what we're just talking about victor what have you got for us thank you you guys covered perfectly my concerns about the trans alleged shooter potential shooter in colorado and the problems we have with with that i live here in colorado we're getting california cated more every day and the woke disease is growing faster than ever here and i'm really concerned i've moved on my young children 15 13 11 to a charter school that has no woke ideology and i just to give an example of the craziness that's happening i was at the boys and girls club picking up my 11 year old boy and i was a 10 year old girl in the lobby there with me and she pointed to the gay pride flag and then she pointed to a smaller flag next with bluer stripes and said what flag is that and i looked at it and i said that's a subset of the gay community flag but you don't need to worry about that so you're much older and then her mother walked in and heard me say that and yanked her away from me said don't listen to him and then i turned to the people running the office the desk at the reception desk at the boys and girls but i said why do you have that crap up here you have a 10 year old girl that's five seconds well that's the girls right so they're there this fall watch c-spans new television
