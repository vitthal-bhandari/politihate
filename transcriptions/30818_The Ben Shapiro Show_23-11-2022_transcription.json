As soon, literally the moment that there was a shooting at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the entire legacy media infrastructure every major Democrat in America decided this was the fault of Libs of TikTok and Tucker Carlson and Matt Walsh and Rizrufo and me and any other American who did not like drag queen story hour or who was not in favor of same-sex marriage or who believed that transing the children is a bad thing. It was all our fault. It was our fault. It was your fault if you believe that there's anything wrong with any of those things, then it is your fault if a deranged individual goes to a gay nightclub and shoots a bunch of people. Now, the narrative was crap from the beginning. It's crap because unless you are inciting violence, actively calling for people to do violence to other human beings, you are not responsible for the violence that they do. This has been the rule in free speech for literally ever. And yet, the left jumped out in front of the story before they even bothered to wait for any facts at all and said that essentially, the uptick in sentiment against the transing of the children was responsible for a mass shooting at a gay nightclub because this is the game that they always play. It doesn't matter whether the person was deranged. It doesn't matter if the person had a long history of red flags that were ignored by police. It doesn't matter whether the square peg fits in the round hole or not. The narrative is always and forever. My political opponents are responsible for murder. Therefore, there must be a censorship regime. That was the narrative. Now, all they had to do was wait for the facts. And it's important to remember this. This shooting did not happen all that long ago. The shooting happened just days ago. All the members of the media had to do was wait for the facts, which is in fact their job. Now, we, I understand we have a media infrastructure that rewards people who are first and wrong rather than rewarding people who wait and are right. That is just how our media infrastructure generally works now. If you jump on a story, and it turns out that you're wrong 90% of the time, but 10% of the time you were right, we remember the 10% of the time that you're right. And we forget the 90% of the time you're wrong because you were first. And that's the really important thing. And so there really is no disincentive for members of the media to create fully formed narratives completely in coincidence with democratic priorities and then to just run those out there. Because after all, if they're wrong, we'll just memory hole it. Three months from now, nobody's going to remember that the media made a complete mockery of themselves. Nobody's going to remember that all the media had to do was wait for a few days. Now, what am I talking about here? What I'm talking about here is the news this morning that the Colorado club shooting suspect is non binary according to his attorneys. Pouf goes the narrative. It's gone. Watch how fast the story gets memory hold now. According to Axios.com, the public defenders for the suspect in the mass shooting at a Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclubs said in a Tuesday night court filing obtained by a New York Times reporter. Their client is non binary and uses that they them pronouns and the media are confused and bewildered and puzzled because after all, this throws a wrench into all of their greatest hopes and desires regarding the narrative. Now remember from the very beginning, it was perfectly obvious this person was deranged. How did we know this person was deranged? Not just because they committed to mass shooting, which is deranged activity, but also because we knew within hours that this person had been arrested last year for threatening his mother with a gun and threatened to blow her up with a homemade bomb before the police arrested him and then didn't take away his guns. So that would be pretty good evidence of being a deranged violence individual who should have been on the police radar should it not. But we were told that didn't matter. There were full up heads in the New York Times saying this was not a mental illness. This was not about deranged violence. This is about nothing except for the broad spectrum narrative that the right is evil and must be silenced. And we need to shut it down, shut it all down. We need to we need to stop Elon Musk from opening up Twitter to evil in the various folk who disagree with us. We need to make sure that everyone we disagree with on YouTube gets demonetized. We have to make sure that the language of the right is never heard again, because that's the only way to assure that gay people don't just get randomly shot at a nightclub. That was the narrative and they ran with it. And boy, did they run with it. It has been nonstop blanket narrative coverage since the shooting. And now it turns out that the suspect is saying that he is non binary. And this puts the media in a huge pickle. It puts the media in a pickle for a couple reasons. One, it turns out the narrative is not quite as simple as they thought it was. Two, they now cannot claim that this person is mentally ill or deranged, because after all, they've created a system in which you declaring that you are a non binary human, a thing that does not exist. We are all members of biological sexes. That you declaring that you are non binary actually makes you more sane than in some ways you saying that you are non binary. What that is, that is the true you. You're not allowed to doubt anything. What the shooter says now must be taken as absolute verifiable truth. You have to take a face value this person saying that he is a they them. You must, because after all, you must respect the pronouns. They've created this pathetic logical box for themselves. Now, for the rest of us who live in the normal world, this is always a very clear story. Deranged individual goes and does something evil. Boom, end of story. And then when the person goes to prison and suggests that he is a member of a they them species that does not exist, you say, well, because this person obviously is deranged individual with mental illness like that. Okay, all fits in there. But now the left is confused and they're bewildered and they're puzzled. They don't know what to do. And so some of the ways they've been reacting quite quite fascinating. So Ben Collins, who's just the worst actor in all of this, he is the senior reporter at NBC News, who's blamed literally the entire right for everything that has happened right here. He's appeared on television basically saying that if you oppose drag queen story hour, which in fact is a wonderful, wonderful thing. He said this on TV that drag queen story hour is wonderful. It's where it's where little kids get to meet drag queens. Why would that possibly be? Why would you oppose that? Why would that be a bad thing? Well, he was also on your TV yesterday was Ben Collins suggesting that the Nazis are coming. That really what this is about. It's the evil people at Breitbart are calling for death upon gay, lesbian, trans people. He can't provide any evidence that that's happening. But you know, it's really the Nazis are coming guys. And you know, the Nazis, they really didn't like gender non-binary people. So if you say that there is no such thing as a non-binary gender, if you say that boys are boys and girls are girls, basically you're a Nazi. And because you're a Nazi, people are shooting up gay nightclubs. This is Ben Collins yesterday. There is a long history of this. I talked to this woman named Jennifer Merciaza, who's a rhetoric professor at Texas A&M. And she was telling me about this thing called hate objects that come up in, you know, pretty fascist governments where they take people they describe as degenerates. Right. And you know, before Nazi Germany was in fact gay and gay people, people who played with, you know, gender conformity. And they say they are contributing to the downfall of society. They are the reason that things cost more, that the crops aren't coming up. Right. We've been through this in the past. It's very dark. Okay, this pathetic person, he's a terrible reporter. And again, he spent just blanketed himself on TV talking about how the right was to blame for the shooting. It was Nazi Germany. It was Breitbart. It was Tucker Carlson. It was all of them. Well, this morning, he issues a couple of updates on the Colorado spring story. Just a few updates, you know, it was the last night, a few updates. The suspect is requesting to go by they them, according to court docs provided to the New York Times. The Colorado suspect was 15 when they requested a name change. So first of all, I love that the entire media has to immediately shift mode and respect the pronouns of a mass murderer. There are those of us who are like, no, that's a dude. And you guys are like, no, no, no, we got to respect his pronouns. We got it. I mean, sure, he just murdered five gay people and injured another 25 people. But the important thing, he's a they. This person's harassment by Edgelord's online was thoroughly documented on the hate site Encyclopedia Dramatica, which outlined a harassment campaign repeatedly calling this person a pedophile. They accrued some of those posts and mocked the person's grandmothers go fund me to send the person to Japan. I'm studiously avoiding saying the name of the shooter because this is something we do on the show to prevent mass shootings, something no one in the media apparently will do. We on this show, over our site over at Daily Wire, we do not mention the names of mass shooters because it gives them exactly the sort of notoriety and glory they're looking for. No one in the mass legacy media will do this. No one. It's amazing. And then they'll blame us, obviously. Encyclopedia Dramatica, the hate site that compiled years of records of online bullying of the Colorado Spring suspect updated the page when they realized that the shooter had an entry for years, adding that this person, quote, shot up a gay bar because he was tired of all the harassment. Okay, so the narrative is now shifting from Ben Collins in real time. So now the shooter, he's sympathetic to now the shooter had a rough childhood. Everybody was bullying this non-binary person. And that's probably why. So as it turns out, according to Ben Collins, the right is to blame because this person was a disciple of the right with no evidence, by the way, none. I mean, the media tried to try it out, not the relevant fact that this person was a psychologically disturbed human being with violent tendencies. They didn't care about that. They cared that his grandfather was a Republican politician in California or something, which is an amazing way to journalism. I mean, that's just high level journalism. Well, you know, we don't know anything about this person, but you notice grandfather was thought, what? His grandfather was like, excuse me, my grandfather, like, ran a one grandfather ran a clothing store and one advised people on speech writing at like AT&T. What does that have to do with anything? But apparently that was the relevant fact. The relevant fact is that his granddad wore a mega hat one time, not that he was a psychologically disturbed individual arrested by the cops last year. And the other relevant fact, of course, is that this person had to be a member of the right without any evidence whatsoever, no evidence. And then the evidence comes in that the person actually is non-binary because this is what the person now claims and apparently has been claiming and their responses. Well, probably if they are non-binary, they are non-binary, it's because of bullying. So it's still the right. So either this person was bullied by the right into shooting up a gay club or the person was a disciple of the right to shut up a gay club. Or maybe your narratives aren't so comfy cozy. Maybe they aren't so pat. And maybe you guys manufacture narratives because you want the outcome. You want the censorship. You want people who disagree with silence. Only the left does this in modern America. Only the left immediately jumps on instances of violence and suggests that half the country has to be shut up on controversial public issues, including transing of the children. Only you do this. It's nasty and it's cynical and it's disgusting and you violate your most basic obligation as journalists when you do this. Because again, you guys are the fact finders, right? You're above it. You're supposed to be the- you guys are the defenders of the American republic. You guys keep telling us this. You journalismists you. You keep telling us that this is your job is to bring information to the- how could anyone label you and enemy of the people? How could anyone say that sort of stuff? No one should say that sort of stuff. You guys are objective journalisming experts who focus first on the facts. That's all you care about is just the fact. Except that you don't. Except you don't give a leap about the facts. You care about the narrative. And so when you jump two feet first on a rake and it smacks you directly between the eyes, that's a you problem guys. You made this happen for yourselves. All you had to do was report the fact as they developed and you couldn't. You couldn't even wait long enough to do it. And by the way, you think that if they had waited for 48 hours and it turns out that the guy had some manifesto online where he said he was a big fan of Tucker Carlson, you think that he wouldn't have had that conversation? You still would have had the same conversation. He just would have had actual facts to back you. But you had no facts to back you and you jumped anyway. Because you don't care. The narrative comes first. The facts come second. That's all that matters to you. And eventually, Will Ben Collins loses job of course you won't. Of course you won't. Well, anyone in the media who jumped on this lose their job over this? Of course not. Well, just forget about it. It'll all go away. And a year from now, they will talk about how they are the objective journalismers who love the facts, don't care about narrative. They report without fear or favor that all they care about is bringing you the crucial information you need in order to form your views. But let us not forget, let us not forget what's happened over the course of the last few days. Literally yesterday, yesterday, this narrative imploded on them like the Hindenburg. Literally yesterday, the entire legacy media, all of it was doing this routine. So Nicole Wallace over at MSNBC. She was blaming Tucker Carlson for all of this, of course. I think Donna, the part of the story that makes people feel like it isn't about them should be thrust under the cleag lights. I mean, everyone that spreads hate and there are hopes who were named in the coverage yesterday. I think Tucker Carlson gives a lot of air time to hate for the LGBTQ community. A lot of elected Republicans do as well and this tragedy has not shamed them at all. Okay, by the way, I should note here, there are further updates on the shooter. Okay, his upbringing is marked. This is according to the Denver Gazette by a biological father with a criminal history who dabbled in drugs and worked in the porn industry and a mother with multiple arrests in California and Texas. Also, shortly before he changed his name, the suspected shooter apparently was a target of online bullying and showed signs of fascination with gay culture. Oh, fascinating, fascinating. Really well done, but it's Tucker Carlson probably is Tucker Carlson's fault. That's probably it. Meanwhile, MSNBC's Donna Edwards did the same thing blaming Tucker Carlson. I have real questions about these platforms like Twitter that continue to amplify and allow this kind of hateful language that then plays in to violence happening. I think, it has to stop and these platforms have to bear some responsibility for their role in contributing to it. And I don't even have much to say about a Tucker Carlson or anybody else who lifts up violence and glorifies violence against a community and then says hands off when it comes to violence that actually does happen in that community. They all did it. The entire legacy media virtually all of them without exception. And not just members of the legacy media and it was lots of, I mean, I care of swisher, the world's worst tech journalist is an awful, awful censorship driven tech journalist, supposed tech journalist over at the New York Times, calling out the quote unquote year long propaganda from the right against the LGBTQ community for what happened in Colorado Springs, of course. More than two dozen people were injured. At least one club patron attacked and subdued the shooter pinning him to the floor until the police arrived. Police now have a suspect in custody. He sounds, you know, problematic and on lists and stuff like that. A lot of the right wing is saying, don't politicize this right after the event. And I think I shall politicize it because this is a year of propaganda from the right that smeared the LGBTQ and especially trans community as groomers, all this legislation, all this hatred. It's, you know, Lauren Beaubert saying she feels this is very upsetting, has been right at the forefront of using terms like groomers and petals around gay people and trans people. And Matt Walsh, who is just the most loathsome person, I think you've ever got to meet is immediately saying, oh, that they're trying to castrate young people, which is crazy. Okay, so this is one of the more loathsome people in the media. By the way, it is chemical castration when you actually pump sterilizing drugs into young people because they are gender confused. Or when you perform surgeries on minors that sterilize them, that is a fact. Okay, but but Cara Swisher, she had she had somebody to blame, she had somebody to blame. And that's what mattered most of all. Or, for example, the New York Times, today, a columnist named Lauren Huff has a piece titled this holiday, I'm going to a gay bar. And here is the key section. When I heard about the news about the shooting at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, I couldn't help but think of the red rexputed by those like James Dobson. That's James Dobson's fault guys, focus on the family, they're to blame. We know what we're up against. We heard it growing up in church and at home. We heard the words they use in polite company about loving the center and hating the sin. We heard the words they'd used when they'd been listening to Christian radio or their actual minister or Rush Limbaugh or Fox News about abominations and predators and bathrooms and groomers on the internet and the words they use when they've had one too many, the names they call those who could be our friends, who could be us. The words we heard and were taught and were forced to read a whole lot of those words came out of Colorado Springs, the headquarters of Focus on the Family. It's Focus on the Family according to this columnist for the New York Times. And by the way, it's not just the members of the journalism in op-ed community. Right from objective journalists to the op-ed community. It's also your favorite politicians. So Pete Buttigieg judge, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is the failing secretary of transportation but also was gay, which means that he's amazing at his job. Pete Buttigieg, he was out there and he was making the same point. The idea is that dis-shooting could be laid at the feet of all of his political opponents. So you think the political discourse that's going on now is a contributing factor to this kind of violence? You can't target a group to be feared and to be hated. A group by the way, they never did anything to you but is politically convenient to attack. And then I surprise when a disturbed person or who knows goes out and follows that through with physical violence. There has always been a relationship between the social and political demonization of a group. And that group's vulnerability to being physically attacked. Oh, so, oh, okay. It probably has evidence to back that, right? No, no, he has no evidence to back that at all. But he did tweet about it as well, just to make clear that this is what Pete Buttigieg thinks. The secretary of transportation of your federal government, he tweeted the same thing quote, if you're a politician or media figure who sets up the LGBTQ community to be hated and feared, not because any of us have a harm but because you find it useful. Don't you dare act surprised when this kind of violence follows. Don't you dare act surprised. Why it's almost as though you had an agenda and the agenda is that we have to support and celebrate everything you want us to support and celebrate or you're going to blame us for murder. Well, I'm sorry that your narrative fell apart. I'm sorry that I'm sorry reality happened to you. I'm sorry that you guys decided that you were going to jump on a narrative because it was convenient and because you want it promoted and not just convenient, useful to you. We'll get to more on this in just one second. First, the holidays are the best time of the year. But if you want to enjoy them to the fullest, you need to get your best sleep every single night.

Alson Camarado was reporting that the shooter in this case in his court filings says he is they and that he's non-binary. On this clip, there'll be a couple of points where you hear that is CNN not doing what we do here at Daily Wear on the show. That is CNN saying the shooter's name. We don't do that on the show as I've explained already because again, we don't wish to give notoriety to people who desperately seek notoriety. It is just another incentive for them to go out and commit shootings like this. But there's pretty good social science on that. Because again, we care about mass shootings, but apparently members of the media very often care not. Let's say they don't care enough to either wait for the facts on them or to stop using the names of the shooters glorifying them. In any case, Alson Camarado reports on this and you can see how upset they are that the narrative just collapsed in on them like a dying star. Attorneys for the accused shooter say in new court filings tonight that the suspect now identifies as non-binary. In a footnote to a motion asserting legal privileges, the public defenders say quote, is non-binary. They use they, them pronouns and for the purposes of all formal filings will be addressed as. So in other words, not Mr. or Ms. Joining me now, CNN political commentator, Errol Lewis, also back in the Al Franken and Joe Walsh, I don't know what to say about that. I mean, that's not anything that we had heard from his background. People have been looking into his background and I don't know if anybody here, are you guys lawyers? I mean, you know, I don't know if I don't know what to say about that. I mean, that's what he's now saying. I love that they're all puzzled. What are we supposed to say about? And then she gets to she allowed to doubt the person's non-binary identity. By the way, I love when she says, well, we have no evidence. I mean, people were looking into his background and we couldn't find any evidence that he did. First of all, you didn't wait for evidence for five seconds before he decided to label this person a right wing fanatic. So there's that. Don't pretend to give a bleep about evidence. You don't care. You're just upset because your narrative died. You're just upset because the thing blew up like the top of Nakatomi Plaza at the end of the die hard. That's all you care about. And here's something else. You in the media, you don't get to do it. You don't get to do it. You don't get to say, well, you know, there was no evidence until five seconds ago that this person was non-binary. We were searching, we were saying, but I was told that the minute that someone declared by your standards and somebody was non-binary, we all have to assume that they were non-binary forever. We're not allowed to mention we're not all the dead name the person. In fact, you using this person's dead name would be an act of bigotry by you. Welcome to the world that you've created for yourselves. If narratives matter more than facts, then you don't have to worry about things like whether this person identified as non-binary 30 seconds ago or not. This was always a very clear story. A disturbed human being went into an evil thing. It was always clear. And all you had to do was wait for the fact and you couldn't. Now the story is about your malfeasance and it's about the cynical garbage that was pumped out there by democratic top politicians suggesting that anybody who didn't vote for respect for marriage act or anybody wants to ban the mutilation of minors in their state is somehow complicit in a murderous attack. It's about you guys now. That's what this is about because that is a broad national story. You want to talk about broad national things that affect everybody? How about the coverage of the news? How about politicians saying that half the country should be silenced? How about your political leaders telling you that you're a bigot because you don't like drag queens gyrating around in front of children. And if you oppose it, then probably you want people shot. That's a national news story. And that does affect everybody. And pretending that it doesn't is a joke. It's amazing, amazing stuff. And meanwhile, speaking of our great moral leaders over in the media. So today there is another horrific bombing. There is the first bus bombing in Jerusalem. It's happened since I think 2016, but the first in Israel since 2019. A Canadian and American citizen apparently was killed. He's a 16 year old boy into Aria Shekapek. He's a Canadian kid. He was just going to school that day on the bus and he was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist. 19 other people have been injured, including an American citizen. I don't expect that the Biden administration will launch some sort of FBI investigation into who actually conducted this. And whether there was complicity from the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, we send hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority and we send financially to Hamas as well, by the way. But I just like to point out here that our clear eyed members of the media, they really are quite moral and amazing. So first you have members of the media who suggest this is an attack on quote unquote Israelis. First of all, an attack on Jews who is directed against Jews and many of the people who are injured are not actually Israeli citizens. Americans are Canadians. But beyond that, it was just yesterday that Whoopi Goldberg, our great moral leader, over at the view, literally questioning on national television whether Hamas and the Taliban are terrorist groups after all terrorism is in the eye of the beholder. She tweeted something comparing the US, Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban as all terrorist organizations. And she has maybe way more knowledge and experience in the very complicated Middle Eastern relations. But I did find that being on a foreign committee and comparing the country to a terrorist, known terrorist, those are organized terrorist communities that not Israel, but Hamas and the Taliban. That depends on who you talk to. Right. Well, I mean, those are there. That's how they're recognized as as terrorist. And what does that depend on who you talk to? Yeah, in this country, right. It depends on who you talk to. Says Whoopi Goldberg, by the way, what they're talking about there is Ilhan Omar at one point in a tweet lumped together Hamas, the Taliban, Israel in the United States. Okay, and Whoopi Goldberg because she has to defend Ilhan Omar because she's a member of the radical intersectional left. She said, well, our Hamas and the Taliban. Yes, they're terrorist groups. Yes, they're terrorist groups. I should I should just note here, that Whoopi Goldberg has had no such compunction in the past about labeling her fellow Americans terrorists. There's just a few months ago that she labeled House Republicans domestic terrorists. When the chairman of the Judiciary Committee says that Antifa is a myth, that is giving cover. How long until mainstream Christianity is deemed domestic extremism? The problem is not that the Republican Party is racist. It's that the Republican Party won't call out the racist and it's missed. When did Washington really get to be replaced? We're stopping domestic terrorism is divisive. I guess when they're part of the problem. The terrorists are voting on the bill. When the domestic terror got it guys, according to Whoopi Goldberg, Hamas, the Taliban, not terrorists, Republicans who vote against an overbroad bill targeting quote unquote domestic extremism that may wrap into it a bunch of people who just disagree. Those people are the real domestic terrorists. Slow clap, slow clap for Whoopi Goldberg and the rest of the geniuses over at the view. A woman so brilliant that she literally believes everyone on earth is racist except for Hitler. Remember she once suggested that the Holocaust was not racist because Jews are white people. Okay, meanwhile, Anthony Fauci did his final press conference as a member of the Federal Administration yesterday. And it was a tearful moment for all involved. There were tears, there was laughter. There's a weird incident where people actually tried to ask him a tough question and Karine Jean-Pierre jumped in front of that question like a bodyguard taking a bullet. It began with Karine Jean-Pierre praising Anthony Fauci as one of our great public servants who had completely blown everything during the pandemic. But apparently he did an amazing job according to Karine Jean-Pierre. Whether it be HIV AIDS, Ebola or COVID-19 for close to four decades and under seven Republican and Democratic presidents, Dr. Fauci has always led with the science and our country is stronger and healthier because of his leadership. Amazing. And then Dr. Ashishu Shah, who is the current COVID coordinator, he came out and praised Fauci as well because there's nothing I love better than people on the public payroll as bureaucrats praising one another. It's great. I urge you to visit vaccines.gov to find a location where you can easily get an updated vaccine and please do it as soon as possible. Thank you. Well, it's hard to follow Dr. Fauci who I would argue has been the most important consequential public servant in the United States in the last half century and a leader and a role model for so many of us. So Tony, thank you. What a leader and what a role model, a person who blew it along every step of the way, who flip-flapped on every major issue, and then who posed himself as the science if you doubted any of the things that he was saying. By the way, he said a bunch of stuff that wasn't particularly accurate yesterday did Anthony Fauci. So first, there was this incident that was pretty amazing where a reporter demanded that Anthony Fauci actually answer some questions about the origins of the virus. Now, Anthony Fauci has been wildly and curious about the origins of the COVID virus in the first place. The evidence suggests at this point that there is a significant possibility, if not probability, that the Wuhan virus was originally developed in a Chinese lab. That it was essentially a piece of gain of function research that got loose because of bad protocols. What we do know is that the Chinese government then covered it up probably since October. If that's on me, that's Scott Gottlieb, who's a moderate former head of the FDA. In his book, he talks specifically about how China essentially hid this thing for months and months and months while it ran wild throughout Wuhan, and then eventually infected the entire world, killing probably four or five million people. But Anthony Fauci has been questioned significantly about the beginnings of the Wuhan virus, because after all, he's been an advocate of gain of function research to the point where the NIH was actually given grants to labs in China to do gain of function research. And if those grants weren't the ones that actually led to the gain of function research that led to COVID, money is fungible and being part of the broader project is kind of a problem. Now, again, Anthony Fauci has been wildly in curious about the origins of the virus. He just keeps saying over and over that it was a wet market that drove all of this. The evidence there is dicey at best. The White House is like, we're not even answering questions about this. You stop attacking Anthony Fauci by asking him actual questions. Stop that right now. You have your question. You should allow her to answer. It's a good journey. It's a good journey. It's a good journey. It is not your turn. It is not your turn. You can't answer the question. You can take a press briefing. You need to call from people across the room. She has a valid question. She's asked about the origin of COVID. I hear the question. The best person to answer. I hear your question, but we're not doing this the way you want it. This is the disrespect. It is. I'm done. Simon, I'm done. I'm Simon. I'm done. I'm done with you right now. I'm done with you right now. I like a school arm. Solid stuff right there. You might wait. I thought that was an attack on the press. With Kaylee McEnany, it said, I'm done with you right now. I'm not going to answer your questions. You're being rude right now. And it was the end of the world. You recall that Jim and Cost actually did this during a press conference with Donald Trump. Or somebody took the microphone away. And this was the end of the Republic. We have the White House press secretary telling people they can't ask Dr. Fauci questions about the origins of the virus. I'm done with you. We're not doing it your way. And that apparently, according to the press, is just fine with them. Thank you, sir. Or Madam. May I have another? And just a second, we'll get to some of the actual medical misinformation spewed by Dr. Fauci yesterday. There was some of it. We'll get to that in a moment.

And after everybody massaged Anthony Fauci, he actually went out there and talked about what we should do this Thanksgiving. So first of all, let me just remind you, if you are deeply worried about COVID at this point, and you're not a person with a very severe preexisting condition, you're being a paranoia. Amakran is not nearly as deadly as Delta. He's not nearly as deadly as the regional variant. Virtually everybody in the United States has had COVID at this point, if not once, then twice. A huge percentage of people who are vaxxed also had COVID. I was twice vaxxed. I had COVID. My parents were thricevaxed, and they had COVID. I think the vaccines at this point are not proving durable against infection. They just are not. Now, you can make the case that the vaccines were helpful for people with preexisting conditions and above the age of 65 and preventing severe illness and death. And the stats tend to show that. That's fine. But at this point, everybody who's going to get a vaxx has been vaxxed. Everybody who's had Amakran has had Amakran, which means that they already have a level of natural immunity. But Anthony Fauci is still out there saying that you should be vaxxed, you should be testing. Like we're just going to do this forever according to Anthony Fauci. First of all, everybody should be vaccinated and boosted with flu and with COVID. Whether or not you wear a mask or another thing we shouldn't underestimate is testing. So when we're gathering at a family gathering for Thanksgiving or for Christmas or for any other holiday as we get into the winter, it makes sense that you might want to get a test that day before you come into a place in which you might be infected and spread it, or other people who might be there. So we're just going to do this literally for all time. And then he said, by the way, if there is a wave of death, if there is a wave of death, blame the unvaccinated. First of all, like everyone's had Amakran at this point, who are you talking about? What is the sub population of Americans who have not been vaxxed and also have not had Amakran? That's like eight people in the United States at this point by available data. A huge number of Americans, by the way, had already had COVID long before testing was even available and already have a level of natural immunity. We're still going to do this routine like you need to go get the shots, get the shots, because Anthony Fauci told you to get the shots, go get more shots. So there is a relatively smaller difference in vaccinated and unboosted versus vaccinated plus boosted. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get boosted. But the real danger isn't the people who have not been vaccinated. So that's where we expect if we're going to see a problem this winter, it's going to be among those people. That way he keeps telling people to get boosted, vaccine boosted, vaccine boosted. Wait, what he says there, he's admitting that the boosters don't do all that much. So for my own family, I asked that my parents, my parents are above the age of 65. I asked Dr. Marty McCarry over at Johns Hopkins University whether he would recommend a booster for my parents. And he said the data isn't there. In fact, it might weaken your actual natural immunity to get a booster if you are above the age of 65. The data just aren't there at this point. In fact, we know that the CDC has released data on the new bivalent booster. It doesn't look good at two to three months. According, Tracy Hugg, who is a PhD in epidemiology and public health, she points out that they used test negative design to actually likely overestimating effectiveness of bivalent boosted people. Because apparently they have a lower threshold to test. And the vaccine efficacy is still only 20 to 30% in people above the age of 65. That's like the best available data. That's the stuff that you're supposed to be super excited about, is that if you're above the age of 65, and if you've had greater than two doses, your vaccine efficacy effectiveness against symptomatic COVID infection is increased by wait for 22% if you had more than two doses. Those are not good numbers gang. And yet you have Anthony Fauci still out there pushing. And by the way, you should mask too. You should still mask. So April Ryan, who is one of these paranoid acts, still wearing a mask in the White House press briefing room, known around her is masked, by the way. And that mask is not tight enough to actually protect her well. She says, I hate to break it to her, but that mask is not going to prevent her from getting COVID. Anyway, here she is explaining sitting directly next to other human beings, all of whom are unmasked that probably we should keep masking forever. On the issue of COVID and mask wearing. We're not talking about mask wearing in this moment. Masks and the word masks have become a pejorative in some parts of this nation. Can you talk about the importance of mask wearing as you're worried about the holidays and people gathering together? And then Anthony Fauci said, well, it is true that we do love masks and ask for amazing. We need more masks. Now, why exactly are folks on the left continuing to do some folks on the left continuing to do this this COVID emergency garbage? Maybe one reason is because they keep using COVID emergency as a rationale for massive government spending. So Joe Biden yesterday explained that he's actually going to extend the payment pause on student loan debt. Now, he doesn't have the legal rationale to do this. We're not in the middle of an emergency. You can't do this. And now he has also been claiming, by the way, he's claimed two separate justifications for why he gets to pause student loan payments. One is based on like the GI bill. He's saying people who served in the military, we have the power to suspend their student loans. So for everyone, we should be able to do that. No, that's not what it means. But here he was explaining, by the way, he looks terrible. I'm just going to put that out there. Joe Biden looks like the knight. Joe Biden looks like the guy at the end of Indiana Jones and the last crusade, who drinks from the wrong cup. Joe Biden is starting to look like that. It's not a great look, guys. Anyway, Joe Biden gave you an update. And we're going to suspend student loan, emergency management emergencies. Folks, I want to give you an update on my student debt relief plan. As Americans continue to recover from the pandemic, my administration been working to provide student debt relief to millions of working and middle class families across the country. But Republican special interests and elected officials sued to deny this relief, even for their own constituents. But I'm completely confident my plan is legal. But right now it's on hold because of these lawsuits. We're not going to back down on our fight to give families breathing room. That's why the Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court of the United States to rule on the case. But it isn't fair to ask tens of millions of borrowers eligible for relief to resume their student debt payments while the courts consider the lawsuit for that reason. The secretary of education is back considering the lawsuit or is an emergency. What's the story? Just going to continue doing this. Great guys. Man, they love emergencies. People in government, they love emergencies. Emergency is a lie to do everything well past the sell by date on the emergency because they love power. They just love it. And it never goes away. The power never goes away once you give it to them. All right, you guys, the rest of the show is continuing right now. You're not going to want to miss it. We'll be getting into the NHL, which has declared that trans men are men. Also, Ellen Siyaga, a fashion company pushing child porn.
