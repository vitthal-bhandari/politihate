I have my job to do. My job is to deliver you a great show. And that's where we're about to do today. We're going to talk about Justin Pearson, the one of the Memphis three. He's become very popular, or Memphis three, the Tennessee three. The three people that help organize the miniature insurrection at the Tennessee State Capitol week or two ago. The two guys, the two black guys that were expelled, Justin Pearson being one, Justin Jones being the other. They overtook the well of the Tennessee Capitol, the House of Representatives in Tennessee. And the Republicans expelled them. I think Justin Pearson has already gone through a process in Memphis where he will eventually is going to be reinstated. But as more and more information comes out about these guys, I think it tells a very important story about these guys are all actors. All of this activism is really activism. And what you're about to see, what we're about to show you about Justin Pearson, is he's what we would call a trans activist. And I don't mean that he's not switching genders, but he's certainly switching roles. And so let's just start with the baseline of here's Justin Pearson speaking from the floor of the Capitol of the House of Representatives doing his full on MLK impersonation. Let's watch this. Yes, I tell you, it was a sad day on Saturday. All hope seemed to be lost. Representatives with Ron out of the State House democracy seem to be at its end. Seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But oh, we have good news, folks. We've got good news that Sunday always comes resurrection is a promise. And it is a prophecy. It's a prophecy that came out of the cotton fields. It's a prophecy that came out of the lynching tree. It's a prophecy that still lives in each and every one of us in order to make the state of Tennessee the place that it ought to be. And so I've still got home because I know we are still here and we will never quit. Weaves is still is here and weaves was never squids. I mean this is full blown chicken George meets Martin Luther King. Full blown. And these people are phonies. They're paid activists. None of this stuff is on accident. This is Colin Kaepernick 2.0. This is Sean King. You know the white dude that's spent the past seven, eight years pretending to be black and an activist. Dr. Martin Luther Creme. Taukum X. That's Sean King. That's what we're looking at. Another Sean King. Another Deremakassum. Did you know that Deremakassum, you remember him from Black Lives Matter? Always wore the little blue vest. The LGBTQ soldier, the alphabet mafia soldier Deremakassum. This is just another version of that. I don't know Justin Pearson's sexuality but he's another one of these young people that's been bought and paid for and been outfitted for a clown suit and rushed out to the stage to go play woke and to go play black activists. And so seven years ago when he was a senior in college or something called Bowedin College, some college in Maine, but before he was Mr. Pro-Black activist, he was off in Maine somewhere going to college. Probably getting trained and transitioned while he was off in the Northeast. But here he is, compare his state capital speech to the way he was just talking in 2016 when he wanted to be student body president. Watch this. Hey everybody. I'm Justin J. Pearson and I'm running for president of PSG. There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year. One has to do with representation. How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to do this by partnering with organizations from the Bowedin Democrats to the Bowedin Republicans. I want to bring together different voices, dissenting voices, voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that we can reach a point of sort of the radical middle where conversation and dialogue happens and growth happens. Right now we have tensions on our campus that can all be resolved by understanding one another and creating those forms and those spaces will be a part of the legacy I hope to lead as the BSU president. BSU must also work better as a liaison between students and administration, not working for administration, but bringing the concerns, the values and the beliefs of students by listening and engaging with the student body to administration, not for administration. Next we really want to work on safety and security. This year has shown us the challenges we have on our campus and in the Brunswick community. So I want to make sure that we're working with BPD to build in security, to make our campus a safer place for all students and that includes working with people like Benji Douglas to make sure that we're working on sexual assault prevention here on our campus. There are many issues that we can work together to solve and that includes working on institutionally environmental issues. That includes building better connections with residential life, of which I'm a part, but I can't do this alone and we can't win this election without you going out and voting. So join the People's Pearson Campaign and let's chart ourselves to a better future. Thank you. During the Justin Pearson Campaign and let's make this college campus a better place for everybody. We're going to fight climate change and sexual assault at everything. Help join us. How you go from that to let's rewind just 20 seconds of of him speaking at the state capitol. You just saw this man seven years ago a senior in college. This is what Democrat politics do to that young man. Him at the capitol. Let's hear him again with his whatever Martin Luther King impersonation. Yes, I tell you it was a sad day on Saturday. All hope seemed to be lost. Representatives with rown out of the state house democracy seem to be at its end. Seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But oh we have to. This is like a Saturday night live clip man. This is a skit. They don't make this dude play dress up. Put him in Angela Davis's hair and gave him Martin Luther King's voice. Go out there and play black for the folks. We're going to put it on camera and we're going to build you into a star. And we're really going for this. Everything. I took a lot of heat early on in 2016 when Kaepernick first started his stuff and I said hey man this is phony. This isn't him. This is someone's put a battery in his back. Nike has put a battery in his back. Grow that afro out. Put some cornrows and we're going to put you in a little Wakanda Black Panther outfit. You run out there and play hyper stereotypical black man Colin. Colin Kaepernick sounds just like Justin Pearson. If you go back to his college days and the early days of his NFL career. And then out of nowhere boom. Let's put him in all black. Let's go his hair out. Let's put a hot comb through his hair and let's run him out there as Huey Newton. And we all went for it. That's what they think were idiots and suckers. And perhaps we are or perhaps they this whole social media thing. Twitter and Facebook and Instagram is so good at controlling and promoting group think. This stuff is embarrassing. Last clip I want to play you is just let's play a clip of him preaching. I think this past Sunday talking about the mother God and talking about ancestors speaking through him or whatever. This is demonic what he's doing. And who's the money behind it? Who's pulling the puppet strings? Is it us? Or is it the same group of people that founded the NAACP and put a battery in W.E.B. Du Bois is back and put batteries in Martin Luther King's back? Who's paying for this? Who's financing? Who's promoting this? Who's pulling the puppet string? Who's telling us this is how to behave in public? This is how to lead. Let's play the demonic clip of him speaking at the church. Well y'all I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord. I'm so glad to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning. Would you mind going ahead and praying with me now mother God create a God loving God holy God take this your servant made from dust and connected with the raw materials of Stardust to speak in this moment to say something that brings forward the word you placed into my heart. I accept my unworthiness for such a task as bold as this and I seek your guidance as you use me and speak through me to the ancestor preachers who made sermons from hymns, moans and groans and spirituals from the bondage of slavery speak now through this your descendant to the black women locked out being abused tormented raped eradicated and yet born a new and distant future in this country into a young colored boy named me I name you now my great-grandmother and a Ruth my great-grandmother Flossy my great-grandmother Evelyn my great-grandmother Lavigne my grandmother Pearson my grandmother Gwen my own mother Kimberly to the preachers who preached before me and will now unto my own daddy Jason my father my uncle my auntie before me to you loving God father mother sister brother sibling and friend preach if it is my voice I promise I'll lose it for you if it's my hands I'll clap them for you if it's my feet let them jump freezing you whatever it is God you use it so a word of justice and love might come forward in these moments this we ask in Jesus's name together we say amen this is sickening Delano has written a column about Justin Pearson and just what's going on with this whole class of alleged black intellectuals and trans activists and that has nothing to do with their gender it's just this transition that black leadership seems to be going through who gets put out there by the system by the puppeteers in Hollywood and in the media and in academia how are they how are they selecting these people and what are they doing I told you I have a young relative who's doing very well at a private Catholic school in Indianapolis being recruited by the Ivy League schools and and and I've said I question like why let her go to an Ivy League school and see her stripped of every biblical value she has and be programmed for this transgender movement are we sure you want to send her off to one of these Ivy League schools where they're going to convince her they're doing her a favor and then for doing her that favor they're going to require that she adopt all of their values that will have nothing to do with God I've asked this question didn't get the answer I want but this is what they're doing to our kids and young people they're being programmed and radicalized and turned into puppets and clowns to serve other agendas that have nothing to do with us and that's what Delano's column gets at today Delano welcome back to the show before we go full board just into your angle on this just your take on the don't they call this cold switching when you go from one voice to another voice and just just the transformation of this young man's personality your take on that well Jason I've been into the mountaintop I'm not even gonna do any more than that um I'm not surprised you know college is where a lot of people find themselves funny enough I remember being in college and even though I was an engineer I remember going to I think it was like a spoken word thing and I had written out part of Dr. King's mountaintop speech and I actually tried to to say it in in that type of cadence now I'm a New York I grew up in New York and a family from the West Indies so it obviously didn't take because that's not how I'm used to speaking or that's not how I was used that's not the type of cadence I was used to hearing but if you listen to enough MLK tapes or you know video from other other preachers particularly southern preachers you can sort of pick it up and mimic it but but I think I'll say this one the big difference between Justin Pearson and Colin Kaepernick is Pearson I think his father was a preacher and I think he has probably obviously more of a connectedness and rootedness with his sort of ethnic identity obviously he's cosplaying that's that's obvious but I think a big part of this is that black folk young black people men and women who build an identity on a pressure and marginalization but grow up in middle class you know or upper middle class environments with parents who love them feel a certain pressure to put on a particular facade in order to signify that they are authentic now we've talked about this when it comes to somebody like John Moran and that's certainly one direction you can go you can go the street hood direction but there's another direction where a lot of young people go sort of the the civil rights activists revolutionary direction and I think that's what Pearson is falling into and I've seen it it's again kids who grow up middle class I think we talked about this the other day Jason the guy who led the one in the protest at Mizzou a number of years back the black student who said there was so many racial incidents in Mizzou his dad was like the VP of some fortune 500 company but but when you're that removed because of your wealth from from the broader community you have to do things to show people hey I'm really down and I think part of what Justin Pearson is doing is remaking himself in an image he feels is more palatable to to black voters and and black culture more generally speaking so I mean it is funny it certainly makes for good content I think you know people like us are feeling we're gonna be very full after today because this is I mean you put these clips back to back and and it just goes to show you you know how much of politics is is purely theater it is it's a complete facade and and this is the last thing I'll say about this topic it works because he understands that many of the people who will listen to him particularly black folk are afflicted with the Selma syndrome and anything that can get people to think back to the 1960s works in to the benefit of Democrats so as long as black folk have our collective heads turned 60 years in the past they understand the democrats understand that they can fleece us right right now in in in the present and certainly rob us of our opportunities moving into the future so he's doing it to showcase his blackness and fit in and appeal to black voters but my problem and what I think you point out in your column today is he wants to appeal to black voters while serving the interest of the transgender community and the progressive agenda that has nothing to do with black people absolutely and I'm glad you mentioned his quote unquote sermon from Easter because he started with a prayer to to mother god and then it just devolved from there he had multiple references to transgenderism to trans health care to uh he he referenced a biblical pastor picking up yeah he said to you know we who are black we who are poor we who are queer about picking up the snakes of transgenderism so again he's he's linking this to a biblical text and and really you know my piece is about justin pearson but it's bigger than him because over the last month or so it is obvious that some memo has gone out from party central and every single black man on the left who wants to um attain or maintain a position of prominence of influence of wealth has had to bend the knee as it relates to to this issue and the central point of my piece is that the the black men who went from leaders in the civil rights movement have become followers in the trans cult and we talked about it last week with Kevin Galakistan, William Rodin you know I talk about it in my piece I added in Eric Adams I added in Torre your friend Eli Mistel from MSNBC Mark Lamont Hill the person who throws baby showers for men during his spare time down the line if you're a man on the left and you want to keep your position you you have to signal a certain obedience to this movement and and what they're going to do to pearson and what they have done already obviously the pearson is say look we will offer you something we will make you a prominent national star but he doesn't understand that that means that he can't speak out of against certain things so so he's got golden handcuffs as as they all do um and a rainbow muzzle and that's why they they will not and cannot speak on any of these issues and and and really what the left does is say we we love guys like Justin Pearson because Justin Pearson allows the left the liberal left to have a certain level of cultural competency cultural capital and moral authority because they can point and say the look at these black men these are black men and know what it's like to fight for civil rights right and and and they spend their days helping to push forward our agenda so that William Thomas now becomes the new Jackie Robinson and quote unquote gender affirming care now becomes the new effort to desegregate hospitals and these guys think that they are radicals and revolutionaries but as i say in my piece and i end off this way they are nothing but the black face of lupron liberalism it's this i i just in pearson your information about his dad being a minister i just how does his dad who maybe he's not in the picture anymore i don't know maybe he's dad maybe he's around but how does he square that transgender thing with his biblical upbringing and again that that's what i find so offensive is like i'm going to mimic the behavior of a minister i'm going to go to church and represent myself as a minister and part of my job requirement is to sell the transgender thing as consistent with scripture it can't be done but they're doing it and and and it's all because somehow they they've made our identity oppression and so anybody that can claim they've been oppressed we see as an ally and and it it's just it's amazing it's an amazing mind screwing over that they've done and mental transformation that they've done is that your identity is i'm a victim that makes me black not i'm a victor and i've overcome that's what makes me black it's that i'm i don't know the whole thing just it drives me crazy that this dude has any standing with black people or or with just with christians he shouldn't have any state it's all so unsound i think to answer your question Jason at a certain point we are going to have to have a day of reckoning with respect to the historical legacy and contemporary activity of the so-called black church now i'm not issue i'm not alvin brag i'm not going to issue a broad indictment that i can't back up with evidence but for the black churches that see man's greatest source of bondage as income inequality and systemic racism what follows from that is an entire theology around quote-unquote liberation and and when you have that type of liberation theology then to your point blackness is not just sort of a social construct but blackness is an umbrella that has underneath it all different types of quote-unquote marginalized and oppressed identities so so so that's why you know listening i heard i saw a different clip of pearson i think quote unquote preaching at another church last year and and he he included you know i think he talked about trans people and oppressed women and and it was all about oppressed identities and that's why he will say people like this will say some to the effect of you know god you know jesus was a was a was a was a black man god is a woman i'm sure in some churches particularly those of a of a pride persuasion you know god is trans and bi and lesbian and so on and so forth um so i don't think a lot of us really want to admit that because the black church has has been for much of american history one of the most revered institutions oftentimes naturally but certainly within the black community even people who don't go to church have a certain level of reverence and respect for the black church because of the role that it is played both in terms of spiritual formation and in terms of political activism but but i think what's happened since the 1960s is that the the spiritual formation of a lot of these churches i'm not saying all by any stretch but a lot of these churches spiritual formation has taken a back seat to social and political activism and that's why just in pearson sounds just like any preacher that you would hear if you were in washington dc and turned on 96.3 at noon and was listening to a sermon from ranking chapel from hollywood university it's the same thing the bible is not you know the revealed word revealed revealed word of god it's not infallible it's not inherent it's a set of stories all in a new testament is basically asop's fable with with a thin veneer religiosity so nothing is not is not history um they they love prophecy but what they do with prophecy is not it's not read Old Testament prophecy to understand more about the messiah the the christ that is to come it's read Old Testament prophecy to understand more about us black people in america in 2023 um so these these people just in pearson there's a guy out here in v so these these people just in pearson there's a guy out here in v how would john wesley who passed his um a a church a black church that the obama have have gone to at times the william barbers the oldest maulses the freddy hanes these are people who i call abou um enhanced they they engage in enhanced interrogation of the text because what they do is they torture the bible so bad that they get it to say whatever it is that they want it to say because they don't believe and they're practicing a syncretic religion where they mix a little bit of christianity with a whole lot of democratic party politics with um a pound of afrocentrism and then they get up in the pulpit and they say that the biggest threat to this country is white christian nationalism um so so it's not that these people don't think that the bible should have any impact on our laws they just get the bible to say exactly what their their party benefactors want them to say um and that gives them a certain sense of uh you know spiritual and moral authority thank you Delano uh thank you so much uh Delano will be here in Nashville uh this weekend at our men's summit looking forward to it uh Delano will check back within and well we'll check back he'll be here friday for the cookout actually so we'll check back in with Delano on friday thank you so much great job as always uh Delano's

see it because i've already seen it and it's good it's by the same people who made gods not dead and unplanned it's called nefarious if you've seen the posters or trailers it looks great if you're like me and you've seen it you know it's great it's a little bit scary it's like a horror film but it's not and best of all it's based on a book by our guy steve dace it's more like the cs louis book the screw tape letters i like to call it interview with a demon a psychiatrist is called into a prison to meet with a convicted killer who's about to be executed the killer says he's a demon named nefarious and the psychiatrist who doesn't believe in god or demons has to decide if the man is insane pretending to be insane or i won't give it away but let's just say that the psychiatrist is a little out of his depth the supernatural thriller is perfect for your friends who like scary films but more than that they love going to church you're going to have some great conversations afterwards nefarious opens nationwide this weekend starting april 14th mark the date and get your tickets now at who is nefarious dot com that's who's nefarious dot com we come back john hadley is telling me he has secured an interview with justin pearsons mama i can't wait for this john hadley you guys know john hadley he's the guy the guy that you know in charge of our little approval rating segments he says he's landed an interview with justin pearsons mama apis the secular world with the culture uses our imperfection our sins to shut up you you can't stand on truth and if all it was was imperfection it eliminated us from standing on true this would be a very quiet place i'm trying to be as loud as i can and as transparent as i can to try to inspire other men we know you're imperfect you know you're imperfect god's grace and mercy mercy gives you the right to stand on his truth and to speak that loudly into the culture we have to do it you can look around and say these guys have taken over everything they own the cdc the nih they got the president is transgender surgery for children colleges today or nothing but leftist indoctrination centers working fully against the bible what's the alternative so you're going to stop fighting today and you're going to let the government raise your kids and you're going to turn around and let them chop off your 12 year old daughter's breasts and let them sterilize your son and tell them that he's a girl and you're going to let them make the bible hate speech you're the last line of defense here because nobody else is going to do it and god's going to walk with you this is literally worth dying for i'm telling you so it's like everybody that's a nice little metaphor this is it if there's a hill to die on this is it the over the window has been moved right in front of our children's bedrooms and there are all types of people that are trying to climb up in the ladder and every good father should be on his post so that when they peek their head up over the window sill you kick the ladder back down let them know you move on to the other house because we're not playing that around here sometimes just standing up just saying no we're not going to do that not my marriage not my kids not my family not my community not my church not my cities just declaring that that's victory enough in prepping his disciples he tells peter he's like listen Satan desires to sift you as wheat but i've prayed for you we're going to face some ups and downs in life and we're not going to always get it together but if we stay on the path if we stay chasing after running after jesus running after his way he's even praying for us now i like it when you pray for me jason and tj i appreciate that but to have jesus pray for me that make me feel pretty good when you make it through this sifting process go back and strengthen your brothers so we all have a responsibility as men once he's delivered me through this i have a responsibility to go back and bring some other folk out you do a roll call to just let people know you're not alone be confident in your positions and we're going to inspire you we're going to eat fellowship listen to some music it's going to be the first of many roll calls that we do so we're looking for soldiers we're going to put on our best recruiting pitches for soldiers apple card is the

done some reporting here and some research and has allegedly lined up an interview for us with miss josephine augustis pearson the mother of josten pearson she wants to defend her son who we just played the video of what he sounded like in college and and what he sounds like now that he's turned into dr martin looser cappernick and so according to hadley and we're about to be joined by miss josephine augustis pearson the mother of josten pearson ma'am welcome to fearless with jason wit Jason whitlock it's it's it's good to have you uh your son apples don't fall far from trees i i see the resemblance uh uh your son appears quite fraudulent uh to many of us based on the way he talked and conducted himself in college as opposed to how he's handling himself now uh sir uh everybody calls me miss jose i'm the head deaconess at first methodist african church of bb king and hot wings where you may be saved but the chicken won't and um i want to let you know that my son is not a fraud he's not a joke or a hoax my son came to me and said mother i want to make a difference i said to him take two steps forward in making your boys heard he then said mother may i i said yes you may because down by the river side hank it hank it war frogs jump from bank to banky yes uh is there a time when you knew uh that your son was headed uh for this type of martin with a king like leadership did you recognize this early on you know i did for a long time he came to me and said the thrill is gone the thrill is gone and i said just then sunday always comes just like monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday it's nothing new just look at your calendar and i said we will rise rise like the great erection rise like the erection in the cotton fields rise like the trans women in the all-female prisons we will rise so that's what i told josten and he's been on it ever since do you think that josten could be the next brock obama he's doing an mlk impersonation but it seems like his star is rising in the political world do you see your son perhaps as president one day you know uh jason i think my son could do whatever he puts his mind to that is how we raised him and that is how he will go forth i do believe that my son is greater than brock uh my son will actually marry a woman uh you know unlike brock obama so i do think that he can be great just like the rest before him can't yes yes absolutely sir yes uh his sermon uh that he's given a church where he prays to a mother god and and speaks to his or wants his ancestors to speak through him many people are calling this demonic and not biblically sound uh is at at church church the first african methodist church of bb king and hot wings is that scripturally biblically sound doctorally sound praying to a mother god and and trying to have your dead ancestors speak through you well sir as you know uh the bible says to honor thy mother and father so when my son said mother god he was talking about me people got confused but it was really me he was referring to and when it comes to the great ancestors you have to be reminded of the famous words of that old bed rock negro yabba dabba doo yabba dabba dah kahahi ha ha ha ah all right shimika i've had enough i've had enough that was pretty good though thank you uh so much for that i needed we needed to lighten the show up me and Delano were killing him i do want to if you can come out of character shimika i do want to uh talk about another issue uh and i'm one that i do want to talk about another issue have you seen have you seen the video oh wow have you seen the video or i'm going to show you the video of a woman at target who got cold-cocked uh by security at target she tried to demand reparations at target and was telling some employee at target that they lived a life of privilege and she's owned reparations and anyway i want to get your take on it let's play the video as this woman gets cold-cocked it's safe for fire so what happened she you know i think that's your ad uh i don't think i'll replay it guys okay i came up i tried to verbally de-escalate she told me that she wanted to wreck it out and i told her we couldn't do that okay and then she said excuse me and i was like man like i need your backup or leave like but we can't do that for you so she started charging at me i came all the way back into my office into an enclosed space and i hit her in the face okay all right i have an all-on video man are you okay according to the manager's statement a cashier called over the manager by the suspect was kind of whispering asking her to make reparations regarding her groceries of over a thousand dollars the manager told the suspect that if she wanted a donation she needed to call in the morning this response led the suspect to become verbally aggressive screaming and forcing the manager to back into the cafe counter a security staff member intervened and told the suspect to calm down before the suspect began backing him into the security office while screaming inside the office the security staff member punched the suspect in self-defense and then called the police i'm probably i'm probably wrong for laughing but anyway your take was was this punch justified or problematic you know maybe she was hungry Jason and that's why he gave her a knuckle sandwich this is just crazy to me and listen i'm starting to think that the whole plan to shut down a lot of these mental institutions it was on purpose so that they could then take mental instability and use it to push their agenda what i'm seeing is people that would have been locked up or treated medically with some type of peel are now just running rampant and we're giving them these messages to kind of feed and feel that when you look at the person that shot the the bank up in kentucky he was 25 years old how at 25 do you feel so oppressed and depressed unless that's being fed to you constantly on a consistent basis we had kids walk out of the school i think it was last week you know talking about gun violence and me and some of the people that i graduated with we were saying it's not that we were like slow right because we never did any of this type of stuff when we were in high school it seems like we were even unaware of a lot of what was maybe was going on and i thought to myself i just think we didn't have this message of oppression that we were fed day after day after day i think that we went to school we learned exactly what we needed to learn to be productive citizens in the world and we were actually told that we could be anything that we put our minds to so it was about us learning and becoming smarter so that we could be great opposed to thinking that our skin color or even for myself a female my gender could hold me back that's not what our teachers taught us uh 20 30 years ago now that's constantly being given to these kids and this is a grown woman who i think that i mean she looks like she may be 40ish in her 40s late 30s you know i'm probably being generous but but you're right in terms of there's constant messaging i would bet and i hate to make generalizations without knowing for sure but i would bet this woman watches msnbc on a loop and i bet joy read is and al sharpton and that group of people want msnbc are constantly feeding her about reparations and what she's old and how she's oppressed and how she's a victim she literally let's play the clip of her saying that this was her rosaparks moment now this is her rosaparks moment rosaparks refuse to give up her seat on a bus and sit in the black's only section this woman is at target with more than a thousand dollars worth of goods saying she wants reparations let's watch her make this demand about or make these statements about this is her rosaparks moment to have a money for her station and her cute girls such as eating and locked out of things yeah we decided we were not going to have a bigger conversation i decided to take a stand this is my role as a park's moment dude then she says that you know she accuses the officer of being a gatekeeper holding her down let's play that fine you know what you know what happened here i know i just watched the video i asked to open a conversation and he's still blocking me out when you guys are protecting it now you chase the one employee all the way to the front okay you make contact with her body by pushing your body to her i just watched it clears day on the video okay he then came out and you followed him all the way back here okay making him fear for his safety you backed him into an office and you got in the face unfortunately where people who are backed into a corner they can choose no no they can choose to do the right thing or they can choose to lash out okay you were in the wrong here just so i held the line you did the whole line and i no no i i moved my line continuously i asked and when they did not respect they were gatekeeping me like the whole world has kept people and you were afraid to leave at any time absolutely but you didn't right absolutely so because it wasn't like the situation no you wanted something for a while you wanted something you wanted something you make a stand so they can change you ready to go outside if the laws are meant to hold people down you will fight for me mack away okay let's go outside okay try to give you the chance right now just like before you're elevating the situation which doesn't need to be it's already done it's done absolutely now let's out you're not europe people that look like you are done trying to get people that look like me no no she's been radicalized and that i know this is humorous but it's really sad it's we have played such a horrible mental game on people and convinced them that this country and every white person they run into is a gatekeeper or pressing them she accused an employee working to target of being privileged and holding her down i i it's sad what we've done and and i mean you can look at the state of california it looks like they're going to actually perhaps give people reparations and so she's being justified here by you know i don't know i think this happened in ohio but she's being justified here by politicians all over the country but particularly out in california and by everybody on msnbc she's old something and and all white people over something even the ones working at target they all have a better life than her and they all you know are awesome and great and if she could just have money she could be like them it's it this is like al-qaeda and and who the taliban radicalizing people that's what's being done to us yeah and she speaks very well she sounds like a college educated woman she sounds like joy read or nakohana jones jamele hill she sounds like any of these professor crump that would actually get on some stage or get before a room full of people and speak professionally and you would think they actually have some type of sense because she sounds sensible in you know in some aspects not necessarily what she's saying but in her ability to communicate she sounds college educated and so yes they have been radicalized and it's frustrating because i want black people to see and this is not me saying whether or not i believe we're old reparations or not old reparations it's whether or not i actually think they will give it to black people and when you have a president or had a black president for eight years and you got nothing i don't understand how we still think that they aren't playing with us and pulling our strings and making us puppets you know we're right here the year before another big election and we're ramping up the talk just like we did right before 2020 just like they did right before 2016 it's always the same thing over and over again and so it looks like california you know may do it i just don't see them putting five million dollars in the hands of regular black folks i just i just don't see that and i think it's just another trick employed to keep us on the string and to keep us acting ridiculous like this woman will this woman did and honestly jason if she was more determined to push away from the table she wouldn't have that small child dangling from her arm the way that she did it's you know what i said she got she's she's a woman you want to see in the kitchen on Thanksgiving and Christmas because she can get bacon grease out of one and maple syrup out of the other exactly i want let's play the last clip so i maybe of her finally getting arrested let's play that one it was either ed we can walk out peacefully or be we can do it in college i was he not know why was he not being arrested and because he said he could have called the cops he realized he had a choice in that moment she used him into his office so here's the okay we're done i need you to turn around put your hands by your back your honor do you have anything on your purse that's gonna poke us products or cut us no okay do you not watch this and go this can't be real this has to be a setup that she's an actor or she's just putting together social media content is is this is this actually real would somebody really go to target and act this kind of fool if you aren't the sweetest grape in the bunch yes you will actually go to target and act like this kind of fool this is like those that you see fighting in walmart in their uh pajama pants and bonnets you know we see this type of foolishness every day she just looks a little more put together sounds a little bit more together than many of them but this is an embarrassment and i hope she doesn't have any children that she's actually passing this foolishness down to thank you shameka gonna let you go great job as always tell miss josephina gustis pearson uh hello and thank her for coming on this show as well this reparations thing i go back and forth you know i could see california being dumb enough to do it i don't know how california taxpayers seem like if i would immediately evacuate california before i would be a part of paying those taxes to give away money and this isn't me saying this but changing is easier for you to say you you wealthy you know made money and blah blah blah but if i was broke i don't i i don't want government handouts it's going to destroy this country it's going to further divide this country people lost their lives sacrifice their lives generations will sacrifice their lives for our freedom to end slavery there's been a million programs from head start to affirmative action to all to all these diversity equity inclusion departments and all the corporate america that all these black women have gotten and now oh we're gonna cut a check and and i know people are gonna celebrate it and say oh this is well-earned and we didn't know who earned it not us i'm just sorry i lived in america i was not oppressed did everything happen positively throughout my time in america absolutely not was was there some unfairness absolutely with some of the air unfairness perhaps based in racism yes but that's true of everybody everybody Asians white people Mexican people everybody faces unfairness in life i'm going cutting me a big check for it based off the suffering that somebody did 150 years ago or even 80 years ago it's not good not good it's not going to take us to a good place all right when we come back we have another audience member not to kneel to kneel says she can't meet our requirements for when she can take but we got another audience member who wants to step up and challenge me on my thoughts i've filled out an approval score on the movie air the Michael Jordan Nike movie and we have another audience member that wants to challenge me on that is named christian beesac i believe lives in north carolina we'll do that next then we'll end the show christian beesac this episode is brought to you by columbia sports wear it's snowing again and that wind chill is killer but you're not worried about that because you shot the omni heat infinity collection it's warmth perfected with tiny gold dots that reflect your body heat inside and protect you from the cold outside no snow or chilly temps can stop you now go out anyway shot the omni heat infinity collection now at columbia dot com slash infinity all right if you've been paying attention you've been hearing me talk about uh our 70 seven-year-old producer john hadley in his attempt uh to get uh the audience more involved in the show uh hadley works out of a nursing home in uh st louis and he emails in and calls in suggestions and so we've been trying to make the audience a part of the show at hadley's uh request and so hadley has discovered another audience member who has downloaded the approval rating app who has a stupid opinion about the movie air i'm going to talk in detail about the movie air probably tomorrow with i've had pastor anthony go see it we've had bryse and grego see it steve kim has gone to see it uh but before we do any of that we're going to let the audience go first uh an audience member fearless army soldier christian basic bezak bezak bezak christian say your last name uh bezak bezak uh christian has overrated the air movie about nike he's given it a 79 a smoke show uh i completely disagree with your take this movie was a joke uh it was very matriarchal michael jordan's mother is the woman king part two played by violy davis but the whole michael jordan's dad looks like a simp and a wimp uh howard white looks like a simple-minded foot shuffling nothing to offer and and mike always see is the back of michael jordan's head i gave the movie a 57 you gave it a 79 christian uh defender rating yeah so i'm with you man i i get it the uh you know you have the adidas jackets uh you would assign with adidas i'm not going to hold you against that in this rating um but the um this is a simpler time man this is the 80s this is back when nike was uh you know sponsoring athletes uh what what a novel time uh but the uh i really look at the movie from a different aspect i think that some of your criticism was fair but really it's a focus on creative types being able to monetize what they do and actually get a cut of the pie so kind of like you know when the whole thing happened with steven crowder i know you did a two and a half hour episode on that which was longer than the movie i watched a week ago um and i think that that's really what you know speaks to my heart is the idea of even if there are a few aspects that even when i looked up the film they leaned in on for example uh michael jordan's mom more than was actually historically accurate but i do like the idea of family um and you know being involved with that he was just 18 or 19 at the time uh and i do like the idea of people being able to be compensated for the brand that they actually bring uh to a company christian you did better than i anticipated but i i just want to go back to again yeah i think it's easy for you to say easier for you to say than me as a black man i get so much of this worship of black women the fact that they when they got michael jordan's mother pretending like she's a housewife in wilma to north carolina and she's telling nikey yeah there ain't gonna be no deal unless my baby gets a percentage of every shoe sold like she's Lamar jackson's mama in 1984 that's just a pill i couldn't swallow it was all played to me and the again michael jordan's daddy was too simple howard white was way too simple and we got to see the back of michael jordan's head i just couldn't buy it so i'm gonna end with this very simple question do you think his mama came up with the idea of yeah my baby's gonna get a percentage of every shoe so she changed the entire shoe industry i know he must have had a good agent um but i think that's a lot of points to be putting off um i looked up on screen ranting all the the websites it looks like um she did play a role in trying to give me advice about how night he was just a better option but it did seem like the uh agent played a bigger role certainly than in the movie all right thank you christin good job i will have to give it to him michael jordan take him off screen we've had enough hadley so get him off screen uh i will say this i did read and do remember that michael jordan's mother did insist that he take the meeting with nike that was her contribution to the process david fall was super aged and put the deal together anyway haddley you're you're off the hook for the christian bays act might be the best of all these guys he he had a pretty sound argument uh art christian that works here said he'd like i kind of like him uh he did a good job play tomorrow we'll see you tomorrow one uh"
