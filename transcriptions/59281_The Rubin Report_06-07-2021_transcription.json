    "text": " Oh, hello there. I didn't know you'd be there. Well, I'm Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin Report Direct Message. Today is July 6th, 2021. Do me a favor, subscribe to our channel, tap that notification bell. Maybe you never know, our videos will show up in your YouTube feed. We possibly won't, but it's worth a shot, isn't it? Alright guys, we're going to get right to it today. We've got four stories for you. First off, you know this Joe Biden guy, he's the old guy who putters around and holds note cards when he's talking off and is confused, doesn't know what he's saying. Well, now people are kind of picking up on that, and a new poll shows that more than 50% of people don't think he's in charge, which is interesting because it's a question that I asked President Trump about a week and a half ago, who's really in charge, and then Trump actually went to a rally a couple days ago, and then he asked the audience. The audience didn't know either. We'll show you that. We'll show you the poll. The second story, critical race theory, which many would just say is an idea. If you're watching the Blue and On Conspiracy Channel over there on MSNBC, there's this notion out there that critical race theory sort of really doesn't exist, or it's not really in schools, and yet at the same time it must be taught, and it is their new religion. It's very, very confusing. Well, it is infecting everything, and that's why I keep saying to you guys, we must build new things. That, by the way, is exactly what I'm doing, of course, with locals.com, but the old things are going to crumble, and speaking of old things, the newest thing that has been now basically wholly infected by critical race theory, and we'll get into the details, is the teacher's union, which basically is just, they're going all in. They are just, we will bring racism to your children in the name of anti-racism, so we'll dive deep on that, and then men in women's prisons. It's the new hottest trend, and it's happening here in California, and you may remember, because we played the video during the election, Joe Biden said that it won't be up to the prison, basically, to decide who is going to go into what prison, meaning if you're a man, it won't be up to them to decide, it'll be up to you. How you identify, that'll be whether you go into a male prison or a woman's prison. Well, it's happening here in California, and you're not going to believe this, guys. There are rapes, there are murders and other violent attacks on women by biological men, bananas, right? And then finally speaking of bananas, New York, once the greatest city in the world, a place that I grew up, that my grandparents lived in, my great grandparents lived in at times. I talked about this in my book. In the early 1900s, there were dozens, probably around 50 people in my family lived in New York City, and in all the boroughs there, we now have one cousin left. Well, I'm fairly certain it doesn't talk to me because of Trump's arrangement syndrome, but we have one family member left in New York City, and why? Because crime is completely out of control, and it looks like they will have a new progressive DA, and he's going to basically decriminalize everything. Trust passing, looting, a whole bunch of stuff, and basically turn whatever decency is left in New York City, and it's hard to know what's left. They're going to try to turn it into San Francisco, and we've got videotape of San Francisco, and trust me, it's nuts. All right, let's start off with this Joe Biden guy, because it's becoming fairly obvious that he is not in charge. I mean, I think everyone sort of sees it at this point. He often, when he gives these press conferences where he has, I'm going to choose you, and you're going to do this, and he always has his notes, and he has everything's pre-packaged, and he's always reading from a prompter. But even despite all that, he is struggling to make coherent sentences, often gets completely sort of sidetracked and babbly, and just sort of stares into oblivion and everything else. The scandal, as I've been saying, is the non-scandal. The scandal is not that there's something wrong with Joe Biden. That is a scandal of some sort, I would say, right? Like it's a problem, would you say it's a problem, that the guy that we're supposed to believe is the leader of the free world, obviously has cognitive problems? Yeah, okay, that's a scandal. But I would say the bigger scandal is the non-scandal. The bigger scandal is the fact that corporate press, mainstream media, cable news, all the respectable blue check journalists, that everyone's pretending they don't see this. So the scandal is actually the non-scandal. The scandal is the fact that we're not really talking about the scandal. But the average person is picking up on it. So there was a new poll by Trafalgar Group, and we've got some info here from The Daily Wire, a new poll released on Monday found the majority of Americans believe that others are really running the show in President Joe Biden's administration and not Biden himself. 56.5% of American voters do not believe that President Biden is fully executing the duties of his office, while 36.4 believe he's directing all policy and agenda. So that's a pretty interesting poll, right? Over half of the people in America basically are saying they don't think Joe Biden is in charge. Now this is the same exact question that I asked Donald Trump as I said about 10 days ago, and he sort of said he didn't know, you know, is it the Obama machine, the Hillary machine? I don't know who it is. I don't know. I'd love to hear your thoughts on who you think it is. I think it is something like whatever is left of the Clinton machine coupled with the Obama machine, which is directly connected to all the BLM stuff and the Antifa stuff. It's just some really weird radical left thing, but like who's really funding it, who's really in charge? But the simple point here is that I just don't know how you could be a thinking person and believe that Joe Biden is in charge. He often during his ramblingly incoherent press conferences, he'll often say, oh, I better stop now or I'm going to get in trouble. I mean, you can find many videos of this. I'm going to get in trouble. They're not going to be happy about this. Who is he talking about? Like really, who is he talking about? Now I get it. He could be like being a little bit kitschy, right? It's a little bit like, oh, I've said too much, I'm going to get in trouble. And he just means it as a joke. But he repeatedly keeps saying it and it's usually not done in a joking manner. It's like, oh, I just said that, I'm going to get in trouble. And then on top of everything else, they are giving him note cards. Imagine if Donald Trump had been walking around for four years with note cards during those insanely combative press conferences. And by the way, I don't mind insanely combative press conferences because that's sort of what's supposed to happen, right? You're supposed to have journalists who are nonpartisan asking difficult questions of elected leaders. That's a beautiful thing. Now what we have is basically a bunch of journalists asking Joe Biden about how many scoops ice cream he had. And of course, when Donald Trump had two scoops of ice cream, it was a big problem. Joe Biden can have as many scoops of ice cream as he wants. Nice sense. Over the next couple of years, there's going to be a lot more soft food in his future. But the point is he walks around with notes. If Donald Trump had walked around with note cards, people would have said, you know, he has dementia or he has, you know, whatever other cognitive things. But for some reason, we don't talk about it with Joe Biden. And I don't know what we're going to do about this because it's a real problem. Well, Donald Trump is now back given the rallies, right? He's out there with the people. And he asked the very same question while on stage the other day. In just five months, the Biden administration has launched an all-out assault on everything we cherish and we value under Joe Biden and the left. I don't know if it's Joe, to be honest with you. It's somebody. Does anybody know who it is? Right. Like, that's more true. Like, who is it? Does anyone know who it is? I don't think it's Joe. Like, that's more true than most of the nonsense we're getting out of Joe or Pasek or anything else. Now, I do want to just say one other thing on this, which is that I would prefer that even if I disagree with Joe Biden's policies, and I obviously do, right? And I think I have a pretty good track record here. I saw through the nonsense. I saw my good liberal friends, whatever's left of the intellectual dark web crew or whatever else it is, the somewhat decent lefties all saying, don't worry, Dave, Joe Biden's going to stop the craziness. He'll stand up to the progressives. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, he actually was just a wolf in sheep's clothing, right? Like, he just has ushered in all of this lefty lunacy, printing money like crazy, exploding budgets, all of that stuff. It was obvious to me that he wasn't going to be in charge. And in some ways, that made him the most dangerous one, because if they had gone with someone like Bernie, it would be like, we all know it. It's like, you're a socialist. You're an old grumpy socialist, but we know what it is. We know how to fight it. Biden, it's much more confusing. But I do want to be clear about this, which is that even if I disagree with Joe Biden's policies, which I obviously do, and I wish perhaps that he was more of a moderate if such a thing exists anymore, as the president of the United States, you know, he is the guy operating, right? Like, he's the doctor, and we're all the patient, and he can do a lot of good, and he can do a lot of bad. And I would prefer that the guy that has the instrument as they cut into our body and move some of the organs around, I would prefer that he has a steady hand. I would prefer that he has the cognitive wherewithal to make the right choices and know how to operate and everything else. So when I say all this, I can joke about it in a way, but it's actually quite scary if you think about it, that this man is not in charge. We don't know who is in charge, and if he is in charge, if I'm wrong about all this and he is in charge and there's something wrong with him, then we got an even bigger problem, because he could put his finger on the button, anyway, there will obviously be more about this, but for those of you in the mainstream media that are watching this show, and I know you guys do watch this show, if you're on CNN or MSNBC or one of these channels, why don't you cover this a little bit? And it will be more honest, you'll approach will be more honest, you don't have to run out there and say, yes, dementia, you don't have to run out there and say there's something deeply wrong with him saying, but you can say that there's some questions that should be asked, right? Like, something doesn't seem right here, but instead what you do is by ignoring it, and then the rest of us seeing the clips online, well, then it leads itself to a bunch of people not believing any of the other garbage you spoof. So in many ways, you're kind of doing my job for me, but it's like, be a little bit better, could you be a little better, then it would be better for everybody, or is it just too late? I suspect I know the answer. All right, let's move on to this critical race theory nonsense. So, you know, one of the things that's happening over the last couple of weeks is that finally, because I think people like me and people in these circles and people online, it's very similar actually to the story that I just talked about with Joe Biden, because the online people have been exposing critical race theory for its neo-racism, for the systemic racism which it wants to put into the system, for the idea that white people in essence are born guilty and are guilty over the sins of their forefathers, or actually, not even for their forefathers, because no one in my family owned slaves. So why would I be guilty of what someone in my family did generations ago? I shouldn't be, and it didn't even happen. So they want you to be guilty by the color of your skin. They've decided the critical race theorists and the intersectionalityists at the Wogsters, they've decided that things like being on time and working hard and empirical facts like 2 plus 2 equals 4, that these are tools of oppression and white supremacy and everything else. Well, one of the things that's happened in the last month is as this has been more and more exposed by people online and Chris Rufo specifically, who I'm going to get to in just a moment, then suddenly the meme went out that no critical race theory doesn't really exist, or it's not really what you're all saying it is, or it's just not really being put into the institutions, and it's just sort of another right-wing conspiracy theory, sort of like Joe Biden has cognitive problems. Well, actually, we are seeing it infect absolutely everything. So Chris Rufo, who you guys know, who is a lawyer, he has done incredible work bringing lawsuits into a bunch of different red states, of course it's red states, to fight critical race theory in schools in that you wouldn't want children to be taught neo-racism the same way you wouldn't want children to be taught Nazism, that it's good. You know what I mean? You could teach about Nazism, that's a very different thing, but Chris is doing a great job with this. He sent out this incredible tweet, and I'm going to, he bulleted it out, I'm just going to read you some of it. So breaking, the nation's largest teachers union has approved a plan to promote critical race theory in all 50 states and in 14,000 local school districts. The argument that critical race theory isn't in K through 12 schools is officially dead. The union has also approved funding for increasing the implementation of CRT in K through 12 curricula and for attacking conservative groups who oppose CRT indoctrination. The teachers union has made critical race theory its number one priority and want to implement it nationwide. According to a recent U-GUB survey, 58% of Americans oppose critical race theory including 72% of independents who believe teaching it in schools is bad for America. But the teachers union wants to double down and impose this divisive ideology on your children. The NEA represents 3 million public school employees in all 50 states. They have a 350 million dollar annual budget and an army of operatives in 14,000 local communities. So we've got a little more info on this, but before I get to that, the key piece of this is that what we've been hearing for the last couple weeks is no it's not really in schools, no it doesn't really exist. Well now we know it does. The Gateway Fund, it's got a little bit more. Laws banning the instruction of critical race theory tenets in public schools have passed in more than 20 states and there is reason to hope that the tide is beginning to turn in the fight for the country's history and principles. Unfortunately, the Zinn education project refuses to accept defeat and desires to teach American children that this country was founded upon the dispossession of Native Americans, slavery, structural racism and oppression as opposed to the principles of liberty enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Now the ZEP is circulating a pledge to teach the truth which identifies left wing methods of analysis like critical race theory as the truth and decrees that the signees, all of whom are educators, refuse to be bullied into compliance with the law. So far according to the Zinn education project, the pledge has been signed by more than 5,000 educators in all 50 states and many of the signees were more than happy to provide their reasons for signing. So what is happening here in effect is that roughly these 20 red states that are now passing these laws to keep systemic racism, new school pernicious racism of the left, out of schools, there are now groups that are actually getting teachers to basically say we will ignore the law and we will teach the quote unquote truth regardless. This battle ain't going anywhere and I saw an interesting back and forth between Chris Rufo and James Lindsay who I've also had on the show many times who's I think one of the prime the prime purveyors of the truth when it comes to critical race theory. In essence James Lindsay was saying that he's not hopeful that despite the fact that he has now spent the last few years of his life fighting against critical race theory in many ways more than almost anyone that he's not very hopeful that this thing is just coming and coming and coming and it's going to get worse and we're going to end up in some sort of South Africa situation. Rufo tweeted back and said that he's optimistic and I responded and I basically said that I'm a world weary optimist. That's the way I always describe myself. I would say I'm an optimist because how could I talk about the news, how could I talk about the things I believe in every day if I wasn't an optimist, if I didn't believe that by me communicating these ideas to you guys that hopefully that gives you some of the tools to take the right ideas to your family and community and everything else and then build a better world. That would make me an optimist but I'm not just a blind-eyed optimist. I'm not just someone that thinks just because we say nice things or believe the right thing or fight for the truth that magically these things grow. I just don't believe that. So I would say I'm world weary in that regard. I'm a realist and my argument to them in effect was well look as a world weary optimist I don't think we can stop it but I think we can actually basically inoculate the new converts right like the new people who are about to be brainwashed we can do something to save them but this thing's here these diversity and inclusion programs that are in so many of the Fortune 500 companies that are most likely in the companies you work for or the schools that you're sending your kids to or whatever it might be they're here those things are now infected and cannot be saved. I really believe that because even if they were to be saved the damage that would happen in terms of saving them like how can you have an organization that believes that it's racist and was going to hire based on skin color and gender and all these things how can it reverse that oh sorry we got that wrong we're actually going to start hiring based on skill and passion and you know education and the rest of it you can't reverse it so the only thing that we can do is build new things and this is what I was talking about on the show yesterday in essence we really need a parallel economy and in some ways we need a parallel country that is not a call for America to split it up it is not a call for a civil war but all of us that that don't believe in this nonsense that don't believe in this neo-racism that that want to further the ideals that America was founded on which are worthy ideals to continue to push forward for for more equality wherever equality doesn't exist not equity equality I think we need to build new things and that's why when I started locals I made it very clear to my entire team we will never hire based on the color of skin we will never hire based on your genitals or on your gender or gender identity or any of these ridiculous things and by the way if you want to work for us locals.com slash jobs move down to Miami and we're looking for great people who are actually hard working and I don't care what skin color you are I know that's called racist but you know I'm old school what can I tell you anyway this story isn't going anywhere we'll keep fighting it but speaking of stories that aren't going anywhere you know the trans stuff which we end up having to spend so much time talking about because it's it's so I would say nefarious in the way it's put its tentacles into everything so I'll give you the stupid disclaimer just to start if you're trans and you're an adult I don't care how you live I don't care what you wear I don't care who you marry I don't care any of that stuff I don't care what bathroom you go to blah blah blah that being said I don't think young children should transition and chop off their genitals or do any other things like that you can watch my interview with Abigail Schreier if you want some more interview some more information on that and I also think that you still have to go to if you're going to jail you got to go to the jail that's your biological jail sort of like if you're playing sports you got to play with the people who are biologically the same as you that's just how it is thanks for the numbers here 0.6 percent of u.s. adults identify as transgender so I really want you to think about how much time the transgender argument takes up when less than 1 percent basically a half of 1 percent of people identify as transgender that isn't to say we should treat those people poorly I don't want laws against these people and I want them to find love and happiness and fulfillment and purpose and all of those things but we shouldn't break the entire system in honor of that well that seems to be what we're doing especially here in California we've got some info from Yahoo News a California law allowing transgender inmates to pick the prison gender of their choice has come under fire from a women's rights group citing abuse of females by men in a letter to evil governor Gavin Newsom I added evil the women's liberation front accused the state of violating the constitutional rights of incarcerated women by allowing men into their living quarters to prey on women since the law took effect on January 1st WLF has received numerous complaints of assaulted abused and traumatized women at the hands of male inmates transferred into their prisons wolf legal director Lauren Adam said so let's just be clear about what's happening here instead of sending people to the prison that matches their biological sex okay we are now allowing men because this is where it's happening it's not happening with a lot of women that transitioned to men to go into the men's prison right that's not going to end well we all know that wouldn't end well so what's happening is biological men who either are trans or are perhaps psychologically confused or are pretending I don't know we don't know these are people are criminals and probably have a series of other problems and drug use and everything else but I'll even I'm not even trying to make it about that let's just say you're a trans guy you're a man who's living as a woman okay that's just fine but now we're going to put you in women's prison and then what happens violent assaults rapes all of these things we know these things are happening and again why isn't it happening the other way where there aren't women who are trans men going into the men's prison and beating the crap out of men right like that's strange how it never happens that way right there aren't an awful lot of girls who transitioned to boys and then crush all the boys in wrestling very odd very odd but this shouldn't surprise anybody because intersectionality has made everyone stupid it has made everyone absolutely stupid and this is what wokeism does to everything so during the election you may remember this moment Biden was speaking at some big gay event and just listen to what he said yes and by the way in prison in prison the determination should be that your sexual identity is defined by what you say it is not what in fact the prison says it is and really think how stupid and dangerous and pandering and nonsensical that is but that's let's be clear that was the man who was to become the president of the United States who may or may not actually be the one in charge basically saying that what we're doing here in California is the right thing to do that you get arrested let's say you're bad enough let's just say you're a serial rapist you know serial rapist you're raped a couple women you know you put on a dress and then you go and they're going to sentence you and they say actually you know you've got lifetime in jail because you're raped maybe you killed a bunch of women you know you did some bad stuff and then you go oh well you know it's not what's you know my biological sex it's not what's on my identification it's not because I have the genitals of a man I'm a woman and I want to go to the women's prison well by Joe Biden and by Gavin Newsom and the other ridiculous people who run the silly banana republic of California you were going to send that guy to a woman's prison you think we got a problem here and you see how these stories are connected like this is directly connected to just destroying logic and reason which is exactly what critical race there is so that's what intersectionality is it's linking together these opposed depressions and within that link it then will destroy the teachers unions it will destroy our prisons and by the way once you destroy teachers unions and then you just you know in effect you're destroying our children's ability to learn and then you destroy the prisons our ability to rehabilitate people what what are you left with with the society and none of that should surprise you because I'll link it back to another story we did yesterday which is how the democrats were completely unable to praise America on July 4th and we've got people like you know congresswoman Corey Bush and congresswoman Maxine Waters and congresswoman AOC where they just basically couldn't say anything good about America on July 4th these people don't think America is good so they would gladly have our schools go down and all our systems go down and burn the whole thing down so we have work to do allow me to take a sip of coffee so as these things continue to crumble in conjunction with each other New York the state where I was born I was born in Brooklyn New York in 1976 Brooklyn when it was still cool not Brooklyn when it was you know hipster uh doofus Brooklyn I was in Brooklyn when it was cool I grew up in Long Island I went to SUNY Binghamton State University of New York at Binghamton one of the best state schools in New York I lived in Manhattan for most of my adult life and then in 2013 I moved out to Crazy California so I am a true New Yorker I love New York City as I said in the intro I would spend weekends visiting my grandparents and my great grandparents in New York City my great grandparents had an amazing apartment on Central Park West overlooking the park my family we really screwed up a real estate thing didn't buy it when they passed away and it now it's long gone although who knows what it's worth now and who would want to live in New York City anyway but the point is I love New York City like I love the upper west side I love the people the subways the smells all the craziness the pizza the bagels the whole thing well New York City is now absolutely crumbling and we should thank Marxist Mayor Bill de Blasio and of course we're gonna have a new DA who's gonna make it much much worse uh we've got some quotes here from the New York Post Alvin Bragg appears to have won the Democratic primary election for Manhattan District Attorney making him the presumptive new leader of one of the most powerful prosecutors offices in the nation amid surging violence in Gotham Manhattanites should be hoping that Bragg takes crime seriously although his biography is impressive his proposals give reason to worry digging further into his plans reveals some truly radical proposals first Bragg will immediately begin de-prosecuting certain offenses refusing to punish violations of duly enacted criminal laws these include resisting arrests trespassing, far evasion, marijuana possession, driving with a suspended license and any traffic violation for those offenses that are prosecuted Bragg announced plans to allow just about every offender to walk free the same day Michael can you go back there so I can see all the full list of the things that he's going to decriminalize so in essence what he's doing as district attorney and by the way this is what Chesa Bodine the ridiculous district attorney of San Francisco is doing this is what George Gaskan our moronic district attorney here in Los Angeles is doing who was the DA in San Francisco so they spread like cockroaches that's what these people do we destroy one city and then we move to another much like the aliens in Independence Day right they're not here to negotiate we're just here to destroy you so the some of the things that they will not be arresting people for resisting arrest that seems like a problem if you're doing something you're let's say you're breaking into a store now you're allowed to resist arrest meaning they're not going to prosecute you for it so I guess you'll get arrested but then you're just going to be let off trespassing oh so you can just hop offense go into anyone's house go into anyone's building or that's okay, far evasion well then why would anyone pay fair this is what they do they these things all they think these things sound nice oh we're just not gonna you know get people in trouble for these petty crimes well then really what you're doing is you're punishing law abiding citizens why should law abiding citizens pay the 275 or whatever it is to swipe your New York City subway card if you can just hop the thing and no one's going to do anything marijuana possession well I'm not totally clear what the law is actually right now in New York City related to buying marijuana maybe we can get some info on that but again if it's illegal then you can't do it right like we can have a discussion about whether it should be legal or not I'd be for legalizing marijuana but again you can't if you just if you're just allowed to break certain laws then we really don't have laws driving with a suspended license okay so you know sure you plowed your car into a group of 20 people and got your license suspended do it again and for any traffic violation well then why stop at red lights right like everyone will do whatever they want oh here's some more information on the marijuana situation this is New York City in New York City age 21 and over are allowed to possess up to three ounces of cannabis or 0.85 ounces of concentrated cannabis public smoking of cannabis is allowed wherever cigarette smoking is permissible that's actually kind of funny because the New York City cigarette smoking is not permissible anywhere they actually outlawed it even downstairs outside buildings because people would be basically you know all the people from these massive buildings in midtown all the smokers would just be downstairs smoking all day so everywhere you'd walk in midtown when you just walk through a giant plume of smoke anyway if you don't think that doing these things is ridiculous and basically making crime legal which is what these people are doing and by the way I think Chesa Bodine in San Francisco and George Gascon here in LA I think they are both going to get recalled and then they should actually have to deal with the law because I don't think and I would need to speak to a legal expert on this but I've heard enough about this that as a DA you're supposed to do what the law dictates right you don't get to decide really this is this is a trick that the progressives have done that we can oh we can bring in a district attorney who can just decide when and if we're going to prosecute crimes so I think these guys could be in legal trouble themselves you know we have laws laws exist and if laws are to exist and we're a nation of laws and there is right and there is wrong and there's legal and illegal well then we have to enforce those things so these guys can be in a lot of trouble but if you don't think that these policies are making things worse well I can show you roughly a hundred thousand videos of awful things happening in San Francisco this one's from this morning and you really got to watch this whole thing this is a clown car of robbers breaking into Neiman Marcus they can do anything shut why are freaking white supremacists it just never stops with these people now think about that Neiman Marcus have you ever been to Neiman Marcus it's an upscale uh shopping center okay it's an upscale department store it's sort of like a Nordstrom or a blooming dale they've got expensive expensive stuff there you're not allowed to just walk into a store and take stuff I was actually at Nordstrom last week I thought I was going to get some new sneakers for my birthday party didn't see anything I liked but had I seen one that I liked I wouldn't have been allowed or I shouldn't have been allowed I should say to just walk up to the sneaker take it and run out of the store but in essence when you have district attorneys that say we will not prosecute these things these petty thefts you know thefts under 800 dollars well then in essence you're saying to these people to these kids these misguided kids go ahead do whatever you want and then what you will watch is a city collapse and San Francisco is collapsing by the way according to the Washington Examiner just this morning almost half of San Francisco residents are planning on moving out of the city due to rising crime really think about that half the people in what was one of the great cities of America I mean San Francisco you know I joke about it all the time but the first time I was in San Francisco about 10 years ago it was the first time I had ever gone to another city and thought boy I could really live in this city I thought the people were great I thought the food was great the geography was kind of cool the full house house was there I was into it it's an abject disaster the last time I would the last I'll tell you the last two times I was in San Francisco couple years back I was in San Francisco I had done an event with Candace Owens and we went out to eat to Morton's Steakhouse which I don't know what street it's on in San Francisco you guys could google it but like a perfectly nice street and Morton's is a you know a well-known established steak joint like we weren't we weren't you know in the downtown in Skid Row and our car got broken into while it was parked right outside the restaurant and I took a picture some of you I'm sure saw this on social media I took a picture and video of the broken glass everywhere and our car broken into and they had stole my bag and it had my notebooks and I think my iPad was in there and a bunch of other stuff and I posted the picture in the video and I got literally thousands of responses on on Twitter basically people saying what kind of idiot leaves a bag in their car in San Francisco and then I did some googling after and it is a fact the amount of break-ins just people just literally just throw a rock through a window or they punched through a window whatever it is of a car they steal the stuff people don't park on the streets in San Francisco anymore okay so that's what's going on in San Francisco and then the last time I was in San Francisco was like two days before lockdown so that was you know about a year and a half ago at this point and we were in San Francisco because we were raising funds for locals and I was going to all the VC things and it was a very weird time because people were freaking out in the masks were just starting the gloves and also the economy was tanking it was it was literally the day that the uh that the economy tank that the market just crashed and we still were able to actually raise a little money it was pretty wild but I saw several people shooting up drugs on the street the amount of homeless encampments everywhere I mean it's craziness so if you think that deregulating crime is is good go to those cities move to those cities see what's happening and it's the same thing when when you see not only deregulating crime we know what's happening in terms of murder in all these cities murder is a crime by the way uh but that's related to gun laws right like you think oh we're gonna have to strict this gun laws and then people will stop shooting people 91 was it 91 91 people if i'm not mistaken we're shot in Chicago this past weekend I think eight were killed those were the last numbers that I had but don't tell that to Chicago Mayor Lori Leifel because she'll just call your racist anyway guys we got work to do I'm in the mood to do some work are you join me a hundred shot 18 fatally sorry I under did that my 91 shot and what I say eight dead no it was a hundred people were shot in Chicago this past weekend 18 fatally happy 4th of July to people in Chicago I mean absolutely unbelievable uh guys my interview with JD Vance is coming out tomorrow we're doing that this afternoon so part one will be up tomorrow and I'm talking to people and interacting with people and I'm doing it bot and troll free all day long over at rubinreport.locals.com hope to see you there and you can get all our videos ad-free and we've got live streaming there and a whole bunch of other stuff anyway have a great day everybody we'll do it again tomorrow see ya"
