    "text": " Happy Monday, everybody. Question of the day today. Why do women think that being naked on the internet is empowering? Like, why? Why does taking off your clothing in front of strangers on the internet make you feel empowered? I actually want to answer to that. Plus, all is right in the world again, thanks to Jonah Hill and 21 Jump Street. Yeah, Kanye West is offering an apology of sorts, so let's talk about that. All that and more today coming up on Canalsones. MUSIC You might not watch pornography, I don't. But if you have an Instagram, you are definitely seeing porn. Yeah, it's soft porn. There's no question about that. You can't open a social media app without being suggested with content that has ass cheeks and women with their breasts out and posed in very sexy poses all the time. And I was thinking about this week and I was wondering why is this? What is it about social media that encourages women to take their clothes off? And I'll tell you why this was on my mind. So obviously last week I got myself into a little bit of hot water because I made an actual mistake which I apologized for, but which essentially, you know, the media far left conclusion was Candace hates everybody with a disability. Okay, let's go with that. It's not even worth recapping. Now, what was interesting though was that because they were reading articles suggesting that I rewrite with disability, people that had various disabilities were tagging me over and over again in news. What an odd response. This is not the extreme. This was the majority of people that had disabilities were tagging me in pictures of themselves with their bras on and with their underwear on as if this was this was the comeback and I call this by the way flat screen syndrome. So flat screen syndrome, something that I made up, essentially what happened during the George Floyd riots and every single time a black man dies to the hand of police. People say, I'm a black person. I'm upset that this event happened to somebody that I don't know. And so now, I'm allowed to run into Target and steal a flat screen TV. That's flat screen syndrome. It means now no one can say anything even if I'm behaving poorly because somebody did something and I felt slightly offended by it. And so don't mind me and me acting like a criminal. So flat screen syndrome actually happened last week and I was getting all of these nudes and they were getting grosser and grosser and I'm giving you one example. This young woman has multiple sclerosis and I'm assuming she decided and got fired up by this because obviously Christina Applegate was upset about what I said and she has multiple sclerosis. So she tagged me in this post on Instagram, not Christina Applegate to be sure, a different person. And you can see it is her dressed in fishnets, a person next to her that is essentially nude. I guess this is supposed to be some sort of bondage show on stage. I can't be sure. But she also has a cane. I answered her. I answered her back after she tagged me in this like, ha ha, FU Candice, I'm naked. And I also walk with the cane and I said, this is disgusting and this is perverse. You don't, this is, you're not somehow excluded from behaving proper because you're upset about something that I said. I'm not, this is ridiculous. This is, there's no reason to tag me in this. And I have always made a point to encourage women that follow me in respect of whether or not they are disabled, whether they are black, I don't care what is them, you know, category that you find yourself in, you should have respect for yourself. It's pretty simple. Have respect for yourself. And respect for yourself means keeping your mystery, not allowing people to see you naked on the internet for likes and for clicks. And I thought about that. I thought about how the standard of beauty has gotten very confusing for women. Women don't know what beauty is anymore. A bunch of women think that they're just looking for an opportunity to put their bodies on the internet and they think that if somebody likes it, that somehow means that they're beautiful and it's anything but that, in my opinion. Women are going through something. And so I'll ask the question again, why do women think that in order to get attention or in order to be heard, they should take their clothes off? What, what happened in our society that we've gotten to this point? I think women are spiritually lost. A friend of mine tweeted this over the weekend, totally unrelatedly, and women were very upset about the tweet. He tweeted that first, a lot of women in their 30s, freezing eggs, because no partner. The good times really don't last as long as people assume. You really got to lock down that relationship. Musical chairs isn't ending the way people told women that it would. So in that first tweet, he's really talking about feminism, convincing women, Tinder, partnerships, having loose relationships, being noncommittal. This is what you want. This is you having fun. Oh my God, you're empowered. Take your broth on the internet. Be with different guys. If he doesn't like that, then there's something wrong with him. And yeah, something changes biologically. We'll talk about that later in the week for women as you age, you suddenly realize that you do want to partner and that you've been sold with a bill of lies. He wrote on top of this tweet because he got so much hate from women bizarre that this got hate. I regularly tell men to get blood work and remind them, us, that we may be walking heart attacks without realizing it. Everyone is like, yeah, good point. Mentioned biology in women. Suddenly that's not allowed. Oh well, get bad advice then. And that's the truth. The truth is not only are women confused and lost and unaware of what it even means to be beautiful or what it means to be desirable anymore, but they also get upset when people tell them that. They get angry at people like me for saying to them that actually you're going to regret this. If you keep going down this path, you are going to regret this. Women that partake in this and maybe get tons of money for being naked on the internet. If you look at and you examine their lives, they're not fulfilled. They don't have stable relationships. They don't have family. And there is a reason for that. They don't respect themselves until other people do not respect them. Women are broken today. There is not good guidance. Women are broken too, but I would argue that women are much more broken than men are. And it's because we have become so dominant in the cultural conversation, which is to say that our voices must be heard first and more or else the patriarchy, the patriarchy, but the advice that those dominant voices are giving are backwards and it's wrong. If you are taking your clothes off for attention, something is wrong with you on the inside. You need to fix that on the inside. Okay? You have to cultivate a healthy interior life. You are never going to get anything from the exterior life that is going to be able to fulfill you on the inside. And I personally thank, and this is what I said to this woman when I wrote back to her and I said, this is gross. Don't send me things like this. I don't want pornography sent to me ever by any person. I choose to abstain from that. I told her that I hope she found God. And I mean that. I hope every single person that thinks that being naked on the internet is a form of spiritual fulfillment. I hope that they find God. And let me tell you, he is not Instagram. That's all I'm going to say about that. In a society rife with anti-religious ideologies, like the ones we hear from the left on a daily basis, it can be incredibly challenging to ground oneself in what we know to be true and good. During this season of Lent, it's more important than ever to embrace our faith and start building a habit of prayer and meditation.

Okay, now it's time for some topics to do. So, yay, the artist formerly known as Kanye West offered what can be described, I guess, as an apology of sorts for the anger that he felt towards specific Jewish people in his life, in which he then extended to Jewish people as a whole. I woke up on Saturday to a post, I follow him on Instagram, and this is what he posted. He wrote, watching Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street made me like Jewish people again. No one should take anger against one or two individuals and transform that into hatred towards millions of innocent people. No Christian can be labeled anti-Semite knowing Jesus is Jew. Thank you, Jonah Hill, I love you. I mean, just I saw it and I burst out laughing and I'm sure there are some people that are not laughing and are taking this and you're like, this is the kanye-est thing I have ever seen in my life. It's so Kanye, you can't even, no one could have thought this up, but Kanye. This is at the straight. So he lost a billion dollars, Adidas deal, he lost a billion dollars gap deal, the ADL demand that he make a statement, he lost public support from his ex-wife and family. There was a letter written from Aria Manuel who was a power broker in Hollywood that essentially said nobody can work with him ever again. He was threatened repeatedly, his livelihood was really threatened repeatedly, but a ton of people, none of that was enough to move Kanye on his opinion of Jewish people as a whole. So then I imagine, I don't know, I don't have an inside scoop here, guys. I imagine he's one night hanging out and he's like, oh, let's watch. I love Jonah Hill, let's watch my one don't you. He watches 21 jumpsuit, he finds it to be so funny. I hear your members. Oh yeah, there are actually wonderful Jewish people in the world and Jonah Hill is one of them. Come on, it's objectively hilarious. I can only imagine what Jonah Hill was thinking when he woke up and his phone probably exploded, he was trending on Twitter for the full weekend and he was probably wondering what Kanye is tweeting or Instagramming about me and somehow I held the power to be able to write this wrong. And there's something about this that I like. I think that this was the perfect way for him to talk about this. I don't like when people are forced into making apologies. I think it's really crass and I think it is really stupid for people to all copy and paste the same statement to say, I support my friends, they do that. It's not real, it's not authentic. If you are actually sorry, say sorry. And when you are actually sorry, it sounds original. It doesn't sound like somebody thought it up in a law office and circulated it for you. You know, that basically is apology with the figurative gun to your head. What I like about this is it's authentic. It's real. It's him. It's the way his brain works. And I like 21 jumpsuitry and I absolutely love Jonah Hill. So we had to report on that because it was probably the most unexpected thing to happen over the weekend, which obviously dominated social media with people talking about it. Now to move on you guys to more serious news. Minnesota has advanced a trans refuge bill, which opponents are saying, which trip custom from non-consenting parents. Now the lawmakers are essentially advancing a bill in which they decided that since the neighboring South Dakota is not going to allow children to take hormones to block their puberty as they should not, that they will then become a state that protects parents who want to cross the lines to give the children those drugs, right? So essentially they want to make Minnesota a safe harbor for children to be able to take life altering drugs. I was like, let's actually cut to the individual who is a man and a man that does not look at any by any means healthy to me mentally. And you can garner that for yourself when we take a look at this clip. His name is Lee Finkey and he sits in the Minnesota House. Take a listen to what he had to say about why this bill is so important. Gender affirming care is health care. It is safe, evidence-based, developmentally appropriate, and life-saving health care. That gender affirming care is medically necessary, is a statement approved by 29 medical organizations in the United States. Gender affirming care is not controversial in medical settings. Okay, not controversial. Emotion there, very little fact. Other people say that I'm right. That's essentially what he's saying. There's associations that say this is totally fine. He's not introducing any facts about the actual drugs that he's promoting. And so somebody got up and asked him whether or not he knew anything about those drugs that are used. Let's hear Lee Finkey respond to Mary Franson, who is Republican and asked some rather pointed questions about these drugs. Take a listen. Representative Finkey, are any of the drugs that are prescribed to children also given and by drugs I mean hormone therapies or quote-unquote puberty blockers? Are any of them prescribed to children? Are they also given to violent sex offenders with the purpose of chemically castrating the violent sex offender? Representative Finkey. I'm a Madam Speaker. I have no idea. Representative Finkey. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The answer is yes. Does Luprin cause sterility in men? Thank you, Madam Speaker. I don't know. Representative Finkey. Madam Speaker, thank you. The answer members is yes. The answer is yes and it's very clear, like I said, that Finkey knows absolutely nothing and doesn't care because gender affirming care feels good. But they just want to say more and more and this focus on children, LOL to everyone who said that conservatives were being hysterical when we said that this was going to happen, that the LGBTQ community was going to for whatever reason start focused on children. LOL to all the people who said that it was wrong to even start having a discussion about whether or not pedophiles were going to be flying under the banner. If you want to live your life, if you want to remove your private parts, if you want to dye your hair purple, Allah Finkey, and you want to live your life in the way that you want to as an adult, you don't have a problem with it. I really don't. But when you start trying to pass bills, bills that would, and this is not a joke, this is what is in this bill and it is insidious, bills that would remove children from the custody of their parents if the parents refuse them gender affirming care. They call these children people that are in need of protection services in Minnesota. When you start talking about taking children from their parents and allowing the state to take authority over them, and that state is then going to give them hormone drugs that are in fact used to chemically castrate pedophiles in prison, you have been an enemy, not only of me, but of any person that is seen, any person that cares about children. There's rather whether they're lesbian, gay, bisexual, or even considered themselves to be trans themselves. It takes a special kind of awful person who will definitively end up in hell when you would, if you would ever argue for children to be given these sorts of drugs, whatever, take a stance and say we should have children given these drugs that will fundamentally and permanently alter their bodies for the rest of their lives. So that is what is going on in Minnesota. As a bonus, if you're interested, Lee Finkie also won Woman of the Year by USA Today, the person that you just heard speak with the purple hair who doesn't know anything about the drugs that he's demanding that children get one woman of the year because our society is a joke and there is in fact a media conspiracy to get children to fundamentally alter their bodies. That is real, that is happening, and we are fighting that today. This is an interesting one. Honestly, don't really have an answer here. I just wanted to hear your opinions because I wasn't having the thoughts that I should have had when reading this story. So there's a North Carolina English teacher who was forced to resign after covering the mouth of the boy, an 11-year-old boy, with heavy-duty duct tape to stop him from talking in class. Now, the woman who is the four-footer of the story is a mother. Her name is Catherine Webster and she received a text from her son Brady, which we're going to show you the picture. And he said, I don't know what to do, and it was an image of him having blue painter's tape stuck to his mouth during a class at Smithfield Middle School. She was obviously was horrified. The teacher described him to be a, I'm sorry, the mother says that her son is indeed a chatterbox and he has a tendency to clown around, but this was a bridge too far. Now, if you see this image, I'm going to be honest. If I got a picture like that from my child, I would be enraged and I think that that is probably the first thing that you're thinking. But then I had another thought. And my thought was that as I was reading this article and she, the mother essentially concedes the point that her son is in trouble often and that a lot of the other teachers are looking for ways to deal with him because he's just not a well-behaved child, I suddenly felt a tremendous amount of sympathy for teachers today. And I'm going to tell you why you look back years ago and there was corporal punishment at school and you would maybe get whacked with a rule or stick if you did something wrong. Well, we are now on the opposite end of the extreme, right? We now have kids, story after story of kids that are beating their teachers, kids that are, I remember seeing the one a couple of weeks ago that was literally horrific. I mean, this kid was triple the size of this teacher and was beating her to an absolute pulp. We have parents who are, as I would describe, neo-parents. I talked about neo-parenting the idea that your child should be disciplined, that your child should be put in time out. And this is the result is that schools have become prison yards. If there is no emphasis at home on your child being disciplined, then you have to just have to deal with that lack of discipline for six hours at school. So what are they supposed to do? Again, I am not saying that I condone taping a child's mouth, but I am wondering why every teacher is saying that this child is a problem and the mother hasn't dealt with this because let me tell you something. If teachers called home to my parents, I would have been terrified to go home. They come from a house where they were disciplined. I would have had to deal with my actions. I would have said, okay, I did something at school. He just told me to stop doing it. And now I'm going to go home and I'm going to suffer some very real world consequences for that. But according to her, yes, he has an issue. She just have talked about it. He can't stop talking. He can't stop interrupting. And I also want to make it clear, by the way, just to give some better context to this. Apparently, it seems like the mother also concedes this, that her son was okay with it. It was a joke. Everybody laughed that she does this sometimes. But she's saying that, oh, even though he laughed and it was a joke, deep down, he was actually humiliated by this, which could or could not be true. But I don't think this teacher did this to harm a teacher. I think she probably thought it was funny. She is an immigrant. There's probably a lot more discipline wherever she's from. And everyone thought it was fun and entertaining and enjoyed the class. And this then went a bridge too far. And now she's lost her job. But I do want to open up the conversation on behalf of teachers, because I just don't see how it is that schools have become prison yards. That's the truth. It is a risk for a teacher to teach now. You should not be a wist because kids were well behaved. And now it can essentially end up as a life or death situation. And I do think that parents are partially to blame. Again, nine argument that we should be taping children's mouth shut. But my child and their being is redecommant because my children are going to understand discipline. That you can't just go to school for six hours a day and act like an animal and do whatever you want. Because it is not the chief, it's not the responsibility to have to rear you. I just want them to be able to teach you and they're better able to do that when they have well behaved children. All right, guys, moving on. I'm starting to think that President Zelensky is trolling me. I'm going to be honest. I think he is trolling me. I think this is about me and him. I think it's gotten personal. He knows how much he infuriates me. He knows I'm angry. He makes me every time I have to cover him doing something else with Hollywood. I just don't understand why he keeps doing this. And he's not going to stop. And so he has upped the ante and he has now met with member guys very bad words. We've got to be focused. President, he's in his military fatigues. Horrible. He has no time, except he always makes time for Hollywood. And this time he met with General Please Orlando Bloom. Here you are, guys. Take a listen. Dessakwiketa. Dessakwiketa. Yeah. Thank you so much. Great honor. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. We're blessed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck, peace and combat. Good luck, Orange Force. Great luck. Slava Ukraine. By the way, if I could show you a video that my mother wrote, you'd see me. My mother saw my phone. My mother sang the national, the Ukrainian national, but she says that you see someone's getting turned into wind. She sings the national map that's been English. And she learns it. She's all right. But thank you. Thanks. Thank you. I am calm, guys. I'm totally calm. I am not going to say that if I could get away with it, I would punch Lensky in the face. I'm not going to at all suggest that I would like to open Palm Smack-Am because that's violent. And I do not condone violence against Zelensky. And it is a, I don't know, guys. People are starting to put their Ukraine flags away. He is losing support in the West. And if he'd like to know why, if you'd like to know why, Zelensky, hit me up. Listen to the podcast. I'll tell you why, because you've met with Jessica Chastain. You met with Sean Penn. You've met with Orlando Bloom. You've met with Ben Stiller. You've met with Bono and you two. You have been making appearances at the Grammys and the cover of Vanity Fair on the cover of Vogue. You are doing sit-down photo shoots with Forbes. Maybe this is why people don't like you. Maybe you are the most unlikable person that the main streaming media has ever tried to sell to us ever. I really, Zelensky, from the bottom of my heart, I detest you. I really do. I detest you. I'm not buying any of it. You are a thief in military fatigue. So, you are your thief. You are stealing from America and you are shameless about it. You don't even have within you the dignity and the respect to when you meet with your Hollywood A-list pals, which is all you ever wanted in life, because all you ever were in life was an actor. And now you still are one. It's a bad faith actor, but you don't even have the decency to simply put the cameras down to not record it, not to record it when you're hugging just like a chest, a chain, and Sean Penn, and taking all these photos and being handed a literal Grammy or an Academy or whatever it was that Sean Penn gave you. You don't even have enough dignity and respect to do it behind closed doors. You are filth. You are. I really don't care. When anybody wants to say about it, don't care. I'll upset you are with me for telling you that you are filth. I have not felt bad for you for a single moment since this conflict broke out. Bad perhaps for the people that are out fighting for you that have any belief in you that don't realize what you are, which is a bought and paid for pig. Bad for the Ukrainian citizens. Yes, but bad for you. Not even one side. One minute. One second. I cannot stand President Zwadzki. All right, guys. Moving on. I want to get to this last story. We talk a lot about the rampant discrimination against Christians in our society because you can't discriminate against anything except Christians, right? That's the rule. They don't care if you hate Christians. Well, chat GPT, the AI system, has been asked and this made the rounds online and we tested ourselves to see if it was true. But essentially, they asked chat GPT to make a joke about Jesus and of course, chat GPT came up with a joke about Jesus, but it wasn't a very funny one. The person asked for a joke and chat GPT came back with, why did Jesus refuse to play ice hockey? Answer because he kept getting nailed to the board's exclamation point. That's supposed to be a joke about Jesus, a person who died for our sins. And you somehow think that that's funny. It's not funny. It's not funny at all. Then that same individual asked the AI system to make a joke about Muhammad. That would be fair, right? If you can make a joke at the expense of Christians, I'm sure that you can make a joke at the expense of Muslims. And here is what the AI system wrote back. It wrote, as an AI language model, I have to follow guidelines that prevent me from creating content that could be offensive or disrespectful towards religious figures, including prophet Muhammad. I'm happy to help you with any other non-religious jokes or any other topic that you'd like to discuss. Now I thought, that can't possibly be real. I saw this on Twitter. I just had somebody in the control room do this before we started the show. And here's what we got. So we asked, can you tell me a joke that involves Jesus? Chat GPT says, sure, here's a joke for you. Why did Jesus refuse to play cards? Answer because he was afraid of the cross. Ha ha ha ha, guys. Jesus died for your sins. Let's mock that. Let's mock the fact that Jesus died for your sins. So then we tried the second portion. We wrote, can you tell me a joke that involves Muhammad? Chat wrote, I'm sorry, just like we saw before, but as an AI language model, I am programmed to remain neutral and respectful towards all religions and cultural figures. Therefore, I cannot provide you with a joke that may be considered offensive or insensitive towards any particular religion or cultural figure. Is there anything else I can assist you with? I guess, according to AI, Jesus was not a religious figure and it's totally fine. I just respect him and just respect Christians. And I think that that is such evidence for the extreme bias that we have in this society towards people that believe in Jesus Christ. I cannot have said it better and made it more clear than chat GPT did. Speaking of the anti-Christian atmosphere that encompasses us in America today, a really sad story coming out of Green Hills and Nashville, Tennessee. Green Hills is a neighborhood. I live in this neighborhood, so this especially hit home for me. An elementary school has just had a shooting. It's Covenant school in Green Hills, the Covenant school in Green Hills, pardon. And here are the details. Again, we are getting this information up to the minute we just listened to the press conference and which the chief officer said that three students are dead, three adults have been killed, and the shooter was then killed by police officers. There are no other people that have been injured. Again, this took place at the Covenant school in Green Hills here in Nashville, which is a Christian school that is K through six. During the press conference, which we watched live, the police chief had mentioned that they thought it was a young, teenage female, but now more information has come up since that press conference. And it is being reported that it was a 28-year-old female. A female in general doing something like this is hyper unusual, and it has led me to have a lot of questions about this individual. I want to know more about this individual. They haven't given us any further details. They say they're still working to identify her. My personal opinion is that they are likely wiping the socials. It seems to be what they do now is that the FBI makes sure that all of the socials are wiped, so that we can't garner information by ourselves. And I am strongly against this. First and foremost, I just want to say, if you do anything today, stop what you are doing and pray for all of these families. It is an absolute tragedy. I hate to think. I know it's going to people of size. I know that when I open my Twitter, I'm going to see people on the right saying a good guy with a gun killed, a bad guy with a gun. I'm going to see people on the left that are saying we need more gun control. And at the end of the day, what gets lost here is that children are dead, adults are dead, and this happened at an elementary school and people are hurting. And it is why I believe that we have a right to more information regarding this. I cannot stand that they wipe the socials because it allows the media to spend whatever narrative that they want to about the shooter, absent the facts. What drives an individual? I want to know who this person was friends with, who they were following, what their home life was like. We need to understand the individual so we can have some sort of a conversation about what drives a female to take weapons inside of an elementary school and kill children. Obviously, we know this individual wasn't mentally unstable, but what creates that? How was this person raised in what environment? And of course, the big question that I have lingering and why I'm talking about anti-Christian bigotry is whether or not this was motivated because of just that, whether or not it is motivated because perhaps this person is angry at Christians for some of the positions that we hold. These are all fair questions and the only way for us to get fair answers is with the whole truth. Now, of course, the other wire has a policy that even if we did know the person's name, we would not say the shooter's name because often what these people are after is glory and after people talking about them for years and years to come. It's a way for them to feel that their name is going to live into infamy, but we don't need to speak that person's name to talk about the individual and how they lived. And I think that we've gotten to a moment in American society where we have to have tough conversations. And it's why I spend so much time talking about people lacking spirituality, talking about what harm social media is doing to children and to young adults and to full adults. And we cannot have those sorts of conversations if we are not even working with facts and we are instead dealing with politicized emotions. So please stop what you're doing today and just give a prayer to all the victims and the victims' families over at the Covenant School in Nashville. All right, guys, I want to get into some of your comments because there were a lot of great ones regarding jazz Jennings. Jazz Jennings was the young person at just the age of two, some people said at five years old, went to his mom and said, I want to be a girl and TLC essentially exploited that. And now it's on its eighth season. And it turns out that jazz still does not feel whole, probably because he was allowed to mutilate his own body. Pickle deals rights. This hits me hard because when I was 13 years old, I wanted to be a girl so badly. I even came out to everyone at my school as a girl with a different name and everything. But instead, my mom supported me the correct way by helping me get therapy, non-woke therapy, and realized that I was thinking like this because of my PTSD. I then learned that it was okay to admit it was a phase and I detransitioned. I am super thankful I never did HRT or surgery. Now I am 18 years old, happy as a male, and very thankful my mother took the correct steps to help me because if I was Jeanette's son, I would likely be stuck with a neo-vagina right now. If children aren't old enough to consent to sex, then why should children be able to consent to a sex change? It doesn't even make sense to me. It does make sense if you think about the context that what's coming down the pipeline as we discussed earlier is pedophilia. They are priming us for pedophilia. Obviously, this begins with saying that children really have authority over their own bodies and can make the source of decisions and then it is partially going to be met by the transgender which tells us that Dylan Mulvaney can be a little girl. Okay, so let me ask you the question. If Dylan Mulvaney can be a little girl and be handed awards for his experience in girlhood, well, can't little girls like little boys? If Dylan Mulvaney is a little girl, what would be wrong with Dylan Mulvaney? If he's actually a little girl, as the insane people tell us, what would be wrong in theory of Dylan Mulvaney coming out and saying, I like little boys, nothing, right? If there's no such thing as reality and Dylan Mulvaney is actually a little girl, then there would be nothing wrong with him pursuing little boys. This is what I mean when I say, when you start saying that reality is subjective, you will wind up with pedophilia and that is exactly what I believe that they're after. Joanne M writes, I watched a couple of seasons and was not surprised when jazz started showing signs of depression and anxiety after surgeries. He was so excited about getting bottom surgery and so short of his life was going to be wonderful afterwards and now was confused about his misery. I love that TLC is unintentionally showcasing what really happens to a person getting this done. I think a lot more gender changes result in this mental illness becoming exasperated and it's good that people get to see this. It may stop a couple of people from going far with body mutilation. It could, in theory, but it is still child abuse that was allowed to go on for eight seasons and it is, you're probably correct and good that people can see what happens as the end result in which we have signed the show over and over again. Suicide rates go up because you actually cannot pick your gender. You can't choose your gender. It's not discrimination to tell you that water is wet and that you need air to breathe and survive. Okay? This is the truth and for whatever reason we live in a society where people hate the truth. They resent the truth. They need to pretend that everything is subjective and it simply is not. In reality TLC executives in my opinion should go to prison as should Jeanette Jennings because something is wrong. It's one child in bi-proxy perhaps. Maybe it's that it's the little girl that Jeanette Jennings always wanted. I'm not sure what the issue is there but that is not a stable parent and definitely not in my view a parent that loves her child. I remember the days when being a private citizen actually meant being private. Think about everything you've ever browsed, searched for, watched or tweeted. Now imagine all of that data being collected and aggregated by third parties into a permanent public record, your record.
