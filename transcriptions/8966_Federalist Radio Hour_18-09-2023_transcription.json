    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, culture editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. We are joined once again by editor-in-chief of the Babylon Bee Kyle Mann, who helped put together a new book I have in front of me. It's hilarious. It's called The Babylon Bee Guide to Gender the Comprehensive Handbook to Men, Women, and Millions of New Genders We Just Made Up. Kyle, welcome back to Federalist Radio Hour. Thanks so much for having me. You are incorrigible and will not stop committing hate crimes. I don't know what you mean. This is a very inclusive book. So we talk about all kinds of genders in this book. I don't know why you would accuse us of a hate crime here. Dedicated to Babylon Bee, man of the year, Rachel Levine. You start before page one even. Tell us about this book. The process of putting it together. It really is hilarious. Yeah, so this is a third book in our Babylon Bee Guide series. We've done the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. The Babylon Bee Guide to Democracy and now the Babylon Bee Guide to Gender. It's certainly the most, it was certainly the grossest of the guide books that we've had to put together. It's difficult to write about a topic like gender and trans issues and sexual identity and sexual orientation and all this stuff without, I don't know, there's a line that you have to walk there that's trying to keep it fun and light and funny. Though it is a pretty serious topic that a lot of us are just confronted with on a daily basis. But hopefully we kept it fun and funny enough where you can throw it on your coffee table when your liberal relatives come over. Yes, this will make many thanksgivings very fun this year. That's the idea. But yes, we're putting this thing together and it's a lot of, we have this great graphics department at the Babylon Bee. As you can imagine, it's an absolute blast to be a graphic artist at the Babylon Bee from putting together crazy photoshops for the website to work on books like this. So I wrote a large chunk of the content along with my managing editor Joel Berry. We're just typing words on a page and it's all black and white and I don't know if this is funny or not. Then you send it over to the graphics department and we have all these notes like draw, a man in a dress with a beard and he's punching a squirrel or whatever the joke is. And then to see this, to see it come alive on the page after the graphic department gets through with it. It's like telling yourself a joke that you get to laugh at a few months later. So it's been a lot of fun. And giving a present to yourself. Yes, exactly. That's what I say. Very generous. But it also, the point about how it was one of the grossest books or the grossest book that you've put together so far, there's something serious when you say that because it gets to how gender is this catch all subject that opens. It's kind of like the umbrella that all of this like sexual stuff gets under for the left that when they're talking or when they're teaching kids about something like very innocuous or that should be very innocuous. You know, you're a boy, boys had penises, girls are girls when they're eight years old, whatever they are in the classroom. It's now open up to this whole universe because they're assigned with this basic task in a public school of making sure that girls go to the girls bathroom and boys go to the boys bathroom that becomes this like catch all for all of these different like sexual topics. So as you were writing the book and as every day you're sort of covering these topics at the Babylon B, do you find that to be the case that so often just sex is the gateway to all of these different like issues of sexual devian deviancy and nonsense once that door is open? Yeah, it's kind of intrinsically tied when you look at some of the perversions that have been ushered in, you know, in the name of equality and inclusiveness and you look at things like that it just think three years ago or five years ago if you thought we would be having a debate as to whether kids should be going to drag shows and tipping, you know, men with fake bear boobs and you know, like it's just insane or the dude that was on the White House lawn, you know, with his with his fake chest out there for everybody to see and it's like we have progressed so quickly off that cliff and nobody on the left is really willing to call it out. There are some obviously there are some voices on the left who call it out but they're few and far between because I think once you've subscribed to this idea that your your main motivator, your main your guiding principle is inclusiveness, you can't say no, you can't shut it down, you know, because if that is your if that is your guiding principle, if you have no if you have no strong foundation to kind of more your morality to and say, you know, this is what we believe things are good and bad and objectively good, objectively evil, if you don't have that kind of an objective moral compass, then you're just going to progress because that's what they do, they progress and they progress right off the cliff because that is the main thing is just moving forward all the time. So yeah, I think once you once you kind of say, Oh, well, inclusivity is our is our guiding principle, you're opening yourselves up to all kinds of craziness. Mm hmm. Correct me if I'm remembering this wrong, but wasn't the reason you guys got blocked on Twitter and have since developed a great relationship with Elon Musk, that was over Rachel Levine post, right? Yes, it was our we after USA Today awarded Rachel Levine, one of their women of the year awards, you know, the names of Rachel Levine, woman of the year. We just thought it was so absurd that we awarded Rachel Levine our man of the year award. It's just, it's a stupid joke. You know, it's like, it's kind of like this dumb lame, you know, just very dry parody of what of what USA Today did. But it got a span from Twitter, it got us locked down to Twitter. And they wouldn't let us back on unless we kind of bowed the knee to their ideology. At least at old Twitter, there was like, when you committed a hate crime on the, or committed hate speech on the, on the app, you had to click through all these screens that were like, yes, I acknowledge that I have committed hate speech against this person, which includes harassment, intimidation, threats of violence, but you know, we're like, what? You know, it was insane. It was just insane. And we didn't, we didn't, it wasn't any kind of like calculated response to this Rachel Levine thing to this Twitter thing that we were going to, oh, let's, let's go ahead and not delete the post and that way we'll generate a bunch of controversy. And then, and then Elon Musk will see us and buy Twitter. Right. Like, it was, you know, it was literally just me and the other owners of the Babylon Bee gave me together and we just said, this is insane. We're not, we're not deleting it. Right. I think, I think it was Seth, our CEO, maybe that said that would, he was just like, we're not deleting this. Are we? And I was like, no, of course we're not. Like, that's, that's just goes against everything that we believe, you know, so there was just a principle and stand of like, and we thought, we thought we weren't going to ever get our Twitter account back. You know, that was just, we're just like, we may never be back on Twitter again. So then when, when Elon called and, you know, started asking us about it and then, and then bought Twitter and then, you know, one of his first directives when he got into Twitter that November was to free the Babylon Bee, you know, that was an insane thing for us to witness and full, just from taking a little stand of ordinary faithfulness, you know, we saw the world change in a big way. That is such an important and interesting point because I was going to ask how heavily now that you have some insight into the process, you think this or why this particular example, he kind of almost just answered this question, but I'm curious for your thoughts. It seems like to me, the reason this example weighed so heavily on Elon Musk is that you guys did take a stand that like, would anybody have even noticed in the long term would this, this would just be sort of a footnote in the Babylon Bee's history if you had this one issue and then you complied, deleted the tweet, got back on and just kept testing the system. But it sounds like the fact that you guys stood strong is sort of what was the catalyst for this to explode or to be sort of a spark for Elon Musk to start looking deeper into what was happening at old Twitter. Yeah, absolutely. Like, you know, I think if we had just done the typical thing of whining about it and then deleting the tweet and then you're back on the next day, it's like, oh, it would not have changed anything. And a lot of conservatives were facing similar things. And of course, you know, deleted their tweets or whatever, which I don't blame them. I mean, it was such a crazy time with how much censorship there was. It's like, well, we can lose access to our millions of followers. You know, that's a big deal. Like I could sink a business, you know, and that's how powerful that the sensors were. But I talk a lot about like what Alexander Solzhenitsyn says in the Gulag Archipelago, you know, which is that he wished that his fellow Russians had, you know, all stood up. And he's just like, if just one of us, you know, in like their apartment block or whatever, you know, he describes these Soviet soldiers coming in and knocking on the door at the end of the hall and then moving to the next door the next day and the next door the next day. And then none of them stood up and he said, like, if we had just made them fear for their lives, the soldiers fear for their lives because they knew that we weren't going to go quietly. You know, he's like the whole thing, the whole system would collapse on the first day. But everybody feared this, you know, and I'm, you know, I'm drawing an analogy from obviously something that's horrible, like so the Russia to just, you know, cancel culture. But we are kind of in the beginning stages of a lot of that, that conservatives feel like they can't speak up. And I don't blame, I don't know, like on the one hand, I understand conservatives that have their job and have to provide for their family. Like they're like, well, I could make a stand, but then I can't feed my family. And so I understand that people have a tough choice to make. But at the same time, a lot of times cancel culture only has power because we self-sensor, you know, cancel culture only has power because we allow it to have power. I think, I think as conservatives it's time to start standing up. And you'd be surprised, you know, we get stories of people that will stand up in their workplaces and say, no, I'm going to, I'm going to take a stand here. I don't believe this. And then more than half of the workplace stands up with them and is like, yeah, this is ridiculous. You know, Jim and all of them were silent about it. So yeah, I just encourage people to not take part in the lie because I think once we take part in the lie, we give it power over us and we give power to cancel culture that way. So feel free to put the Babylon be guide to gender on your coffee table over here. All 10 copies that you purchase. Put them on your coffee too. And to another thing you just said, it's not just conservatives anymore. And I mean, of course it never really was just conservatives. I remember my college job was working for Christina Hoff summers who was sort of canceled in the early 90s for having this heterodox take on what was happening to feminism in like 1994. And so there was always this anti speech streak on the far left. It was mainstreamed. And then people like Elon Musk were certainly not conventional movement, conservative Reagan nights. Gender for some reason, sex and gender strikes a nerve. I want to ask how why you think that is because the speech issue. I think those are the two biggest gateways to sort of being read pilled. It's free speech and sex and gender. A, do you agree with that? B, why is sex and gender something that seems so basic and obvious such a powerful gateway to having your eyes opened up to kind of a lot of these structural problems on the left? I mean, I think it definitely like strikes at the core of who we are. Like they're ontological questions, gender questions. And you have to be so, you have to be swimming in the cool aids so deep, you know, you have to be so immersed in the cool aid to buy into the gender nonsense. And like it denies the very basic reality of who you are. And I don't like I do think that there's a lot of people on the left or we call themselves on the left, maybe in the Democrat party who, you know, balk at this stuff and say, like, this is this stuff is too far. You know, because it is so basic from a biological perspective. But the problem is that the Democrat party and everybody on the left has really been, you know, co-opted by this movement. And something that it feels so inorganic because it's something that was so fringe, you know, just a couple of years ago. And like if you had, if you had read a headline from the future five years ago, that's like, you know, this man dressed as a woman is now the spokesperson for Bud Light or, you know, whatever you do, you'd be like, what, what is happening? You know, I read some headline the other day I was reading and I'm like, if I read this headline three years ago, I would not understand a single word of it. You know, there's this, there's this insane, like hockey stick level progression when it comes to the insanity on the left. But yeah, I think it is. I think it is because it comes down to such a basic question of being that every, you know, XX or XY chromosome in our body screams and rebels against that. And you're just like, you know, it's wrong. And you really have to, you know, as the Bible says, like, sear your conscience in order to, in order to fall for it. Hey, y'all. This is Sarah Carter, investigative columnist and host of the Sarah Carter show. Thanks for listening to the federalist. We all have a heartfelt reason to support our blood pressure.

I'm looking at a page in the book right now that has an illustration of notable accomplishments and inventions of men, medicine, automobiles, skyscrapers, indoor plumbing. This is just a taste of what you can expect with the Babylon beat guide to gender. But it also strikes me that this was not partisan humor, ideological humor like 20 years ago. We all, and it's kind of like the Barbie movie, which just over and over again, the joke is that men and women are different. I don't think Greta Gerwig knew that when she was making the movie, but over and over again, it's like, oh, we have to sanitize the mojo dojo causa house to make it back into a Barbie dream house. Why? Because men are disgusting. Like, this is used to just be a basic thing that we could all joke about and make fun of. But now I'm only finding jokes about men inventing these things and the Babylon beat guide to gender nowhere else. Well, that's, it's funnily enough, the original pitch for this book that we were working on when we were talking about doing our third Babylon beat guide was the Babylon beat guide to men and women. Like we just wanted to do kind of your old school Seinfeld men are like this and women are like this style of humor. And that's really, you know, gender obviously is a much hotter topic and we were able to expand to making fun of a lot more woke topics because we expanded it to gender. So we're glad we did that. But we, you know, you've kind of noticed those first few chapters we're talking about men. There's a chapter on men chapter on women. And we got, we do a lot of the stereotypical jokes about those things. That kind of humor is great because it is, I don't know, another funny thing is like you see it on, you see those kind of jokes on TikTok all the time. You know, the younger generation is making all these observations about men do this and wives do this. Husbands do that. You know, and it's like, well, why do you think that is? Because they're different. And so we love that kind of humor. And I think it's been relegated to this, like, oh, that's boomer humor. Like, oh, men do this and women do that. So, you know, that's so passe or whatever. But, but it is like, like I was saying with the left and how you have to deny your very biology in order to find the gender stuff, it's like those kinds of jokes really speak to us because every single person on earth has experienced, you know, those kinds of differences, whether it's your wife, you know, running into the curb in her car or, you know, your husband wanted to just as an example. Yeah. Well, it's not, it's, you're not saying that women do that. I know it's a joke. It's satire. This is satire. It's possible women are worse drivers than men, but that's not what you're saying. Yeah. Right. Odds are some of them are. The question that I also was thinking of when you were talking about that is the church in particular is what you guys started satirizing. And just along with, you know, the new Twitter versus old Twitter, you guys have exploded. There's some, there does seem to be something happening. They call it a vibe shift, whatever it is. There is some real change. People are getting braver. Some people may be getting less brave. Some people may be becoming more cowardly, but some people really are becoming more brave. And I mean, I don't know the Elon Musk of 10 years ago would have been taking some of the same would have said it's worth it for me to take some of the same stands on X, Y and Z. Maybe that's a bad example, but there's something in there's something a foot. Have you seen that in churches? Is it getting better or worse in some of those, those church spaces that you guys started satirizing? Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I would say it's getting better or worse beyond, but I would say instead, like it is definitely becoming more polarized. Like it really depends on your local church. Is your local church founded in the Word of God and the truth of the word God? Do you submit to the Word of God? Because if you do, like, I don't think you're past, you will have any problems speaking up about these issues when they come up. If your church isn't founded on the Word of God and it's just whatever the whims of the culture are, then it's just going to progress off the cliff even faster. And that's why we're seeing so many empty pews, you know, it's because of a lot of the main lines and nominations that just, you just sense that they desperately want to be liked by culture. And maybe that was fine in the 80s and 90s when culture was relatively friendly to Christianity or whatever, but now it's not. And so if that became your, if your goal was to appeal to seekers, you know, in the 80s and 90s, and they were just generally normal families or whatever, then maybe you couldn't notice much of a difference at that point. But now it's starting that, that kind of approach is starting to be exposed for what it is because you, you know, you just see insane stories coming out of these, out of these mainline churches that you never would have, that would have been a Babylon de-headline a few years ago. You know, we had some articles a few years ago that was like, you know, a priest fired from an Episcopal church because he reveals that he believed in God or something like that. And then, you know, there's like true stories now of these like atheist chaplains popping up that universities, it's just wild, like how did we get here, you know? And I think it is because a lot of churches weren't taking seriously the word of God. You guys do a really good job of, and I guess partially because this is, you know, where you started, but you do a really good job of not just giving the, giving conservatives or Christians a past, but also not like relentlessly just attacking conservatives and Christians, but also having a pretty like broad scope of humor of things that you're like poking fun at. Is that intentional? Do you guys try to keep a balance? Like how do you decide, you know, when you're going to take a shot at the right versus the left? Yeah. And some people have asked like, is it, you know, do you like completely balance it? And we made fun of Democrats. So now it's time for a joke about Republicans. I don't really think that that's a great approach. I think I think it's more like we want a really interesting, healthy and funny mix of articles on the site. And on a given day, like Democrats might be being a lot more ridiculous than Republicans, not always. But on a given day, that might be the case, you know, so we might make more fun of Democrats that day. And then if there's a day where there's something insane happening on the Republican site, of course, we're not afraid to call that out either. But I think it is like, I feel like the VAML on B is this like a newspaper that's, you know, just reporting on clown world. And so when you open up the, when you open up the homepage of the website, like you really want this feel that you've received a newspaper from an alternate dimension that's like, that's very, very similar to our own. But so we want that interesting, healthy article mix. Like if every joke is politics or every joke's making fun to the left, and it's just not going to be interesting. Nobody's going to be kept on their toes. I like reading, you know, the onion or whatever. And you read a silly article about the family dog or whatever. And then the next article is making fun of me, you know, it's like, oh, shoot, they got me. You know, you want that moment or else it's or else comedy is not interesting. So we definitely try to spread out the targets as much as we can. But yeah, you know, a lot of it's dictated by the headlines of the day, you know, if if Republicans happen to be ridiculous that day, then I guess we're making fun of Republicans today. I'm going to pay to pay to it now that it takes a somewhat veiled shot at Rachel Hollis, a woman with a copy of Girl washer face. And this is perfect to the next question I wanted to ask, which is that Babylon B was kind of an is still kind of it has this niche down really, really well of Christian humor that you're not really going to understand if you're not a regular church goer. And that's something that happens a lot in our culture now is that we kind of have these these cultural corners that are less, you know, penetrable to people who are outside of that particular bubble, but are really, really funny to people who are inside the bubble. At the same time, you guys have expanded to the point where there are tons of pop culture references in this book and on the site regularly that everyone can they're like touchstone references, LeBron James, for instance, that everyone could kind of pick up on and have a laugh at if they're able to laugh at these things. Do you find that to be a problem? As you guys are like coming up with jokes, like, is this something that's like too? Is this just a me thing or is this like just a politics thing versus, you know, is this something people will understand in general? Well, I think I think with humor, there's like a there are so many considerations less like this giant four dimensional matrix of like what what is a joke trying to do and what are the different dimensions of it. And you know, so you're always like it's really good to super laser focus in on, you know, a dumb joke about, you know, David Crowder or Jeremy camp or some someone that only people in in within evangelicalism would understand. But it's like you want that. I don't know, I feel like that there's a context to the joke that people outside can still get and they can read it and go like, Oh, you know, that guy must have a giant beer or whatever the, you know, or whatever the the joke is. So there's a little bit of like, you know, yes, we're making the joke for our little in culture, but it should give a it should give a feel to the outside world of what your sense of humor is of what the tone is that you're being light hearted, you know, even if they don't get the specific reference, one of my favorite articles is this really dumb one that I wrote that was like five signs your husband is secretly looking at planes of pictures of World War two planes on the internet. You know, and it's just like, it's not even super relatable. Like there's nobody like who looks at just randomly looks at pictures of World War two planes, but it's like, you know, it's obvious. I do absolutely. Well, you know, I'm in an accountability group for it, but you know, we're trying our best. But you know, it does kind of without being on the nose and without being at the risk of explaining a joke and making it not funny anymore. I mean, you know, it does kind of give you that feel of this Christian website that's like, here's how not to look at porn or whatever. But we do it in this light hearted way that's like pointing out some of the symptoms, but it's World War two planes. And then it kind of gives this weird, I like when you read an article and it's like strangely specific. And you're like, who wrote this and what were they going through? You know? So I think there's a so I think there's a balance, you know, but we definitely we I mean, honestly, we found that the way that Facebook suppresses a lot of our political posts, because we'll post something on a hot news item about Hunter Biden or something and it gets five shares on Facebook because they just completely shut us down during the 2020 election. But then we'll like post a silly joke about a worship leader and it'll get thousands of shares because Facebook doesn't have any of those buzz words that Facebook looks for to try to shut an article down. So there's something to be said for that really niche comedy that is just laser focused in on your one audience and hits it really well. Do you have a favorite gender of all the genders, the infant genders? Do you have a favorite? Well, of all the ones we made up, I like, I like goomba sexual, which is a little Mario Goomba. We made up all these gender symbols and they're all they're all stringed throughout the book and we have gender flags, you know, so that's that's wonderful. All kinds of queer flags from California to the Dallas Cowboys. And just a lot of great. There's just a lot of great gender. Oh, the best thing in the book, of course, is the is our genderator, which is our way that you can generate your own gender. So that's a lot of fun. People get to do that in the book. So we have fun interactive features like that. It's always my favorite part. I'll sit there. The guys in the office make fun of me because I'll be sitting on it in our little lounge area. Yeah, check out this one. You know, and I'm like generating fake genders and I like, okay, I'll get back to work. But yeah, that's a lot of fun too. Well, they say get back to work, but clearly what you're doing is work. Yeah, it's work. Yeah, exactly. Really perfect. Because I was just going to ask you to take us inside the book on the writer's room, which must be a mysterious place, a magical place. What's it like when you guys are producing a book like this producing content, like what you do on the site every day? What's the process like? Yeah, so the headline writing process is not as much fun as people would think it is because it's mostly just online chat, you know, Slack channel type pitching stuff. And I think the very specific kind of comedy that we write with the headlines, that onion style, like the joke has to be super contained in those 80 characters or whatever. It's less collaborative than you would think. Like it's very much like, I have this idea. I think this would do really well. And then like, I'll just write it. But there's once in a while where like you have a kernel of something and you're like, I'm not really sure if this joke works for AOC. Maybe it'll work for Lauren Bogart instead or whatever. You know, like there's a little, there's a little bit of that collaboration where someone says, Oh, what about this? What about that? It's a real fun that people think of with like a comedy writers room comes when we're writing our sketches. And also when we're writing these books, because there is a lot of sitting in the writers room, punching up each other's joke. And it is just literally just like sitting with the funniest people that you know and chocking around for a few hours. Like, have you ever been, have you ever been with a group of, you know, your closest friends and you're sitting around and you say, Oh, and what if this and then the guy over there is like, Oh, yeah, but this also and this guy and someone else throws in something else and you just make up this ridiculous thing. Like, that is the feel. It's guys sitting around, joking around, which is, which is just a blast. And this book, of course, is so funny because it's, we're like throwing it up on the screen, on this giant screen that we had and we're like looking at it. And one guy came to our office and said, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys as motto should be like that you're serious about being funny because I'm so like immersed in it that I don't even realize how funny the conversations that we have are, but I'm sitting there and I'm like, I don't know if this picture of Karl Marx in address is that funny. I think we should, I think we should change his leg hair. You know, and I, and I don't, and I'm not cracking at all. I'm not like thinking it's funny. I'm just like, yeah, I think that would be funny. You know, and then there, we have some guests visitor to the office while we were having this kind of conversation. He's like, are you guys not cracking up all the time? You know, it's just like what? I'm just trying to write up this joke. I can't. I don't know. So hopefully that gives you a little sense to decide whether or not it's more or less funny that I guess we're in Karl Marx, just like you're not. Yes. Yes. That's a serious question. Do you have, have you found that people outside of like just the conservative space are now regularly Babalom B readers? You must. I mean, the amount of just the amount of followers that you guys have on social, there aren't enough conservatives in the world. You have to have a fan base. Do you have, have you found that? Do you talk to people on the left to like the Babalom B? Yeah, I'm talking to people on the left who like the Babalom B. I think most people in real life are normal and can laugh at themselves. You know, I was laughing at, you know, I left headlines from the onion. I left it headlines from Reductress, which is like a feminist set there. Like, I think most people can laugh at themselves and, you know, humor is one of the ways that we can, you know, reunite our country and save our country in a lot of ways. Because I think it is the thing that, that unites us. You know, humor is this common language. The transcend, transcend his language. And humor is, humor is universal in a way. But yeah, like, I never want to judge the full movement of the left or my political opponents based on some fringe, crazy people online, because obviously there's a lot of people that hate the Babalom B online. But I talk to people in real life that disagree with me politically and. Follow the Babalom B, you know, their atheists or their, or their, I was talking to a girl at one of the ladies, sorry, at one of the events. I don't know if that's, I guess that's not politically correct, but I mean, she was a girl. I do. I think that's, yeah, that's how she presented. But she was a, she was a priest, like at a mainline, you know, Anglican church or something, you know, had the rainbow frock and, you know, came up and she asked me something about, like, do you feel like sometimes you guys are too mean towards, you know, like trans issues or, and I'm like, well, we're trying to be lighthearted. We're not trying to. So we had a little conversation about it. And she's like, well, thanks for talking to me and answering my questions. He's like, I really do like most of your guys's jokes and I love your church jokes and a lot of wealth. You know, so that's like, that's an example of somebody that you would expect to be an insane person online and you talk to them in person and it's not that, you know, it's, I do think humor has this power and, and it has a power to get people in their yards down a little bit. And if we had just written like, screams against transgenderism or whatever, like nobody would read our website and nobody on the left would read our website, you know, but people do because, because it's humor and it's disarming in a way. I wonder if the onion hadn't become in some ways unwilling to fully engage with the modern left and all of its excesses and hilarity, etc, etc. I mean, I guess there would always be space for two of you, but that has had to have helped the Babylon be immensely that even in the comedy space, there's been reluctance to kind of poke fun at all of this stuff. Yeah. I mean, to the onions credit, they, they do make fun of the left. They do make fun of Biden and Democrats and they always have made fun of both sides and they still do, but there was, there was kind of, there's probably a noticeable tone shift, maybe around the Trump era, you know, or post Obama that shifted to like, I mean, you, I mean, you, you saw it in, you saw it in the late night hosts, most especially, that they were, they turned from like our job is to get the left and the right together and laugh at things and make, make the events of the day look ridiculous. And because, because humor has this power to help take, take the anxiety out of, out of the news, you know, because humor is this way, like we're worried, no World War three is going to happen and you would turn on, you know, Johnny Carson or Jay Leno or whatever and they just make a joke about that, they'll make you go, okay, it's going to be okay. Like we can, we can laugh about this. It has this power to bring light in the darkness in a lot of ways. And the late night hosts, once Trump, once Trump came to power, it was like, okay, our job is no longer to make fun of things because that's platforming or normalize and we cannot normalize this man. Our job is now to lecture our audience on what's good, you know, what's good and what's bad, what's right to believe and what's wrong to believe. And that loses all, that makes humor lose all of its power. And yeah, I guess you did see some of that with the onion. But that's like, that is why the Babylon B exists, was, is because we were reading all these headlines, the founder of the Babylon B, Adam Ford was reading all these headlines about. About, sorry, he was reading all these headlines from the onion that were from this leftist slant. And he was like, this is so funny. And yet it's making like the opposite point of the truth. You know, and he's like, I really wish that we had something like that because it's so powerful. You know, and if the onion had had been right in the middle and just making fun of both sides or, you know, went after the left with the same ferocity and frequency as they as they went off to the right, then there wouldn't be a battle on me because we wouldn't have needed it, you know? So there is, there is some truth to the fact that them leaning super hard left led to the Babylon B. Yeah. And just as we're kind of wrapping up here, it strikes me that the Dylan Mulvaney and target kind of the Bud Light target boycotts. Then you had the whole controversy with the, the Dodgers and the sisters of perpetual indulgence. This pride month was actually kind of a rough pride month for the pride movement because a lot of those, what average Americans would see as excesses were on full display. And it felt like even to people on the left, I saw some analysis that this was kind of maybe a turning point for the pride movement, for the LGBT movement, that this particular pride month is when public opinion, you started a backslide and, you know, people woke up to what was really happening. Do you think that's the case with these sex and gender issues that we've kind of, it's, it's peaked. And now we're going, you know, maybe not back down the hill, but sort of to a point of broader consensus about men and women. Are we in the middle of that process or do you think we're sort of yet to peak? It's tough to say. And it's funny when people ask me that because I always say, well, I just, I'm just a dude who tells jokes on the internet. Like, I don't know. I don't know the broad sweep of Western civilization, what it's going to do. But I always go back to Tolkien, you know, I'm doing my annual reread of Lord the Rings right now. And Tolkien talks about how, like, we don't have the power over what happens in our age and our era. This is, you know, there's the famous with Gandalf talking to Frodo, but there's other, there's other pieces of this theme throughout the books that we don't, we can't decide what the weather's going to be, but we can tell our, we can tell our earth, we can defend our little farmstead. It's like, if Western civilization collapses, let's let it collapse while we're laughing about it and being joyful warriors, fighting for our little slice of the earth, you know, I think, I think there's something to be said for that. And that's what we call people too is is such a funny balance being a satirist, you know, because it's like you get to see like Western civilization collapse in real time in some ways. But we do it while we're sitting and sitting on a lawn chair drinking a beer or a non-alcoholic beverage and we're pointing at pointing at the world and laughing. And I think I think that's our role, you know, as as comedians is to say, well, I don't know. I don't know what the trend is going to be. I don't know if if this is going to come back. You see some signs of hope for that, obviously, like with all the pushback during Pride Month and stuff. I don't know if that's going to result in anything or not or if people are just going to forget them and the Dodgers sell out, you know, 55,000 seats every game still, you know, so maybe people don't care about as much as we hope they do. But maybe people's attention spans are too short and we're too far gone to save save America. But but we're going to keep laughing because, you know, we serve a God whose kingdom is has outlasted all the other kingdoms and a kingdom that will never fade away, you know, as we read in the book of Daniel, it's like, and I think sorry if I'm rambling, but I think that's what I think that's what gives Christians the right to tell jokes, you know, a right that I don't know how atheists tell jokes because because they're like, Oh, I like this meeting list. It's like, yeah, well, that's horrible. You know, like we can we can joke about political things because politics ultimately, ultimately, in a grand scheme of things, obviously it matters now, but ultimately it doesn't matter because we serve a God who's sovereign and in control of all this stuff. So I can I can laugh about the things that are going on in the news without any kind of like despair, you know, so that I think Chesterton wrote about that. The satirist must have a moral grounding. If he doesn't have a moral standard, he can't tell a joke because there's no the whole point of satire is to say, you should be acting like this and yet you're acting like this. And you can't do that unless you have this, unless you have some kind of a moral backing and some kind of a hope beyond this life. What I took away from all of that is if Frodo were a comedian, he would be Kyle Mann. That's it. Well, Sam wise, you know, Sam wise was the comedian. There was this, I just read the part where Frodo and Sam are climbing up to Shealob's lair and there's this giant spider attacking him, you know, and Sam's telling jokes and singing songs. And that's our that's our goal, you know, that's that's our job is to be the ones that make enough dumb songs while we're walking into into doom. My female brain just turned off as soon as you start them climbing up. You're not read for have you not read Lord of the Rings? I've read the Hobbit many times, but Oh, I highly recommend it. Even if you just do the audiobooks, I sometimes I do the audiobooks and it's a high recommend. I can't believe you just made me a public on a conservative podcast. I know I got through Lord of the Rings, but it's a little crucifier. Crucifier. It's probably going to happen. Kyle Mann is the editor in chief over at the Babylon B and they have a new book out called the Babylon B Guide to Gender. It's hilarious. Kyle said it by 10 copies by 20 copies. It's that good. Kyle Mann, thank you for coming back to federalist radio hour. Thanks for having me. Of course, you've been listening to another edition of federalist radio hour. I'm Emily Duchinsky, culture editor here at the federalist. We'll be back soon with more until then be lovers of freedom and anxious for the frame."
