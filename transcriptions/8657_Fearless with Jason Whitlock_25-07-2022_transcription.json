    "text": " The truth is the tattered and shredded black family structure has undermined American black people's ability to produce male leaders. We're a matriarchal culture. Because of psychological damage caused by having no father in the home, black athletes do not respond well to black male authority figures, especially in a sport with a leadership model similar to the military. I'm talking about the NFL. Black players don't care about black coaches. The whole simple-minded conversation about black NFL coaches is a manufactured bread and circus for talk show hosts and lazy journalists. Welcome welcome to Fierlers with Jason Whiplock. I am Jason Whiplock your host Happy Monday to you and yours. We made it through the weekend and have a great week of shows playing for you starting with today a Single topic and we're gonna talk about it with Steve Kim and TJ Mo the NFL season is just around the corner just around the corner and so I Want to give you a little bit of a taste of some NFL talk and why with teams reporting to training camp or whatever Why I'm not as excited as I normally am. First thing I need you to do though. Honestly, I need some help This is a new jacket. I bought It's not a new shirt. It's the shirts a little too big, but this is one of the smallest jackets I've purchased in years and and it's I had bought some other ones and maybe three four weeks ago and Then when I went back to go buy a couple more I Had to get even smaller than just a month ago But this is a little snug and I'm wondering if you guys could hop in the chat I'll be there in the chat monitoring if you could hop in the comments. How's this jacket look on me? But is it is it too snug is it you know, I? Don't I kind of like it But maybe that's just because I know what size it is and I know how hard I've worked to get here But you know if you could hop in the comments or in the live chat and give me a thought on this new jacket What do you think did I go too small or is this actually a good size and a good fit? Does it look good on camera? It feels decent. It'll feel a little bit better. I think in a couple weeks When I've lost a little bit more weight, but I'm very excited about You know my weight loss journey and all that and so give me your thoughts questions comments in the chat and I'll reward you for doing so by lighting this fire and Leading you on a good discussion about the NFL. All right, the same billionaires willing to pay Kyler Murray and Deshawn Watson 46 million dollars a year in salary are Two races to pay black men five million dollars to coach Murray and Watson The argument that the NFL is a bastion of white supremacy Has it made much sense for nearly 50 years? You'd think this past offseason would be the final nail in the outdated narrative But it's unlikely to die It will be kept alive by a constant retelling of the league's flawed history and a simple-minded explanation of the league's hiring practices related to head coaches Welcome to NFL season 2022 Pardon me from my lack of enthusiasm training camps have opened we're 45 days from the start of the regular season I've never been less excited for the start of professional football The game feels disconnected from reality. It's used as a prop to make species arguments denigrating the league and America as Systemically racist. I don't have the stomach for it. The American economy is in free fall Inflation is shrunk the middle class times are hard for most Americans except for those with some rare athletic skill and or a willingness to ignore the absurdity of elite Influencers getting rich for promoting games and narratives intended to distract from our descent into Babylon Murray and Watson have rare athletic skills and little else this offseason the other Arizona Cardinals and the Cleveland Browns Rain record contracts on the pair of quarterbacks Despite two dozen sexual assault allegations and a likely suspension hovering The Browns traded for Watson and gave him a guaranteed contract worth two hundred and thirty million dollars It's the most guaranteed money in NFL history Imagine that the man with a league shattering number of sexual assault allegations received the most guaranteed money in NFL history That's quite the combination and accomplishment and it's rather Surprising giving the fact the NFL allegedly suffers from systemic white racism Watson is black So is Kyler Murray Murray has no all field issues his issues are on the field He's now the second highest paid player in the league trailing only Aaron Rodgers But he's not one of the NFL's ten best quarterbacks or 50 best players The wear and tear of the regular season causes the pint sized quarterback to melt in December in three seasons and 13 games of the month of December the five foot nine hundred pound 190 pound passer Has thrown 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions the Cardinals are five and eight in those games in 46 NFL starts Murray's record is 22 23 and one He's never thrown for more than 26 TDs in a season in this era elite quarterbacks routinely tossed 35 plus touchdown passes In his first three years Murray has thrown 70 touchdowns and 34 interceptions in comparison in his first 46 starts Patrick Mahomes tossed 114 TDs and 24 interceptions In 49 starts Lamar Jackson has thrown 84 TDs and 31 INT's Let's don't even compare one lost records Mahomes and Jackson led winning teams Kyler Murray makes more money than Mahomes and Jackson That's likely going to change it relates to Lamar Jackson The Ravens and Jackson have spent much of the offseason trying to work out a deal the contracts awarded to Watson and Murray have complicated those negotiations Given Murray's deal What do you pay Lamar Jackson? Jackson won the league's MVP award in 2019 and had one of the greatest seasons in NFL history But I digress the point of this Firestarter is to call out America's absurd culture priorities and debates the NFL America's national pot pastime the number one TV show on five different networks is America's primary supplier of bread and circus It's entertainment designed to keep the masses happy as the masses are robbed of God given rights and freedoms That's why the NFL refuses to defend itself from allegations of racism That's why Colin Kaepernick remains in the league's conversation The Raiders granted Kaepernick a trial this offseason. Why? It's why the Pittsburgh Steelers hired Brian Flores the former dolphins head coach who is suing the NFL for racial discrimination The dolphins fired Flores. He claims he was fired because he's black The NFL is a willing participant in the overthrow of American values For years I wondered why a league and industry that produces more blackmail millionaires than any other industry is So reluctant to defend itself from allegations of systemic racism Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league's top black executive Troy Vincent know the league's positive impact on black boys and men Why won't they tell it? Why do they constantly bend to the woke mob? They know racial bias and animus do not explain the racial disparity in black and white-haired coaches The owners don't care who they pay to lead their teens The Browns just gave an alleged serial predator 230 million dollars to play quarterback The truth is the tattered and shredded black family structure has undermined American black people's ability to produce male leaders We're a matriarchal culture The NFL is a patriarchy Because of the psychological damage caused by having no father in a home Black athletes do not respond well to black male authority figures Especially in a sport with a leadership model similar to the military Here's another inconvenient and uncomfortable truth The rise of the black quarterback is directly tied to the technological advances that allow coaches to puppet master quarterbacks from the sidelines In the 1950s 60s and 70s the quarterbacks used to routinely call their own plays That's no longer the case Football games now more than ever are orchestrated from the sideline and the press box the players are less valuable as leaders They're paid for their raw talent That's why the Browns do not care about Deshaun Watson's character flaws He's not being paid to lead He's being paid to follow the instructions communicated in his helmet He'd rather have those instructions be delivered by a white man That's part of the reason he was so comfortable last season skipping the opportunity to play for david kully in houston David kully is black Black players don't care about black coaches The whole simple-minded conversation about black NFL coaches is manufactured bread and circus for talk show hosts and lazy journalists Are you not entertained? All right, that's my fire That's the conversation I want to have today with Steve kim and tj mo And so without further ado we'll roll out and talk to the korean co-sell and Steve I want to start you here. Do you have a problem just as a fan? Not not just just as a fan are you comfortable with a kyla murray and Deshaun Watson getting paid the kind of money they're getting paid First of all good monday, too I can't say that I I feel either way about it And we talked about this last week with amar jackson quarterbacks or going to be paid And that particular market for that position Is the one spot in the national football league that has actually protected you actually get overpaid And you get taken care of over and above your value And so there's an old thing about a rising tide lifts all vessels That's the truth in quarterback play The bottom line is when a patch from a home's can sign this Basically on the half billion dollar contract Just a year or two ago and that contract almost looks obsolete Shows you a lot about the quarterback privilege. It's not black privilege It's not white privilege But there is a quarterback privilege that exists in the national football league and as it relates to Deshaun Watson and now kyla murray They are the beneficiaries of that privilege Got it I may be asking a slightly different question though. I'm just a as a fan When I look at kyla murray Getting this kind of money. I'm like, did he earn it? Really? 46 million dollars a year and then when I go to Deshaun Watson, I go, you know his play on the field I got no problem with him getting paid. Yeah, but his Conduct off the field makes me go. Did he earn it? Really? With this guy's conduct off the field Are we really paying him? This kind of money That I don't know just as a fan. I don't have a problem with the amount of money that these guys make But but it's like who gets paid and have they really earned it after three years and and you're 22 23 and one Your performance in December is not nearly as good as what you do in september and october I I just I just feel like these athletes today and it's in all the sports They don't have to earn it the way they used to and i'm just not comfortable with that No, you may not be but that's a personal choice. Again. Are we fans or are we moralists? We have to be honest these guys are not our next door neighbors. They're not related to us I don't look at them as role models, but i'm a lot older Yes from an ethical and moral standpoint, you could certainly question the deal of the shawn watson But get this jason the national football league is a business and that is a franchise that's under pressure to win Okay, so talent wins out talent matters talent gets paid but to a deeper point Um I think that media needs to stop this whole narrative of the black quarterback being treated any better Or worse than a white quarterback that that's simply been debunked the last 20 some odd years Uh, the days of quarterbacks like regi collier who I grew up watching the usfl Who are never given a fair chance because their style of play and their athleticism Was almost held against them are over. I'm not told you this a couple of years ago jason Nowadays if you're black quarterback in college and you show any proclivity To be a quarterback at the next level whether you're god take cup cold pepper spurge and win david jorard You're going to get a shot the days of war and moon being the best player on the field with the rocket arm in the rosable for the university of washington And then having to go to the cfl and win five great cups to prove your worth Are over and the example that I would use in terms of how the playing field is now leveled Go back to eric crouch 2001 he won the hyzeman at nebrasco But his style of play they said bro, you're gonna have to be a safety You're not playing quarterback at the next level jason edelman was a quarterback in the mac and they told them both You're you're a five-nine little white guy Julian edelman right so Everyone's being treated the same and this is a book that I read long time ago Quarterblack by doug ones one of the best books I ever read came in 1990 You learned a lot about this man and I have so much respect for this guy because the character that he showed and the stuff that he went through And the reason why He left for the usf fella memory play for the outlaws that lasted one one year Was because his owner hu kolver house was literally paying him Less than several backups and this guy along with luroy selman was the heart and soul of the buccaneers And then he had to take a red shirt year in 86 behind jay shrader Um, yes, do I think there was a point that black quarterbacks had a tougher road? Do I think that they were treated differently? Yes, but to say that that happens now in 2020 and beyond I you'd have to show me evidence of it besides your own personal bias that certain people have All right, you you've jumped ahead. I'm gonna I'm gonna jump back to your point here or you've moved me to a point a little quicker than I wanted to get to Steve part of my argument is that the tattered black family structure Undermines black male leadership when 75 percent of your kids are growing up in homes Led by a woman or some single parent that no dad around it undermines your ability to produce leaders You couple that the the rise of the black quarterback is not a coincidence that it's happened at the same time That the game has been taken away from the quarterback And now the game is managed from the sidelines and from the press box And and and they don't really care about leadership and that's why uh, de shan watson can get paid He's nobody's leader. He can't lead in that locker room. He's been clown suited by all these women Uh, and so I just think that the the technological advances and the It's and this again goes to my discomfort in terms of The game has actually gotten easier for the quarterback and more Responsibility has actually been put on the sidelines and the coaches, but we've seen this rapid ballooning of Of quarterback salaries and we've seen the head coaching salaries balloon as well But i'm not sure if it's proportional the coach is actually more important in football than he's ever been at any time in the history football truck when oj simpson and Walter paten where the highest paid players in an afoul that was a player dominated player driven lee Quarterbacks in the 60s 70s 50 Many of them called their own plays now it's all a head coach driven thing But we're lavishing all this money on the quarterbacks is like they're they're carrying the biggest low. I just don't believe it Jason Jason you've lost so much weight. I can't call you fat joe, but you need to lean back. Let me disagree with you a lot. Okay a lot Here's the ironic part about the father situation You know the ironic part is in this particular one Kyle and mary had a father a very strong father figure that I think me and you have both said wow that guy is very influential You know what it hasn't been a great thing because his behavior Is not what I expect out of a franchise quarterback There are certain things that he's done whether it's scrubbing the social media or some tweeting i'm like, you know what You're allowed to be unhappy with your work situation You are a quarterback you can act that way as a wide receiver. You can act that way as a linebacker I'm sorry if you have quarterback privilege. There's also quarterback standards that I would like you to adhere to Here's the other thing about the technological advances of football. I disagree though You know, I think there's one more black quarterbacks. I think the style of play has a lot to do with it Yeah, I get it most quarterbacks now have a headset where the coaches call the game But with the rise of the spread offense, which now every high school in america Basically is running a version of the spread So there used to be a tie when quarterbacks were really thought about don't run the ball Stand the pocket but with the rise of the rpo the read option and now the fact that quarterback athleticism is being utilized and you're you're cutting down the field in certain respects with one read There's going to be more and more black quarterbacks There used to be a time Jason when I was in high school and I think you're in high school There used to be passing leaks of seven on sevens And basically the only schools that did them were in california or suburban schools And literally it was only the white kids that had quarterback tutors. Guess what? Everyone does that now the seven on seven leagues in football the summer camp circuit is big across the country It's the a you version for football So I actually think the the level the level playing field has helped the black quarterback and also the style of play also I get it the quarterback coach and the coordinator matter with the headsets, but let's go back to the rams Um, goth was very effective for the first three years Under mcveigh and they used to talk about he come to the line of scrimmage and he would literally be like a playstation player saying Hey do this do that But even goth was limited And mcveigh made the choice and said you know what? I like you goth, but I don't love you I love what matt stapperd can do with his arm So the point is jason. Yes, you can have a system. You can have a play caller, but here's the reality players still Matters and the reality is you can be the greatest coordinator in the world. You can be the greatest play caller Gotta have players players still matter and here's the reality There really is no quarterback white black mexican or asian that calls their own plays anymore. The game is simply too complex I get Players still matter the only thing I would add is but they don't matter as much as they used to Oh They don't matter as much as they used to jay jay you're thinking x is the nose I'm thinking jimmies and joes I'm just look at the end of the day if it was just about the best coaches Then usually then why is alabama winning every single year? Because I mean next same as a brilliant because they have the best coaches And they have the best coach and again you talk about the spread offense This used to drive me crazy when I would watch college games They everybody come up to the line of scrimmage and then look over to the sideline Uh to be told what to do and it gets just me as a college player from the 80s That was never our mentality. There was no help over on the sidelines the help they helped you Uh monday through friday and then you got out there on saturday and you were kind on your own Yeah, they'd single it they'd send in single in place to the quarterback But everybody else all the training that went on all week told you what to do based on alignment of the defense And it just what you had to make based on what step blabba And again now the whole thing Is there's a puppet masters on the sidelines and in college they're all looking at sidelines and soon enough That same thing and there's already signs of it the nfl is all about looking over to the sidelines And and the whole thing is orchestrated from the sidelines. I'm not trying to take a dump on these quarterbacks but they're not doing what Joe nameth or what? Warren moon or what dan marino or what Guys and from yes, they're what terry bradshaw. They're not doing what they had to do That they're out and and I I get it the spread is great. Why receivers can now play quarterback It's awesome and it's changed the game and you may make the argument It's more fun to watch a quarterback that can do all those different things But it's not as hard Jay, I will still argue playing quarterback effectively in the national football league is still the most difficult task in professional sports At least in america and yes, can you scheme up certain things? To accentuate athleticism to make it easier on a quarterback? Yes But to play at the highest levels and to win playoff games and beyond you still have to be effective in the pocket and have real on Talent and that goes beyond scheme that goes beyond coaching at that point You separate the men from the boys when you're I have to be able to throw certain concepts So I completely disagree. I still think talent and ability Absolutely trumps coaching because if you put nick seman at wake force I'll guarantee you this he will lose at least 50 points off his football IQ Well, he won at michigan state. Let me ask you this Lamar jack coming up Lamar jackson's coming up or it is up, you know, they should have got a deal done this off season There's who knows if he's even gonna Participate in training camp or if he plans to play if they don't get a deal Lamar jackson's going into his fifth season Kyler murray has gotten paid just going into his fourth season If if kyla murray is worth 46 million a year I'm sorry lamar jackson is worth 56 million a year. He's worth 10 million 37 and 12 I believe this is career record Uh, he's been the mvp He had the most incredible 2019 season in the history of vinterfell quarterback play when you Add what he did running the football and throwing the football It's the greatest season a quarterback's ever had. I know the net 2020 and 2021 not as good he's backed off a little bit, but if kyla murray's worth 46 My god. What is the mar jackson worth? I guarantee you okay? So this is what happened when lamar jackson woke up this morning and he checked social media like we all did and he heard any read about guys but murray's deal oh I guarantee you as happy as kyla murray is Well mar jackson's even more jubilant again rising tide Right i think about this if you look at the rosters and of the help they get on the outside You don't think that lamar jackson would have loved to have even an aged aga green a new copkins and urch A christian kirk who's now with the jackwars or a young rondell more who's an explosive playmaker And that's the thing that gets me about lamar jackson. He hasn't had that much help He really hollywood brown is a one-dimensional Uh take the top off the defense type of guy. He's no longer there. He has a provol tied end Last year he had no running backs by week two or three they all got injured And yet the camel point halfway through the year. They were still a really good team now look I said this last week. I'm not gonna back off it lamar jackson Still has to evolve as a quarterback and have more easy plays where the ball gets out and it's just simple Backstep read get the ball out quickly But the thing that I like about him much more than kyla murray There's a maturity within him that I think is far beyond murray Murray has been petulant. He's been a little bit childish Well, lamar jackson to me has been the rocket dr. boralta in a lot of ways He just looks like a guy that you can give several hundred million dollars to and you say I trust you You might get hurt. You might get traveled one day but from a personality standpoint and character I trust him so yes if he kyla murray is worth 45 to 46 million there's no doubt about it lamar jackson getting paid 50 million dollars plus per year So and I agree with you and I said here if murray's worth that my god I'd love to be uh lamar jackson's agent You know lamar jackson and his mom representing he doesn't have an agent but Having said that Warren sharp has the football expert if you're not following Warren sharp You're not really a football fan. You should follow his social media feed and all of his work He's one of the smartest guys talking about the nfl. He tweeted out a quote from someone that's uh an nfl uh defensive coordinator current nfl defense coordinator and the quote says I don't give a SHIT if he wins the league mvp 12 times I don't think he'll ever be a one as a quarterback who'll be one as a football player but not as a quarterback This is pissed a lot of people off and of course people are saying oh it's got to be jack dale real that there's a lot of people Complaining and of course the race card is going to be played but I do think a lot of nfl coaches That that's reflective of what they think lamar jackson's a tremendous athlete That you can figure out Come play off time and slow him down and eliminate him from the playoff and if he a true number one quarterback The jury is is still out on a bit and again everything you said about lamar. I I think he's committed I think he's mature. I think you can hand him all this money And he's going to continue to work his butt off to be great All of that is true Is he a great pocket passer and will that bite him in the rear end in december in january? I think are fair questions Jason I I like you share a very high opinion of worn sharp But I will say this I think the only person that loves a more jackson more than his mother is worn I mean he loves a more jackson Right now if lamar needs an agent and lee stieberg is no longer in the business. He ought to get worn What I can at least five percent But here's the issue and I think so look Has lamar been stifled in the playoffs in his first four or five years? Yes, the record is the record, but keep this in mind and i'm not making a comparison player to player But i'd like to think paint and manning was a really good quarterback one of the all-time greats Um he came into the league in 1998 Jason he didn't want to play off game till 2003. It's probably one you covered It was in kansas city where they beat a really powerful offensive club in the chiefs I don't think they potted that game was like a 38 35 game Yeah, there wasn't a part but it took him a while to get that ball rolling but look This year is a litmus test for lamar you're into your fifth year Dobbins his back gusta buses back um Is put up or shut up you're right because I think the coordinator has a point though That there are certain players in all sports. They're very good in the regular season Right they're great But once you condense the whole talent and all of a sudden it becomes a game of fractions of inches It's a possession here and a possession there You're right. That's where lamar Has to actually be that guy that come january the turn of the new year He's the type of guy that could put up the same type of numbers that he does september All the way up to christmas I love your analogy to paten manny because it plays into a point i've made for years I was critical of paten manny And the because I thought it was a legitimate criticism That at crunch time you saw it in his college career you saw it in his pro career He didn't play the best against the highest competition Tennessee won a national championship as soon as t martin took over for him t martin wasn't half the quarterback that paten manny was The flaw for paten manny in this side relates to my conversation is paten manny Love to control the football game Love to take things into his own hands on the field And in this modern nfl and this what i always said brady's advantage was over paten manny is that brady allowed the coaches To control the game in new england paten manny wanted to control the game from on the field be old school he's archie manny son He knows the game like the back of his head But I don't think you can outthink These coaches that stand on the sidelines never take a hit never lose their breath Nothing you can't outthink them in that playoff chess game And paten manny was trying to do it while taking hits while running out of breath And it would catch up to him in the post-season And and and that's why he didn't have as much success as brady who During his new england years allowed himself to be a system quarterback And allowed those coaches to control things the offensive coordinators either was charlie wyce or josh mcdance or whoever Who's the guy i'm thinking the texans head coach For a while Yeah bill o brine he allowed those guys To control the game and so and paten paid a price for that in terms of wins and losses So maybe i'm contradicting myself a bit here saying that you know It's because I do think it works The game is better when it's controlled by the coaches the guys that aren't breaking a sweat or the games run more efficiently By the coaches the guys not breaking a sweat then back in the old era when there wasn't those communication through the helmet and and you had to render some control to the quarterbacks but It doesn't betray my overall point games easier for these guys And they're all getting paid a generational wealth Tyler murray $46 million a year Guy hasn't proven anything steve i'm gonna let you go Uh, thank you so much great job Uh, let me take care of a little business ronald ragan once said all great change in america starts at the dinner table Well There's no company doing more to help you bring your family and friends to the table And good ranchers good ranchers delivers 100 american meat to your door They guarantee your meat is born raised and harvested here in the united states So you know who you're supporting.

If you can't do it at crunch time. Does it really matter? Got to give him some high marks though because you know he's put up these numbers and you know no matter what I say about his passing numbers I think in his second year he ran for 11 tds And so he's a threat with both his arm and legs and so i'll give him a 15 in job performance Jay, I gave him the exact same rating look he's been good not great Uh, certainly not a bust but there's got a couple point time like lemard jacks and he's gonna have to have playoff success And he was awful against the ramped. I'm not saying it's always one player But the quarterback always gets the brunt of the credit or the blame So I I do think this though in today's quarterback world Unless you're lemard jacks and you got to get at least 4 000 yards passing which he has not done yet Um, but again good not great. So i'll go with the 15 Uh character Uh, I can't I can't go too hard on him on the character right he's not been in any kind of trouble Uh, you know as far as I know Uh, there are you know some teammates that i've heard kind of anonymously say Not the greatest team guy and so i'm not going to go super high, but I I give him a 17 in character Wow, okay, this is one of the few occasions where I was a lot lower than you I went to 10 I again Quarterback privilege comes with quarterback responsibilities and the way he's acted and some of that stuff he's done I just go now. No, no to paraphrase trolones That's not my quarterback It's not Michael. I gave him a 10. I don't like that. I'm sorry. He's half korean. I hold him to a high stand What's his biggest crime? What's his biggest crime? Look if you're a quarterback, I don't want you doing this stuff like, um, you know, um, I'm not following you anymore or just like I hate that stuff get off but look you hate social media and what it brings And chyla maria has fallen into that and my view is as a quarterback If you want to be a good one if you want to be a true franchise quarterback You have to be a leader of men. Do you think that behavior is that of a leader of men, Jason? Yes or no? No, no, no, there you go. I guess I I contributed more to a lack of authenticity and that's where we are next I don't know if he's authentic Uh, I think that You know, again, you made the point earlier in our discussion about his dad. I think he he's a bit of a pampered spoiled Daddy and mama's boy And I think that undermines his authenticity Um, you know this whole little I might go play major league baseball You know, he's pulled that trick scam Uh, or an end, you know, I guess kind of threatened that a little bit even here I just don't find him very authentic. So I gave him a 12 in authenticity Again, you I want to call you the salivation army today. You're being charitable. I gave him a five because I hold baseball thing He I guess even with the Oakland athletics and I read somewhere. I know it's true Your Solory right now is probably more than the whole payroll of that team currently you are never playing for the athletics give him a five second him Well He was supposed to be a really good baseball player if he had ever made it to superstar I'm probably by a six or seven a year. He could have made a bunch of money in baseball and less wearing tear on his body It factor, uh, I got to go high here He's he's you know, he's a little bitty Guy everybody loves the underdog. He's a little short guy midget playing quarterback Can you say midget now in these days? That would have been correct. You can't you can't say midget. Well, he's a midget and he plays quarterback And that's pretty exciting in the NFL and so I give him a 20 Uh, and it's what? 20 Play quarterback Lamar Jackson has worn sharp, uh kylomori f u First of all, it is funny about the short can you say midget because on twitter There are these meme of these little remote control cars going down the freeway And it's that kylomori going to science contract You see that or that little little guy throwing a football that looked all big So maybe i'm being a little bit harsh, but I mean look he plays in a perfect system But to me quarterbacks that have it have got to win in the playoffs So I gave him a 10 look statistically he's been okay But if we're gonna hold quarterback to the same standard Lamar Jackson gets marked down because of post-season Non-success. I will hold kylomori to the exact same standard Did you watch game of thrones? Yes Yes, I did This guy's this guy's the imp who was the greatest character on game of thrones Very fascinating interest to see this is like the did you like dunk flute? I mean that was a little guy to play Huh? I loved dub flute Yeah, the little guy in quarterback. That's always a great story It is but again dog dog didn't come with these issues though that matters And dog was not as you know, there was no social media franchise He was remember dog flute. He's one great year in buffalo He leaves him to the playoffs in the week before they say a rob johnson's are starter give me a break Terrible, terrible. All right I'm just sorry. Duck flute. You you just never knew. I'm sure he had the same napoleon syndrome as every guy I know that's five eight or shorter. Uh, I'm sorry. I apologize for saying that there's people in the room. I could have offended Overall score I'm going to give him a 64 a grease fire Hey Gas science for 46 million bucks and you got him as a dumpster fire I'm sorry. I don't count his money. I'm not in his pocket book. I don't get a percentage not a manager All right, we gotta let you go. All right, thank you. See get your fearless army swagger shopblazemedia.com We're gonna bring in the show me kid and talk with someone who actually knows football in the quarterback position former sec wide receiver tj maul to show me kid next Yes All right, welcome back, uh, we're gonna dive a little deeper into calamory Lamar jacks and uh, dishan watson the whole black qb thing with uh tj maul former sec wide receiver showed me kid he ain't scared and so we're gonna talk about About all this stuff and tj. I'm gonna start you here with a doozy of a question for a white guy Does the collapse of the black family structure? undermine black male leadership Oh sure. I think the collapse of the family structure in both white and black communities Undermine all male leadership and so we've seen it I mean we talk about it happens in the the black community at much higher rate 75 percent of kids or so are born out of wedlock But 25 percent of white kids are born out of wedlock that is a lot one out of four so you still have you know, it's that is if if a You know Put those two numbers together on a football team and based on the white kids being 30 percent of the Of the team in the nfl and the black kids being 70 percent that's over 50 percent of the kids without a dad So you're expecting them to come in and respect male leadership When they've never experienced it themselves. Look, it's like it makes them really crappy rule followers That's why 85 percent of the youth who are currently in prison grew up in fatherless homes They don't know how to follow rules very well. That's according to the texas department of corrections fatherless kids Have lower levels of sociability Confidence self-control they're quicker to anger. They're more aggressive Fathers tend to if you go look at all the studies They they bring the discipline to a household And so they utilize what you'd call authoritarian authoritative Parenting and so you know, it's it's loving but you have clear boundaries and expectations for what you're going to do It leads to better emotional academic Social behavioral outcomes for kids. This is based on every study ever done. I'm not this is not Uh cherry picking. I'm just telling you this this is clear stuff. I can give you a personal example Call me a sexist, but you're also going to have to call her call my daughter a sexist who's one years old She climbs up on the fireplace all the time And my wife will say hey, even get down and she'll turn around and smile at her And I in a deep voice say hey, even get out and she sits right down and then she cries Because she understands male leadership. It's just a different. I mean I can't explain it to you Again call me a sexist people respond even at a young age you understand how that works So To answer your question Yes, it's worse in the black community because there's far more of it But it's certainly not a problem for black people the white kids without fathers have all the same issues And so I bring that up because i'm relating it to the conversation that will hear during this NFL season about black coaches And and there will be No discussion all the entire discussion will sit around well the reason there's not more black coaches because the ownership is racist And there will be no discussion like well hold on black people have this culture that's very matriarchal Black women are the leaders of black culture You can see it everywhere And and there will be no discussion like well hold on if a guy grows up in a culture that worships women worships the mother His his mom and dad has been a mother Uh has been a woman. I wonder if that prepares him And does it prepare the player? to be led by a black man when many black men grow up feeling abandoned by their fathers I've said it a million times for 20 years if not longer that Many of these black athletes don't trust black coaches Because of the psychological damage of not having grown up with a father none of that will ever be discussed as it relates to Why aren't black men becoming headed coaches in the nfl And and is that is the avoidance of that conversation just more of the fear white reporter feels he'll be called racist and black reporters and journalists Either don't have the balls or the courage or the intellect to even raise up the conversation Well, I think your last part is certainly true There are very few people willing to even discuss the topic I think there's the other side of the coin is equally as important Not having a dad Doesn't show you how to be a man and if you don't learn how to be a man It's very difficult to become a leader of other men And so it's not just that black kids who aren't used to black fathers being in the home Won't listen to black male figures It's that black men didn't grow up with a father in the home and it's harder to become really good leaders You're behind the eight ball from the second you're born without a dad So this is it is part of the discussion that we should all have and again There's nothing, you know, it's we were let's do a sermon yesterday This white skin's just the house i'm living in and got nothing to do with me But it turns out that people that happen to look like me don't have my genetics Don't have anything else happen to look like me Tend to have dads in the household more often So then when you take the skin out and just look at the obvious well, how about just the dads in the household Those people across the board white black asian latino does not matter have an easier time through life than people without fathers in the home So it's not just that you're being trained not to listen to them because of the matriarchy It's that you have a harder time ever ascending to that position at all because you were never given the example of how to lead Yeah I think I can personalize A lot of this my parents divorced when I was around five years old Uh, my dad's involved in my life Significantly and then Uh, you know my final year of high school I started living with my dad and he had tremendous impact and throughout college my mother when I was in college My mother lip was in Kansas City and my dad was right there in Indianapolis Just an hour away and so me and my dad got very close and his influence over me Uh heightened You know later in life, but I think my college coaches Would tell you like man Whitlock was a handful. He walked up against authority He didn't want to buy in and you know, he was a decent player But he could have been a really good player a great player for us If he could have adapted to our leadership model and so it really wasn't until later in life that The things my dad planted in me and that relationship really took root and I had a uh more mature Understanding and belief in male leadership and all and all of that I I get I just say all that to say I'm not Trying to rip and shred Black coaches black athletes I'm trying to get us to deal with the unique ramifications That come about because our family structure has been completely destroyed and undermine And and we can't just sit around and say oh, it's the feelings of white people That determine our success in life the culture that you embrace the values that you embrace and and again I What what did I I just? saw somewhere where The the mayor and we'll probably talk about this later in week, but the mayor of New York city Eric Adams Today in a press conference Called god a woman And you know said she did x y and z for me And i'm not shocked at all that he he would say this because that's Where black culture is at this time it worships the woman and it denies biblical truths And and wants to recreate history and redefine Male and women roles and so the mayor of New York city a black man is telling the world that god is a woman And and he's got five female deputy mayors that he's bragging about He doesn't believe in black male leadership and and and we're shocked That uh black men are struggling to become head coaches in nfl and when they get those jobs we're shocked When black athletes the predominantly black athletes in nfl have a hard time following their lead Well, I must have missed the verse where they call it God the mother god the son and god the holy spirit. I miss that one. I do think it's god the father and it you know I think Outsiders view that black people as a whole have been conditioned to think that everything That the white man has done is bad because of slavery everything doesn't matter what good outcome That has been created by their behavior. That's bad because it came from white people Instead because prior to the 1960s if you go back to like the 50s and the 30s or even more the black family was seriously intact intact in many occasions I mean black people were getting married during slavery undercover Right they had their own. This is this is what marriage should be I think I have nothing to do with the government it has to do with you your wife and god and black people have been doing that for all of Time and they they created their own families even when legally it would not be observed and so for whatever reason The culture has said hey the nuclear family is a white thing. I'll give you another example I saw this one on twitter the there was somebody who Was ripping on joe biden who I think I gave him a negative 10 score when we did the approval rating So you're aware i'm no fan of joe biden, but they said it was why it was it was a representation Of his white privilege and supremacy and he was showing white urgency By continuing to work while he had covid and i'm like You're telling me urgency and doing your job because people are counting on you even when you know feel your best Is a white characteristic? Urgency and responsibility are characteristics of people that are good at their job white black Asian latino again does not matter So my contention would be that we should all reevaluate what good characteristics are Embrace those no matter what race you are and discard the bad ones So just because white people did a lot of really stupid things in the past Do not look at all the good things they do and say that's for white people And then you're stuck with only the terrible things because that's what we're doing with the fatherlessness issue today We're saying that hey, that's a white man thing white dads stick around. We don't have to do that It's all about the moms here. Why do we even need dads? It's all about the matriarchy It is a serious problem and you've talked a lot about this. I just I think we need a full recalibration of what's important Why won't the NFL Defend itself from allegations of racism it has an amazing story to tell About its impact positive impact on black boys and men I contend it's because the NFL has accepted its role That they're part of the overthrow of traditional american values And the reason why roger gadale toy vincent none have the balls to stand firm and defend the NFL whenever it's accused of racism They got stats evidence stories. They got everything they could throw at that, but they won't do it I think the NFL knows its role is to be the bread and circus while Uh and distraction While we get robbed of our freedom and rights and they remake this country I think the NFL knows exactly what it's doing. It's not it's not doing it out of any sort of fear It's not it's not doing it Just to survive. It's in on the the remaking of this country But before I answer that Tell me why expand on that for me. Tell me why you think they're in on and in that they know their role and why the role Could not just be something else just as easily and be more successful with the great story they have to tell Uh because I believe many of the owners are globalists at the end of the day they own They they made their money off global corporations And so I I think They're putting up a front like they're bothered By what's going on but but I look at their swallowing of black lives matter I look at commercials about hey the NFL is gay And I look at their hyper focus on Making sure women are coaches this whole diversity thing uh and They're implementing All of the rules of the new world order that's that's trying to be established uh and and they've accepted The allegation that their races Troy Vincent basically says it logic a dare anytime black coaches Aren't given enough jobs during the all season. Well, you're right It's because we're racist and if we don't put these little extra tricks and incentives in you get a third round pick if you hire a black coach and all that Instead of just standing firm and saying hey, this is a joke You know what this league is about? Opportunity and how many opportunity? I have benefited Jason would like never peter dropping the NFL. No one ever even thought about giving me a tryout but america's love affair with football Allowed me to escape poverty and get a football scholarship To a mid-major school and change the course of my life and help members and my family changed the course of their life The NFL has a tremendous story to tell football has a tremendous story to tell It won't tell it and I think they're in on it the the ownership roder gadell Troy Vincent You know roder gadell making 40 some odd million a year Troy vincence probably making five 10 million a year They're good as long as their individual families are good and They're not going to do what's right and and I'm I think they think what they're doing is right I certainly agree with the money part of what you just said Colin coward has a good line. I can't remember it exactly but it goes something like major league baseball does it first the nba does it the best and the nfl makes the most money from it and The idea for the nfl is they never lead on anything the nfl has no values the nfl has no principles The nfl cares only about money the nba went woke the nfl Decided maybe we'll jump in on this. We'll see how it goes Their ratings collapsed the nfl jumped back found a way to just pay To get people like Colin Kaepernick to not kneel and what hey will start a social I still get this this from um several of the former player emails and things if you have a social justice cause just let us know we got we got money for it We got grants nfl grants. Just let us know and we'll put it's a they decided to throw money at the problem because they knew The ratings weren't good, but they tried it for a season the nba tried it first Their ratings are still un recoverable at this point and so the They the nfl is not going to go patriotic. They're not going to go what is right? They're not going to suddenly turn back to christian values until somebody else does it and then they'll wait and see And if that works, they'll triple down on it and they'll make the most money doing it. This is what the nfl does I think I think if Major league baseball turned around and became the most patriotic league and they ascended like crazy The nfl would be right behind them. I just don't think the nfl has any principles There's not a value in sight with these guys They care only about sitting back observing making the most money possible And then caught droopling down on whatever that thing is All right tj I may have you back tomorrow to talk about Ew jackson and that sermon you shared with me Yesterday, uh, we're certainly going to get into it on wens the With bobby and anthony, but we're going to get into it tomorrow as well Anybody watching if you go to my twitter feed, I think i've put out this ew jackson Um Sermon and if you can find on my twitter feed you should watch it tonight.
