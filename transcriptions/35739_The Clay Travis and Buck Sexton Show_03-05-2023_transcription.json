Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Second hour of Clayhead Buck starts right now. Thanks for being here with us everybody all across the country. We have now with us Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. Governor Stitt, we know you're super busy trying to do the best possible for the good people of your state. You just signed earlier this week a bill that, well, there's the way that the Democrat media is writing about it. It basically prevents children from having gender-mutilation surgery done to them by going after doctors. Can you just tell us what's contained in the bill and what the reaction has been? Well, listen, in Oklahoma, I mean, it's common sense. I've had so many people just thank me, call me, text me, Governor. Thank you for protecting our young people. Listen, all it says is we're not going to let utilization, gender surgeries, harmful surgeries happen to minors. That's all it says. And I've been public to say, listen, if you want to do an elective surgery after you're an adult and you're going to pay for it, go knock yourself out. But we're not going to use taxpayer dollars and we're certainly not going to let it happen to our youth. We've got to protect them. They can't buy alcohol or cigarettes or get tattoos. And then we think it's OK to let them mutilate their bodies like that. That's just nonsense. It's not going to happen in Oklahoma. Kevin, I'm a Governor Stitt. I just have to ask you as well. Our debt, because I haven't seen this in the write-ups of it. What kind of opposition from Oklahoma State Democrats did this bill receive? Or did some of them go along with it? You know, I can't. I'll have to pull up the exact vote, but yeah, they all voted a block. They all vote against anything that's common sense, my opinion. And so they voted against this. They did not go that. That's all we really didn't know. They went along with it. They're sorry. They would not go along with this. That is correct. That is correct. Governor, appreciate you coming on. You're around both of our ages. And would you have ever believed? I was tweeting about this recently that we would be in a place where kids would be having transgender surgeries, which is wild. And also simultaneously that if you say men who identify as women shouldn't be able to compete in women's athletics, you mentioned Democrats voting in block. I believe only RFK junior of someone who affiliates with the Democrat party has even been willing to say women who identify a men who identify as women shouldn't be able to compete in women's athletics. I mean, where do we go from here? Because it seems like the legislation that you signed is very important, but we're truly to a place where insanity is the preferred position of one of the major political parties out there when it comes to just simple things like athletics. Well, you said it so well. I mean, I signed that bill. We said, listen, boys are going to play in boys sports. Girls are going to play in girls. I had the Washington Post interview me and they were like, Governor, you signed this controversial bill and I said, well, hang on. Hang on. It's not really controversial in Oklahoma. We know the difference between boys and girls. And it's fundamentally unfair for a 14 year old trying to get a scholarship or playing volleyball or a college athlete track star at the University of Oklahoma. To compete against biological males. And that's just so common sense to us. We think that the left has lost their mind. And I'm telling you, it is it is pausing the a lot of different, normally democratic voters to swing our direction because they know how crazy this is. And they have daughter of fourth grade that they want to protect. And so it to us, it's just common sense and we have to have more people standing up just calling us calling. Just say, listen, this is this is right and wrong. We're speaking to Governor Kevin state of Oklahoma, Governor, you know, just last week, the justice, the Biden justice department announced that they are suing the state of Tennessee for its law that protects children from transgender surgery. And I'm going to say, I'm going to say that the Biden and D O J is going to bring suit against your state. And what would that mean? Well, you know, the federal government sometimes tries to, you know, intimidate states with federal dollars. And man, this is all of our tax dollars. And that's a very dangerous, you know, path to go down when the federal government can, you know, stop funding roads and bridges or trying to push their agenda to our Department of Health and our health care authority, the way we run our Medicaid because, you know, we believe in the 10th amendment, which just basically says that what's not specifically given to the federal government belongs to the state or the people, the states or the people. And so we're so much closer. And I'm going to first tell you that I represent 4 million Oklahoma and we're going to do things different than they do in California. They might do it in Texas or Illinois. And that's the great thing about our country is there's 50 different examples of democracies, laboratories of democracies. And and and so we're going to do things differently. We believe in low taxes. We believe in smaller government. We believe in freedoms. I refuse to shut my state down during COVID. And now you're seeing people move to Oklahoma. We're top 10 right now and people move into our state because of our pro freedom, pro business policies and traditional family values. We believe in this. Governor, you're obviously a neighbor of Texas and I'm wondering as title 42 is set to be repealed next week, whether you guys in Oklahoma are having to prepare for potential influx of illegal immigration and or what you think governors should be able to do to respond to what's happening in our southern border, which Joe Biden seems quite content to just leave wide open. Well, you know, that's something that the Republican governor's Association. We're kind of in lockstep on that. I went down with governor Abbott. There was 10 governors that went to the border. We put a 10 point plan together. We need to go back to the Trump policies of remain in Mexico. We have to have a strong border. It's just beyond me. It's mind boggling. It makes no common sense to not say we have to know who's coming through our southern border. You've got the fentanyl issue that that's really what is affected my state and bordering states to Texas and because we know that's flooding in through the southern border at the same sense. Once we have a strong border, we have to have common sense immigration reform. And so again, it all flows together. Ronald Reagan had an immigration policy. We need to be talking about that, but we can't even have that conversation because you're just going to be you're just going to the mass migration is going to continue to flood in if you don't have a strong border. So again, I just can't tell you how strongly we should be, you know, defending our border, making sure we know who's coming into our country and and what whatever it is, putting me in the middle of the border. Oh, thanks so much, guys. We'll talk to you soon. Yes, sir. You know, Clay, it's such an interesting stat that he brings up on Oklahoma. You know, Oklahoma is not a big state. So for it, it's one thing when Florida and Texas are getting a lot of people moving to them because they've got huge populations. They're their places that for a long time have been there's reasons why people would go seek them out. You know, it's interesting that Oklahoma, I think just because of policy, sure, there's economic opportunity and. And you can get good value for your money there in terms of home and quality of life, cost of living, all that stuff. But these red states are running up the scoreboard and the the redder they are increasingly we see the more people are just like, sign me up. I got to go to this place. I've got to figure this out and how I can how I can get there. You know, one thing that I was curious about it, I'm wondering if maybe we could get the governor of Tennessee as we are sitting here in Tennessee to join us at some point and explain this, it seems to me that we're at a point where with the we mentioned the trans shooter manifesto has been delayed once again. Could could governor could governor Lee just say, I mean, he's the head of law enforcement in the state of Tennessee that they need to release this thing. You know, I feel like if it were Oklahoma, they would have released it. I feel like there's a little bit of a delay here. They're allowing Nashville and the so it was the FBI, the feds. And now it's Nashville PD weighing in and someone needs to come in and say the people of this state have a right to know if they want to know what the motivation here was and what happened. No, I think you're right. And for those of you out there who don't know, we'll open up phone lines on this 800-282-2882 while we've been on the air, the Nashville Police Department has put out a statement saying that due to pending litigation, they are not going to be able to release the trans manifest. Now, the manifesto, as I understand it, Buck, is not one document. This trans shooter had a bunch of different sort of journals that she was keeping that laid out the rationale behind the decision that she was making. But I've been told and I said it on the show that this was going to be released. Last week, the Nashville Police Department said that they were going to be releasing it and now we're sitting 37 days out and it still hasn't happened. And now I question whether it's ever going to be released. I think that they could have handled this very early on by saying, look, we understand people want to have some sense of, and you know, it is a public safety issue. It's a public, it's an issue of public need to know. We would have said in the intelligence community, right? Why did this person do what she did? Now, if it's just that she's a complete psychopathic lunatic and there is nothing else that anyone should be aware of that was part of the motivations of this as in political motivations of some kind, then they should say that, right? They could tell us, look, we've scrubbed all the information we have. And here is our honest best assessment of motivation. And that would at least now, I think still eventually you have to release the manifesto. But remember, they won't tell us motivation at all. Nothing. We've heard nothing about this. They won't tell us motivation and they won't release the source material. That's what makes it feel so much like a cover up. Now, you could say, well, Buck, they could just lie about the motivation. And but yeah, eventually when the information comes out and I believe it will at some point, if they lie, then they look, you know, that that's a massive liability for them. And I don't think, you know, I don't think that's happening right now. But for them to withhold any insight on why this happened and the information itself just seems like a political, a political cover up. And I think everyone is pretty furious about it. Who's been following the case closely. Buck, one thing that I've been told and I've been holding off on saying it, but I've been told by reliable people on it is that the reason she went to this school in her writings is detailed because she found that there was not significantly. Significant security there. Eddard bare minimum compared to other school compared to other schools. So think about just the political implications of that. Think of every mass shooting we have seen recently that has occurred at a school. What do conservatives say? What is the position? How do we increase security? We should allow teachers to aren't that doesn't mean every teacher. It doesn't mean, you know, you know, this is Ethel, who's 95 has to go in strapped. It means that you've got guys who are former law enforcement. You've got people who just want to get the training and know how to handle a weapon who want to conceal carry who would create that additional effect of any school shooter has to know. Maybe it maybe there's an armed teacher. I don't know who it would be in the school plus the possibility of armed official uniform security. This is what we say. If that was taken into the mindset of the mass shooter in Tennessee, that's what I mean by we have a right to know on a policy level. If these kinds of considerations are being made by the mass murderers who enter our schools with the intent to harm our children, but the Biden administration does not want that to be part of the discussion. We would know that obviously. That's what I've been told is that her decision to attack that school was based on going in and looking at it and seeing that it was less well protected than other schools and other locations as well that she considered for a mass shooting, right? That by itself would be an incredible revelation because what it would reflect is something that all of you know you can be insane and still make partly sane decisions. In other words, she didn't walk into Fort Knox, right? She didn't walk into Fort Knox and try to shoot that place up. Fort Campbell is just up the road, right? Where there's tons of military. She didn't show up there and try to shoot that. She went into a religious elementary school that she believed she would be able to wreak mass chaos up on. And so all of these details matter. I think it's consequential as we said with the U-Val day shooting. We need to look at every single thing there. Now the Nashville police to their credit responded heroically to this shooter. Someone truly that the officers. There's the bureaucracy of the police, which I think we still have issues with. But those officers on that day were heroic and I think every citizen of Nashville and I'm one of them deserves to know why this trans shooter chose this location and what else did she put out there about her motivations to do so. If there was a change, if she's a terrorist, okay? If there was a change in tactics that the terrorists made because of the issue of armed teachers and or security. We have a public interest right to know that and it makes a difference. The parents out there, parents in Nashville, parents across the country should know, hey, psychopathic school shooters, by the way, when I was in the CIA and we're helping, you know, J.Sock, tag and bag, the bad guys all over the world, the jihadists. There's all, there's all kinds of crazy. They're still thinking about how they can kill maximum number of innocent people. They're crazy, but they're still trying to. There's a lot to their. Correct. They're trying to be tactically proficient. But that's a component of this. And then also if the media narrative about, you know, trans trans children not being able to get the gender affirming notice how it's no longer gender transitioning. Gender affirming surgery in Tennessee. If that was a factor, well, then we should look at the rhetoric that's being used about trans genocide and the rest of the stuff that's being said left wing media. These are the kinds of things. People are wondering why would we want to know? These are the reasons we want to know. It's not just for some idle curiosity to delve into the mind of an evil psychopath. And I, again, if this person had been a deranged Trump supporting lunatic and they had written a manifesto, all of that information would be out and it would have been out within a day of the shooting. We're sitting here 37 days after a crazy psychotic, trans terrorist attacked innocent people in a religious school. And the city of Nashville has still not made all of this information public. I think it's unacceptable to your point, Buck, Republican governor, double Republican senators, eight of the nine congressional members of the Tennessee caucus are Republican as well. So I would think that all of them would be fired up about this as well. If you own a small business that employs five or more people, you may have a tax refund coming your way.

We're talking about the Nashville Police Department saying they will not release this manifesto. And Harold in Huntington, Tennessee. When it gets you in here quickly, Harold, you got an interesting case. What have you got? Why? Why would the Governor give the Justin Triplets a platform again? I won't call them the Tennessee 3. I'll call them the Justin Triplets. Yeah, you know what? This is a really good point. And I want to build off of it when we come back. They're talking about a special legislative session.

MyPatrietsSupply.com We are following the breaking news here as we are talking to you of an active shooter at an Atlanta area hospital reports of multiple injuries. It is very much still a breaking news story, so as we have more on this, we will share it with you. And they've got security images that they've released of the suspect. We'll have more again as it comes in. There is the possibility, Clay, that the Tennessee State Legislature, we're sitting here together right now in Tennessee in Nashville. And the Tennessee State Legislature could have an emergency session that would deal with security and firearms related issues. I haven't seen that much in the specifics. What can you tell us about where this stands in your home state and what they think might be able to be accomplished, even though right now, of course, we don't even have a manifesto. Yeah, this is really important, I think. The Tennessee Legislature, both the House and the Senate, Republicans have a supermajority. And certainly there's been more attention, voiced it on the two members who were voted out almost than there has been on the failure of the Senate. On the failure of this manifesto to be released. But here is what I would say. And I know a lot of the members of the House and the Senate and their staffs listened to this show on a regular basis. It seems quite simple for me for the Tennessee Legislature to say, how in the world can you expect us to address red flag laws or any other aspects of existing Tennessee gun laws when the full motivations of the United States. And the limitations of the shooter are not out there. And the impetus for changing things in the first place is the shooter's actions. So that seems very straightforward to me. If you're in the Tennessee Legislature, if you're in the House or the Senate, you should be beating your fist on the desks and having press conferences and making it quite clear that until this full manifesto, every aspect of it. And broadly speaking, the manifesto term, which was initially used by, I believe, the chief of Nashville police. It's actually, I'm told a series of notebooks and a series of writings. But for instance, if as I am being told, one reason she targeted that religious elementary school was because she had visited other locations and decided that they were not as well defended. And therefore she attacked there. The number one takeaway is, Buck, as we were just saying, you can be insane and still act logically in your insanity in some ways, right? So the mental illness that I think it's quite clear she had in many mass shooters, maybe most mass shooters have, did not stop her from what I'm being told from going around two places in Nashville and assessing their security. And finding this to be the most attackable and choosing to go there. So Senator Marsha Blackburn, for instance, has introduced legislation that would add far more security officers to every school in the country so that your kids are protected. And I say this, Buck, as a parent with kids in three different schools in Nashville, my kids go to schools where there are armed security. I want every kid in America to have that same opportunity. And I'm saying that as a parent, regardless of what your politics are. But if this there is evidence, Buck, that the reason this girl targeted this school was because of a lack of security, well, that changes everything. And it really makes the idea of having armed people in school, I think even more paramount. And I think it goes deeper than that too in terms of the politics of it, Clay, because what has been the four decades now, the Democrat response and something that they try to expand constantly is schools are a gun free zone, which is among the dumbest policies anybody has ever come up with for anything. All that does is prevent law abiding good adults from being able to have a firearm on campus to defend themselves and their students. There is not a single mass shooter in history who has thought, you know, I'm going to go murder a bunch of people, but the enhancement that I will get on my sentencing from the gun free zone is going to make me think twice. It is an abjectly moronic policy. It's basically waving to any shooter. There's going to be almost no guns to combat you here. What it does is, and I can think about this from a counterterrorism analysis standpoint, it takes what is always going to be a soft target. Let's understand that a school is, you know, school is not a military facility, right? And it's not going to be. But it takes what is a somewhat soft target and makes it the softest target possible, meaning it makes it a situation where a maximum of a person is not going to be. It's not going to be a situation where a mass shooter can reliably act on the belief that anyone else, good people who obey laws are defenseless in this facility. So you can go in there knowing that until law enforcement arrives on the scene, you are not going to have any real opposition that can bring force to bear to end the threat to neutralize that threat. So, decades of gun-free school zones haven't stopped any shootings as we know. And occasionally someone who's going to go sporting clay shooting or something after school, someone sees a 12-gauge shotgun in the back of the pickup truck and it's, oh my gosh, gun-free zone, and then it does this person get locked up. All this panic. There are people listening to this right now, I'm sure, used to go to schools before this became a federal law, federal issue, they've made this. I'm sure they brought guns in their truck or in their car to school in the parking lot to go shooting afterwards, right? I mean, back in the 70s, back in the 60s, this was a thing. I've talked to people who were going to schools that had shooting teams and they would actually take their rifles to the school so that they could go out on the shooting team after school for practice, which is kind of emblematic. Guess what? There weren't any school shootings then. And this is so important, if I don't understand, the people who shriek and rage and shout venom at anyone who thinks that allowing teachers to be armed is the way we should say it, allowing teachers to conceal carry, advocating for armed security at schools, advocating for a program to take veterans who we train to use firearms to be protecting schools in places. And, you know, of course, the veteran can be pregnant at school and also, you know, it's another presence, often going to be a male presence on campus to help out with other things and be a role model for the kids. And, you know, there's a lot of stuff that could come to this. The people, though, who sneer at those ideas are never going to want to hear that not only are they not sound in terms of policy, but their lunacy in terms of the gun free school zones and, you know, we have to take all the guns out of all the law buying people's hands may have made schools left safe and resulted in more casualties of adults and students in these schools. They're just never going to want to accept that. So there's a big psychological impact they're trying to avoid. We'll open up your phone lines because I'd like to hear calls if we're missing anything 800-282-2882. But, Buck, isn't it the most easy and straightforward and important thing for the Tennessee legislature to do, both the House and the Senate, just say we can't really look at red flag laws and potentially changing the law when the reason we're meeting is this school shooting, and we're not able to see what the motivations for this shooter actually were. Red flag laws aren't going to work, folks. Red flag laws aren't going to work. I get it. Red flag laws, I will say, are well-intentioned and theoretically could possibly maybe under certain circumstances work. But, you know, you're going to miss, you know, 99 out of 100 of these instances, I think, just because to try to catch somebody. And maybe it's maybe not. I'm more open to the idea of the red flag laws if very clear on what the judicial oversight is in it, but, you know, it gets tough. The implementation of this is where it all falls apart. Well, to me, you could balance red flag laws with adding more security at schools if the goal is to respond to this shooting and try to make it less likely, which I would imagine everybody's goal is that. The problem is there'll be abuse, though, too. This is we all the red flag laws will be abused. And so this is what, but it's a conversation that's I understand people. At a minimum, you can't respond to a shooting until you know all the details and motivations of the shooter. And so we're sitting here 37 days after the shooting. This seems quite simple to me for the legislature. The leaders to just say, hey, this whole thing has to be released in order for us to have this special legislative session. I would say the same thing to the governor. Anybody in state government, to me, this is a simple, straightforward demand that should be that should be acted upon before you can decide, hey, we're going to try to change existing law. You need to know how the existing law failed. That's that's the most basic foundational level here. And I think it would get a response in some way other than there's pending litigation. So we can't release this. Very strange, very odd behavior by the Nashville police department legal team, whoever they may be making this choice. 800, 282, 288, look, the market's been brutal. Everybody's talking about inflation. It's everywhere 40 year high. Buck and I recently met with Dutch Mendenhall, Dutch is the founder of Rad diversified as a patriot.

We are rolling through the Wednesday edition of the program. We have got a lot of people who want to weigh in on this story surrounding the school shooting and the failure to release the manifesto. Let's dive right in. Sergeant Major Taylor from East Tennessee, thanks for your service. How would you assess the failure to release this manifesto? You know, sir, thank you for accepting my call. It's a great honor to be on your show. Listen to you guys a lot. Thank you. This is a political hack job. I mean, come on. You know, I've hunted terrorists all over the world and I've never seen anything like this before. I mean, as a Tennessee and how disgusted are you that this thing's not getting released? It makes me violently ill to my stomach. I mean, you know, we live in a great free state. Yep. And you know, Governor Lee is supposed to be a conservative pro gun this that the other now. He's pulling up red flag laws and all this stuff just because some terrorists goes in and shoots up a Christian school. Notice somebody else Clay who's a practitioner from the military side. The word is terrorist. This is a terrorist. And this gentleman is correct. And the motivations here make a big deal, right, Sergeant Major? Yes, sir. Absolutely. I mean, it's the same motivations all over the world. I mean, you know, two and two equals four. You see one saying, so this is just that. This is a political nightmare. Yeah, it's a cover. It's a cover up. It absolutely is. And we're furious about it too. And we've been calling it. As you know, Sergeant Major, thank you so much, sir, for your service. And thank you for calling in. You know, we keep bringing it up when it wasn't even a news cycle. We've talked about it last week, talking about the week before. We're not forgetting this because that's the whole game that they play. That is what they are. They're trying to do. You know, Clay, did you see this? Oh, wait. Oh, sorry. We got every line lit. I was like, wait, is that? Do you want to get to a couple of others here? Yeah, let's keep. Let's keep power. Just in the truck driver in Wilmington, North Carolina. Love our truck driver listeners. What's going on, Justin? Yes, sir. I'm just driving down the highway. Hands free. So let's not forget where the gun free school zone law came from. It came from Crooked Joe Biden in 1990. And I believe it's part of his design for his anti-second amendment, propaganda, and, you know, the man is just garbage. I just want to point out you are your correct, sir. The 1990 gun free school zone act. Federal penalties for possession, possessing a firearm on school grounds signed by George H. W. Bush, by the way, but Biden was involved on the Senate side in the passage of that. Uh, led just he introduced. Wait, let me just make sure that's correct here. I'm looking at the Reuters fact checking of God. See, this is the problem. When you try to fact check on the fly and you find a fact check, you can't trust the people that call themselves the fact checkers. Who checks the fact checkers? You look that up. Johnny, the truck driver also. Brooklyn. What do you got for us, Johnny? Yeah, just this weekend. Me and my daughter were training with our less than lethal personal protection. And she mentioned to me that when her teachers went over to do's and don't, if there is a school shooting, you're not supposed to go start pressing your phone and calling 911 because it'll make noise. So I asked her, I said, would you be more comfortable if your teacher was packing if your teacher had a firearm? And she said 100%. Now, maybe my daughter might be a little different because I changed her up since she was six years old, like all my other kids had a handle fire alarm safely. So it wouldn't concern her if somebody was armed, but some of these parents and kids really don't want their teachers to have firearms in the school, which is nonsense. Yeah, I appreciate the call. Look, I'm fine if teachers are well trained with the idea of a teacher having a gun. I think what is imminently clear is that every single school should have well trained security in that school, like officers, security officials directly assigned to the school who are armed. That's what happens at my kid's school. That's what I want for everybody. We have a lot. And, you know, in a state like Tennessee, you know, how many, how many, you know, retired former military or retired former law enforcement veterans and law enforcement out there with the firearms skills with the criminal awareness would consider taking up one of these roles and protect schools. Tons of the right. So, by the way, I want to just get to this because it's classic. There was a fact check of the did Biden introduced the Gun Free School Zones Act from Reuters. You know what they said, oh, well, it's not really true. Oh, I'm sorry. It is kind of true, though, because the legislation of the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990 was included in the crime bill that Joe Biden sponsored. So, yeah, it was his he was the guy behind the crime bill, which he later repudiated as we know. And the Gun Free School Zones was in the Biden crime bill. So you start to see the politics of this friends and you understand why the cover up seems to be underway in this way.
