    "text": " Hello and welcome to the Federalist Radio Hour. My name is Tristan Justice and I'm the Western Correspondent for the Federalist. And joining me today is Montana Radio host Aaron Flynn. Aaron, how are you doing? Hey, I'm doing great. Great to chat with you, Tristan. Big fan of your work at the Federalist. Thank you. Now, are you based in Helena or Billings or? Yeah, I'm based in Billings, but when we go statewide with our radio show from 9 to 10 mountain time, we're on the air in Helena and yeah, about 20 plus radio signals all across Montana. So we take callers, everything. Oh, wow. So I want to talk about the stuff that's been going on in Helena. There seems to be quite a few disruptions going national. But what you have, you know, the legislature of course passed this bill to protect miners with gender dysphoria from undergoing these permanent procedures with hormone treatments and surgeries and all the kinds of stuff that's going on. But there's a transgender lawmaker up there who's making a fuss about this and has been encouraging demonstrators to take over the Capitol and we've been seeing this play out across the country. What have you been seeing happening in Montana? Well, I think what's really interesting, so the legislature just wrapped up in the transgender lawmaker drama kind of consumed the final few days of the legislative session. But nonetheless, they still got a lot of work done. But what I find very interesting, so here in Montana, we have a 90 day legislative session started back in January, wraps up by the end of April, first part of May. So and they only meet every other year. We do not our lawmakers do not meet every year. So they have a biennial session, right? I think it was very clear since day one that this representative from Missoula, Montana and Missoula, Montana for your listeners is like the Berkeley, California of Montana. It's the Boulder, Colorado of Montana, right? It's the liberal hotbed. I went to college there at a great town, but it's changed a lot because of the college campus environment, all the radical environmental groups and other left wing activists that have kind of found a home in Missoula, Montana. So that's where this transgender lawmaker comes from. And I think it was very clear that very early on that the Democrats and this representative Zephyr from Missoula, we're going to try to figure out a way to become a victim, try to figure out a way to say, Oh, those mean Republicans are being mean to me, right? You know, the latest, the latest victimhood Olympics. And really, I think the Republicans did an incredible job. They have a super majority in the Montana legislature now because the Democrats have gone so far off the deep end. So obviously the Republicans have this super majority there in charge. But I thought they did a really good job throughout the entirety of the session, really being kind and respectful to this representative and the rest of the Democrats. And I think I think they did a very good job because I think from day one, you know, we knew that this representative Zephyr was going to be demanding access to the women's restrooms. And they were going to be playing the pronoun game. But it's quite remarkable when you think about it that really it wasn't until the final few days of the legislative session that it took this representative Zephyr, breaking house rules, breaking decorum, attacking fellow lawmakers with a bigoted attack on lawmakers of faith, then refusing to apologize for breaking those rules, then cheering on this trans insurrection, this trans-direction when these transgender activists ended up getting arrested for for tussling with law enforcement and disrupting the democratic process on the Montana House floor. So it's quite remarkable that that it took it took representative Zephyr breaking the rules and then cheering on this mob in order to finally get the national attention that that representatives Zephyr so desperately wanted from day one. So I definitely want to talk about the media treatment of everything going on out there, how they've covered this, how they've covered representatives Zephyr. But I want to first go through some of the legislation that's been passed up there because it's my understanding that there's not just one bill that the legislature passed on these issues. They passed to be able to protect minors with gender dysphoria from these permanent life altering interventions. But I understand they passed several pieces of legislation addressing this issue. Yeah, the other big one is what's known as medical rights of conscience, which I'm sure you've been tracking in other states, which okay, so not only did we pass Senate bill 99 and a great Vietnam veteran by the name of John Fuller, a state senator at a callus bill Montana. He was the author of Senate bill 99. And so that's the legislation that would protect kids from these radical transgender surgeries chopping off healthy body parts or giving them life altering drugs that can lead to lifelong you know, health complications and things like that. But in addition to that, there was a bill that Montana Governor Greg G and Forte signed in a law that's known as medical rights of conscience. I believe it was the bill carried by Representative Amy Regeer also at a callus spell. And what this does is this says, Hey, so not only has Montana now said, Hey, we're going to protect kids from these radical procedures. But not only that, but we want to protect nurses and doctors and other healthcare professionals from being forced into having to take part in these horrific types of procedures as well. So, so if, you know, like much like we saw from Matt Walsh's great reporting out of Tennessee, where they were, you know, they were busted on camera saying, Hey, hey, hospitals, you're going to have to force your nurses and doctors to perform these procedures because you're going to make a lot of money doing these procedures on these kids. So you're going to, but you're going to have to force nurses and doctors to partake in these procedures because they're not going to want to do this to kids. So I think the Montana legislature and the governor knew they've got to protect healthcare professionals from being forced into this as well. So just like we don't want nurses and doctors being forced into having to perform abortion, we also don't want to protect our nurses and doctors from not being forced into having to take part in some procedure that might remove healthy body parts off of kids. There's also a, you know, a drag queen story hour targeting kids. There's a, there's a bill that passed the legislative session on that front as well. Really these issues really became the, I think the most in the spotlight types of issues for this legislative session, because if we're to look back on this 90 day legislative session here in Montana, I think it can best be summed up by basically pointing out the fact that, okay, here's the Republican super majority in Montana that just delivered over a billion dollars in tax relief, tax reduction in the rates, tax rebate checks that come out later this summer. So the Republicans delivered over a billion dollars in tax relief and what defined are the Democrats this legislative session wanting to do these radical transgender surgeries on kids and dragging drag queens to the Capitol so that they can read the kids. What in the world? And this is happening nationwide. I mean, I made a list of all the states that were capitals of legislators have been passing similar legislation as Montana and where these capitals have come under attack by transgender demonstrations, Tennessee, Kansas, Kentucky, Florida, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas. I mean, I remember the last two and a half years we had every single major media outlet condemning this quote insurrection at the US Capitol after January 6th and I'm reading the Associated Press last week over what's been going on in Montana that the conservatives are redefining what an insurrection is to go after transgender people. And so of course, there's some media culpability in all this, but speaking about transgender issues at large, they said for years that this was happening, that there was no surgeries for children under 18, to permanently alter their bodies. But now we know we have major institutions bragging about how profitable these procedures have been for their bottom line. Vanderbilt University is a great example of this that has came out last year by Matt Walsh at the Daily Wire and I was just reading about Snapchat today. There is this reporter from the Babylon, well, I wouldn't say reporter, but I punned it, so on Twitter how they were speaking to Snapchat's artificial intelligence robot, which is on every single child's cell phone today who's got the Snapchat app, which seems like everyone, quote, I feel like a boy. She wrote that three times since Snapchat's artificial intelligence and just after three times she was being led to doctors who offered, quote, gender-affirming care, which of course is a misleading term in and of itself. So, I mean, this legislation is warranted, especially after Democrats were trying to say this wasn't happening, this wasn't happening, well, if it wasn't happening, A, this legislation wouldn't even be necessary. B, if it wasn't happening, why do you care so much if this legislation is being passed? And C, now you're descending hundreds and hundreds of pro-trans demonstrators on capitals across the country, which according to their terms is an insurrection. Yeah, no, exactly. And it's so similar to the 2020 BLM riots that we saw in attacks on law enforcement, burning down police precincts, targeting U.S. Marshals at a federal courthouse, targeting law enforcement, burning down black-owned businesses. And yeah, they were so dismissive of hundreds of BLM riots, but yet then when it comes to January 6, that's all they can talk about. And yeah, in a similar regard, all of a sudden they don't care about disrupting the democratic process at a capital, they don't care about tussling with law enforcement. Don't call them, it's like LL Cool J, don't call it a comeback, but this is don't call it an insurrection, the media lectures us on. And yet we see these attacks now taking place in Statehouse after Statehouse after Statehouse. It just once again exposes the hypocrisy of the liberal media mob. I mean, the Associated Press, for example, this is going to sound like inside baseball, but here in Montana, let's say 20 years ago, if you were a local radio station in, say, you know, Wolf Point, Montana, you'd rip out the AP headlines for the day. You might have six or seven Associated Press news headlines for the day of Montana stories that the broadcast editor trimmed down for broadcast form and put it in the broadcast format. Today, you're lucky if there's one 30 second story sitting there waiting for you. If you were to rip and read off the AP wire. Last week they had three stories almost every single day, all on this radical transgender lawmaker from Missoula. And they were in each story was biased. And each story was calling him her and shoving the pronouns down people's throats. And I think, you know, what I've heard from so many women across Montana is that, you know, they're so desperate not to offend a man from Missoula that they're offending women from all across Montana. Right. And you seem you spoke about drag shows for kids earlier. Look, I don't have an issue with drag in and of itself. I don't understand the fascination with it. I'm not particularly a fan. I don't watch RuPaul's Drag Race. Even though I'm gay and all my friends do, I just I don't understand the fascination with it. But drag shows have absolutely no place for children. And look, they all hate this groomer terminology. Okay. If you don't want to be called a groomer, maybe don't groom children. This was the question that people here in Montana kept asking. Why are they because they brought drag queens to the Capitol and did a drag queen story hour inside our Montana Capitol? And it's like, Hey, hey, Zoe Zephyr, you got your surgery as a 30 something year old male to now identify as a female. Nobody's barring anybody else like you from doing that. Nobody's telling you you can't do that. Nobody's telling you you can't live your life that way. Yeah. So in my career, I had a guy call in to the radio show early on in the drag queen story hour debate when they were when they did one at a zoo here in the state. And he said, look, yeah, there was there's a drag queen event that goes on at a bar in Bozeman. He says, I'm a straight white male. I go to the event. I find it entertaining. He's like, but that said a bar. He said, that's not appropriate for kids. So why are they so desperate to read to our kids and to talk to our kids? I like, it's just crazy. And then with the surgeries, why are they so desperate on targeting kids? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Watchtower on Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski.

New polls show 40% of Republicans don't want Trump to run, but he's still leading in the polls. Has the new Republican strategy become leading to the left on certain issues? How should Republicans approach this primary strategy with an easy path to the White House? Whether it's happening in DC or down on Wall Street, it's affecting you financially. Be informed. Check out the Watchtower on Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski on Apple Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. And now you have apps like Snapchat or an artificial intelligence leading kids to doctors to provide this quote, gender, firm, and care. And now you have legislation in states like Oregon. I believe it's Oregon, if that California, Colorado, allowing minors to pursue these treatments without parental consent. And so it was a real problem here. But back to Zui Zepfer. So the legislature has been working on this package of transgender legislation for the past few months. And it was in mid-April that the storyline really took off when you had this lawmaker from Missoula. He's a freshman representative, first term in the House, first transgender representative in the House. And so, after taking this grandstand against this package of legislation and mocked Republican prayers, claiming that if this legislation passed, then Republicans could, next time they pray, we'll see blood on your hands. And so that demonstrably violated the quorum. House Republicans acted appropriately, censured the representative until he issued an apology. The speaker refused to recognize him. And he encouraged this mob of pro-trans demonstrators to take over the Capitol. The legislature had to cancel the rest of the session, cancel an entire session the next day, and then ultimately a ban the representative from the rest of the serious legislative session. And like you said, the legislature only meets every other year. So he's not allowed back in the chamber for the rest of the session. But now it's been going even further than that. I mean, the entire time no one took away the representatives, right, to vote in the legislature maintains voting privileges, just can't participate in Florida Bay after biling to quorum and encouraging this trans correction. What else am I missing here? Yeah. No, you're hitting the nail on the head here. And you shared the full story there. Most of the left wing media, the legacy media, whatever, however you want to refer to them, they only give half the story. They say, well, Zephyr was censured for saying blood on their hands. No, it's the attack on people of faith. If you attack a specific group of people, you can't even say another lawmaker's name on the floor of the Montana House. I had a former representative, John Sinridge, his name. And he said, hey, you know, everybody gets fired up. Everybody gets passionate. He said, one time I used another lawmaker's name during my floor remarks. Well, that was against the rules. So I apologized and we moved on. And isn't it interesting that this representative Zephyr was so desperate to pretend to be the victim, so desperate to pretend to be discriminated against to look like this fake civil rights hero that representative Zephyr didn't want to be treated like everybody else because everybody else would have followed the rules, apologized and moved on. But no, no, Zephyr wanted different treatment, wanted to be discriminated against. And they didn't discriminate against Zephyr. They held Zephyr to the same rules that they held everybody else to. Another former lawmaker, his name is Roger Koopman. He was on our public service commission here in Montana as well. And he told a story. There was, you know, the teachers union activists showed up in the House gallery one session and they started getting a little raucous. They started getting a little rowdy. They were starting to get out of hand. And the Democrat lawmakers on the floor at the time saw what was happening in the gallery above and they started calming the mob down. They said, Hey, you know, because they knew like, like, if this crowd didn't calm down in violation of the rules, law enforcement was going to have them removed. The sergeant of arms was going to remove these people from the gallery and it was going to make the Democrats look very bad. And so the Democrats on the floor quieted down the mob. Zephyr on the other hand stood there on the floor. Well, everybody else was ordered to clear the floor because remember these transgender activists were throwing things at the lawmakers and the young pages that are there helping with the legislature as well. So the sergeant at arms for people's safety cleared the floor of the house. Zephyr stayed on the floor and raised up the microphone like some rage against the machine wannabe right from some throwback 1990s concert, raised the microphone in the air, raised the fist in the air and urged the mob on. Could you imagine if on January 6th, a Republican had stayed back and was. Hang in next to Mr. Buffalo head guy and was raising a microphone and cheering on the crowd at January 6th. Oh, man, they'd be in shackles right now. Who had also reminded listeners when the Senate chambers and asked to pray for the officers. So pretty remarkable contrast. But one thing about this whole thing, this is not Selma 1965. This is like these demonstrators are treating this as this morally righteous crusade for transgender rights to do these procedures on. And even if it was, they're on the wrong side of the bridge. They're they're fighting to take away women's rights. They're fighting to take away hard fought for women's and girls opportunities in sports Title nine. They're on the wrong side of the bridge, even if they think they're in Selma. No, absolutely right. And it's that you especially saw that play out in Tennessee when you had these representatives begin to claim Republicans were being racist because two of the three lawmakers censured who were expelled from the legislature are black. And so they did this massive march parade through Nashville with this massive crowd behind them as if this is Selma 1965. Well, and and oh man, what about so you went to George Washington University, right? Washington DC is that right, Tristan? That's where you went to college? Right. So I started college at Howard University in Washington, DC. You know, and I was one of like six white guys there, my freshman year, I think. And I lived in the all male dorm, the all guys dorm, Carver Hall. And you know, when I would get done waiting tables at night, because I had to wait tables on Pennsylvania Avenue to pay for college. So when I'd get back late at night, I'd end up BS and then having a good time. You know, you know, chatting it up with with the guys in the dorm. I'll guarantee you that that lawmaker in Tennessee, the guy, you know, with the Afro that pretended to be Hillary Clinton at a black southern church, I'll guarantee if I was back at that dorm, those guys would be laughing hysterically mocking that guy because he's such a phony. I mean, he goes from being Carlton on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, you know, when he was at that, that very Ritzy college in New Hampshire running for student body president to all of a sudden now he's like some, some fake want to be Al Sharpton. I mean, it's just like what a phony. I love that transformation because I think it says so much about how they approach these issues. I mean, it's like they're, it's like they're larping the civil rights movement from, so it's actually pretty offensive when you get down to it, treating these issues as this, you know, morally righteous crusade for civil rights. And it's not just, I don't know if it was Justin Jones or Justin Pearson who had that massive transformation, but you're seeing it across Democratic politicians across the entire party. I love watching anytime Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks about identity politics. She talks like he's a preacher at a Baptist church. I don't know if you've seen this. Or when, or remember when she did that town hall meeting and all of a sudden she's like, that's okay. That's okay. It's like, whoa, all of a sudden am I watching Scarface here? Where did that accent come from? I mean, are you stealing money from a boyla down in Puerto Rico again? What the heck's going on here? It's absolutely larping. The movement from the 60s. But I want to get into how the media has been been treating all this. They pretended there was some big backlash against Republicans in Tennessee as if they're an electoral jeopardy for maintaining decorum and the legislature down there. You're doing a similar thing in Montana. There's one lawmaker in particular who's born the brunt of this attack from the media. I think she's from Billings. Representative Kerry Sekans-Kra wrote a column about her this week. NBC News went back and found a clip of her speaking on the floor from several months ago about the mental health issues that her family has phased and claimed right in the headline. Something along lines of Montana lawmaker would rather have a dead daughter than a transgender daughter, which is this ridiculous talking point in the left about transgenderism, even though there's multiple studies now showing that easier access to these actually raises the risk of suicide. But this lawmaker, her daughter wasn't even transgender. She said nothing about her daughter struggling with transgenderism. Her daughter, she barely shared this out in the house for her daughter, had a three-year period where she was struggling mentally and had some suicidal ideation. That speech was manipulated by NBC News, which was then rippled across the media salon, picked it up, gay media such as the advocate picked it up to claim that she would rather have a dead daughter than transgender daughter. Yeah, it was so outrageous. It's crazy too because just like you pointed out here, we know that... When it comes to these radical transgender surgeries where they're going to chop healthy body parts off of kids or give them these puberty blockers, you start hindering bone development. What's that going to do to somebody down the road? And so you think about it, even if somebody did have a kid that was struggling with gender dysphoria, here you've got these folks on the left and these greedy folks from some of these associations that want to profit off of these challenges that these kids are facing. And they say, oh, that's it. You just need to chop off their body parts or they're going to commit suicide when what we've seen in Sweden, even Elon Musk pointed this out, what we've seen in Sweden is that actual suicides, not just suicidal ideation, actual suicides went up in a big way after the surgeries took place. And now if they want to counter that and say, well, that's because they still faced a lot of societal blowback and pressure. You know, this was in Europe where they fully embrace this, where the society embraced this type of this type of culture. And yet it still happened. So maybe there's something else at play there. And so, yeah, they and so, but here's the other big picture thing I think that we can take away from that. So, so are these activists in his NBC News and these others, are they telling, you know, parents all across America now, well, if your kid, if your kid says they want something, you just have to give it to them. I mean, you, you as the parent, you don't know what's best for your kid. That's six year old knows what's best for that six year old. If that six year old wants a smartphone and a TikTok account and a Tinder account or whatever, you just got to give that kid a smartphone. Because if you don't give that kid a smartphone, I mean, you don't know what it's going to do to them. If that little kid likes playing cops and robbers and wants to walk around the neighborhood with a loaded gun, you have to let them do it. Otherwise, you're a bad parent. Is that what they're really suggesting here? The other thing, Jeremy Carl is a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and he made a really fascinating point. This bully campaign that Zephyr has engaged with from the floor of the Montana house, you lawmakers, you'll have blood on your hands. He's suggesting that, well, if you pass this bill, there's, there's gender dysphoric kids out there that are going to kill themselves. Just every single LGBTQ organization out there, there were several that Carl named in this piece that we had on our Montana Talks website, have specifically said, do not say that, do not do that because you are promoting suicide. You are encouraging suicide. And when you look at what these left wing activists are doing, think about it. What is the message they are sending to these kids that are struggling with these issues out there? All these people hate you. They dislike you. They're trying to erase you off the face of the earth. No, we're just saying you better wait till you're 18 because you might decide to identify in a different way, 10 years from now. So maybe you don't want to chop that body part off yet, right? But they are literally promoting suicide. They are promoting suicidal ideation amongst all these kids. They want these kids to be angry. They want these kids to hate these Republicans or these parents who are simply trying to protect them. That is got to be one of the most sinister, disgusting and evil things. So they claim to be LGBTQ yet at the same time they're promoting talking points and ledges and policies that would actually be very harmful and lead to more suicide amongst the very groups they claim to be protecting. I mean, there's just it's just a crazy story all around. Right. This whole narrative about kids being denied access to peer to doctors being more suicidal is such a deeply dishonest talking point to exploit the pain that families are struggling with these issues. I don't think it's any secret that kids today are facing an unprecedented amount of stress. I think technology has really become a poison in the classroom more than it's helping us at this point in a lot of ways. I can't imagine going through elementary, middle and high school with the level of access to social media that kids have now today. And you have on across these platforms these elite institutions and telling kids that they can change their sex and gender willy-nilly without fear of consequence. And so, and I also think, you know, especially with the delay of puberty as to Soscher and levels of front, you know, there's one there's one there's one there's one data point I would love to find out there. I would love to see the testosterone levels in men today who claim to identify as women as testosterone levels drop off a cliff, which is an issue that nobody's talking about. I think you have, you know, this generation of people who are going through puberty later and it's confusing them. And when you have all these institutions saying, well, maybe it's maybe you're not depressed, maybe you're just transgender and you plant that seed in their mind. And then they convince themselves that they're transgender and then it creates this saga into an aura of confusion and then they become lifelong medical patients. And so I think, you know, this whole narrative of, well, this person might kill themselves if you don't let them do what they want to do here is so deeply dishonest and the fact that they regurgitated that to go after this Republican lawmaker just because she supported legislation to protect kids from these life changing procedures is really speaks so much to how our media operates in this country and really what their motives are. And so we talked about NBC talked about and associated press trying to redefine insurrection to go after Republicans and protect these pro trans demonstrations. I want to know as a as a as a local radio host up there, you're really you have such a better pulse than I do on how the local media has been covering the saga. Now has a local media metre using any pronouns whatsoever. David David Dewhurst is his name. He was Montana's solicitor general. He spoke at a Montana Family Foundation banquet once and he made a really great point. I think by the way, I think he's well, I better not say where he's at now because I can't remember which state he's in now. But anyway, incredible guy, very entertaining guy. But he gave a speech at the Montana Family Foundation banquet a few years ago and he said, you know, as lawyers, and I think this could could or at least should apply to journalists as well, he says, we swear an oath to tell the truth. But when we get admitted to the bar, we we take an oath to tell the truth. And you could you could also say this as journalists. I mean, I don't think any journalists are, you know, putting their hand on the Bible or even the Quran for that matter to swear to tell the truth, right? But they should be committed to telling the truth. And he raised this question, well, how does that work when it comes to gender pronouns? I mean, if somebody's a key, but identifies as a she, well, if I'm, you know, sworn oath to tell the truth, what am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to say? So I don't go out of my way, you know, to poke a transgender lawmaker in the eye. I just treat it more, you know, but but I'm also not going to lie and call a he a she, for example, right? So so instead I, why do I need to use pronouns at all? And he talked about doing that in legal documents where you just refer to the lawmaker by name or or whatever, right? And that's kind of a roundabout way of of coming back to the liberal media and how you're not even allowed to be a journalist anymore in most places other than places like the Federalist or talk radio. And but but they've been biased for years. They're constantly in the back pocket of the Montana Democrat Party. What's been kind of funny to watch is because of all the national attention with this Zoe Zephyr story, you can tell all of the these PR firms are descending on the Capitol in Helena. They're invading the Montana politics hashtag on Twitter. And so a lot of tweets are getting a lot more eyeballs than they used to get. And you're seeing a lot more nasty rhetoric from the bots from the left and the liberal media has descended on this story. And it's just like the era of and it's just like the era of COVID-19 when we had a Democrat governor who was issuing statewide mandates and there were lockdowns taking place. We the people of Montana very quickly pushed back against that nonsense and that governor got basically got his butt kicked in the United States Senate race in 2020 as a result of it. But if you were to just read Twitter or if you were to just see what the TV stations are reporting or what the newspapers are reporting, you would think, oh yeah, these mandates and these mask mandates and these lockdowns. Yeah, I mean, it's so right thing to do is it's backed by the public. But if you actually saw reality and got out there and talked to real people or listened to talk radio, you would quickly realize, oh man, no, this is very unpopular. And so in much the same way, if you were to just look at Twitter and look at local media and national media, you would think, oh yeah, the public is aghast at the fact that this, that the rules were being enforced on this lawmaker from Missoula when in reality, people think that it is nuts what the Democrat party is pushing here. And, and, and they think real women should get, should get a microphone and should get the attention and they're sick and tired of this man from Missoula hogging all this attention. Right. And I want to get to that point about pronouns. You know, I mean, I, I, I love compassion. I have the most compassion for people who are struggling with these issues. I will call to their, you know, in person when I've seen them face to face, I will call someone, whatever, when they want to be called. It's like someone whose name is Robert, but they go by Bob, whatever. But in a paper of record, when you are, you know, paid to tell a story truthfully, you're supposed to use the accurate pronouns in line with ones biology. But instead we've kind of created this culture where people are just making stuff up. And so, and to get to represent Zephyr, it's my understanding that, you know, none of the lawmakers were, were rude to this person. No, I think they were very kind. I think they're, especially the Republican women were just, you know, when you'd have, you know, just off air conversations with them, I think they have such a heart for this lawmaker from a Zula where they just, you know, they feel bad for the, for the struggles that that lawmaker has faced and, you know, why they're in this position that they're in. And so there, these are compassionate people who, yeah, they bent over backwards. They, they installed bathroom locks so that the women can still feel safe that are using the women's room. And, you know, they, men on the floor of the house are supposed to wear suits. But they didn't force this biological mail to wear a suit. They gave an exception there. So, you know, they were bending over backwards to be kind. But this, this lawmaker was, was determined to be a martyr, was determined to become a national celebrity and get rewarded by NBC and MSNBC and CNN. Well, one thing I wanted to mention, like, what you were saying, Tristan, which is, Hey, look, however you live your life, you do you. This is America, right? Right. I, I, I interviewed Rob O'Neill. He's the Navy Seal who killed Osama bin Laden. He's from Butte, Montana. And I interviewed him because he basically, you know, he's talking about the Navy, having this drag queen in their recruiting video and how it's a bunch of BS and. And, and he made the point, like he's like, look, whatever you do in your off-duty hours, Hey, that's you. You, you do your thing. I got nothing against you. If you want to go be a drag queen, you go do you. He said, but, you know, but when it comes to the military, the first thing you do when, when you join, they shave your head and they put you in a uniform because it's about the team. And I thought that was such a great point. And, and, you know, because I, I served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I've served, served with people of all, all sorts of backgrounds and, you know, different lifestyles and, and I love every single one of them, incredible people. So, but, but this is about protecting kids. And this is about, and this is also about protecting our freedoms and not being forced into compelled speech and a violation of our constitutional rights. And it's also about basic, basic truth here at some point. Right. And I can, I can say for listeners as Western correspondent, you know, I've, I've traveled the entire region talking to voters and, and, and, you know, people out there and the press, you know, this, this, what I've learned is that there's this kind of small L libertarianism that is so present out in the mountain west. They don't care what other people do. Just as long as you don't, as you beat them alone, like them, do whatever they want to do. And this is kind of like the marijuana thing, you know, even Montana legalized recreational marijuana, right? And I think that's because, you know, a lot of us are kind of like, Hey, I, I, I'm not happy necessarily about the drug culture. I'm not happy about the marijuana stuff that's going on. I think it's fueling the fentanyl and the marrow and the meth increase that we're seeing once again, just like it did in Denver, Colorado. But I think at the end of the day, we're kind of like, Hey, man, you know, we've also got friends that, that do marijuana, that do the gummy thing. And you know what? Hey, again, you do you. But, but with the transgender, the, the angry transgender activists, we're sitting here saying, Hey, yeah, you guys go do your thing. You go do the marijuana gummies. You go smoke marijuana. That's you. Hey, I don't want to smoke it. But, but you got you guys do your thing. These radical transgender activists like you will eat the gummy. You will use the pronouns. You will smoke the joint. It's like guys, what happened to live and let live? Or I guess I shouldn't say guys. Right. And you have this lawmaker who is capitalizing on this, um, this, this caricature that legacy media has painted of any, any dissident to this, it kind of, uh, transgender ideology who is, there is a, you know, it comes to mind when I think about all these state lawmakers, grandstanding on the trans issue is that, that woman in Texas and I'm, I'm blanking on her name, but she made this. Uh, she did this, uh, filibuster in the Texas Senate over abortion, a number of years ago. And I think a number of state lawmakers are starting to realize that they can capitalize on this depiction of, uh, of conservatives, the media is painted to build their own profiles. And so I imagine that's a big part of the agenda here, even though no one's denying, uh, this lawmaker to pursue whatever treatment they want, no one's design, denying an amount of adults to pursue, uh, do treatments. And yet, uh, they're grandstanding as if this is, uh, you know, the, the modern, uh, civil rights movement. And, you know, I was reading the New York Times this morning. Like you said, the lawmakers in the chamber have been extremely courteous, have gone out of their way to be courteous to this, uh, to this representative. Um, it, it now's reading the New York Times that the, the house speaker met, right? I'm not sure if I'm going to say this correctly. We're here right here. Yeah. We're here. Yeah. Um, one of the first things he did was, uh, ensure adequate and safe and private bathroom access, um, right away. And somehow the New York Times made that out to sound like a bad thing. And the, yeah, you know, the New York Times article, uh, we, we, we love the headline here in Montana. I know the New York Times meant it to be a hit piece on the Regeer family because Speaker Matt Regeer is the son. The father state Senator Keith Regeer, Chair of Senate Judiciary, uh, Speaker Matt Regeer's sister, Amy, is the, uh, representative Regeer. She is the, the chair of house judiciary and they're just a rock solid family. And so the New York Times headline was, uh, something to the effect of this family is why Montana is unflinchingly conservative. And Matt was like, man, I love that headline. But, but then you read the article and you can tell up typical New York Times, they're trying to make it a hit piece here. Yeah. And you know what's fascinating about this. So just like the legacy media, the liberal mob media, the Twitter verse is trying to attack Speaker of the house, Matt Regeer as some sort of anti trans or, oh, he was so awful the way he treated Zoe's effort. The closing remarks when they right before they did signy die or seen a however you want to pronounce it, the house minority leader, Kim Abbott, we took to the floor and in her closing remarks, she said, Mr. Speaker, you have been the biggest surprise of this session. I, I have enjoyed working with you. Uh, whenever I needed to talk, you were available. It's like, wow, how come that didn't make the New York Times piece? I guess that didn't fit the narrative for the New York Times. I guess that didn't fit the Zoe's effort narrative either. Absolutely. Uh, so I just want to wrap up with this question. You know, the saga has been going on in Montana for a number of weeks now. It seems to have died down this week after a Zephyr sued, to regain for access, but a judge denied it, spelling out how the constitution explicitly states the house can do stuff like that. So the separation of powers. What do you think this entire three weeks saga has, has exposed about how media and more broadly the left operates? Yeah, I think, uh, mob tactics. And I forget who first started using this medium mob and no Hannity uses it a lot, but mob tactics, bullies drive by media is how the great Rush Limbaugh always referred to it. So, so the media just did their drive by attack on representative Kerry Seekens crow. They did their drive by attack on Speaker, the house Matt Reger. Thankfully, the federalist, uh, you did a great piece, uh, uh, exposing NBC and telling the real story there, uh, another drive by attack. I think it just once again shows that journalism is dead with these legacy media outlets, uh, that not only will they not tell the truth, but, but they're being forced to tell a lie, uh, and, and do cheer lead that lie. But you know, like you say, yeah, they packed up their camera bags and, and moved on to the next state house facing a trans-direction. The other, the other thing that I just wanted to share that I find really interesting about all of this on the, on the radio and, uh, and I think in, in the federalist piece, uh, that I wrote earlier this week, I tried not to use specific body parts, but I think since we're on, this is a podcast. So can I use specific body parts? Is that okay? Would that offend some of your listeners? Do you think, Tristan? I, I, I don't know. I have an ask that question. We might always get, you can edit it out or, or I'll give you a second version of, but basically this is not me saying this. So this whole Zoe Zephyr story comes out. Then we share a, a background piece on Zoe Zephyr. Who is Zoe Zephyr? And it turns out as Zoe Zephyr didn't really even transition until 2019. Went through the surgery last year. So basically, uh, in 2022, uh, Zoe Zephyr, who had the birth name Zachary Rash, who was a high school wrestler, apparently. Uh, anyway, so this, so, so think about it this way. So Zoe Zephyr in 2021 had a penis. Uh, and then in 2022, Zoe Zephyr, uh, has the, uh, vaginal plastic, uh, and, and has this, this female body part created, right? So this ranch woman, a ranch mom in northeastern Montana, she, she read this story that we had on our Montana talks website. And her response was this. She says, she says, wait a minute. This guy just got his vagina last year. I have bottles of ketchup in my refrigerator that are older than his vagina, but now he's the expert on women and what it means to be a woman. I mean, and that's the type of reaction. I was shocked that, you know, ranch women are pretty tough anyway, but, uh, I was shocked that this specific ranch, uh, mom, uh, outright said it the way she said it, but it really puts it in perspective. Well, on that note, Aaron, thank you for joining me. It was a pleasure. All right, Tristan. Hey, great reporting is always enjoyed, uh, reading your coverage in the federal list. Thank you."
