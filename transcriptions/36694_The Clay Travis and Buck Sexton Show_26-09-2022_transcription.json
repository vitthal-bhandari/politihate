    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show podcast. Welcome back in clay Travis bucks, Xt and show appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We have got so much to dive into. Buck, I am fired up. About this absurd under 18 surgeries that are going on. I'm going to dive into that in a little bit. We're allowing 14 15 year old kids all over the country to decide that they are the wrong gender and have irreversible surgery. I'm going to talk about that in a moment because I've been looking into this and I just think it's truly evil. It's New York Times. We have a lot of something everybody needs to know about. And when you get into the language, they're on defense, folks, which is why there's a lot of evasions and smears and how they talk about a medical procedure. Very strange. Yeah. And I think it's important that all of you understand what's going on all over the country and it is, it is significant. So I wanted to share this with you though, because, Buck, it's amazing how stories get buried in the grand scheme of things, even if they are conducted by the Washington Post and ABC. Usually the Washington Post covers everything with the fine tooth comb Trump related, but I found this really fascinating. So in the Washington Post, ABC poll over the weekend, a lot of you probably didn't hear about this because it didn't receive very much coverage because it was so overwhelmingly favorable to Republicans. First of all, generic ballot likely voters, Republicans with a five point lead. That is that is like 1994 2010 level dominance. Again, generic ballot, Republicans, 51 Democrats, 46 among likely voters. And Democrats now are behind Republicans. I thought this was interesting, Buck, because we like to say on this show, history doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes in that things can be very similar. Republicans right now have the largest lead on who is going to solve crime issues over Democrats since 1991. Let me repeat this. Crime is such a disaster nationwide for Democrats that Republicans now have a 31. I think I'm doing the math right because it's getting them, but be a while back in the 90s, 31 year lead over which party is going to better respond to crime. Can I, can I say, Clay, I'm, I'm wondering if you feel this way too, the numbers are stark, clear, obvious that we have suffered because of Democrat policies. We have suffered more as a country from murder, rape, theft. You go down the list. Every major crime car theft, car jacking, home invasion, all the way down to, you know, simple theft, stealing from stores, people engaged in the more lower day to day crimes. But what I think really hammers at home for people is you cannot go on social media right now for more than a day without seeing some broad daylight usually, but just brazen, heinous, vicious crime. And it is not by MAGA hat wearing January 6 insurrectionists. And you see a crime committed and you say, what is the situation here? And you find out when you read the headlines or you read it when it makes its way into the news that this is a person who's been arrested 50 times or 30 times or whatever the case may be. And I think because there's video and because we see it, people have this reaction to this is disgraceful. We are a better country than this. And also we're all sick of walking around wondering, am I going to get hit in the face with a brick by some maniac who's been walking around, you know, urinating on the streets and shouting at people for last week? Cause that happens in places like New York all the time. This is what I shared last week, Buck. I don't remember ever having a conversation with my wife about which gas station to use. But crime has become so omnipresent all over America, cities, rural areas, suburbs that as a, as a father and as a husband, I think about it way more involving my kids and my wife than I ever had before. And, and you're probably a lot like me, Buck. You don't worry as much if you're a grown man about yourself. I think that's the females in my life. Yeah. That's right. My sister, my mom and my fiancee. That's why I worry about. So when you are having those conversations, it registers and it doesn't just register Buck with obviously men who tend to vote Republican far more. I think it's registering with moms out there in the suburbs who are a lot of these swing voters. And I wanted to hit you with this too. Who do you trust to handle this issue the most? Economy, Republicans plus 16 inflation, Republicans plus 19 crime. As I said, biggest trust issue for Republicans since 91, according to the Washington Post plus 14. This ballot, this, this poll among likely voters, Buck didn't see this splashed on the front page of the Washington Post in a big way. Trump has a two point lead over Joe Biden, 48, 46 among likely voters as well. Again, this is the Washington Post, ABC, an a poll that's likely to be inclined to be favoring Republicans and they buried it because the numbers were so devastating as we sit here, 43 some odd days out. I know this isn't, this isn't an important, we're talking about important stuff. This isn't super important, but it has been crossing my mind lately. So if it does turn into Trump, V Biden, which you just mentioned, that poll, if it is this rematch, this straight up rematch of 2020 to CNN, like higher back Brian Stelter moved on lemon into prime time. Do they all decide, Oh, just kidding. We're not a news network. We're actually the anti Trump platform for the DNC. I mean, cause that's how they made all their money. That's how they got all their ratings for years. And now they're moving away from it. Think about the pivot that they would have to make again. I know we got bigger, we got bigger fish to fry, but I do think all of a sudden we might have Stelter be like, that's right. I'm back in a prime time if Trump runs. And but you may, you may want to spend more time on this story even in the third hour. We should tell you, uh, by the way, we are scheduled to join be joined by Tommy Tuberville in the third hour of the program, Senator from Alabama. Um, and, uh, and we've also got a guest in the second hour, who, uh, I believe I'm checking right now to make sure who we got going on in the second hour. Um, but I read this story over the, uh, over the weekend and it's, I believe in the front page of the New York Times today. The headline is more trans teens are choosing, quote, top surgery. You're like, Oh, that's interesting. They are removing breasts. Nation. Why? I just want everybody to understand what's going on here. They are removing teenage girls breasts at 13 sometimes 14, 15 years old. In an effort to try and make them pass as boys. And I just want it is, I think stunning. And I know a lot of you out there are probably not aware of how common place this has become. I live in Nashville where Vanderbilt University Children's Hospital, uh, totally dark time, Vanderbilt University Hospital totally got caught in this. And they have this Dr. Gallagher who is quoted here. She's doing 40 of the surgeries, uh, on a regular basis. Some kids as young as 13 and 14 years old. And I just want to ask every parent out there, every grandparent. We don't allow buck kids to get tattoos legally until they're 18 because we don't want them to form their bodies. We don't think they're old enough. You can't buy a beer until you're 21. You can't rent a freaking rental car until you're 25. We're letting 14 year old girls choose to get their breast removed. This is child abuse. This is mutilation and it should be criminal in nature and every state should prohibit this. If you were to ask, uh, this, this doctor, Gallagher, and I'll point out here's a big tell and this is from this New York Times piece, quote, conservative commentators with large followings on social media have recently targeted children's hospitals that offer gender surgeries leading to online harassment and bomb threats end quote. So just notice that talking about the surgeries that are going on at these hospitals, the response from Democrat corporate media is there are bomb threats. You're, you're calling for bond. No one's calling for threats or bomb threats against anyone. We're talking about protecting children and the law and the fact that they immediately pretend that this is some extremist right wing. They are doing surgeries. If you were to ask this doctor, what are the long term studies showing on, on psychological stability and happiness with this kind of a procedure? What are the long term complications? And in this same piece, they do talk about how there are an increasing number of adolescents, uh, people who are not yet have not yet reached the, uh, you know, the age of 18 who are having bottom surgeries as well, which are incredibly dangerous fraught with all kinds of secondary effects. I mean, Clay, you know, I spent a lot of time researching whether I should have a tendon repair surgery on my ankle and decided not to do it because I got so many people telling me, well, a lot of complications. Well, no, we're talking about removal of your sex organs in order to change who you think you are as a person. And they're going to let 15 year olds do this. The reason Democrats are so shrill and hysterical and saying they're calling for bomb threats and all this stuff is because they cannot defend this. Yes. They cannot defend this. Just think about it. And I want to play this cut here for you 31 in just a sec, but I want everybody out there to think about either when you were 14 or 15 years old, or when your kids or your grandkids were, think about how many crazy thoughts and ideas you had as you entered into adolescence that as you got older, you thought to yourself, boy, I'm really glad I didn't do X or Y. I mean, easy analogy is this is why kids can't get tattoos until they're 18 and a tattoo is way less serious. Obviously, as is drinking beer and you can't be get to it until you're 21. And then we're letting minors change their gender forever and listen to this. This is from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. This is from 2020 that was posted on the Vanderbilt University YouTube channel. This is an unidentified woman talking about gender transitioning minors as young as third team years old. Listen, we can provide gender affirming hormones on an individual who is on a pivotal blocker, depending on whatever kind of blocker they've chosen or we have discussed with them, or they can present to us at a later stage of puberty. And then we provide the gender affirming hormones. Previously, the Endocrine Society recommended to start these at age 16, but we all know that would be delayed puberty, right? Not 16 year olds don't start puberty. So more recently, they did update that to say as early as 14 for compelling reasons. So we have some individuals who have started gender affirming hormones at 13 or 14 to be more like their peers. 13 or 14 bucks. This is crazy. This is child abuse. And you want to like, I think about right wrong, make this illegal, by the way, Tennessee, your home state is moving right now in that direction. I would remind everybody as well, all of what we're talking about right here, it really started with language and demands for acceptance and courtesy. All of what we're talking about here, notice its gender affirmation surgery. It was gender transition surgery until about five minutes ago. But now the whole mentality is it's already who you are. We're just changing the physical reality to match the internal reality. That's why they call it gender affirmation. That's why they were saying years ago, you must use the preferred pronoun because it's not a preference. It's the internal reality that must be reflected in your language. We got to this point because they were able to dictate the language and demand obedience at a cultural level. And now you have 13 year olds who are having their genitals and their breasts removed. That's what's going on. I would just point out, think about this, how often have you heard, and look, this is kind of graphic conversation. I'm not going to lie. But how often have you heard about the clitoris removal in Africa and how unacceptable it is? It's a big topic on female general mutilation. F.G.M. Yeah, I did. I mean, this was something that came up a lot back in the days when I was studying Middle East stuff in college. Yeah, a lot of discussion about it. This is this is that level of mutilation that's going on. And people are just pretending that it's not happening. We happen in Africa. Oh, it's unacceptable. It's occurring in the United States. Oh, well, this is just gender affirming care. No one under the age of 18. And this is, I hope what they're going to pass in the state of Tennessee. And I think every state should pass a law, frankly, on this. No one under the age of 18 should be able to have gender surgeries like these at all period. Switching gears, friends, if you want to up your game and have energy every day, if you want to be the anti-stelter. I'm so tired.

Welcome back to clay and buck. We're going to be talking here in just a moment to Dr. Scott Jensen, who is making it close in the Minnesota gubernatorial race. You know, Clay, I mentioned patent at the top of the show and I know you're watching. You're watching the house of the dragon. You're out. So Carrie had a girls night Saturday. So I got to stay home, put on the comfy sweats, order the fattiest food I wanted. And I watched Dasp boat. Do you know Dasp boat? I don't even know what that is. It's like three hours plus it's from 1982 was made in West Germany. And it's about World War II Germans as in, you know, Nazi Germany on a submarine is a really well made movie for what it is. Actually did very well at the time got a bunch of Oscars. But it's so interesting because as I was watching, I was like, well, here we have a movie that's sort of showing the humanity at some level of the side that is fighting for the Nazis. These guys are part of World War. And I'm like, and I had just gone off on this whole thing about the Dohomey and you know, you know what happens at the end of Dasp boat? All the Germans get wasted by the British planes. And I was like, you know, see, they knew they knew you can show us what it's like on the Nazi submarine. But the Nazis have all got to get wasted at the end. Worst job I can think of and I always spoiler alert a little later. Yes, boiler. Worst job I can think of. And in terms of most challenging, and I respect everybody who's been able to do it, I would lose my mind on a nuclear sub right now. Do you know what the losses were for the for the Germans and World War II submarine service? 75%. The highest of any service in the Nazi German military. Good story about the HMS Hunley, which was the first ever submarine the Confederate Army tried to use in the Charleston Harbor, I believe, correct? You got to read history nerd. Let's go. I know. There's been a lot of people in the marketplace over the last three years, and we've got to make sure that you can get taken care of by emergency food company, my patriot supply.

We're headed up to the great state of Minnesota. Golden gophers four and oh, if you are a Minnesota sports fan, you can celebrate about buck didn't know all about the Golden Gophers. All about it. PJ Fleck has got him at four and oh, I bet that our next guest, Dr. Scott Jensen would know about that because it looks like they may be making a trip to Indianapolis. Only one top 25 team on the schedule the rest of the way. Dr Jensen, are you a golden gopher guy? In my family, we have a total of 10 degrees from the University of Minnesota. We actually have gopher blood in our veins. It's been a good season so far. So that's a positive. Buck and I are fired up. I want to I want to set you up. You've got an MD. We do not. As more and more, the evidence comes out about the deleterious impact of lockdowns of schools, everything else associated with that. How wrong were we on COVID and how much are you hearing from Minnesota voters about the errors of that way? Is it a significant impact in your race? It is a significant impact and it seems like almost each week that passes, there is more to tell us. I mean, we see Joe Biden say the pandemic is over and we see everybody scrambling and we see his own experts and researchers criticizing him. Then he tries to walk it back. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to recognize that what we did for those two and a half years when we locked kids out of school and we locked nursing homes into facilities that had literally become infested with that virus through policies of if you will, Tim Walz and a variety of other democratic governors, those policies caused horrific deaths in the nursing home population. When we locked businesses down to the priestess where in Minnesota, we had two different lockdowns. But the second one, you could get a haircut. Evidently, the science showed us that the virus didn't like air anymore. These are the kinds of short-sighted policy making that really hurt us and the whole idea of one size fits all doesn't work. And then we had for a while, the denying of natural immunity. Then we had the goal, the goal post being moved. And then we saw the epidemic of fear and we tried to see people's thinking processes paralyzed by fear. There were so many things done wrong that we've got a lot to learn. Dr. Jensen, I wouldn't ask you about the issue of crime in your state. We have been talking here on the show since we started in June of 2021 together about what happened in 2020 and the BLM riots and what that did to the country obviously began in Minneapolis. There was a very loud defund the police movement there. You actually had a police station burned to the ground in Minneapolis, which I think a lot of people forget about. Certainly the national media wants people to forget about it right now. What has happened? I mean, since since there were people painting murals of George Floyd and the BLM, marches, protests and riots and the Democrats deciding that defund was their mantra for the entirety of 2020, what has climbed on a Minneapolis and across your state? It is blood everywhere. And it isn't just the urban areas. What we saw literally was Minneapolis became the epicenter of a nationwide violence. And at the end of the day, you could literally say that Tim Wallace is a godfather for all of that violence. He created it by quitting. He quit on Minnesota. He quit on the National Guard. We had TV journalist saying, where's our governor? This is what Tim Wallace has done. It's almost as if he was just, he was tired out. He was just too lazy to get down in the streets and really help him. So when he finally did put the National Guard out late, he tried to blame Jacob Fry for it. When he, when he left the third precinct building burned to the ground, he tried to blame it and say that it was the best advice of law enforcement. And that was entirely his decision. I'm surprised actually that Minnesota hasn't been sued by other states, because other states wouldn't have experienced the kind of decimation and devastation they did. And it not been for Tim Wallace entirely inept handling of the riots. Dr. Jensen, what should he have done? What, let's pretend that we're in a different world. And you're right. We hadn't allowed the summer of violence to spiral out and to still be reaping, unfortunately, what we sown in that time with all of the violent crime that has spiraled since. What should have happened in the wake of the George Floyd incident? In America, as well as Minnesota, we know that we have, if you will, people who would do us harm from both without and within. And to counter that, what we've done is we've created a chain of command. Our military has a very explicit chain of command. But so do our internal, if you will, tools that we utilize to maintain safety and lawful behavior. That's what Governor Walsh should have done. He should have tapped into the command chains that were in place. We have the state patrol. We have the National Guard. We have relationships with other police departments in the suburban areas. All of these could have been a part of a unified response and a rapid response, certainly not being dragged out day after day after day where literally we've got, like I mentioned before, TV journalist saying, where's our governor? It should have been a unified, strong, not either or, but both and. This should have been everything going out there because this was a huge issue. And literally, we have a billion dollars of damage. People died. People were hurt. And in those areas today, we still have people just overwhelmed by fear. They don't want to move. They don't have a place to move to. The governor could have used his bully pulpit to elevate the work that the police were doing. The state patrol could do the National Guard. But instead, our governor chose to denigrate the very people he had led by calling them 19 year old cooks. It was astonishing. Speaking to Dr. Scott Jensen, who was running for the governor's position in Minnesota. Dr. Jensen, we've got a lot of people across Minnesota who are listening right now. And we've seen some polls that show that you are making this a competitive race. It's a shame that Minnesota is thought of increasingly as a blue state, but you may be able to turn some of that around and you're going to need some independence, certainly, and maybe even some Democrats to switch around and decide they're going to give you a shot. If you become the governor of Minnesota, a state where I actually spent a lot of time growing up, it's a beautiful place. How will it be different than if Waltz is able to continue in his role? We'll trailblaze the issues. We'll have the hard conversations. We'll speak for all Minnesotans. And we will tell the truth. We're not going to politicize. That's not who we are. And the fraud that has become identified with Minnesota politics will disappear. I'm not sure if you're aware of it, but over the last 72 hours, we've had breaking news where in almost an unprecedented move, the judicial system of Minnesota came out and Judge Goughman basically called Tim Walz a liar in regards to some of Tim Walz's comments in terms of Judge Goughman's rulings. Judge Goughman said, this is inaccurate what he has said. Tim Walz doubled down and said, well, the judge did this or they would have held us in contempt. The fact of the matter is Judge Goughman had never made any ruling requiring Minnesota to make fraudulent payments to feeding our future. And so I think Tim Walz right now is being called out by numerous factions across the state of Minnesota, including people on the other side of the aisle. The excellence in government that Minnesota used to be associated with is no longer part of it. And I think that's why you'll see real clear politics call our race, a toss up. And in doing that, that was before this largest fraud of a COVID relief policy in the entire country taking place in Minnesota. And that's why we're telling people, you know, we've got a chance. We've got a chance to turn Minnesota red and we need help because Wall is the team. They've got five to one money on us. But if people are willing to help us out and give it, Dr. Scott Jensen dot com, it would help us immensely. And we've already broken all records for fundraising for any Republican governor's race. And we've got over 100,000 people that have joined our email team. We've got 35,000 unique donations. So there's a movement going on in Minnesota. And I hope you keep watching it because the two of you, your voice matters. It really amplifies to the whole country, what's going on in Minnesota. And if in Minnesota, we see Minnesota turn red and have a governor for the, that's Republican for the first time in a long time, that's going to change the landscape and a lot of other states as well. No doubt, Dr. Jensen, we appreciate you coming on the show. We're wishing you well. Let us know how we can help out and good luck to you in making the Minnesota governor's race a true battle ground. Thank you both so much. Together we stand. No doubt. Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it, which is why it's such a shame. Most kids hate learning about our history. It's not really their fault. Most history books are boring and often focus on the wrong things. I got three kids. I know how challenging it is to get them read actually, unlike, or maybe you like a lot of you have to put the Alexa monitor on and get them to read for a certain amount of time when they get home. And you know what's great? I've seen them actually start to pick up these total twin books, particularly my seven year old and read it myself with them and then have them go and get it and read it on their own, which is even better. And that's why I've got to tell you right now about the total twins and their books. If you're interested in teaching your kids truth filled history, you need to get the new total twins history book only book that teaches the most important lessons from American history in an engaging way that kids will love. They'll come away with a solid understanding of what happened, why it happened, most important, how it relates to them today. There's a book deal with big bonuses at tunnel radio.com. That's total radio.com to get your own copy of the total twins America's history book, plus the bonus for a limited time. Go to Tuttle Radio dot com. That's T-U-T-T-L-E Tuttle Radio dot com. So there are these people that say they're Republicans and then they spend absolutely all of their energy, time and focus helping leftist stay in power or win power. Opposing everything that conservatives are supposed to care about. It's fascinating. There's this this whole tranche in American public life. This whole group in our politics of people that are, oh, I'm the real Republican. It's like, well, hold on a second. If all you do is hurt the Republican party and help its enemies politically, how exactly are you the real Republican? This is, you know, this is amazing. This is like Benedict Arnold telling all of the the colonists, the the Patriots, you know, look, helping the British is the best thing I can do for you guys, which Benedict Arnold probably thought he was probably thought he was doing at the time. Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney. Before we even play this audio, we told you that this was going to happen. And we did that. It's not just Trump. It's not going to stop there. She's going to start to pivot. She gets desperate. Trump's not in the stories enough. She's going to come after others. Oh, yeah, no, she's going to just give it time. She'll be on CNN saying that everybody should announce their pronouns and, you know, socialism is good, whatever. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because she's just gone to the other side. She has switched to team Democrat. And, and the thing is, they'll always have an audience when they do this. They'll always have supporters because they love this. It's like Republican apostates, right? It's apostasy. You're supposed to be from within. It amuses the latte liberals of New York and California to watch former Republicans who just go and trash their own side all the time, right? So that's what you're doing. That's, that's essentially their game. Liz Cheney here saying that for one thing, she will leave the party. Do we have, we don't have that. I don't think that's oh, we do. I don't know. Well, here she is. Let's start with this one though. Clay, your friend, your lady, Carrie Lake, who's doing great stuff. Let me just say this again. Best candidate Republicans have put forward for a statewide race, this election. And look, there are a lot of good ones. I'm going to give her credit on this. She is a stud. Like every time I see her speak, I think she is so good. To be fair, Governor DeSantis is an incumbent. So different category, different category. Like in an open seat, open seat, best nominee, I really do think is Carrie Lake and we're going to play their her response. But first, Liz Cheney is not a fan of Carrie. No, apparently not. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that Carrie Lake is not elected. So does that include campaigning for Democrats? If that's what it takes? Yes. She will straight up help Democrats into power. She loves the village so much. She will burn it down to save it, Clay. Don't you see? I mean, just honestly, buck, she's from Wyoming. I would understand if it was like a Wyoming governor's race or something. Why does she care who wins the the governor's ship in the state of Arizona? Does the Cheney family have some deep lasting time? So I think I think that there are, I think that the they're the Cheney dynasty, the Ramnis, the Bushes, they're all still people connected to that world. They're all still holding out hope that the GOP will shift back to a place where, let's be honest, it almost felt like a monarchy on the right because it was hereditary title. We got Bush and then we got Bush and we're supposed to get other bushes, Jeb exclamation point and Romney and you know, we have all these different people who want to go back to the old way of the GOP and are still, they say it's they're clinging to this because of principle. But what you see is they're willing to hurt the country out of spite because if they can't, if they can't be in charge of the GOP, it's better for psycho leftists to be running the country. It's all you have to know, folks, you know, Mitt Romney will not back Mike Lee. Yeah, he will not back Mike Lee. He will back the fake McMuffin over Mike Lee because their buddies in their never Trumpness. Yeah, it is kind of unheard of to do what Mitt Romney is doing right now to Mike Lee in Utah. So we had Liz Cheney saying, Hey, I'm going to fight against Kerry Lake, Buck. Kerry Lake. She's a stud. She said what I think is 100% true, which is this. That might be the biggest, best gift I've ever received. I mean, the people in Wyoming can't stand her. I'm pretty much sure that the people of Arizona don't like Liz Cheney. You know, here's the deal, Maria, the Republican Party, the new Republican Party is the party of we the people. It is no longer the party of warmongers. And so Liz Cheney probably should change her voter registration. Turns out she really is a Democrat after all. I mean, just just to be clear, that is so good. She's phenomenal. And to be clear, the Bush Cheney legacy did destroy the Republican Party for a period of time and send us into the political wilderness for eight years of left wing domination by Barack Obama and that whole apparatus. That is actually the legacy of the Bush Cheney years. They had eight years. What do they deliver? What ended up happening? We have the worst recession since the Great Depression. Multiple wars that we did not win trillions of dollars spent thousands and thousands of lives lost tens of thousands of wounded. And for what? That's the question. The Bush the Bush Cheney legacy leaves out there for everyone. And I think that was a big reason why Trump got the nomination in 2016 because he was one of the few people who would actually come out and say the Iraq war was a mistake. And I understand there's lots of people out there listening with us who served in the Iraq war. I'm not saying that you made a mistake. You served your country. You followed the leadership of your commander in chief. But Dick Cheney, who was driving this this position made an awful choice to expand the 9 11 war on terror into Iraq. And I'm still not sure Buck, whether we're in any way safer with the new Iraqi government than we were frankly with Saddam Hussein there. And we years into the future may not know for sure whether we still are. Yeah, that's directly those were those were well the war specifically in Iraq was pushed by people who and a lot of ways were actually the Fauciites of the Defense Department. Yes, in that they were in love with their own brilliance and expertise. They thought they knew a lot more and they sent brave Americans who just answered the call for their country over there. But in terms of the in terms of the strategy and the mission, the people that pushed this stuff, you know, Wolfowitz and Pearl and Cheney. Wrong as wrong can be. So we're going to talk about the old GOP. Carrie Lake brings us up. Is that the GOP we're supposed to go back to? And I think she's 100% right. She's a fantastic candidate. But she's 100% right. The best thing that could happen to her is Liz Cheney saying she's against her."
