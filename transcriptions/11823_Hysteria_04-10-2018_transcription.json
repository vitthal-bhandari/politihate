    "text": " Welcome to Tisteria, I'm Erin Ryan with me this week. Karen Deal. Hi, Anne Grace Para. What? A fuck. On this very special episode, Hawaii Senator Maisie Hirono joins me to talk Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans, and other bullshit. Her work, not mine. We've also got Grace Para and Karen Deal in studio to highlight some female candidates we're excited about, and later, actor and writer Jen Richards stopped by to talk about civil down feminism. And of course, we wouldn't leave you without telling you what Hills will die on this week. I'm so excited. A couple housekeeping things. We have Hawaii Senator Maisie Hirono this week. Her year to us weekly. Very special edition. She's great. We got her to say bullshit twice. And we also have Jen Richards, actor, writer. She's wonderful. We have her on for the second half of the show. Housekeeping stuff. So we've been getting a deluge of emails from listeners in response to stuff we've covered a lot of stuff in response to Grace's birth control story. We're still getting emails about that week. I thank you guys for all the feedback on that. It's been it's been it's been wonderful. Turns out getting birth getting birth controls of pain in the air. Yeah, everywhere. Yep. We've also gotten a lot of stuff about Kavanaugh sexual assault and other issues like voting, registering women who are running for office. These are all things that are important to us and that we like to read about and that we promise that we're taking a look at but that we run out of time to respond to and we promise we'll have a reader mailbags episode soon. If you want to get in touch with us, the email address is hysteria at crooked.com. That's hysteria at crooked.com. Another housekeeping thing you should listen to PODS save America. Tuesday's episode of PODS save America is really good. On Friday two women followed Jeff Flake into an elevator two hours later the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was delayed by one week and that was partially thanks to one of the women interviewed on this Tuesday's PODS save America on a Maria Archila. She's great. The interview is really really a good listen. If you want to feel uplifted she's got a lot of tenacity. She's got a lot of grit. She's really really cool person. So listen to Tuesday's PODS save America. I mean always listen to PODS save America but Tuesday is particularly good. Also like being uplifted is worth its weight in gold right now because there's a lot to just trying to drag us down these days. Yeah yeah but I think that there are a lot of people who are equally determined to bring it back up. Yes I agree I agree. And like view the long game. So we're gonna go to the news real quick. A lot's happened last week in the Kavanaugh stuff. On Wednesdays of September 26th, Kavanaugh released his 1982 summer calendars to dispute Christine Blasey Ford's allegations. The same day we learned that there was a third woman who is accusing him of sexual misconduct in addition to Dr. Ford and Deborah Ramirez. The people listed on the day of the calendar that he provided. Match the people that Dr. Ford said. We're at TVPJ and Squee. Squee is my favorite. I can squeeze. I can squeeze man. Yeah I mean that's interesting. We only need to squeeze in our lives. It's also interesting to me and I kind of I made this joke I believe on Twitter. Who keeps you know if you kept calendars like that involved in the 80s like you are either and you're you're nerd right? Like how was Brett Kavanaugh this like hard partying jock guy but also kept calendars. The only guy who kept calendars and was a hard partying jock in the 80s was like Patrick Bateman. He was also but you have to remember that Kavanaugh is very rich. Oh yeah like he's hella rich. He got into Yale with no connection. Not just his grandfather but there was a what like John Oliver show was like there's a golf course at his high school like there's a George champrab. Yeah yeah George champrab is probably one of the most prestigious. This is one thing that hasn't been discussed a ton in the news is that it's one of the most prestigious prep schools in the nation. One of the wealthiest demographics in in the country. So academics are going to be highly valued at that school and also well I'm a jock man. It's a I think the I think I think both of those things could exist at the same time but but the the excessive amount of like privilege of that particular schooling environment is oh yeah pressing yeah it's intense. Okay so now we're moving on to Thursday 10 years after your last Wednesday Thursday the 27th. There was a really long hearing that a lot of people watched. I think it was I read something like one in five Americans watched it or something like that. There was also a real-time hysteria text chain where Megan Galey was drinking mimosas early in the morning. She did invite us over to her house at seven in the morning. Yeah she invited us the day before to come over at seven and drink mimosas. There will be mimosas was a big hard sell. Yeah and then there was a real-time account. Yeah all of us just like can you believe this? How are you doing emotionally? How are you feeling right now? Yeah I like that we checked in with each other. We did check in with each other Alyssa Master Monaco and I were texting back and forth all day. It was yeah it was a rough day for a lot of women I think it was a rough day for a lot of survivors men and women and I like a great day for bars though. Well it wasn't a good day for beer that's for sure. Beer beer stock just dropped. Yeah that's true. Beer makes people a drunken creep like ambient made rosana racist. Yeah it's the beers fall. Yeah plenty of people are capable of drinking beer without acting like a creep. Thursday was beer's recession. Yeah it was not great. On Friday September 28th the Judiciary Committee voted to send Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Senate floor but thanks to two selfless bad-ass women who we mentioned earlier in the show that's a Maria Gallagher and Anna Maria Archila Senator Flake called for an FBI investigation to last know more than one week to explore the allegations against Kavanaugh and as of this recording the FBI investigation is currently underway and it's supposed to conclude momentarily. Apparently they've done all the investigating that they need to do. Just a note that Senator Flake is not a hero I mean he might have had a he might have actually had some moral compass bestowed upon him as a gift from these fantastic women that we mentioned but this is you know he the fact that it took the intervention of Maria Gallagher and Anna Maria is very upsetting. And like weeks of behind the scenes meetings and like that's another thing I'm not going to bestow the title of hero on a person who is displaying basic levels of human decency. Yep yep and it's so often that we're expected to do that. Joe Scarborough tweeted about how like one man can it's like Joe honestly fuck off. Yeah I agree. Stop the reason that things are so bad is because we're so willing to like you know get on our knees and worship people who act in a minor decent way and that's just it that's why everything's so broken I think. Or I think it might have to do with the fact that it was the reason that there was such a it felt like there was such a huge discrepancy between those 11 white male senators and the populace or what women are feeling is because there's no women which brings us to the midterms and and an opportunity to vote. Yes. Which is a place to really galvanize who gets to sit in that hearing. Who gets to be the person asking the questions. Who's a whose voice represents you specifically and the importance of that. Well I can't say this current Republican party ever breaking stride with tradition or history and appointing a single woman to the judiciary even if like women are running. There's never been a female Republican on the judiciary committee in the Senate ever. So I can't see them breaking tradition but we're going to highlight some women in a little bit who are running for office who on the Democratic side can add that energy and and maybe look make it look even more cartoonish than it did last week when it was just 11 white guys and Democrats. So and the prosecutor and the press right. Oh that's right. They're Aunt Lydia. Yeah. Oh my god I haven't heard that well. Yeah well it's I've said it multiple times. She's it was awful and then they just sort of here's a thing then they just sort of dismissed her rudely when they were done using her as a mouthpiece to talk to a woman and it's just like yeah that's what happens you align yourself with those guys they're going to use you for their purposes and then continue to disrespect you. Yeah you're never going to be one of them. Yeah I liked the her the SNL take on it when it was 80 brilliant. Yeah and then she was just like oh okay I'm already regretting this. She's so great. Yeah yeah she was great. I want to talk about one more thing last night President Trump had a rally in Mississippi. Did you did you yeah you you texted us about I texted yeah there's a lot of text and that goes on behind the scenes clearly. Yeah I texted the second that I saw Trump mocking the female reporter I think it was actually two female reporters. Yeah NBC News then one from MSNBC. Yeah he had a big mocking couple days. It was the female reporter but I was talking about at the rally in Mississippi when he was mocking Dr. Ford. That's right yeah that's that was oh my god there's so much mocking that goes on I am forgetting like I don't know I don't know. Yeah yeah yeah. Here's the thing I think that I think that people who love President Trump enough to attend a rally for him are the sort of people that like to imagine people like us getting angry at things like that and so I am trying to keep my rage in check because he's performing you know he's he's a bad he's a bad stand-up comic who's who's driving the world into or off a cliff and I just I don't know I think it's it's obviously disgusting but I if somebody told me that he I did not need to see the clip before I was like oh yeah that sounds totally right yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Check out. Check out. Check out on brand. He also expressed concern for men this past week I don't know if you guys read him or heard him say that it's a very scary time for young men in America but that that also struck me as a real crown jewel this past week. Yeah it's crazy to me that they can conceive of things happening to men as though those men were people but not happening to women like it's as though they believe us to be two separate species one with a higher purpose and higher capacity for emotional feelings and and leadership and and value and then the other part being this kind of unnecessary annoying sex puppet class. No. Which is. I think that's all a thing. It is it is a whole thing. I mean what's frustrating about about that comment to me is that by saying that that it's a scary time for young men first of all like let's be real he's saying it's a scary time for young white men in America because it's been a scary time for young. Yeah what about the fucking Central Park five. Yeah exactly exactly calling for them to be executed when they were not guilty. Exactly. But the second thing is that he is tapping into something that I think is actually valid which is the fact that masculinity is evolving it is changing right now. So young men I don't think should be afraid of that. When you frame it is something that men should be afraid of and yeah they're gonna feel fearful but it's that when by nature of this feminist movement by nature of the Me Too movement when they're gaining power you know the flip side of that is that masculinity is being called into question a little bit but I don't think that's necessarily bad. I only think it's being brought up in such a way by a Trump and bias cohort that it's a scary thing for men but it shouldn't be viewed as a scary thing for men it should be seen as an evolution. I think that he is saying it's scary time for men because he's afraid that women just go around willy-nilly accusing men of rape. Exactly. Exactly. Which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Did you guys talk to your families about this about the hearing and definitely yeah I talked to my parents about it they were they were very invested in watching it. I know I just I after I did I was on positive America last Thursday and after I did that episode I just like wanted to crawl into a hole and I couldn't think about it anymore but I did I did talk to a family about it it just wasn't my family. Did you talk to yours here? Yeah I did. So my dad was very like because he's in England right now and I asked if you watch the hearings and he was like he was like yeah he's that guy's going through a really rough time and I was really like and I was really like what well why do you think that well he was so upset and I was like yeah yeah but but how about and I like you know kind of like went in on and not I didn't go in on him but it was really interesting to hear how much I was surprised honestly like how his kind of empathy like just just like kind of default went to Kavanaugh. Do you know what I mean? Because he's like oh people get accused in America of stuff all the time it happens constantly and then I had to kind of be like and this sucks that I had to qualify but I was like but she's a professor she's very wealthy she has a PhD I mean this is a you know this isn't you know not that it should even matter if somebody is a stripper or what they do but I was like this is somebody who's lived a private life who and then when like I associated it with education and like all of that stuff that started to kind of you know he was like yeah I get that but it is is really it made me wonder you know I think that there's like kind of public and private opinion that people hold do you know what I mean and I you know it's my dad so but I thought that that was really I was surprised by that and it made me curious do you know what I mean like what people's yes there's the stuff that people say on Twitter and whatever but like what do you say when you're in your group of friends. Yeah I mean I think that's that's kind of an important question like Donald Trump does the thing he says the thing that people used to feel like they were only comfortable saying around other scared spiteful people right who blame everything wrong with the world on the fact that women are gaining power that the idea of gender is changing that it's no longer okay to hold down a girl at a party and try to rape her even if she's been drinking too I think that there are people who were talking about those things in private and now Donald Trump has kind of started saying the quiet part loud currently. This week in a special edition of uterus weekly I'm delighted to welcome Hawaii senator Maisie Harono. Born in Fukushima Japan Harono was nearly eight years old when her mother brought her and her siblings to Hawaii to escape an abusive husband and seek a better life. Harono served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1981 to 1994. She was elected Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor in 1994. Voters in Hawaii's second congressional district elected Harono to serve in the US House of Representatives in 2006. Senator Harono was elected to the Senate in 2012 and sworn in as Hawaii's first female senator and the country's first Asian-American woman senator. She serves on several committees in the Senate including armed services and the committee on energy and natural resources but she's been most visible recently as a member of the committee on the judiciary. So Senator Harono what's the congressional cafeteria like right now? I imagine kind of tense. Wait congressional cafeteria? Yeah like where do you eat when you eat lunch? Is everything very cheap? I usually eat sitting at my desk. Who goes out? No I just sit at my desk read the paper you know that sort of thing and and I tell you it would be nice if I had at least oh I don't know 20 minutes to eat but often that doesn't happen. I'm not complaining you know it is what it is so I'm actually really glad to be here at this time of great non-normalcy. Yeah yeah well what you're doing is really important this week is really important McConnell announced that there will be a vote this week on yeah Kavanaugh's confirmation. What's your strategy leading up to the final vote? We've been talking about how this is not normal times that's what I've been saying because so certainly it's not normal to rush this person through in this way it's not normal not to have all of the documents that we should have access to. It's not normal not to have an FBI investigation for new information that came forward and it's not normal for appropriate witnesses to not come before the committee so these are not normal times and what I would characterize as the all-fired rush by the Republicans to get this person on the Supreme Court. They did want to do it before the October term started and they're trying to get as close to that as possible because he is going to be the reliable fifth vote on a lot of issues that will impact all of our lives for decades. So last night on that note last night at a rally in Mississippi President Trump openly mocked and imitated Dr. Ford's testimony how do you respond to this as a woman and and how do Republicans justify this behavior? How do Republicans justify this behavior? I think that the Republicans in my view have lost their souls and I was very very disheartened to say the least but not surprised for President Trump to go down to the lowest common denominator which for him is always attacking people making fun of people all of that. It's really sad more than sad the tragic sad we've come to the point where this kind of behavior is deemed normal from a president of the United States so we can't get used to this kind of bullshit. So I was very disheartened and one thing you said is he mocked her the fact that she couldn't remember some peripheral things about the attack and when I was able to I was on Anderson Cooper last night and I said the thing that she was 100% sure of is Brett Kavanaugh attacked her. But you know what was disheartening was really to listen to all the cheers so he knows how to play to his base you know so how to roll up his base and what I am doing is to listen to all these thousands and thousands of women who have come forward and I want them to retain their anger but to be very determined because we can't just be angry we have to be determined to do something about it and I just heard from one of my colleagues that we're all getting phone calls and we're being all kinds of communications from women particularly who have experienced these kinds of assaults and kept it to themselves but he told me that he talked to two women who had contacted him one was 80 years old and this happened to her when she was much much much younger. So this is what's going on this is a moment for our country we obviously in the Senate have not figured out how we should deal with or address the issue of sexual assault in our country and what to do so you know the rest of the country is paying attention much of the rest of the country thank you for your help. Yeah yeah I mean that is definitely something that we see over here too but on the other hand you know on one hand we have people that care very deeply about this and that are feeling empowered to speak up that like the 80 year old woman who called your colleague and your colleague who was moved enough about it to tell you but at the same time there's a huge swath of the population that just doesn't care that easily just dismisses allegations of sexual assault assault and harassment. Do you think that this is politically motivated? Do you think men who brush off allegations or justify it by calling locker room talk or boys will be boys are inadvertently taddling on their potential past behavior by being dismissive about sexual assault and I wanted to know what your thoughts were about that. I think it comes from fear that as exemplified by what both Trump and his son said that the men and boys in our country should be very very afraid really afraid of what that women are going to falsely accuse them. That's their attitude this is why people who have experienced these kinds of terrible assaults mainly women do not come forward but I hope that this is a moment where we're just going to stop this kind of thinking and and do our best you know I just feel as though all the women who are coming forward some of them never having talked about assault going back decades that they're going to remember how it felt then and how it feels now to be marginalized to be to be shunted aside to be told basically we really don't want to hear from you and even if you come forward we don't believe you. I hope they retain that anger but it has to be channeled and determined and I tell you the women are really making are going to make a difference in my view in 2018 that is my hope. Yeah keep me going. Yeah same on this side. One thing that I was thinking about yesterday as I was walking around listening to old Maisie Hirano interviews on my headphones was that you've done a lot of work on military sexual assault and one of the one of the things that you emphasized in a bill that you sponsored I believe last November which feels like a million years ago to be honest but last November was the practice of retaliation against survivors who come forward and report. I was thinking yesterday as I listened to you talk about that how it feels now as though the Senate is practicing a form of kind of sick retaliation on American women who report like Dr. Ford came forward and the retaliation seems to be doubling down on Kavanaugh is does it feel like that from inside the chambers? What it feels like is the Republicans not being able to face the report to be able to deal with it they're just hiding behind whatever it is you know these these this kind of thinking that led to the scourge of sexual assault in the military when they were supposed to be zero tolerance in the military for sexual assault and harassment and went on for decades and decades and I believe that not I believe I know that it was the women sitting on that Armed Services Committee finally seven of us in a very martial committee Kirsten Gillibrand and the rest of us very much focused on we're not going to just sweep this aside and this is why there is a change when women are sitting at the decision-making table we can focus on those kinds of issues that do not give the kind of attention that they deserve so in that context we know that there's retaliation that's still going on in the military we know that the culture has to change and that doesn't happen overnight and obviously in our country we do not have a kind of cultural shift that says this has this kind of harassment this kind of sexual conduct and attacks have to stop but it doesn't happen overnight we have to teach our girls and boys how to treat each other like human beings but obviously you know from the admitted predator-in-chief practically half the country is getting a whole different kind of message yeah and that's another thing I wanted to talk to you about October is domestic violence awareness month and you and your mother fled Japan you're fleeing an abusive father how does your experience your personal experience with abuse inform the way that you approach issues of abuse in your professional life I know that if my mother had been married to a normal person who a person in that culture supposed to take care of the family and all that none of which my father did because he was a alcoholic as well as a compulsive gambler so he had two illnesses we're not for my mother facing up to it because I know that people who are in abusive relationships very very difficult to get out of those relationships because usually they come and say they're sorry blah blah blah I'm so grateful that my mother recognized what she needed to do to save herself and her children so she changed my life now what it's not I wouldn't say that it was so much that it was more the fact that my mother took control of what was going on in her life that that's what informs a lot of what I do and of course being an immigrant not speaking the language being poor I really speak for people who do not have much of a voice and and really I don't I would not be doing this if it were not for that kind of a background of being an immigrant being very much an outsider having a very strong mother who did something very amazing for that time and it's not as though she sat me down and said oh my daughter she was lifeless than for you I just watched her being very determined to support our family how does it make you feel to know that young women are watching you as somebody who they're looking up to in the same way it's not anything that I ever thought about for myself because most of the time I work very quietly but in a very effective way to move legislation that's really the approach that I've taken but the times call for a lot of us to be much more vocal and I've always been a fighter and I just been very quiet about it I'm good at what I do I'm an advocate this is why being in Congress as when I served for 14 years in the state legislature is so much you know it's kind of my cup of tea but at the same time yes this whole kind of role I suppose that I did not seek but I do realize that if my speaking out is encouragement for others to speak off standard ground I'm glad for it going back to what you were talking about you kind of brush up against this when you're talking about the Armed Services Committee you mentioned a couple weeks ago that that mentioned just shut up and step up which is great you know everyone it was in the context of the four women who sit on the judiciary committee I think the question was something like well do the four of you basically do you have some kind of special responsibility to deal with this issue and I said it's not just us it's the men it's all of us in fact the men who are basically perpetuating this kind of behavior and that's when I said oh you men out there just shut up and step up and do the right thing so that is being hurled back at me in all different contexts including I have to say Lindsey Graham was on what George Stephanopoulos just before I was on and he said maybe he wrote told me to shut up but I'm not shutting up well how brave what a brave brave man that Lindsey Graham who's had a massive plaque now I'm being characterized as a man hater oh please you know so what would happen if in your in your vision what would happen if more men would take a step back and listen to women and in context of from the Senate all the way down to women who work in industries like the service industry well I can tell you the world would be a much better place much better place that's being just you know sort of I'm not being facetious by saying that but women have had to put up with this kind of bullshit for for way way way too long and I'm hoping that this is a time for some kind of a cultural shift in a and tipping point for for women in this country and we don't have to be loud and obnoxious about it but we need to be very determined and we need to stay the course because these cultural changes are do not do not happen unless we are persistent and especially one like this you know the fault lines in our country we obviously haven't dealt very well with race in our country we obviously haven't dealt very well with gender equality issues in our country so you know I'm really glad that we now have we support same sex marriage that was amazing I didn't think that would happen in my lifetime but we need to stay the course in terms of the kind of change we want and how women are treated in this country. Senator since you're the only immigrant in the Senate and therefore the only one who cannot run for president in a sea of people who might be trying to think about running for president does that leave you free too and I'm and I'm using the phrasing of one of my colleagues does that leave you free to let your freak flag fly? Well there are a lot of people who don't know that I can't run for president but well you know there are a lot of things that caused me to speak out much more and it's because I am on a daily basis outraged by what this administration is doing to children of the border with to the DACA people that we haven't even dealt with 800,000 of them and so my head explodes on a regular basis and so I'm very motivated to to speak out and I think the feedback I get from people who appreciate the fact that I am speaking out and I speak very plainly by the way sometimes not even in complete sentences I think it reaches people in a way that that they can tell that I'm not programmed to do this I I really come from a standpoint of knowing what it feels like to be marginalized to be part of the me too because I've certainly had people you know men do unwanted kind of things that that we've had to that I've had to put up with and I know most women have had to and so I I have life experiences that have brought me to this point and I'm glad that I'm able to speak out because it makes a difference to a lot of people but I always tell everyone look each one of us has a responsibility now because these are not normal times maybe in normal times you call up your senator you call up your representative and you think your job is done these are not normal times we have to all be organized we have to reach out to advocacy groups that we may not have worked with I say to all the people who come to see me we please get out of your advocacy silos because we are all getting screwed I've been saying this long before I started to be so vocal that people in our country are getting screwed every second minute of an hour of the day and if by our efforts in my office we can decrease that number will be making a difference we will be doing our job and it's something that I've said for years now in terms of what we're here to do well one more thing you mentioned your head exploding a lot which is unfortunate on a regular basis the senator with the exploding head may be her own how do you put your head back together after it explodes like how do you how do you regroup how do you calm yourself down and apart from just caring deeply about the issue how do you de-stress I usually have at least one trumplastay a week oh really trumplastay usually it's Sundays and I do other things I don't turn on the news and I do other things that mainly more creative things I do pottery which I don't do here so I found another outlet which is I make my own paper and I make cards and I do those things and I'm very I would say that I my outlet is to to do art that's so cool so I used to go to the museums a lot and but I say to everybody we all need a break and I am we all should take a trumplastay at least one day every week sometimes I have to take an entire trumplast weekend who keep my souls together that sounds so luxurious I'm gonna try that one of these days you should it's very helpful well Senator Hirano I know you have a lot of important work to do maybe the most important work thank you so much for speaking with me and have a great day bye and we're back with some female candidates we're excited about we are taking some time on hysteria between now and the election to spotlight women candidates that we're really excited about and also tell you all to visit crooked medias vote save America which has recently launched if you go to vote save america calm you can register to vote you can be competitive races and you'll be able to see sample ballots pretty soon there's a lot of stuff there so please if you haven't visited yet do so so this week we have three candidates we're going to showcase and Kieran why don't we start with yours her name is Carolyn Long she is the Democratic challenger in Washington's third district the website is electlong.com www.electlong.com kind of love that name guys I kind of love it too elect long that's pretty memorable Carolyn Long is a first-time candidate and she's challenging another woman Republican incumbent Jamie Herrera Butler while the race leads Republican in the open primary more Democrats voted than Republicans which makes this race much more competitive than was originally believed and Carolyn is a fighter who works for working families and grew up in a rural coastal community where her mother worked as a waitress and her father worked odd jobs and started a small produce business and she started working at the store when she was 12 years old to help her family make ends meet so she worked her way through college with a union job go union go union shout out to unions and lousy I love a good union a good union at a grocery store and then she went on to earn her PhD in political science she's an accomplished professor who has written two books on constitutional law has worked at Washington State University Vancouver for more than two decades as a tenured professor and in administrative leadership positions and kind of felt the call to public duty and the civic duty and she's running for office for the first time to stand up for Washington State working families and to defend American values as they come under attack like never before she's great also Jamie Herrera Butler used to work I believe for another congresswoman from Washington State and her her opponent longs opponent and she's a kind of an enemy of choice as most Republicans are now they're very few pro-choice Republicans but Carolyn long is is a Democratic challenger to somebody who is very openly anti-choice so she's somebody that definitely deserves their support mm-hmm grace let's talk about your candidate well let's talk about another first-time candidate over here first-time candidate Sharice David's who is the Democratic challenger what up democratic challenger in Kansas's third district and you can find it more about her at Sharice for congress calm so she is challenging Republican Kevin Yoder and if she is elected she is a triple threat here if elected she's gonna be the first Native American woman in Congress the first openly gay person from Kansas's congressional delegation and the first woman to represent her district that's yeah she wins she's gonna like run around the district in circles just being like oh I mean I'm throwing her parade for sure comes Queen of the district she does the district so the race right now is a toss up it's leaning slightly in favor of her opponent however Yoder is the most vulnerable house incumbent in Kansas my Kansas women come on Kansas so Sharice was raised by a single mother who is also a US Army veteran in Leavenworth and as a member of the Ho chunk nation Sharice could make history again as the first American woman elected in Congress so a little bit about her background she graduated from law school and then worked for law firm in Kansas city specifically on issues including economic development for Native American tribes she then went on to live and work on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation and she served as a White House fellow during the final year of the Obama administration this is one of my favorite things about her most recently she hosted a podcast that she called Starty Pants oh I love that I love it so much and it's called Starty Pants because she interviewed entrepreneurs and investors also guys this woman just keeps getting cooler she's also competed in MMA tournaments yeah mixed martial arts tournaments fighting both professionally and as an amateur both categories oh my god she's awesome she's so cool also I won quick note the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota is one of the most economically depressed places in the country and it's really really something that needs smart people like her working on helping advance so it's really cool that she did that also like she's an MMA fighter so she could literally kick all of our totally literally and figuratively I mean she's go go Shari's my candidate is Angie Craig she is a Democratic challenger in Minnesota's second district Minnesota Minnesota that's near my home stomping grounds I'm from the Minnesgonson region right between Minnesota and Wisconsin Angie's website is Angie Craig calm in 2016 Angie ran against the current Republican incumbent Jason Lewis but lost by just two points less than 10,000 votes oh my god everybody needs to vote please go vote if elected Angie would become Minnesota's first LGBTQ Congress member the race is rated as a toss-up but projection show her as a likely winner her opponent Jason Lewis is terrible he used to be a loudmouth talk radio host and my dad used to listen to him to get himself angry because he's so wrong and bad he sucks I like your dad that's cool my dad's my dad's awesome do Angie Craig is awesome Angie Craig is running for Congress because the opportunity she was lucky enough to have her disappearing for too many working families she grew up in a mobile home park when if three kids raised by a single mom who worked will go into school to earn her college degree Angie worked two jobs to keep up with the cost of her education graduated from a state college she began her careers in newspaper reporter and then worked her way up in business over 15 years to eventually lead a workforce of 16,000 employees for a major Minnesota manufacturer as a former fortune 500 company executive Angie's helped create jobs empowered women and veterans to advance their careers and created workplace policies to promote diversity and inclusion and she's also been a powerful advocate for marriage equality in the state she and her wife are proud to have raised their four sons in Minnesota and embrace the state's values of family community and caring for each other that's great Minnesota is great go Angie Craig beat Jason Lewis and voters in Minnesota in Kansas and in Washington please pay attention to these great candidates they've all three been endorsed by our pal and yours former president Barack Obama love that that's so exciting yeah that's huge so we have to take a break and when we come back we'll have our guest John Richards and her snow political and we're back hysteria is delighted to welcome this week Jen Richards a writer and actress Jen will join HBO's new comedy Mrs. Fletcher as a series regular Margot a transgender woman who teaches a creative writing course that Catherine Hans character enrolls in Jen welcome thank you so much for coming thanks for having me so I wanted to kind of segue quickly into a segment we call personal political personal political is you know kind of about how news stories affect our lives and a story that kind of struck me this week was California now has a law in the books that will require corporations to have women on their boards if they have a presence in the state one thing that that kind of reminded me of is how feminism is sort of in some ways it seems a little trickle-downy to me like women at the top are given a ton of energy and a ton of resources and a ton of coverage but how does that affect women who are more marginalized and Jen I wonder what you think about that I don't think like everything it's complicated I actually do think that's a great law I think it's a good start there's a lot of evidence that I mean I would not necessarily call it trickle-down but there is evidence that it's harder for marginalized people lower in the organization to succeed if there aren't people like them at the top of the organization there's good evidence about that I used to work in nonprofit management for years and did a lot of consulting there and one of the issues with diversity is that people would often try to put like a single person like we'll have one black person on the border one black person on staff and what they found is that in order for any particular marginalized identity to feel comfortable and confident they need to have at least two other people of that same identity within the organization and ideally at different levels and there's just two people weird dynamics happen if you're alone you just people tend to check out there's a kind of critical mass it reaches and ideally you really do have to have it at all at all levels from the board down to entry level so I think it's it's a kind of like necessary but not sufficient to use a logical phrase like I think it's actually really helpful to to mandate that you'll probably get cases of tokenization but I get tokenized all the time and as long as I'm getting paid and I get responsibility for like I'm okay with that you know I like the way you use the term critical mass you need like at least three I was like oh that's like when me and my cousins walked down the street in Boston and people get frightened critical mass there's three of us oh no they're taking over what do you mean your cousins look like that they're so frightening just scary with our meat and my good face is kind of goth thing yeah oh this is a this is an audio medium so people can't see this at home but Jen is drinking out of a cup that looks like it's made of skeleton skeleton standing on skulls and you know the skeletons weren't enough and we're talking like 12 I think around the mug or those skeletons are comfortable like regardless because there's 12 of them so none of the skeletons feel like there's a little mass of skeletons for sure John I wanted to talk to you a little bit about your work as a visible trans actress you were the first ever openly trans character on a CMT show which is kind of incredible did that did that strike you when you were on Nashville we did you realize that you were breaking ground that you were doing something that nobody had done before there's this bad habit of trans people to always say they're the first to do something I'm the first person to open it after pepper in room 310 today everyone wants to claim the first I think it is significant to have an openly trans performer on country music television just because of shows like Nashville's reach and areas that might not otherwise get exposed to these issues I'm from the south like my families in North Carolina and Mississippi so I was going home to North Carolina right during the height of HB 2 which said like I'm supposed to use the men's room and it shows like Nashville that got to people who could be kind of their fears could be exploited because of ignorance because they had this blind spot you know kind of right-wing conservatives who were trying to stoke an issue that didn't exist could raise the specter of you know a burly man who throws on a dress and like sneaks into the women's room and it's legally protected and when people in those areas didn't know any trans people at all in real life it's kind of easy to buy into that just because out of you know desire to protect your children but then they see someone like my character on Nashville and I don't think they even mentioned that the characters trans to like the second or third I think the third appearance so there's a chance for the audience just to see them as a character who's you know helping the lead of the show you know recover from an accent you get to know the person a little bit and then it comes out and then it's not so scary it's like oh that's just a person it's just a person like what was a big deal right and I guess that kind of to me feels like it has parallels in when where people are looking for a blank person to work in any position like a female CEO or a a black member of the board it's sort of like I mean on one hand I worry that like pushing one person to the top and then being like okay we did it we're done we have one we're good I worried that that's not you know that's not sufficient but on the other hand you know having one person can be kind of the beginning of maybe normalizing what that looks like and what that feels like if the person is good I mean that that's in a whole issue too that's a problem with tokenization is that if someone throws someone in just because of their identity and not because of the qualities they actually bring to whatever you know they're there for then you get this kind of self-affilling prophecy of like well we didn't think this kind of person was good enough and then we threw them in there and look they weren't good enough so and then that cycle continues so you really do have to look for the best people but I think there's a kind of consciousness raising that comes when you decide to like we're going to put more women and then look for really good women who will help our company and the other thing is it seems like it's you need opportunity to get good is the other thing it's not just like but it's not just cart horse it's horse cart and so that's where Aaron we were talking about it earlier like that UN resolution 1325 it was like in conflict resolution they found that like the UN started saying okay if you get four people in a in a situation to resolve a conflict you get one more person if you add a woman so you can have four people or you can have five people and make sure that one of them is a woman because in a lot of areas like no women were ever included and by getting a chance to be a part of that process of being just getting involved getting a seat at the table getting to be a part of the conversation that then gave some agency to people when they come back to run for leadership roles to gain confidence to gain experience to know what it's like because certain things you can't get good until you've had the experience to do those things you get a chance to fail like that's something that men that's a that's a big privilege that men have that is denied most other identities is is the chance to fail I see it in Hollywood all the time like some young bold you know young white director will get a chance to you know do a big feature film and then it'll completely fail like oh he took big risks he swing for the fences let's give him another shot and then a woman assault somebody and get a franchise yeah exactly and then a woman does it's like oh see women can't women can't do comedy right or whatever whatever the case yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a really interesting point it feels like it feels like sometimes yeah men do have a chance to fail and men I was thinking about this last week not to bring everything back to Kavanaugh but it's sort of so yeah so in the air right now I was thinking about the hearing last week and and Dr. Ford was so composed and for the most issues obviously scared but she was very polite and you know deferential to the people asking the question she was in their workspace and she was and then you know Brett Kavanaugh comes up there like a big whiny fucking baby and I just like was thinking afterwards pundits were treating it as though they were in any way comparable performance now right like and it reminded me of the debates last fall between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump where he would just kind of march around the stage looming and saying nonsense and then afterwards people were like well I don't know it's a toss-up like it's it was so frustrating did you watch the the Kavanaugh hearings and have a reaction I tried not to but I couldn't help it it was just everywhere I was actually breaking a pilot at NBC and we kept taking breaks to go you know watch more of it God it's like the world's grimaced soccer game like you know like the world was gathering around to be like oh it's it's horrifying though like I can't believe I mean just on the face of it like if you just for a moment compartmentalize whether or not the allegations are true or whether they're even relevant if you just put all that aside for a second just the way he composed himself during that hearing is astonishing that he would even be considered for a position that is supposed to be defined in large part by a calm even handed to quorum civility yeah yeah with self-restraint yeah you know being bipartisan neutral like I keep thinking about Hillary with it with the Benghazi hearings to and thinking about how composed and cool she was for like how many hours ten hours like an hour straight yeah she did no yelling no and no and I mean yeah the lack of decorum was was striking to me the fact that that there's a comparison between those two it's been really frustrating I think emotionally and and I sort of toggle between feeling frustrated that we're all focused on it and also to some extent feeling excited that we are also invested in something in kind of civic engagement yeah but God I wish it wasn't under these circumstances well I was thinking a lot during the also during the Kavanaugh thing because I watched the entire fucking thing oh wow your masochist yeah well I had to do it for work I did it for my job which is masochism I was thinking about how when Sonia Sotomayor was being considered for the Supreme Court how people were like latching on to her being calling herself a wise Latina and kind of penalizing her in the press or being in in some way not even close to as emotional as Kavanaugh I was wondering Grace if you had thoughts on her saying she's a wise Latina on on on like the I guess the the chasm between the way that Brett Kavanaugh was treated and the way that any woman of color is treated in this context well I mean I think it goes back to the idea of tokenism that we've kind of talked about as well Sonia Sotomayor could she just didn't have an option to fail she just didn't have an option but to be the best possible version of herself and the best possible version of any Latina that could exist Brett Kavanaugh just has to be good for himself he just has to make himself look somewhat passable is there a double standard yeah absolutely I mean I just I also think that like and I know there have been a number of conversations about this but the whole hearing itself was was convoluted and weird because it wasn't a trial and it wasn't exactly it wasn't his hearing to become Supreme Court justice it lived in this strange world that I think was super unsatisfying because when we walked away from it I ultimately don't think we learned much more we didn't learn much about what happened between we learned that he is a dick exactly I before the hearing I was like wow you know I don't know very much about this guy except I find his judicial record appalling but then after the the the hearing I remember thinking this is a man who behaves in a way that men think that they're entitled to behave to women or marginalized groups all the time and they get away with it because they've always gotten away and that's a key like who so to me it's it's not politics it's theater at that point everyone is performing for the audience and then we have to ask who is the audience and I think for for Lindsey Graham I think for Brett Kavanaugh it was an audience of one like they were performing for Trump oh I thought you were gonna say Satan Trump and and Republicans because I've heard a lot of thoughts that it's about mobilizing the base I think what I think it's a particular base it's the base that Trump in particular mobilized which I wouldn't actually call like having grown up around Republicans right I see no similarity between what's happening now and and and traditional Republican sure sure sure it's they've utterly betrayed any value that they ever laid any claim to and it really has just become you know there was this awful joke on SNL last year where something about the 52 genders that Facebook introduced and like that was the reason that Trump got elected and there was this kind of blowback against it and identity politics and all that but I've been thinking about that ever since and I think there's some truth in it actually like I feel partially responsible you did it I did but hear me up that I'll make this really brief but basically I mean gender is such a huge part of the way that we move through the world the way that we relate to each other the way that we construct everything that we see and want to do and trans people kind of disrupted a very safe and secure binary that has defined people's roles in society for a really long time and in that disruption we've gotten a blowback to the most like kind of like basic reified forms of the gender binary and I think that's what we're seeing with with Trump you know we're getting you know from from Obama who's a very kind of like a feat kind of cold you know intellectual to someone who is pure bombast who can kind of brag about assaulting women because there's a sense of like well that's how men are that's what men do and I got the sense that very much that Brett Kavanaugh that's what he was doing he was kind of like doing what he thought Trump would want and people who like Trump would want which is being a man like yeah I did this I drink beer and like I hit on women because that's what men do and that's their correct role so you're saying that that's not necessarily even reflective of of his authentic self I can't I can't possibly claim to know that I just know that that in that moment that is the performance he reverted to and that there's I'm sure that there's a reason for that I think that's dead on because that that's actually something that that I noticed too it did feel like theater but it also felt like a fabrication of this this man's identity and the way that he viewed himself I don't know that he necessarily sees himself as this like you know bloated frat dude I think he probably has a holds himself in higher esteem but I do feel like there's a pressure to put himself in some particular box and I think that's the one that he went with and that's probably the one that he was guided to go into and as you mentioned it's for a purpose it's because there's an audience that he's trying to appeal to we've seen again and again Trump critiquing his own team when they don't stand up strong enough he hated that about Sean Spicer you know he hated the impersonations on SNL because they made someone look weak yeah like that's his whole thing I was actually concerned that that that we're not concerned I might my impression was that Trump was going to hate the Kavanaugh performance because he cried because there were moments of emotion I thought that was going to make him look weak in effect in effect you know it was kind of the opposite because I think he showed a range of bravado that that ultimately Trump really liked but I just referring to this theater is is dead on and that was something he's like I think the Trump camp had specifically asked for that from Kavanaugh you know from the jump like it's before the hearing it was kind of like oh like there was internal rumblings that oh we don't like the performance he's too boring he's too metered you know he needs to kind of like step up to the plate so this this to me felt a little bit like watching somebody who is kind of boring like trying to muster up emotion yes you know like and and and the bombast you know I wish politics were boring really do yeah stay craft state craft should be a craft it should be like in it should be like engineering we should be hiring people who are trained in it who take a very kind of like mechanical approach to it this whole kind of cult of charisma that we have around politics is just so incredibly dangerous yes I think we might be moving to a place now where you can't succeed as a politician unless you have that quality and that that then takes there there's one positive to it which I think that we are moving in a direction where career politicians no longer exist the idea of somebody who just sort of works exclusively in that world and that you come from a different background I think is kind of necessary but that different background is reality television that background is acting that different background is something that isn't by nature performative and not by nature intended to pursue a civic duty and people but eventually you become the performance like if you're a person who is you know oh but I'm not like that you know I I just play a an asshole on TV I just play an asshole in Congress I'm not an asshole and with my family or with my daughters and it's like yeah well you know if your job is to be that asshole eventually you that's who you are it takes over the person the goodness of you and it and it and it's carcinogenic and it's not something that people can escape I think a lot of people like to entertain them the the idea that they can somehow be a throw Lindsey Graham style tantrum and then also be a good guy that everybody wants to hang out with and eventually that comes to a head and that's impossible by the way that's the double standard that that Brett Kavanaugh I think was purporting between his himself as an alcoholic and himself as a sober person too there's this standard that like you can be a good guy but you can also be a bad drunk and I don't think that's the case at all I don't think that's the case at all I think if you if you're if you're a bad guy when you're drunk that's who you are yeah I tend to think so too yeah I can we can say this that if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed he will be a groundbreaking Supreme Court drunk that I'm sure there've been a lot of drugs on the Supreme Court I have no doubt about that so many there's so much room in those flat like for flax in the robes so much bag under that that's what I mean you could just put you know keep a whole six pack all the beers we don't know what's happening under the bench in the robe it's like you just have different pockets sewn yeah exactly you know just as koozy look he likes beer I'm convinced that basically the only way that I can make sense of what's happening in Washington right now is that straight white men in power have seen the writing on the wall that they know their time is up like there's no way around it demographically we're shifting in such a way that they cannot retain power it's impossible there's no other option and so they're kind of it's like a cash grab like fuck it you know this thing is ending let's steal and take whatever we can to benefit ourselves and the one thing that they can do long term is stack the Supreme Court and I just think it's all about that it's all about saving unborn babies and stopping the gays and stopping the women and they can do that best by stacking the court and everything else is just up for grabs well and it's a sort of the spirit of make America great again which is like the reaching back to a time when everybody who's angry about how things are now was more comfortable yeah not right not when not when you know women were more comfortable or people who were LGBTQ were more comfortable reaching back to a time when people who are like you were saying Jen are made uncomfortable by the challenging of existing paradigms they want to go back to that and and they don't really care who they hurt or what they take away from people in the process and I guess maybe we need more females CEOs and female senators and say combat that Aaron I just wanted to say like and just to your point about it is your identity like what you like Kavanaugh had a choice he still had a choice and how he wanted to it like the Trump camp might have wanted him to perform a certain way but at the end of the day if you're supposed to be an independent thinker if you're supposed to be a person who can withstand the pressure of whatever politics are and be like nonpartisan then it's like that it's like the responsibility is still on him for for the words he chose to say out of his own face if you've been as common collected as as Dr. Ford it would have come down to he said she said which which is awful and there are people who would have picked aside no matter what but the few crucial swing people like Flake and Murkowski and etc who might have been on the fence like I think he pushed in the wrong direction I hope so I have really well we found out very soon yeah I'm terrified I'm just so anxious about I know I know I know we have to take a break unfortunately but when we come back we'll have the hills will die on this week and we're back with the hills will die on this week Jen since you're the guest I'm gonna let you go first what's the hill you're gonna die on and it's not an important one no it has to be unimportant okay well this one's very important to me I have a thing about nerdy laughing coffee cups versus teacups okay go on once something is a teacup it can only ever be a teacup for life and once something is a coffee cup it can only ever be a coffee cup for life and if I see someone put coffee in a teacup or tea and a coffee cup I get incredibly anxious so the shape of the cup or mug does not matter well I so ideally like if I'm going to choose the first time a liquid goes into a cup there will be considerations I see but ultimately it's about whatever was served that first time in the cup so like for instance you have a purple cup right now that has a teabag yes so I'm fine with that's the first time I've ever seen that cup it has tea in it if I were to see someone else drink coffee out of that cup I would be like clawing at my seat how bad would you hate it if I went to go put coffee in this after the tea oh good lord without no she puts coffee with the tea okay that's enough you're just being mean now no bullying the guests no bullying is number rule number one of my staring is crying I had a question about because you know how like the like a teacup can be you know like a proper like with the tea cat like so now what about if that cup originally gets coffee put in that it's a tea cup it's well if that original no okay if that originally gets because like my mom had cups that I would consider to be classic classic tea cups tea but she doesn't drink tea she drinks coffee so I'm okay with that because in her house those are coffee cups what about other fluids what if I put Coca-Cola in this cup why would you do that though I don't know sometimes if I you know haven't one of them I dishes and yeah Grace I feel cozy by her own code I know this is a weird fanatical little thing in my head but I do think there's something to the shape of a cup how wide it is the thickness of the lip and the material totally that absolutely do determine how you would intake the liquid I say it's like wine aficionados yes exactly that similar like when you do have specific well no that's a real thing though yeah when I used to work in restaurants I actually do have there's a particular kind of glass for every varietal of wine right I don't know if it's time for any of that I've now I've I forever changed the way I'm gonna look at coffee and tea cups thanks a lot Jen you're passing on your anxiety Kieran what's your hill this week some mines petty but you know sometimes I'll go on Yelp to find a restaurant and it says it's open but then you go to the restaurant and it's closed oh boy and I feel like kill yourself if you are that restaurant fault is that that was at the restaurant's fault for misreporting their hours is it yelps fault for not getting it right is it isn't it isn't it isn't Yelp crowdsourced in some way so maybe we are at fault for not getting the hours took the hours is an official thing that Yelp worked out with the restaurant or that the restaurant has a right to put in there I told I was in Brooklyn the other day thank you for making that question much less existential no because I went to a restaurant and I chose it based on Yelp as an Indian restaurant and the only one in that neighborhood and I went and it was three o'clock and it said it was open all day and it was closed and they were just closed and I sat there giving them the like death eye from like it says you're open and they ignored me yeah I was extremely rude okay here's the hill I'm gonna die on this week a oregano is fucking trash oregano is a no it is grace come on I stand for a oregano but I want to hear I want to hear the spices here yeah first of all it's an herb and it is the trash herb it tastes it tastes like soap it's always overused in foods it detracts from the overall taste of like Italian food I can't think of a food that last night I made a soup and it called for oregano and I was like ah ah not putting an oregano in you no oregano and I didn't use it with I didn't use oregano in it was the best version of it I've ever made it was great what about if you what about if it's fresh oregano no fuck that what if what about in a in a vinaigrette a fresh vinaigrette of some kind for a salad I guess if I can't taste the oregano that's fine fuck oregano you know how people have like I have the gene that makes cilantro taste like so maybe you have a rare gene that makes oregano taste no I think I'm correct and the world is wrong anyone else think of oregano is trash no I love it I love it I consider it a spice I consider them all spices herbs and spices they're all spices they're all kinds of spices anything you use to flavor food can be considered a spice I will never sprinkle oregano I'll never sprinkle oregano straight on something I'll I'll give you that but I use it in things all the time see this is why I based oregano see this is why we need more women leaders because this is compromise that you're seeing right now yes grace what's your hill this week okay my hill this week is this drinking is hard it's hard it's gotten harder it's difficult for me I drink and then it's fun and then the next day I feel like caca and I don't like it and it's difficult that's called aging I know you put a lot of elbow grease into drinking no so you know no I how committed are you to this though I'm to drinking oh well I'll probably fight it through the difficulty that's the thing is that I I personally she's a yeah she's a trooper I am a trooper so I shall I shall fight the good fight I will not give up but it is difficult and I just want everyone to know that that it is it is it is a struggle I'm a petite woman and I like to pretend that I forget that in the moment and then I drink lots of sake let's say which happened two nights ago and then all of yesterday I was squiggly I felt like a squiggly little lime do you know the animated show Doug and all the characters are just kind of like slightly moving that's me that was me for a whole day after I had like six little teeny thimblefuls of sake I think that's called being wavy and I think usually the kids use it when in reference to drugs oh yes my drug is is restaurant sake and and drinking is hard oh gosh well those are all as stupid of hills to die on as as any week and that's all the time we have for hysteria this week thank you so much to senator mazie hirono of Hawaii
