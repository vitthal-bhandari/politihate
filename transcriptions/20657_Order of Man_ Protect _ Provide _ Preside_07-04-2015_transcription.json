    "text": " Everywhere you look, you can see men that look like they've got it together. We also notice men that absolutely look horrible. The way that you do one thing is the way you do everything and it's no different with fashion. My guest today is Tanner Guzzie with Masculine Style and he's here to talk about how every man can and should up their fashion game. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. We boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred, repeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. My guest today is Tanner Guzzie with Masculine Style. He started Masculine Style in 2011 and has loved watching it grow since. Tanner believes that every man can improve his life by paying careful attention to his style and using the ways other people see and treat him to his advantage. Masculine Style focuses less on the what and the how of men's clothing and instead dives deeper into the why. So Tanner, I'm so stoked to have you on the show today. We're going to talk a lot about fashion and what it means to be fashionable and why that's important. But according to you and a little bit that I know about you, you used to be poor in this area. Now this is something you focus on. So what changed for you? What made that switch for you? It's a good question and it's funny because poor, not to call you out right out of the game, but poor. I don't think the way that I would put it because honestly being style conscious is something that I've been my entire life. I don't know why, but I've always been that way. And so the philosophy of it and the understanding that people judge you by and everything else is always something that I've been aware of. The way that poor does actually fit though is the tribe that I used to want to identify with, especially in high school and everything else was very much the, and this was late 90s, early 2000s. And so it was the skate, BMX, punk rock, that kind of scene. And as a 30 year old dad of two kids who's in the style industry and everything, obviously that doesn't communicate who I am anymore. And so it was a gradual change as I started to grow up. I realized that my clothing wasn't growing up with me and to a very large extent people were still continuing to perceive me and therefore treat me like a high school kid. And so I had to change my style in order to change the way that I perceive myself and other people saw me and treated me. So for me, it was just kind of a natural progression of I've always identified this way. I've always wanted to look this way, but it was time to change because I had changed. I'd grown up. So you called me out the very first part of the episode. I insulted you the very first comment. Don't even close to an insult. Just a clarification. So we're starting this thing off right. So you bring up a really good point where styles change and of course your season and life changes and what you want to identify with. I think from my perspective and even in my own life, I think a lot of guys have a challenge with changing or keeping up with new fashion trends or new styles or trying to find that new identity. Can you talk about that a little bit? Absolutely. I have written about this quite a bit. And one of the ways that I choose to call it is a static inertia. And it's this idea of a lot of guys, whether it's in high school or through college or once they first get married or at some point in their lives when they feel like they've really kind of established their identity of who they are. They dress accordingly and then that inertia just kind of continues to carry on throughout everything after. I think a lot of times as men, we resist the idea of having to change and improve because in a twisted way, we think that means that we're not fine where we are. We kind of identify as I'm great now as opposed to part of my greatness is that I'm willing to seek out and achieve even more greatness. If that makes sense. Right. For sure. So it's this idea of if I have to change, that means that what I was doing before was bad. Yeah. Well, and I think in addition to that, I know this is the case for me is, and I can just think about just in the last like 60 days, I changed up my hairstyle a bit. And I'll tell you what, for the first little while, first couple of weeks, even still to this day, a little bit, I feel a little awkward. Like I feel a little uncomfortable with it. And I think we get to this stage where it's like, I don't know, like I don't know if I want to put myself out there and expose myself to something new. Right. Especially because people are used to seeing you with your old haircut and they, it's not unwanted attention, but to some extent, it's probably uncomfortable attention because people might comment. You don't know how to respond to those comments. You get treated a little bit differently. It's all this stuff where something as simple as changing your hairstyle takes you out of your comfort zone. And I think a lot of men are either resistant to any idea of being outside of their comfort zone or the men who deserve a little bit more credit are so continually out of their comfort zone in other areas that they see their style or their aesthetic as kind of their safety zone, somewhere where they can just kind of retreat and not have to worry about improvement. So is there a point where you feel like guys maybe just take it over the top though? Like one end of the spectrum is this aesthetic inertia and then is there another end of the spectrum where it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's too much all at once? Oh yeah, absolutely. And that's even one of the things where part of what I do is I coach clients and I help them dress better. And I have a few clients who really, you know, to their benefit, money is no object and they're able to do a full kind of ridiculous wardrobe revamp. And if we wanted to do it in a weekend, they could. But if you change too much about your aesthetic, your parents too quickly, then it's not congruent with who you are as a man. And so it's something that has to be done consistently in over a period of time. It's like, can you imagine if there were some way that you could go from whatever your build is today to being 70 pounds bigger with half the body fat percentage where you are right now and how weird you would feel. Even just walking down the street. Right. Sure. And that may be an admirable goal to get to that point, but you're able to adapt to it because it's a gradual change. And style doesn't have to be that gradual, but it needs to be something that it's consistent with who you are as you're progressing to meet the style. It's kind of a give and take relationship. Well, and I think what's interesting too is that as we think about our own fashion and our own style, there's certainly an element of comfort to that. But I think there's probably an element of comfort to those around you that, hey, I can rely on Ryan looking this way or behaving this way or acting this way. And so when you step out of that, does that affect the way people treat you? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And it's one of those things where it can work either direction. I had a talking about haircuts. I had a haircut up until probably six months ago when I decided to change my hair. But until that point, I had to have the same style for a year and a half. And that's the longest at any point in time in my life that I have kept the same style of hair. I don't know why it's always been something that's kind of been in my head that I get bored with it and I want to change it. And it started to kind of mess with my dad where he was like, you were always changing your hair. Like, why have you landed on this? Why is this stuck? And so whether it's a consistency or a consistent change, people get used to whatever it is that you've established as your habit. So you talk about your hair a little bit. And for me, maybe it's my shirts or my beard or whatever else it may be. But I think we as guys maybe have these, for lack of a better term, these sacred fashion items or these sacred styles that we are. Why do you think that is? Like, why do we get into one rut and then it's difficult for us to move out of that? That's a really good question. And part of it is, again, what I initially talked about as far as it's safe. And it's almost like home base. You know, when you're a little kid and you're playing tag and then once you get into home base, you're able to kind of let your guard down a little bit. And I think for men who are self-improvement-minded, as we continue to get better in the gym or get better in our relationships or get better at work or get better with our kids or anything else, sometimes the idea of having to add a change in wardrobe on top of that can just make it feel overwhelming. I think to another extent for a lot of guys, it's this idea of, for me, okay, we can talk about the BMX culture. I actively remember the first time that I did not own a pair of skate shoes. And it felt really weird because I hadn't been on a bike in a year and a half. But it was letting go a part of my identity that I had always associated with myself and I'd always been kind of proud of. And I'd relied on for so many years that it was weird and it was uncomfortable to walk away from that. And so I know plenty of guys too. You know, they haven't been on a skateboard in 10 years, but they still wear their skate shoes because they can't quite push themselves mentally or emotionally to be beyond what they were in quote-unquote their glory days. Right, right. That makes sense. You know what's interesting and I don't know if you know this about me. Maybe some of the guys listening to us. I actually spent in 2005 and 2006 a year in Iraq. And one of the interesting things that we had as we were leaving the gate of our base is we had this big sign that said complacency kills. Who I love that. And I think obviously not to the same degree when it comes to fashion as being in Iraq. Obviously. But I think that could be a lot of the same things in fashion or in business or relationships or a marriage or being a debt. Whatever it is, I think if you just become complacent, you're just going to end up withering away. And so I think that's why it's so important to be on top of not only fashion, but everything in your eye. Well, you're absolutely right. I mean, I'm not going to physically be in danger, you know, for the most part because I get complacent about my style. But if I get complacent about it, then I see it as an opportunity to maybe get more complacent in other areas. Or other people see that complacency and they will believe that I'm more complacent in other areas as well. And so both in the ways that I see myself and in the ways that other people see and treat me, that complacency is a negative when it could be a positive just by being more deliberate and intentional about the clothing that I choose to wear. You know, that's really interesting you say that because one memory I have as I was in high school, we had a fairly good baseball team when I was a, well, basically, our entire high school. And my coach had this saying, he says, if you look good, you play good. And without a doubt, we would always have the best looking uniforms versus any other team that we would play. And his thought was, hey, if you look the part, you're going to behave and you're going to act the part. Absolutely. I mean, why do you think in the military they're so strict about what your uniforms look like? I mean, even I have a buddy who's going through, he's just getting ready to go into the police academy. He's not even in the academy yet, let alone on a force. And it's been ridiculous how strict his mentors and his instructors have been as far as his facial hair or the length of his hair or how shine to shoes are or anything. And it's not because in a fight situation, it doesn't matter. But in a disciplined situation, it's all indicative of your ability to have the back of the rest of your team and get the job done right. So what do you think, just out of curiosity, when it comes to the military, and I know that there's a lot of fashion just in the real world, I call it the real world, that obviously mirrors military-type styles. I think that's a huge factor of it. But when you look at military uniforms and you look at the gear, what is it that is trying to be portrayed? What is coming across to people? Wow, that's another really good question, especially if you think about modern uniforms. Because you're right, a lot of current style has its roots in old military. It's the idea, you know, a suit was even based off of the coats and jackets that officers wore in the military. It's kind of funny to think about the idea that what the military wears now, maybe 150 years from now, some iteration of that will be considered formal wear. Yeah, right. It's not crazy to think about. But I think that there's, as much as the current world kind of shapes against this idea, men like aspiring to be like manly men. Right. We're just programmed to be that way. We love having heroes and we love aspiring to be like them. And I think on some very, very primal level, we understand that if we start to look like our heroes, then we start to act like our heroes. Right. Well, and that's what Order of Man is all about. It's all about getting back to masculinity and being comfortable with that and saying, no, this is us as guys. It doesn't mean we need to be pigs or chauvinistic or jerks or whatever else, but it means we need to be strong. And I think a lot of that can come through the styles and the way we present ourselves to people. Absolutely. So what are some of the other things that we talk a little bit about the military, but what are some of the other things that you think guys can do, or maybe what can they portray to other people through their sense of fashion? Yeah, military and kind of that root of that raw and even that violent masculinity is obviously one of them. What I do is I focus a lot on helping guys understand why they dress the way that they do. And part of that is breaking it down into this idea of discovering and then developing a style archetype. I believe that most masculine men that the rest of us aspire to be like can fall into three different archetypal ranges. You've got rugged, refined and rakish. And if men are able to kind of assess their own lives, not only where they are, but where they want to be, and they can find men who epitomize what they want to be and then start to find out where those men fall within those three archetypes. It makes it a lot easier to then break it down, not only in style, but kind of in every other chunk and every other aspect of what your life is of whether or not you want to fit into that archetype or even a percentage of any of the three combined together. So I do think that anything that a guy can do or that a man can do to embrace that masculine to be and look to be intentional about his clothing and see it as another tool that he has in his belt. And as opposed to something that, I mean, yeah, we all have to wear clothes. But why so many men just look at it as a neutral. It's like as long as I'm not embarrassed about it, then I'm fine. Because any, I guarantee you that any man who tells you that he doesn't care about what he looks like does, because otherwise he'd be walking out. I always say he'd be walking around in a snuggy. Yeah. You find the most comfortable thing. Comfortable, it's functional, it gets the job done, but he cares because he doesn't want to be embarrassed. So he's avoiding the negative, but he's only taking it so far as being a neutral when really what he needs to do is take it into the realm of being a positive. Right. So I think before we connected, I think I was actually on your site and it seems like there was a resource or an article that actually broke down the rugged, refined, and rakish. Is that right? Yeah, I've got a whole series on it. So maybe what are some key points of each of those? Like if you're looking at a guy who has a rugged style, what would be typical of that? Yeah, the best way to kind of describe all three, I'll say that a rugged man is defined by, I'm doing my best kind of paraphrase how I wrote this down, a rugged man is defined by his ability to manipulate and control nature. And so whether that's somebody who's kind of the classic Americana or a cowboy or a lumberjack or, you know, and obviously these are very American archetypes, but that translates into other cultures as well. But it's men who are more comfortable outside and manipulating the physical world with their bodies and dressing accordingly because a guy can't do something like that in a suit. You can't be like Axman on the history channel or something without wearing a suit, right? Right. Yeah. And so dressing according to fit his needs, but still being cognizant of how that aesthetic affects the way other people perceive him and using it to not only accomplish his goals physically, but his goals socially. A refined man is somebody who is defined by his financial and his social savvy, somebody who has a lot of influence over kind of the world of people and of culture. I think one of the ways, a good TV way to describe that is kind of like Frank Underwood from House of Cards. Right. He's not a physical archetype. He's not a rugged man. And he's certainly not a rake. And that he's someone who has his identity by breaking the rules. He's someone who follows all the rules, you know, at least from a perception in order to maintain his level of impact over the world around him. Right. And obviously you can see that reflected in his wardrobe and you can see that in the wardrobes of people who are in politics or who are big business people or anything else. And then the third one is the rake. And this is a guy who, his power comes from coloring outside of the lines and kind of throwing a little finger to what everybody else says and having the gravitas to be able to do that and still gain his own following as a result. As I think about this, is it, I'm sure there's guys that maybe try to cross over into something that they're not. Is that to me, I think that might be out of integrity a little bit. Maybe that's not the right word, but just like out of alignment with who you are. Is that visible for people to notice? Yeah, I think so. It's funny. I'm not, not a huge movie buff, but for some reason all these references kind of keep popping in my head. But as soon as you said that I was thinking of, do you remember in Back to the Future 3 when Marty McFly goes and buys all of his eight Cowboys? Right. And I mean, I would argue that every single man has some percentage of all three of those archetypes in his life. And it may be something as small as five or 10% of one and 80 or 90% of another. But I think we all have that to some extent. But there is, there's some inconsistency with, I mean, for me, I work on top of doing the side. I do, I help run a company that does custom suits. And so for me, both the refined and the Rekka Sharka types make a lot more sense than the rugged one. And it would be silly for me to go into work wearing a suit and have a pair of work boots on with it. Right. Right. You know what else is interesting about that? I think back to a friend of mine who owns a landscaping company. And if you saw the guy, he's just, he's a rugged guy, like I can tell you right off the bat. I mean, he looks the part, he's strong, physically strong. He sometimes he'll wear, you know, like a polo shirt, but for the most part, it's kind of a more of a ragged t-shirt. He's got some ragged jeans on, some boots on. I mean, he just looks the part, right? But as salesperson is a woman who is very attractive and she dresses up, I would say, more than a couple of years ago. And she dresses up, I would say, more than average. And although she looks nice and she's attractive and she's well-spoken, for me, it's like, I don't really get it. Like, I don't connect how you're going to be the landscaping representative because I don't expect that to be the case. Is that right? Yeah, absolutely. To me, it would make more sense to have the guy who owns the business, whether it's him or somebody else who's like him that's in charge of sales, like go in wearing a pair of jeans, some work boots, and then maybe like just a good casual sport coat or something like that. So it's like, all he has to do is ditch the jacket and he can get down into business itself. But he still acknowledges that the sales environment and working with people who aren't down in the dirt all the time is different and cater to that accordingly. So this brings up a really good point because I think we've all heard that you can't overdress for the occasion, but I don't know if that's true. I mean, it sounds like there's times where dressing down is actually in your best interest. Oh, absolutely. Because I would say that that's a safe rule and that's a good beginner rule to live by, but you're not going to go surfing in a tuxedo. Right. And so it's very, it is. It's important that as you kind of get over the initial bump of trying to dress better, and most men will over dresses or they're trying to dress better. And I think that's a great thing. That's the right way to air as you're getting better at it. But at the same time, you need to learn that casual wear or functional wear. It exists for a reason. And dressing up can be just as much of a negative as dressing down is when it's done in the wrong context. I'm sure that there's categories that you can place events or occasions into. Like, okay, here's a casual event. Here's a business event. Here's a formal event. What are some of those categories that you would see guys needing to find a style in each one of those categories? I would say it's more important that guys find their own style with who they are and then that's reflected within those different categories because it's more of an art than a science. You don't want to come up with a uniform for a day with your kids at the park, which is what I just got done doing, versus going out to South by Southwest versus going to a board meeting in New York because the same man can do all of that. And I would never recommend that he do all three of those in the same outfits. But I would hesitate to say that he needs to wear X, Y or Z because it's more important that he understands where he falls within those three archetypes and then he leans on whichever one is his strength within those different environments. So how do you do that? Because I know that there's times where like it was up to me and I know I heard you on a podcast. I think it was for one of your articles where you said no flip flops unless you're at the beach. And so like if it were me, if I'm going to go to the park, I'm going to throw in some flip flops. And so it's like how do you find that style but not like settle, not be like too comfortable. That's a man, you've got good questions. I really appreciate this. I would say one thing that's really interesting about that and I've been thinking a lot about that in a flip flops thing because I just got back two weeks ago from a trip to Hawaii. I was there for a week with my family and it's different out there. It's totally different out there and wearing flip flops beyond just out on the beaches is culturally appropriate. You know, me being in Utah are spending most of my time in kind of landlocked areas or more kind of urban areas. It's easy to say absolutely not. You should not wear this unless you were in this very limited scope and very limited perspective. I would say the big thing with the flip flop example or any other is to be almost hyper sensitive to what is being communicated by what you're wearing. As guys, I think we tend to be and I don't want to lump us all together but we tend to be very bottom line driven. Like what's the outcome? What's the result? If you're telling me that, hey Ryan, you've got to be more intentional about your dress. You can't just go out in your gym shorts which is what I tell my boys. Guys, you don't wear gym shorts outside of the house unless you're going to play basketball. But that's hard. That's out of your comfort zone. What's the bottom line? Why should we even take that into consideration? So what if it's out of your comfort zone? I mean, comfort zones are for children. To me, what it comes down to is this idea of ease has its place but it should never be sought out for its own sake. I don't grow when things are easy and as a man, it's my responsibility to grow and to get better and to improve. Not only that, but to leverage that improvement, to improve the lives of my family, the lives of the people with whom I work and everything else. So, ease and comfort are great things and they're great respites but they should never be actively sought out. So I think you're talking a lot about maturity as a man. Absolutely. We do hard things because we want the things in our life that we want. We've got to work for those things and every element, I think, is so easy to look, overlook fashion and maybe relationship with your family or your co-worker. But I think there's every element. You know what else is interesting is the way that you do one thing, in my opinion, is the way that you do everything. So if you're a sloppy dresser, I'm not going to hire you because you're going to be sloppy with the work that I'm trying to hire you to do. Exactly. And the thing is whether or not somebody's justified in seeing you that way, you're going to feel that way about yourself regardless. Because if you think, well, I can take it easy in this one area or this doesn't matter, then where else does that translate because it's never just isolated to one area. So, okay, so what are, I'm curious, with your background and what you do for work, what are some of your pet peeves? Like mine, for example, socks with sandals. Like every time I see that, I'm like, what is this guy thinking? Like, literally, what is he thinking? What went through his mind? Yeah, like how do you decide to do that, right? Right. So what are some of the pet peeves that you have? My biggest pet peeve is, and I see this a lot because I'm in a very family concentrated area, is dads who dress like their toddler or young child-aged boys. And it's not because their boys are dressing up to look like men. Right. So it's dads who wear a pair of flip-flops with baggy cargo shorts and a superhero t-shirt and everything is two sizes too big. You know what I mean? That's literally what their kids are wearing. And I just, I look at that and I think, do not see what that's communicating to your son. Do not see that it's telling him that that's as much as he needs to do, you know, that he may need to grow more physically or he may need to be more disciplined in doing his homework or in spending his money or in eating his vegetables or anything else. But does he really need to do all that if he doesn't need to get any better at dressing better either? Yeah, good point. Anything else for pet peeves? Nothing I really ever see consistently enough, especially because another one that I emotionally kind of respond to and then I always have to draw myself back from it is guys who are overly stylized. And because I just look at it like, okay buddy, you're trying way too hard. But that's the cynic in me because I'd rather, I would rather invest time in a friendship or in a business relationship with somebody who tries too hard and is overly sensitive to the relationship. And then there's some kind of overly sincere than somebody who's cynical and ironic and just airs on the side of being too cautious. So let's talk about, one thing I want to talk about with you is t-shirts. Because every dude out there loves just like a good comfortable t-shirt. But at the same time, if all you wear is like you said, t-shirt, t-size and too big, all superheroes or stupid sayings or whatever. What do you recommend for t-shirts? I recommend, and it's actually one of my staples, is still a good t-shirt. I think every man should have a good rotation of t-shirts in his wardrobe, whether that's, I mean for me it's two, maybe three. But I do think that we should be able to wear them. It has to be something that fits and I do recommend that it's something that's plain. But even then I see a lot of guys who fall within kind of different combined aesthetics. Like I see a lot of guys who are into the old motorbike scene, they live out in California. They work on and ride these old kind of vintage 60s and 70s motorcycles. And for them wearing old graphic t-shirts, it makes sense because it fits within the context. My big thing that I would say with t-shirts though is most guys just, whenever they get out of work or get off the clock or they don't have to be wearing something, they wear a t-shirt. Right? And so I would say, okay, so when do you wear a button up shirt? And they'll give me a list of times and a list of reasons in which they will wear a t-shirt or wear a button up shirt. And then everything that doesn't fall within that limited scope means it's time to wear a t-shirt. And I would say it's better to switch that around. So you're wearing a button up shirt. And that doesn't necessarily mean a white dress shirt with a tie, but just a shirt with a collar on it. I mean I'm wearing a casual chambray shirt today, but it has a collar and it buttons up. So you wear that, something like that as a default unless you have this limited range in which it actually appropriates wear a t-shirt. So just a little mental shift. Let's talk about fit because with me over the past year and a half, I've literally lost 45 pounds in the last year and a half. Adam, man, that's awesome. Yeah, yeah, it's been good. It's been exciting. Tons of energy, like everything just goes better. Business has been better and it's not coincidence. And I'm getting the shape and doing that. It's not a pretty good idea. It's so cool how much of an effect that has on you. I didn't lose that much, but I've had a good body shift in the last two years as well. It's good for you. It's a huge thing. So here's one of the challenges that I've had over the year of losing weight is that my clothes now are a little baggy. And my wife has even made comments like, oh, your shirt's too baggy or your jeans are falling off. Like how do you find the right fit? Because I've also tried jeans on and I'm like, no, no, these are too tight for me. So how do you find the right fit for you? I would say two things to go with that. One is when you try on something new, a guy needs to learn to distinguish between something being uncomfortable or it's being unfamiliar. Because if it's uncomfortable, then obviously that's a problem. And you either need to not buy it or you need to have it remade or tailor it or something else. But if it's unfamiliar, then after three or four wears, you actually do get used to it. And the way it looks is more flattering on you. And it's just unfamiliar. So I could often deal with it for the first four or five wears, you know? Yeah, because it'll become comfortable to become part of who you are. I mean, I've worn a suit almost every day for the last 12 years and it certainly wasn't easy at first. But now it's simple. It's not a big of a deal for me to wear shirt and tie every day. I really am not bothered by it. The other thing that I would say is just kind of a good general rule. And this applies regardless of what kind of a shape a man is. Clothing should follow his natural lines without giving away any details. Yeah. Exactly. Because if you're too small and you wear something that's too big, then you just look scrawny. And if you're big and you wear something that's too big, then you just look sloppy. Right. And if you're too small and you wear something that's too tight, then you just look wispy and almost effeminate. And if you're too big and you wear something that's too tight, then you just look even larger than you actually are. Yeah, that's a good point. That's really interesting. I don't even know if I should share this. I was actually down in the Bahamas about a month or so ago. And literally this guy ran by and all he had was his banana hammock on his speedo on it. He's running down and there's literally thousands of people and he owned it. But at the same time, that thing is not right for you. So let's talk about versatility because you know as well as I do, probably better than I do, that when you're starting to improve your wardrobe and be deliberate about what you look like and how you dress, it could probably become a little over the top as far as cost goes. Oh yeah. So if I've got guys that are listening to you and I today that are saying, yeah, you know what it is, time that I upgrade my wardrobe and I start being deliberate about this. What are some things that they should consider purchasing first that are like really versatile? I have a whole series on that on my site. I call it the staples. Wait. Perfect. And let me pull up just kind of a few that I can recommend to some guys. All you're pulling that up to, what I'll do is just for everybody that's listening is I'll make links on order of men on our website and the show notes to be able to access all of this information. So we'll have the three different archetypes you talked about. We'll talk about the staples that you're going to address right now. So we'll have all those links there. Awesome. Awesome. So most of these are things, actually all of these, the reason that they're staples is I recommend that every single man have these in his wardrobe because at some point in time they're going to be needed and they're going to be used. And even if it's a one off thing, it will be in a situation in which it's necessary that he looks good. A good example is a suit, you know. There are plenty of men who really don't have a daily or even an annual need for a suit, but they should have a well fitting suit in their wardrobe because the times in which they will need it. A son's graduation, a job interview, something, you know, they're going to meet a political figure or something like that. It's so crucial that it fits well and it looks good, right? Is there a color that you'd recommend? Navy and Grey are always the best ones that I recommend just because of their versatility. A lot of guys will be called to black, but it's too formal. Yeah. So things like a suit, a good pair of dress shoes, dark jeans, some button up shirts, a t-shirt like we talked about, a Henley, a trench coat, a watch. A tie, a pair of chinos, you know, there's 30 of them, but they're all things that, for the most part, will translate across all three of the archetypes. They will either work. They'll work very well within kind of the formality spectrum of none of them are overly casual or overly formal. You know, I don't think every man needs to have a tuxedo in his wardrobe, although that's something that guys can aspire to have. And then there's a lot of other things that are even functional. An overnight bag, a DOP kit, a pocket knife, that kind of stuff. But I think that these are things that need to be factored in as part of a wardrobe or part of your everyday carry that every guy should have. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, I'll make sure I make a link to that because that'd be good for us to know. Cool. So let's talk about watches. You brought that up. What should guys be looking for in a good watch? And when I say a good watch, I mean, obviously you can go high end and spend tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars. But what's a good value in a watch? A good value is something that, I mean, it does the job. And even then, you know, a lot of, especially now, a lot of guys that I work with, they just don't wear watches because at this point in time a watch is jewelry. Right. You know? Right. Because we've got our cell phones or whatever else we don't need it. Exactly. I would argue that there's kind of, well, there's a couple of different situations. And one of the reasons I made a distapel is if you're a guy who, let's say you fit within the rugged archetype, you need something that will work in that environment. It has to be, it has to be able to stand up to the elements. It has to be waterproof. It has to be on a strap that it doesn't matter if it gets dirty. But you may be in situations where you don't want to have your phone on you. And so you need to be able to tell the time or use the other functions of a watch there for someone who's in a refined environment. It needs to be something that I think for a lot of guys, there is a reason to have a very high-end luxury watch. It's one of the things I'm saving up for now because I work with clients who make a lot of money and it's indicative of status. It's indicative of success. It's indicative of taste. And all of those things can be leveraged into more success and everything else. I'm so glad that you said I'm saving up for it because I'm a financial advisor by Trini. I love the fact that you said I'm saving for it. That's awesome. Yeah, it's not like, well, I'm going to go get the Sam X and go put no. That's right. That's false advertising. I haven't accomplished any, I haven't accomplished the success necessary for an expensive watch if I'm just getting it on credit. So, well, let's talk about that though because there's this big saying that, you know, fake it till you make it. So, where's the line with that? That would be, I would almost look at it as a spectrum. So, let's say in life in kind of a self-confidence or even a perception of others as far as my success or my appearance or anything else. I'm on like a level six. You know, say it ranges from one to ten. If I start to dress like those who are at level ten, there's too strong of dissonance in between those two numbers. And so, it's not faking it until I make it, it's just outright faking it. But if I'm not a six and I push myself to maybe a seven or an eight, then that can kickstart into self-improvement in other areas until I get up to an eight. And then at that point in each row to reevaluate and then start going at the nine or the ten level because it kickstarts that jump into that improvement up there. Right. That makes total sense, like always be striving to improve in every area of life. But, you know, don't overdo it. Find something exciting in the process of upgrading. Right. I mean, the best way to describe this is, let's talk about being in a gym. I would love to have a 500-pound deadlift. Right. Of course. If I go in and I try to do a 500-pound deadlift tomorrow or even a 450-pound deadlift or even a 400-pound deadlift, right now at a rep range of right around 300. And so if I go in and I can get one or two for three and then the following week I can get one or two for three or five and I incrementally work and I'm aspiring because I'm putting more weight on the bar than I could previously do. You know, you're faking it until you make it, but it's a level at which you can handle it and then it actually, it inspires and it catalyzes that growth as opposed to just you're just going to hurt yourself if you go straight for five. That's a great analogy. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. Let's talk about one thing that you said a little bit a little minute ago about a watch is that at this point it's just jewelry. And it's funny that I think we're going to have this conversation that we're talking about, men and jewelry. But let's talk about it. So we've got watches, we've got rings, we've got bracelets, we've got necklaces. Some guys might have an earring even or whatever it may be. Tell me a little bit about jewelry and accessorizing and all that stuff as it pertains to being a guy and looking good. I love it. Right now I'm wearing, I have a necklace with two different things on it. I have a watch with two bracelets on one arm. I have a wedding band and then I have a big lion head ring on the other hand. So I'm not someone who shies away from it, but part of it is because that's where I choose to embrace that little bit of rake in me. That rake-ish archetype where in American society jewelry is something that's considered to be a little bit gaudy or maybe even a little bit of feminine. And for me it's been kind of fun to figure out a challenge of still having a, there's nobody who questions that I'm a man when I walk down the street. There's no one in Drogeny which is nice, but at the same time it's like, what is that guy doing wearing this kind of stuff? While still being able to have the rake, but still being able to have the respect to the people that don't. So jewelry is definitely not something for the, at least in the United States or in North America. It's not for guys who are kind of new to the game because, you know, let's say that on a rake level jewelry is like an eight or a nine. And if your rake level is only a five or six and you're reaching too far out, but a watch is a good way to do it because it's an acceptable form of jewelry that has a rooted tradition within the United States. And I'll tell you with everything that I'm wearing today, I did not go buy all of that at once. I have added things slowly over time as I've gotten more comfortable wearing out. I think it's that manly beard that you've got offset sets in that. It helps a little bit, right? But I mean for sure. That's very intentional. You know, I wear, I have a beard and I've grown my hair out to the point where it's long enough that I can start to tie it back. And that's very intentional because for me, I really enjoy, at least right now, I enjoy the contrast of jewelry and long hair. These things that are in the United States, considered to be a little bit more rakish or a little bit more rebellious. But juxtaposing that with a really well tailored custom suit. It's fun because it's another way to just kind of indicate even further that everything about the way that I look is intentional. None of this is by accident. Right. So let's talk about beards for a minute because I'm really curious how and why styles change because when I got into this business, my planning business, financial planning business, it was roughly eight years ago. And I remember one of my trainers say, you will never have a beard. And I've got a beard now. Not as nice and full and thick as yours, but I've got a beard. And I don't think anybody thinks twice of it. So like how do styles change and why do they change? Like are there trendsetters that people are looking to? Oh, absolutely. There's always people who are willing to kind of break the mold or revamp something that existed before. And beards are one of those. A lot of people will attribute the beard revival to the hipster movement and a lot of ironic beards. I personally don't see it that way. I actually tie it more to what you and I are doing is kind of a revival of traditional masculinity and that kind of a movement. It's this rejection of men and women being the same. And that's how we're equal as opposed to equal of value. And so I will never say, and there's certainly things that I hate. Like I, the big like talking heads, massive giant suits. I hope that those never come back. But I'm sure that at some point I will see something like that. And if I were to see it today, I would totally reject it. But I'll go through it. And then another change and another change and style cyclical, it always comes back around. So what are some of the trends even coming up or things that you see becoming more popular over the next year? So what do you see? I'll tell you one that is, it's a subtle thing, but it's one that a lot of guys are starting to pick up on what it used to be. And so to make the change, the mental change is kind of weird, but it's a change from really skinny lapels on suits to massive lapels. Interesting. And it's funny because I have guys who come in and they want to do suits for weddings and they'll say, I want a modern suit and I want to go with a skinny lapel and I'll just kind of say, well, actually, you know, if you really want to kind of get ahead of the game, then you need to do something massive. And most of the time I'll talk guys into doing something that is consistent with the proportions between their head and their shoulders. For someone who really wants to kind of ride or embrace trends, which can be fun. That's one thing that's happening a lot is you're seeing big, big lapels on suits. In fact, one of the best ways to kind of see upcoming trends is to check out, have you heard of PT Womo? It's a big men's trade show. It happens twice a year, it's in Florence. They do a winter and they do a summer one, and it's just kind of this massive shooting peacock event where technically people go because it's a way for brands to showcase what their line is for the following year and for boutique shops to go and kind of buy stuff and sign up. That's not what it is anymore. It's just a way for kind of the who's who in the suited and the tailored men's world to go and hang out and get photographed and then have magazines and vlogs and everybody kind of put that stuff up. But it sets and establishes trends for what's coming up in the next year or two. You know what's interesting is probably six or seven years ago I had somebody come into our office and he was showing us shirts and ties and suits and he showed me a suit with, and I don't even know the technical term, but it's just like an open stitch on the lapel. Oh yeah, the pick stitching. Yeah, and I saw that. When I saw that, I'm like, no, I don't want that. That's not even done. But it's funny because then I started looking around, I'm like, oh, I guess this is popular because a lot of guys are wearing this. Well, and you want to know what's funny is it's actually not even something that's new or popular. It's an indicator of quality from an old world perspective and the only reason that we're so used to not seeing it is because with anything related to tailoring, time is money. It takes more time to do it and so off the rack of the two companies would be able to bump up their profits just a little bit more by eliminating the pick stitching. Yeah, so the whole reason that we're moving back to this idea of intentional clothing and quality clothing, handcrafted, made in America, all this kind of, you know, we're moving away from the assembly line aspect of our clothing. And so you're starting to see a revival of little details like pick stitching or functioning butts and holes on the sleeves or things like that. Well, so, Tana, we're running short a little bit on time, but what I want to do, just tell us briefly about your podcast because that's actually how we got linked up. I've listened to three or four of your episodes and so tell us a little bit about your podcast. Absolutely. So it's the masculine style podcast. It's available on iTunes, Stitcher, and on SoundCloud. I have three and a half years worth of articles on my site and kind of like we were just talking about things change, whether that's styles themselves or my own knowledge or my level as far as, you know, what I've aspired to. And so I, the whole premise of my podcast is I go through and I revisit these old posts and update them with new knowledge or with clarifications. And so it's fun because it's a lot of very basic stuff, stuff that I had, when I first started writing a site that I had first written about, but it's with a new lens, not only new as far as, you know, maybe what's current but also a more expert lens than what I was doing it with a few years ago. And what's the segment I really enjoy where you talk about guys that are really nailing it when it comes to fashion and guys that are flopping? What's that statement called? Yeah. Icons and embarrassments. Yes. I love that. That's awesome. Yeah, it's fun. I want to listen to you. It's what, for me, real world examples are always the best way to kind of nail down a concept. And so what I'll do is whatever the topic is that I'm talking about in a given episode, I will give an example of somebody who, like you said, is nailing it. He's our icon and someone who just completely does not and he's the embarrassment. It's so good. I love that segment. Thank you. The other thing that we talked about is I know that there's some things that you do from a coaching and consulting perspective. One thing that you had mentioned and you were gracious enough to offer is to give away to, are they called style profiles? Is that right? Yep. So as much as I will say that dressing well is more of an art than a science, there is still some science aspect of it. There are rules that apply to things like face shape or the contrast of the color of your skin versus the color of your hair or whether you have a warm skin tone or a cool skin tone or the proportions between your head and your shoulders and all these other things. All of this stuff really is available for guys to go out and learn on their own and do free. That's how I did it. But for a lot of guys, they're busy men and they want their style to be something that's intentional, but they don't want it to be something that turns into a hobby. They don't have the time to invest in it like that. So I offer a service where I will have clients send me out information. Usually involves just answering a few questions and then a few pictures. And then I give you all of that information so you can dress the best you can according to those rules and those stipulations. Awesome. So what we're going to do on that, and I'll have some notes on this again in the show notes, but what we're going to do is in order to be entered for the drawing to win one of those two style profiles, we ask that you leave a rating and review for this podcast, Order of Men, and also a rating and review for masculine style podcast. And if you send those both to me, just a snapshot of those two reviews and ratings, then we'll enter you in for the drawing for those style profiles. Absolutely. Cool. Tanner has been so great to have you on the show. A ton of valuable information. I know that we're going to connect in about a month at StyleCon, but I appreciate being on the show today. Absolutely, Ryan. I really appreciate the invite and I can't wait to get to meet you in person at StyleCon. That's going to be a really fun event. There you have it, guys. My guest today, Mr. Tanner Guzzie with Masculine Style and the Masculine Style podcast. I hope that this information was useful for you. I know it was for me, and I took away some great tips on how to up my fashion game and why that's even so important. Don't forget this week to leave us a rating and review at OrderOfMan.com slash iTunes. Yes, it helps us get the visibility out for this podcast so other men can become the men they were meant to be, but if you remember, you'll also be entered into the drawing for one of those. The drawing for one of two style profiles provided by Tanner, and those are each a $97 value. So you've also got to leave a review for Tanner's podcast, Masculine Style, which you can also find on iTunes. Now, once you've left those two reviews, send me a picture either on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. All of those can be found at OrderOfMan. Thanks again for being here today, men, and I will look forward to being with you here next week. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
