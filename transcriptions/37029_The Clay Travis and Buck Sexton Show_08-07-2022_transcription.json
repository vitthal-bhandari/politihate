    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Third hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show is here. We are almost at that point. We're getting our weekends started. So appreciate your rolling with us. And if somebody be listening on your own time during the weekend too. So it's one of the great things about that podcast on the I Heart app on demand whenever you want it. The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Highly recommend it. Also so fun to just take it and text it to a friend. Just do that little thing on the app where you can send it to somebody and say, Hey, these guys are pretty good. You should give them a shot to people that, you know, want to help save the country, for example. Sometimes we on the on the conservative side of things, we get a little bit. We get a little bit wrapped up for a moment and oh, wow, look, a celebrity said something that made sense, you know, a celebrity that maybe we weren't expecting to get political at all. Or perhaps it's just somebody who hadn't heard much about in a while. And you have this rumor, you go, Oh, I wonder how this will be handled. So just a few days ago, and by handled, I mean, by the lib media, by the, the Democrat apparatus. Macy Gray is a singer, recording artist. I, I, she was, she had like one year, am I, am I right in this one? Clay? She won like a bunch of Grammys. She had a really big year some years ago, maybe 10 years ago. Does that sound about right? Yeah, I was going to look her up. I mean, I know the name, but I was, I was similar to you and that I was like, I don't really remember why she became famous or when it was. But yes, she had a couple of songs that were super famous. She had a couple of big songs about a decade ago. For those of you like me who celebrate the movie Training Day, for which Denzel Washington actually received the best actor award that he should have gotten for some other movies, including Malcolm X. But Training Day is a great movie. Macy Gray actually makes a cameo in Training Day. And if you haven't seen that movie, you're just looking for a good watch. Have you guys all seen that one here in New York? Have you seen Training Day? Very, very good movie. Ethan Hawke, very good on it too. I got to give credit where to do anyway, Macy Gray's in that she was on a peers Morgan show. And she said something that had a lot of us go, Oh, this is going to be interesting play. Good for her. Sixteen. I would say this and everybody's going to hate me. But as a woman, just because you go change it, parts doesn't make you a woman. Right. Sorry. You feel that? I know that for a fact. Can I just what she said there is the most basic statement of fact imaginable. She is what she said is 100% true. It is as true as two plus two equals four. There can be no dispute. You will never find anybody who can credibly claim that the changing of the parts actually makes the parts what they would be for the other sex that actually can't they can't do that. They can try to make it somewhat similar in appearance, but they can't actually make that transformation to make somebody a woman who is in fact a man or a man who is in fact a woman and clan. No, we saw this. We got it. You know, oh, well, I thought to myself good for her, but my any time I see a quote like this, I actually sent this to my wife because my wife is super fired up over the idea that you could decide to become a woman and that makes you a woman. So like, no, that's like, and this is why I always say like, Hey, you can't be transracial, right? If you, if, but if you decided tomorrow or I decided tomorrow, Hey, you know what I want to be, I'm going to be an Asian man from now on because I feel like even though I'm a white guy, I'm actually Asian. I'm a, I've been trapped in a white body. I'm going to become an Asian man or a black man or a Hispanic man. It would be super racist. It wouldn't be allowed. Transracialism. You'd actually make a whole lot more sense because we have people, for example, who self identify as that they will self identify as black and you'll find out that, well, they have a grandparent of four who are black. So there are actually multiple ethnicities that are coming, you know, you have, you have people who my own nephew is South Asian and Caucasian. So he is multiple ethnicities. He is not actually one. He's absolutely adorable, by the way. So great. He already knows all of his ABCs. He's counting to 10. I will, I'm going to tell you this. This is like getting me. I got to have kids to play because this is getting me all excited. I walked in recently to see my visit. My little sister was amazing and her little nephew, he's 20 months old and he came and he's at that age where he's just running in circles constantly. He's just running everywhere and he runs all the way up and he just looks and he goes, fuck. And I was like, yes, send my name. I was very excited. Anyway, okay, everyone doesn't need to hear this all across America, but I was very excited. Point being, let's take this back to the basic gray situation. We all have way more in common as to your point. Like if you had to choose right now, do you have more in common with someone who is also a man, even if they are a different race or do you have more in common with someone of a different gender? I think men and women have far more in common with their own sex than they do with their own. Yes. They're sorry. You can be, you can be a person and many of them. I mean, we all are actually when you really get down to it, right? I mean, you know, just to ask Elizabeth Warren, but we all are the product of many different ethnicities actually. And so identification along racial lines, that is a much more mutable characteristic in this sense that you can have more, you can actually be a man and a woman at the same time. You can be have a Black father and a white mother or an Asian father and, you know, et cetera, et cetera, all the way down, all the way down the line. And many of us do. So you're right though, that's because of the political implications of say, of the racial, what the Supreme Court calls the racial entitlement state in this country and racial identification. Okay, but back to basically actually offensive, right? If you change your race, whereas it's brave, if you change your gender. And that's why I when you, a minute when you said, what did you think? I said, she's 100% right, but I didn't want to praise her because I said, I wonder how quickly she's going to backtrack. So you know, we have the same thing. You're saying, yeah, this amazing. She spoke the truth. My first thought was, Oh, they're about to JK Rowling her. Oh, here it comes. You know, they're about to the left. Well, the thing is she said she knew she was going to get criticized. So it's not like she walked into the statement blind. I know. And now this is where we have to go. You know, wamp, wamp gets a little sad. Macy Gray, what about 48 hours later after her recitation of the most basic and straightforward fact? Here is Macy Gray saying, I am super, super, super sorry. I said some things that didn't go over well, but my intention was never to hurt anybody. I feel bad that I did hurt some people. And I think it's, you know, just about education is about conversation and us getting to a point where we understand each other. And that only happens with it. You know, I've learned a lot through this. So I think that that was one of the reasons it might have happened is it was a huge learning experience for me. And I just have a compassion for it. You know, what I think you can, like I said, and there you can call yourself what like you, you, whoever you believe you are. And then no one can dictate that for you or take that away. No, you're not actually whoever you believe you are. And I'm not Spiderman. It's yeah. I mean, I could, I could walk around saying I'm Batman and it doesn't make it true. And you know, just this Ben Vanney beg forgiveness from the woke mob thing. It's so both tiresome and also so pathetic. And when are people going to realize that we should not live in a country where the statement of basic fact results in groveling apology? Also, I just am so disgusted at the idea that you have to apologize. I understand if somebody has to apologize because otherwise they're going to lose a job and they can't pay their mortgage or they can't take care of their family. I understand when people have to make apologies because economically they have another option. If you are fortunate enough to be wealthy as I would think that Macy Gray certainly has to be, why do you care if people are mad at some of your opinions? Like I just fundamentally reject the idea. I just don't care. And maybe there's a lot of a lot of very rich, very influential and famous people, as you know, Clay are also deeply insecure, which is a surprise to a lot of folks who haven't spent time around people who, you know, were in that in that milieu, I shall use to say, but even it's true, even in media, it's true in Hollywood. You get people that are deeply insecure. And the thing that they actually crave because they have money, they have prominence more than anything else is the acceptance of their peer group. And that's why it says, Oh my gosh, you know, the other, the other fancy music or Hollywood or, you know, news media people, they're mad at me. So now I have to grovel. My wife says to the extent that I have a talent, it's that I legitimately don't care. And some people say that, but I'm the kind of person who if 10 people tell me I'm awful, but one person is like, Hey, you're pretty cool. I remember the one positive. And most people remember the one negative. But to me, this is what discussed me on so many levels about these false apologies. If you have, and many people out there do buck, f you money, I think this is a quote from the, from the great show before it lost its mind billions. What's the point of having f you money? If every now and then you don't say f is in it. So interesting that you quote that show that's also went off the unwatchably because it really just became a show about a gender neutral transgender 22 year old finance genius who everyone had to refer to as they that became a central conceit of the show. And you're just watching this like, like, no, what is this? Like, why am I being subjected to such politics in this way in this show? It just became unwatchable. So right. So they have a lot of money. They have what you call, you know, believe money. And I just say again, I mean, I feel the same way about people who had to get the COVID shot. I understand if you had to get the COVID shot because you had to keep your job. You had to make your mortgage payments and everything else. There are a lot of people who don't have financial considerations at play. And to me, Buck, those are the people who need to stand up for the people who aren't fortunate enough. They don't have the privilege to be able to say, no, this is wrong. So when I see Macy Gray, she went on Peter's Morgan show and said, I know I'm going to get criticized for this. And then totally changed her tune by the time she went on the today show. Why? I agree with her. You can't just decide that you're going to change your gender and that everybody else that makes you a new gender. That's not possible. That's biologically not real. You can basically decide that you want to identify in that way. If you're an adult, I think that you're right. But I certainly don't think that you can change your biology. In fact, Buck, I don't know if you can see this. The shirt that I'm wearing right now that we are now selling on outkick just says simply biology is real. And we have ended up in such a crazy place where these transgender activists now say sometimes doctors get it wrong when a baby is born. That's their argument. This is fascinating. By the way, there was a a sub stack that has been making the rounds. Some I've seen some people on the right. I'd I'd had tipped them, but I forget who was retweeting it earlier today. A sub stack with this headline. When a quarter of the class identifies as brands. And this is let me just read to you folks a little bit of this. A quarter of the girls in my daughter's class identify as transgender seven out of 28. When I said that on Twitter recently, I was attacked for being a turf, which is a trans exclusionary radical feminist. I've learned this term. It makes up ridiculous stories to harm trans people. While I may be a turf, she writes, I did not make this up. A quarter of the girls in my kids class identify as boys. One of them has had four names this year, all from an anime series. So this this all of these kids, they're like 12, I think I gotta I gotta check this. It's parents with inconvenient truths about trans teens is this sub stack. And it goes on to talk about it's interesting. Actually, I'm not even seeing a the author's name here, maybe probably because scared to actually put this stuff right this stuff down. But I know about this from other people, where they're telling me the 10 15 20% of their child's eighth, you know, eight year old or 10 year old class in school, are all identifying as trans. And all want different names and things and they just come up with a new name and a new pronoun that everyone's supposed to. And the teachers are all encouraging this and parents find out about it and say, what's going on? It's like, hold on a second parents. Do you want us to call child services on you? This is the this is the America we're living in now, folks. I know people don't want to believe this, but this is happening. Well, and it's also an indication of how sort of this thing spreads and becomes popular, right? I mean, if you're talking about 28 kids in a classroom, like this author did, and 25% of them are identifying as transgender, this is absolutely crazy. And the pushback on this is when we're starting to see it take over in the world of sports and become more and more common, there's a difference between saying, Hey, you have decided that you're going to make a life choice and then allowing that life choice to implicate everybody else who is, let's say trying to compete in women's sports and suddenly has a six foot four swimmer who used to be a male college swimmer, kicking all the women's asses biology is real. And I think we just have to keep hammering home on this because we're getting to absurd categories. Look, Buck is saving a ton. My kids are on this same wireless plan, and we are saving a bunch. You can do the same. You can leave Verizon, AT&T or T mobile, keep your same phone, keep your same phone number and save a bundle, pay $30 a month for unlimited talk text and the data levels you need instead of sometimes $100 or more that you are paying for same 5G service. Pure Talk is easy to switch to and you'll get a free month right now if you make the switch. How do you do it from your cell phones right now? Grab them in your hand. Everybody trying to save money as the inflation rate is through the roof. Dial pound 250 from your cell phone. Say, Clay and Buck again with pure talks, no risk money back guarantee. You won't regret it. Dial pound 250. Say, Clay and Buck, boom, you sign up. It's an easy transition. Same phone, same phone number. You'll get a month free. Pure Talk is simply smarter wireless. Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton show. We were talking about Macy Gray initially saying, Hey, women are women and then saying, Hey, be whatever you want to be to apologize. Sonya from Austin, Texas calling in. What did you think of that whole interplay? I think she was I lost all respect for her just because of this comment. I'm usually very quiet, but this I can just no longer stand. If you're going to stand up for women's rights, then actually stand up for women's rights. Don't backtrack just because of social media. I don't care what social media says. If you have to access on your in your chromosomes, you're a woman. If you're the X, Y, you are not a woman. This is this crazy, you're in Austin, Texas, where we're number one now in the market. We appreciate this. Sonya, I don't know how old you are, but you sound like you might be how old are you, Sonya? So I am 39. All right. So you're 39. Would you have ever believed that you would call into a radio show and say, Hey, if you have double X chromosomes, you're a woman. If you have an X and a Y, you're a man that you would ever have to make that argument? No, I never thought that. But now I'm so, you know, I'm just so disappointed with this whole thing. Women, we've been sitting here trying to get equal rights all of this time, and they are sending us back. Not that I have anything to do with anyone's discretion. Don't get me wrong. I respect everyone equally, but I also say, listen, if you are born a woman, you're the only people that should be competing against each other. If you are not a woman, you are you can participate, but not compete for all for all of our scholarships, all of our things that we work. We totally totally agree with you. Thank you so much for calling it from Austin, Texas. And once again, our audience, the most sane, reasonable, and compassionate people. We're going to be down in Austin, where we're number one buck for that Alabama, Texas game.

If it's outside of a restaurant, if it's peaceful, for sure. Really? Peaceful protest. Where's you? Your first question to me was intimidation. Justice is because violence. And violence. Protesters do not agree with an opinion that they signed on to, had no right to privacy is what you're saying. But Peter, this is, this is, people have the right, this is what a democracy is. People have the right. Of course, people have a right to privacy, but people also have a right to be able to protest peacefully peacefully. It's the intimidation and the violence that we conduct. Yes, that's right. That's the White House press secretary. When asked about intimidation of a Supreme Court justice by an angry mob of lunatic Biden voters chasing, effectively, the Supreme Court justice out the back door of a restaurant because of the possibility of a full on confrontation. She, the White House press secretary wants you to know, yeah, you know, that's just democracy. This is what Democrats believe. Even apparently when there are federal laws on the books to prevent, say, mobs from outside of Supreme Court justice's homes, those laws don't count. Meanwhile, if you take a photo of yourself inside the Capitol building at the wrong time, you could be held in solitary confinement for what over a year could be treated like an al-Qaeda terrorist. We have not forgotten here about the January 6 defendants and the right they have to be treated fairly under the Constitution and not to be the tools of a politicized Biden DOJ. Julie Kelly is with us now. She's a senior contributor to American Greatness and author of January 6, how Democrats use the Capitol protest to launch a war on terror against the political riot. Julie, thanks for joining us again. Hey guys, thank you for having me on. Happy Friday. Happy Friday. You tell us, Julie, what is the status right now? We don't hear much about January 6 defendants or how many are left are some still in solitary? What have some of the sentences been like and what are we expecting? Well, thank you so much for continuing to bring attention to this because it is completely almost completely forgotten by Republican leadership with a few exceptions in Washington. About 850 Americans have been arrested so far and what is the DOJ calls the Capitol breach probe. They are arresting new people every week. Here we are more than 18 months later. Roughly 80 men are being held in pre-trial detention orders. That means that the Justice Department is asking federal judges on the DC District Court to deny these people relief based on the fact, as you just said, comparing them to 9-11 terrorists. Many of them have been held for more than a year as the same DOJ delays their trials into later this year. In one situation, the Proud Boys, this alleged militia group, accused of no violence, by the way, on January 6, no violent crime, no violent charges. Some of these men have been held since February and March of 2021. Their trial just got moved to December, the end of December of this year. That means these men will be held almost two years, not convicted of any crime. None of them has a criminal record. Held in jail awaiting trial simply due to their involvement in protesting Joe Biden's election on January 6. Julie, what's wild about this and thanks for coming on again is some of these people are going to face less severe punishment potentially than what they've already been serving in time in prison, right? Or jail just to kind of contextualize this. Very few, you'd know this better than me, very few of the January 6 defendants are getting more than a year in prison. In fact, the vast majority are getting far less. Some of these guys, as you just said, 80 of them, some of these guys, some of those 80 are going to be in prison for almost two years before they ever go on trial. I mean, this is this is pretty crazy stuff. It's insane. It's unconstitutional. It's inhumane. These prosecutors and this DC US Attorney Matthew Graves, who is the one driving this train, a Biden campaign advisor, his wife is a far left radical activist, a women's activist in Washington, DC. They have open and public in touch, not just for Trump, but for his voters. And so you have political prisoners here in the United States. You have Biden's DOJ punishing, prosecuting and imprisoning people who protested his election. This is like the Nana Republic type stuff. And what's even more upsetting is these DC judges, Trump appointees, believe it or not, down to Reagan appointed judges who are still on the court, who are going along with this travesty and holding these men, denying them bail, denying their release, denying motions to move trials out of Washington, DC, because there is no way for these men, any of these defendants, to get a fair trial before a jury. We've already had six or seven jury trials, all guilty verdicts on every single count in record time. One juror joked in a trial in one trial, it took us longer to order lunch than it did to sign this particular man guilty. They're chopping at the bit to throw the book at these January 6 protesters and throw them in jail. So it's really a travesty. And you know, there's just there's no really legal way out for almost all of these defendants, which is why so many are pleading guilty, taking prison time and trying to get get it over with and get on with their lives that have been almost destroyed. Speaking of Julie Kelly, author of January 6, how Democrats use the Capitol protest to launch a war on terror against the political right. Tell me more about this. The concept of the war on terror against the political right. I mean, I think that this is something that people need to be mindful of because the Democrat media treats all of this stuff like it's so normal. Meanwhile, there was a what a Trump, a Trump administration lawyer who they just leaked the footage, I think, of him in his underwear during a raid. Early morning raid. Early morning raid. They pull this guy out of his home and his underwear, all having to do with, you know, the insurrection and the election and all this other stuff, speaking about third world dictator style tactics. I mean, this is madness, Julie. It's madness. Not only that Jeffrey Clark, who is the man who subjected to the raid on his home early morning. This was last month. They searched his house for three and a half hours. They didn't arrest him. He's still now almost a month later faces no criminal charges, but yet someone probably in the fads, DOJ, not the local Fairfax County Police Department, apparently was captured on the officer's body cam body camera, leaked it to CNN so they could plaster it on the social media and try to humiliate Jeffrey Clark, a DOJ attorney who did nothing more than write a letter, a draft letter asking Georgia to take a look at its election irregularities, the 2020 election. He didn't kill anyone. He didn't kidnap anyone. He didn't rob a bank. He wrote a letter and they're destroying this man's life. He's got four children. They're humiliating him, bankrupting him simply because he was part of trying to uncover what happened in that election. This has been happening to hundreds of Americans. For now, 18 months, these are horrific stories of what this FBI and DOJ are doing to people. Now, threatening some with life in prison, if they don't accept plea deals, threatening life in prison for this delicious conspiracy charge, a rare charge no Americans ever been convicted of. But nonetheless, you've got 20 or some January six protesters who face this charge, the DOJ compares to treason and saying they will ask for life sentences if a DC jury can fix them on that charge. Julie, I donated money to help these guys have defense attorneys because a lot of them don't have very good legal representation. If you're part of our audience and you're out there listening right now and you think it's not American, regardless of your politics, to have 80 people behind bars like this for this long without being able to stay in trial, what would you tell people they could do to help? Thanks for asking. So the fund is called Patriot Freedom Project. PatriotFreedomProject.com. This was started by the adaptive aunt of one of the detainees. There was no legal resources available to any of these people and to the extent that lawyers were available, they wouldn't touch these cases. So now we're getting a little bit, she's getting a little bit more attention raising money. This goes to help retain lawyers and also help these desperate families who are being bankrupted. People have been fired from their jobs simply for being charged with misdemeanors like parading in the Capitol. These people are pariahs in their community, to their families. It's really heartbreaking to hear some of how what's happened to some of these people. Julie, I just have one more for you. Republican leadership. I mean, if you don't want to shame those who are being cowards, maybe at least name those who do care about this issue. I mean, if we believe in the constitution and due process and equal justice under the law, clearly that's not happening here for these individuals, right? There's a difference between saying that what they did is all fine and saying, well, they deserve to be treated fairly and have the rights respected and misdemeanors shouldn't get you locked up in solitary for heaven's sake. Which Republican leaders, who among Republican leadership is on this? Well, I'm not even going to bother with the Senate. We've heard a few things here and there from Senator Cruz and Senator Cotton and a few, but nothing really about these detainees. House Republicans, there are hands full, luckily, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louie Gomer, Andy Biggs, Matt Gaetz. They've actually visited the D.C. Gluag, I call it the jail. It's holding at least four dozen of these men, languishing in mostly solitary confinement conditions being abused by prison guards. So that's it. Where's our Republican leadership talking about this? Why are they not in front of this jail or in front of DOJ every single week, screaming from the rafters, threatening to cut off funding to this DOJ, this FBI, this DCUS Attorney's Office? Where is Kevin McCarthy? Where's Elise Stefanik? Where's Steve Schulief? Where are heads of committees that oversee this department? The silence is deafening and I'll tell you what, the base is very aware of this and they are not going to let Republican leaders just wash their hands of this if they take control of Congress. There was an article in Axios that said the base wants blood and that is for sure, because the base understands what's happening and they want retaliation and they want to expose what happened on January 6th and they want justice for these people who have had their lives destroyed at the hands of the Biden, Garland, Matthew Graves, DOJ. Julie, we appreciate you coming on with us, sharing this story. I'd encourage you guys out there to join me in donating money to help these guys get the legal defense they deserve. Can you give us that website one more time? And thank you so much for that donation, PatriotFreedomProject.com. PatriotFreedomProject.com. Thanks, Julie. I want to tell you guys, look, Michael Endell is willing to stand up in the face of a lot of outrage. We're just talking about how quickly Macy Gray turned and ran as soon as she started getting any criticism at all for her political beliefs, even though the vast majority of you agree with what Macy Gray said in the first place where Michael Endell stands behind his own political beliefs.

Because she says she can listen to the whole show in like the basically the time that she drives to and from work. And I don't know what that total distance is but like an hour. And yeah, 2.0 speed.

And we're going to have a romantic evening. I'm not making this up. We are finishing stranger things season four episode nine. We've got one episode left tonight. So that's going to be the wild activity for the birthday birthday girl little Italian food and stranger things for. Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. It's going to be a great food relaxing. Good show. I have a new show for you. Yeah, what is that? Not not for the kids. So you got to have the kids cannot be in the room for this one. But the boys on Amazon, have you seen this? No, I don't know anything about it. Oh man, it's a very now they're clear. I want to be there are clear anti right wing, some anti right wing themes, more anti Hollywood and famous people memes or themes, not memes. It is super. I can't really explain. Like it's violent but at a level that is a cartoonish almost in some places. I don't I've never even heard this. Very well done. Have you guys heard of the boys on Amazon? It's on Amazon prime. It's very good. It's about imagine if superheroes were actually all like Hunter Biden basically in their private lives. Oh, interesting. Imagine if Superman was actually like a crack addict who you know was impregnating strippers. Yeah, like that's kind of the and they work for a corporation almost like Disney. But they are actually these horrible people and they're trying to control them. It's actually it's very entertaining I find for it is. So I'm just throwing that out because you won't watch my Piki blinders. I tell I'm going to I'm going to get to it. I was just saying we finished Stranger Things. We're now home for a while. We've been on the road a lot. And so Laura has not watched Piki blinders either. But she is similarly heard its phenomenon. That's a better show planning on starting. I'm just going to Piki blinders should be higher in your queue. But I keep talking about this one and you know, I'm wearing myself out of this. We're going to start it. This has been an agreed upon. And the challenge is, and I'm sure a lot of people out there understand this, when you already started to show you want to keep up to date on it, but then when you dive in, there's like five seasons of Piki blinders right now actually six seasons. So we're talking about like 60 hours of commitment here to diving. It's going to fly by. You're going to come on the show in a few weeks to be like, Hello, the Piki blinders. I can't do accents. It'll be my accent guy. Yeah, I'm like, I can barely pronounce anybody's name. Correct. It's so it's such a good show. Very dark, but very good for what it is. You'll enjoy that one. I've actually, Carrie's got me watching the time traveler's wife, just so you know. So I'm man, you're basically engaged and married already. I mean, I'm really putting in the work. I didn't even know men watched the time traveler's life. I don't feel like a man while I'm watching it. I can tell you that. Are you serious sometimes? I sit there and just like, Oh, it's all so romantic. I I've not watched any of this. Don't let lars not going to make you do that. But you know, when you're still in the get when you're trying to get the ring on its face, you know, sometimes you got to watch the show. So there you go. Everybody have fantastic weekends. We love you. We appreciate you. And we'll be back with you on Monday."
