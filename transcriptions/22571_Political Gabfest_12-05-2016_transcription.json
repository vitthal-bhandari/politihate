Hello and welcome to the Slate Political Gavfest from May 12, 2016. Goofy, Elizabeth, for an edition of The Gavfest. I'm David Plots of Atlas Obscura, joining me here in our DC studio is John Dickerson of Face The Nation. Howdy, John. Hello, David. And down the line is Emily Baslan of The New York Times, who's in probably New Haven today. Hi, Emily. Hi. On this week's Gavfest, will Donald Trump tone it down enough for the Republican establishment to make it nice with him and all get along and coast to victory in November? Or will Elizabeth Warren and Paul Ryan prove his nemesis? We'll find out. Then is Facebook manipulating its algorithm to downplay pro-conservative stories? Then we will talk about the next round in the fight over North Carolina is just simply awful. Anti-LGBT law. We will have cocktail chatter. There's going to be a special announcement in cocktail chatter. You've got to wait for it. You've got to hold tight for that from John Dickerson. And in Slate Plus, we will try to make sense of the Ben Rhodes profile kerfuffle. If you are not yet a Slate Plus member, you can get up by going to Slate.com slash gavfestplus. I hope all the people who have been involved in the Ben Rhodes kerfuffle then join Slate Plus. Because then Slate Plus membership would probably soar to hundreds of thousands of new members if they all joined up. And some excellent journalists would be among them. An excellent journalist would now be Slate Plus members of the party. Probably RDR, Slate Plus members. Don't forget we have a live show coming up in Washington on July 13th at the Warner Theatre. It's going to be great. It's at 7 p.m. Slate.com slash live to get tickets. Please come. I think it's probably our last DC show before the election. So it's going to be a chance to get your yayas out and hear all questions at John and Emily. As we tape on Thursday morning, Donald Trump and Paul Ryan are preparing to meet and make some kind of peace. The House Speaker made headlines by announcing last week, late last week, that he was not ready to endorse Trump. Trump responded with his characteristic Pope Francis-like beneficence and quietude. He threatened Ryan. He has emphasized again and again that his success has come from being outside the party and from being a bomb thrower. And he's going to continue that. Meanwhile, Trump has also been engaging in a Twitter flame war with Elizabeth Warren, which has raised some Democrats' hopes that she's going to be Hillary Clinton's running mate. So Emily, is there any possibility that over the long term, but before the election, that Trump and the Republican establishment will not have reproachball? Isn't there have to be some face-saving measure for everybody and they'll sort of move forward? I think there has to be. And Paul Ryan's already making all those noises, right? And in fact, the really cynical part of me wonders if this is all just like- Isn't that all of you? Isn't that all? Like, that's like 83% of you? No. I guess not. No, actually that's you, not me. Sorry. There's a way in which though this is like such a great media narrative, right? Because there- I mean, it's like watching a, you know, bromain. People don't answer a love affair where they start out far apart and are they going to reconcile more all like paying attention to this meeting today and we have another week in which Donald Trump dominates media coverage. And we're not talking about any real issues, we're just talking about people's relationships to each other. I think there's a lot going on here. So in the way that Trump is dealing with Ryan, it's a template or it's the first test of how he's going to deal in Washington. This is what the outcome is. A lot of it show he's captured a lot of the coverage during this week and I think all of us have to think about how we're gonna go forward and and I haven't figured it out yet, but what the theory of covering Trump is because In the last election cycle we tried hard to not cover whatever the shiny object of the moment was because we knew it was Both evanescent and also because we knew that it didn't have anything to do with the really issues that should be in conversation We now have that problem times like a thousand Now having said that what's the game here? I think you've got it probably pretty right, which is that Donald Trump takes the maximalist position and then If he and Ryan come to some kind of unity whatever the heck that means then people will say wow, you know He can do it. He can do this thing that we worried that he wasn't able to do which is how could he build a bridge between his bombastic Kind of go it alone campaign and the power structure in Washington Um, but what john, I want to push on you for a second. Why is that a game? I actually don't think it's a game at all. I think that there's a really profound philosophical question about whether Donald Trump, yes, whether the Republican party is willing to reconcile it. That's right. That's right. I was going next so Regardless of whether they come out and say they're unified today or there's some future unifying moment later neither one of them will be Legitimate because on the signature issues of the day on both the way Paul Ryan looks at the world thinks the world should work And thinks politicians should behave and then on the specific issues of immigration entitlements taxes trade he is on the exact opposite end of the issue spectrum from Donald Trump there's no amount of meetings you can have To bridge those differences unless Donald Trump comes out and says everything I said in the Campaign all the things that got those people riled up so much at the rallies was all totally wrong I've completely switched if if one of the other reconciles let's say the Republican party essentially The Republican party establishment has embodied by ryan and mcconnell and these various people who are snuffling around trump If they say oh, yes, we support him and we you know, we think he's really energizing the party and yes We we're gonna carry him forward doesn't that reflect a cynicism and abandonment of republican principles? That the party will pay for in the long term or not. I don't know it depends So let's imagine they do that for the short term to just do away with what is ryan's getting there are two camps of response to ryan from his based on the conversations i've had based on his members And that's the other thing paul ryan is not an island to himself He's got to worry about This agenda that he was working on that he thought he'd have a little more time to work on before there was a republican nominee Which he still wants to save he was hoping to have a house republican agenda that they could push On their own Your respective of who the candidate is the problem is the agenda they were working on is totally The the opposite of what the candidate is running on so that's one problem, but the challenge for ryan is Okay, let's say for a moment. I have to do the political thing which is to get to appear unified They can make that bet now, but He's then gonna have to actually work with the president and actually have to get um, you know It's gonna come apart any minute you can say that you're unified but until you actually and because paul ryan Is different than john bainer when bainer ran on a platform to get his house members reelected he was gauzy and fuzzy and ryan has for his career and more recently been saying only unless we are very specific about what we're running on Can we build a mandate and then govern you may not agree with that idea of governing but that's his idea So he can't suddenly get super vague about policy Um, but can he say we're a big temp party. I'm not the presidential nominee like and just sort of ease off Like melt into the background a little bit. I mean sure if he wants to be totally and effectual, but the If you i'm sure that's I mean if he wants to just hand over his you know I if in conversations that i've had with him and in people who know him He does care about these ideas. He does want that to see them implemented So I think what you just described would mean basically saying I'm just gonna like basically blow all that off and Just that he would do that till november and then he would secretly hope that trump loozes and that will only Reaffirm his own ascendancy and then he'll start planning to become the nominee in 2020 This would be You know like putting on an itchy sweater for six months Right his his feeling is You campaign on specifics in the election and then once you've won By the election then you get to implement the stuff you've done So he's giving up what for him is an important sales moment, which is the campaign Right And so I just think that right and I'll especially Especially since presumably trump is going to lose if the republican establishment Somehow manages to find a way to distance itself from trump I think that once trump loses the republican party will not have suffered any great Loss that the trump will be forgotten. He'll be he'll be footnoted I think they will immediately immediately they will turn to they'll immediately turn to just taking on hilly clinton and slammy hilly clinton and the base will Get excited again. Oh, but I think it will be a forgotten moment. I think it's the base I think if the people who are supporting trump like the noises you guys are making We're trying John's making whimpering noises and Emily you're speaking Go ahead. I'm still trying to talk I think if the people who are supporting donald trump who are not necessarily tried and true republican voters feel like the republican Establishment distance themselves and made him lose And they'll be looking for people to blame then they could have more lasting Ramifications and cause more lasting damage to the republicans and to paul ryan specifically like if he is seen as a weak need And the person who hand-waved while donald trump lost They'll be this like lost cause feeling about the election that right you were never with us You undermined us and all the and and for the group of people who are Already in a position by the way the trump candidacy and the republican party was founded on disappointment with the elites So they are ready to believe and already do believe that that ryan and romney and all these people are Trying to undermine trump well ryan and romney and and the republican establishment can choose They can choose to capitulate and then and give in and become a white nationalist party with mercantilist grotesque trade views and uh surrender the party or they can or they can choose to say we're we're we are a Party that represents certain really generally pretty terrible ideas Alternately terrible ideas in the world, but those are the ideas that we actually believe I don't think they can actually don't think there is a there's a cogent republican party which reconciles both of these views So my view my own Taste would be well Republicans should like pick pick their horse and stay with it and have a belief system that makes sense because there's no They can't govern this way. I think that's right. The other alternative is that donald trump just cast aside all the stuff he was saying. I don't it doesn't look like he's going to do that either temper mentally or Policy wise so before we get to elizabeth warren. I want to talk briefly about a really interesting story by tom edson New York times this week about the difference between how trump polls when it's a real person taking the poll and when it's a computer or an electronic poll And it turns out that he pulls much better When it is when you're not speaking to a real person and the theory that edson lays out is of course that people are embarrassed To admit it. They just don't want to say to another person that they support this divisive Prejudicial horrible candidate yet they'll go out and vote and they actually do support it It got me thinking about something which is i'm going to try to express it As clearly as I can trump is really good at getting people's fear He attaches himself to people's fear Reflexes fear instincts and he's very good at it and all of us every one of us has kind of darkness and horror and anger in our souls And for the most part civilization is the act of suppressing that and putting on a smile and like being kind to others Even despite all the darkness that we have And that I feel that what trump has done is sort of validated the speaking The utterance of all that dumb shit stuff that people want to have in their soul But actually the purpose of civilization in fact the purpose of politics is kind of to suppress that You you can sort of say oh, this is our essential being of course we should speak it This is how what we feel but some feelings actually shouldn't be expressed Some feelings shouldn't be released from the cage that you hold them in and I worry that trump has has justified has allowed A kind of the hatefulness that's in all of us to feel validated to see the light and walk and walk in daylight And that worries the hell out of me Do you think then that two things one That people need a Hot stove moment in order to be reminded of why we have some of the Conventions we have in norms that we have yeah as long as you lose this as long as it's stove gets turned off Yeah, but then the question is does that do people get the message? Yeah, and then the second thing is people What you described david as the the things that are suppressed for the common good there are whole host of people out there who believe those sets of norms are not to suppress the id and Base instincts within us but to basically they are a tool for people who've just figured out how to use those norms to feed their basis instinct which are their greed and their nest feathering and so When you see those norms instead of thinking oh, right? That's what keeps us from being savages The response is no, that's what's getting that guy whatever he wants and it's screwing me And it's not wrong no right right in there. Not that's the other side of this this Ross doubt that I thought wrote a good calm about this over the weekend that you can reject Donald trump because in his like florid Odiousness, but then there is this as you were saying earlier david this way in which he's tapping Straight into people's anxieties and those are real anxieties that the political system should be grappling with much more than it is And this is where I always feel like there's this um, you know right meets the left with the burning center supporters For sure for sure, but it's uh, well for one thing. I'm I'm not a true democrat I'm a republican and in the old time time sense Which is that I actually do believe that there's a that we we need uh the sauce or if t you need you need actually need to cool The passions of the people that it's very terrible to have the populism is the worst Possible form of government because it because we are so all of us are so filled with anger and rage all the time And if you can animate it and activate it becomes really dangerous And that's why you need these intermediaries and trump is threatening to sort of strip that out of the system You you guys are both right. It's not that they the resentments people feel don't have some Justifiable basis and it's not that there aren't horrible people exploiting it and taking advantage of it for their greed It's just that the populist solution and the rageful solution is has so much downside We're gonna regret it if we go there There was some of this talk during the obama ascendancy in 2008, which is that when you elect somebody based just on this kind of Hero worship that was going on behind Obama that was supposed to be the warning along the lines of just what you're saying Which is that you're not thinking that no, but that you elect somebody based on all the wrong feelings There's some of that in some of the never trump caution But it's almost like it's a talking point that people who dislike trump for other reasons Are using let's quickly touch on elizabeth warren so she and dalton trump have been going at it on twitter At real dalton trump your policies are dangerous your words are reckless your record is embarrassing and your free ride is over And then he's countering with goofy elizabeth warren and tweaking her about her supposed native american heritage Classic bully behavior. I think so emily. This is raised prospects of a raised talk that that warren would be a great Running mate for clinton because she's so such a tough fighter and because She channels some of the sanders wing of the party and that would fold them in with hillary clinton What do you make of that talk? Well, i'm embarrassed by my own initial reaction which i'll share even though i probably shouldn't which was to be like No, the country can't handle a ticket with two women. That's way too much and then I thought oh my god I can't believe i'm Feeling that way and why does that have to be true and there are all these good Potential arguments that warren could actually help hillary clinton with younger women with single women with Groups of female voters who are not necessarily Clear clinton supporters and clinton's going to need a lot of women and that obviously plays into trump's Bad reviews among female voters and I started getting kind of into this idea Although it seems it does seem implausible to me it doesn't seem to me like Hillary would necessarily go for a warren and the whole question of whether warren would upstage clinton I think would be a real concern for the clinton campaign and then there's a problem of like losing a senate seat since Massachusetts has a republican governor who would appoint her a placement I just don't see the rationale for the Elizabeth Warren candidacy on any level both because she's her own Person and she would have to Sublimate herself as vice president even more than other vice presidents have um hillary clinton doesn't need her in the tent to be effective in doing what she's doing with donald trump right now She's kind of more useful arguably is like a right outside that's exactly right. They're not particularly close It's not a there's not a kind of state. That's a very good point Do you think there's any chance that hillary would pick a woman to Emily's point or that he Then I couldn't think of a single white guy. I have to say and they're and like they're I mean I don't know it didn't seem like there was a really good other option I mean what is the biggest target that hillary clinton would try to hit by with her vice presidential nominee? I mean picking vice presidents for geographical reasons doesn't help So what do you think latino voters male white male voters? Do you pick it by the voting group? Do you pick it by the? You know what what's just what's that criteria that'll be? Fascinating to watch Okay, let's leave leave donald trump there and hillary clinton there Now word from our first sponsor this week, which is castor Life is exhausting so you shouldn't just settle for an okay night sleep get a fantastic night sleep with castor Casper is an obsessively engineered American made mattress at a shockingly fair price It combines springy latex and supportive memory foams to create an award-winning sleep surface With just the right sink and just the right bounce Time magazine named it one of the best inventions of 2015 in fact, it's now the most awarded mattress of the decade And you can try castor for 100 nights risk-free in your own home There's free shipping and returns in the us in canada if you don't love it.

It's it's refusal to be transparent about how it operates so Briefly, what is what is this trendy topics and why is it important? If you're signed onto facebook and the right corner or on the right side There's a list of trending news topics that people click on because there are stories there and people are using facebook as they are Conduit into the news and so what is up top on those lists both in terms of the subject matters and the particular outlets that Are being linked to matters a great deal for traffic and it matters for the new stories people see and they're individually curated So it can change depending on how the algorithm interacts with you. So there's like layers of potential Potential manipulation here and as far-had manji wrote a good calm about this today I thought like we don't even exactly know and it would be very I don't know how I'm going to figure out what how facebook is Tweaking its algorithm for individually users because it is changing all the time and it's different depending on who you are as a facebook user What's the big deal john if like a thing which is a major source of news for lots of people You know it has some editorial bias and Assuming this is true and it's not even clear that it is true But why would that be a big deal because it has pretensions to be the opposite and it's a black box We have no idea what standards they're using and they don't say or explain executives at facebook have They're presenting themselves as a an alternative to All the strong with the the mainstream media. So if you're going to do that you have to your state It would it be better that facebook's algorithm and with the news that's showing to people is Infused with human intelligence based on the kind of biases and knowledge of the people they've hired Or that it's coldly algorithmic and that it's only the robots scouring News sources and even the validity of those newest sources is algorithmically rated and that there's no human intelligence Which is the better universe? I would probably rather live in the humanly curated universe But I don't care which universe it is. I just want to every I want there to be transparency about it So I think the problem right now is that the word algorithm and the way in which trending topics appears may could seem like it's you know straight from the popular gut and it feels like it's organic and not controlled and instead it turns out there is some Monking around with it going on and if we knew what the standards were for that shaping that would be fine Like we don't expect the you know home page of any news outlet to not be based on a set of human choices Of course news outlets choose which stories to promote and how to put headlines on them and who to link to and that's how it goes But there is no tradition of journalistic standards at facebook in fact as john said the company Usually acts like it has a lot of contempt for the media and so the notion that it's trying to have it both ways that I really find problematic news is one of 75 things that facebook does and is attempting to dominate the world with and It is not at all surprising to me that they would be making experiments and that these experiments That they are not fully documenting and publicizing exactly what these experiments are because they are private business and they don't have to Nor does the the new york times. I don't think New york is every editorial meeting at the new york times they send out a memo afterwards here's what we decided I mean structure that there are editorial meetings like you can read all about that at length If you go look at the ethical standards that we know what that process is and we don't know what the process is at facebook And I I feel like you're being the super dismissive sure it's not surprising that they're not doing this But this is affecting how lots of people take in the news I guess I don't see this as like some massive crime against the public or against journalism or even against conservatives Why is it so why is everyone been so damaged by it? Well, I think it's a boon holding hearings about well, that's that's a totally different thing is whether there's any role for the government and I'm not quite sure. What's the argument for why there should be investigations into it? Well, it's there's an argument against it, which is like this is a first amendment issue I don't think the government should be investigating it so but then the second thing I think is certainly for for conservatives They feel like this is of a piece This is just more proof that there is that what is presented as fair is actually Tilted to screw conservatives and that's they felt that about the mainstream media for a very long time And now this other thing that is replacing it in a lot of people's lives Because conservatives, you know, are in facebook and twitter in that world too And so they they feel like it's a neighborhood where they thought the rules were one thing and it turns out the rules are actually subtly against them And the public doesn't appreciate that. Right. They're gonna bug me too if I were them Here here. I think I've identified why I find this to be such a tempest in a teapot the the We live in an age immediate efflorescent age There is so much choice And yes facebook is is a disproportionate player in this and they certainly guide a lot of traffic But the idea that americans are sort of being deprived of massive news choice Because facebook has tweaked some one feature on one page for one website Seems to me so Missing the forest which is the the forest is that there is just an enormous variety and access to media Today that there wasn't 10 20 40 years ago for most americans That's the thing we should marvel at is that there's so much available to everybody at every Are you underestimating how many people get their news make their choices? Directly from facebook and based on the default settings in facebook I mean, I know people who that is like absolutely No, Emily, you know, we'll see what's there. They see what yeah, sure they see what's there But you know what there if they're if they're liberals they're getting you know Confirmatory liberal stories sent to them at all times if they're conservatives They're getting because their friends are sending them stuff and facebook's algorithm knows that I mean my my mother-in-law Who's constantly sending you know a barrage of sort of israel under attack stories like I'm sure everyone in her Universe is getting israel under attack stories and is like has the sense that israel is constantly under attack And that's because they're self-confirming bias because of their the facebook friend network they exist in and tomorrow could wave a magic wand and change the algorithm and those people would see different things and then the day after that facebook could decide that like Most of us should vote and push us all to vote or it could setly You know send some messages that pushes up to us to vote for democrats or for republicans That is a huge amount of power for a private company to have I mean, I sound like a kind of paranoid right now But I definitely sound like a real thing, but it's real Well, I'm not saying that facebook I'm not saying that facebook will act in in the public interest at all I don't think it will and I think you're right that it will manipulate the algorithm But I think there is there is just such an overwhelming A variety of media and ways to communicate that media to your friends Okay, so facebook is no longer sending you the stories about israel But you know what you can go on twitter and just put in a hashtag which is like you know Defenseless israel hashtag defenseless israel and god knows you're gonna get lots of stories about that They're gonna qualify Of course if you go out and know the people you follow on instagram Thesis and default settings and how when people just have their habits. Why are you liking nor no seriously? Don't get like squirting for me Why are you like if the elephant in the middle of the room? If the elephant in the middle of the room of media diet is this private company Which is making all these decisions and having an effect Why is that like not matter just because people could go around it if they chose when we know that a lot of them are not right Well because thank you Because Emily Yes, the trending topics is one small piece of it I would be more troubled if I would be more troubled if there was evidence that facebook What when you were sharing things with your friends and it noticed that you were sharing conservative stuff and it was saying Well, we don't like those conservatives so we're not let them share and they're gonna get down downgrading the algorithm if that were happening That's like it is happening. We have no idea what's happening. That's the point the company is a black box But it doesn't have an affiliation or allegiance to traditional journalistic standards in making these choices and we have no idea what i don't care You know what forget it. I don't even care if they'd want to do that They can do that too because they're a private company There's you know what there is there is like go if you were interested in those conservative stories Go to the daily collar go to drudge go to fox It's not like when there was one newspaper and and three networks and that was how it will live Right. That is not it is a different world. Right? That's all I think that's all true But if you are a person who assumed that facebook was feeding you essentially A kind of straight up the middle to the extent that's possible View of what was in the news that Day and then and then there's a question what should be in the news that day, which is another question Then you feel like you've been ripped off. So the only thing that makes me feel better here is that the guests Thank you. I will take the last word The only thing that is reassuring to me is the idea that people could Gain a better grasp of the way in which facebook is manipulating things and is not some Pure neutral algorithm so that maybe they will vote with their feet and go look for other kinds of media sources That would be a good outcome All right, now let's hear from our next sponsor this week, which is zippracruder Finding the right job candidates for your company is crucial The human capital of a of a company is the most important thing that a company has and having the right mix of people and the right kinds of talents working for you is is critical if you have a business And that means that posting in one place isn't enough to find the best employees for your team And that's where zippracruder comes in With zippracruder.com you can post your job to over 100 job sites including social media networks like facebook and twitter All with a single click you can find candidates in any city or industry nationwide Just post once and watch a qualified candidates roll into zippracruder's easy to use interface No juggling emails or calls to your office.

Pat mcgory willing to go in and maybe this is great politics for everyone. I can't quite decide but yeah, Emily beyond the bathroom though Yeah, the bathroom issue Isn't there a larger case around the whole law that the law is The law because law isn't just about the bathroom law is about the ability of towns and counties in north carolina to pass to have protections for lgbt people in general and sort of be able to make employment claims and things like that and that the law the overall law itself There's a claim that that's unconstitutional because it's it's infused with an animus towards and by animus. I mean or I guess legally we mean Specific sort of targeted prejudice against a particular group that is unacceptable, right? That's it which is that a whole separate line of thinking yes It's not just that the animus is unacceptable if indeed courts find that the law is motivated by animus and it sure looks like that to me It is unconstitutional based on a 1996 important supreme court decision called romer versus evans Which has a very similar set of facts. Um, I think we've maybe talked about this on the show before but same dynamic except in colorado of like overturning local ordinances that were protective of gay rights in the name of In the name of I don't know what in the name of like the state government decides it doesn't like those groups so john No one wants to be swacked as a bigot. No one wants to be told they're Dumb and behind the times in retrograde. This north carolina law has got to go. It's gonna go in one way or another What's the way for that law to go? And then still respect the feelings of people yeah and also allow people to save faith around it I don't know. I mean, I think it what's complicated is it it has to go in a legal way in other words. There's not a political uh, exit that I mean the political exit will have to kind of form around whatever the legal exit is Is there an off ramp emily that? That allows some Way for people who because this is as we've talked about before this is not about just public bathrooms It's about The sense of encroachment that people feel has taken place and they that they always feel is taking place I mean, this is encroachment of what exactly well encroachment of a set of values that they find Uh that make them uncomfortable is their a legal response that allows people who Don't like the progress of things or they're just gonna have to suck it up when it gets over You know when it gets overturned or or put aside I'm not really sure what the off ramp is Some of the quotes are just filled with hate and there's just no other way to put it They're so cruel and such a misunderstanding of transgender identity It just made me really sad to read them And so I don't know how you Find a way to not tell those people that like that's sorry But they're wrong and they are behind the times or at least like the government isn't going to countenance that kind of prejudice We've had other moments in history where we've said to people your racial prejudice your prejudice against women Whatever is just like not acceptable and we're not going to go along with it as a society We just obviously are we're still having this argument about gay marriage in some way though In other ways, it's subsided remarkably quickly at least in most of the country Now to hear from our next sponsor this week, which is trunk club Shopping takes forever No one has time for it.

I'll go first today I'm gonna go first and then Emily and then john how about that? So my chatter is the story about main governor paula page main governor paula page is just a font of Harbleness. He's a consistently says dumb quasi racist things He just is a bully. He's he's gonna end up in the trump cabinet prediction number one. He'd probably be trump's running mate but He did something this week that was so or last week that was it was really it was classic He adopted a jack russell terrier a rescue dog. He he adopted it from um The greater and risk agon humane society. That's very nice He named the dog veto Because he likes to veto legislation so much that it turned out that how he adopted the dog he'd adopted the dog By cutting the line at the humane society the dog had been put up for adoption. It was going to go up on wednesday Le page shows up there on tuesday and says i'd like your dog That you're putting up for adoption on wednesday And the humane society kind of said okay go ahead take take the dog Meanwhile the there's woman who've been planning for a really long time to adopt this dog. She heard about the dog She was gonna she was like gonna be there first thing six a.m on wednesday morning to adopt the dog and she was going to use it as a emotional support animal she was a victim of sexual assault and Just is heartbroken because this dog that she'd set her cap on with stolen by the governor just a it's just a perfect story of entitlement Emily what is your chatter? I am also um shaking my fist in my chatter. I'm really interested in a lawsuit against frontier airlines Brought by four female pilots who have not been given a way to use their breast pumps at work This is like just a serious Continuing problem and I feel like first of all breast pumps are just No fun breastfeeding great breast pumps horrible And you the last thing you need is to be stressing out during the day over where and how you're possibly gonna like go Do this on your own And if they're not alone this airline in not doing this and there have been some rotten court decisions in the other direction Not to mention that donald trump I will have to bring up once called a lawyer disgusting for requesting a break to pump milk And uh, and then the other thing about this that dismayed me is that Frontier airlines makes pregnant women take eight weeks of unpaid maternity leave before their due date Now it is true that people in their eighth and ninth months of pregnancy are not advised to fly But there's no way that these women can do any kind of paid assignments And that makes it really hard to take their unpaid maternity leave after they have babies The whole thing just puts me into a state of some despair over the over the state of pregnancy discrimination law and accommodation in this country and I really hope that these women win their suit John what's your chatter My chatter is a is the ultimate result of all the previous chatters So because the wonderful gamfest audience over the years has been so supportive and encouraging about all those historical shaggy dog stories that I've told I With Andy Bowers's help and the now the help of allegiance of wonderful people created whistle stop Which has been incredibly fun for me and the feedback has been wonderful So I decided to write a book about it And that book will be out on the second of august it will be a collection of Some of the whistle stop stories people have heard before but with a great deal More research from our crackerjack researcher brian rosenwald and an even bigger team of people working on it The chapters one of them is running in slate today on gold water in 1964 and the stop gold water movement since we're in a Never trump moment um, and then there will be new chapters as well with Stories that we haven't yet heard in the whistle stop podcast But the whistle stop podcast will continue on as it always does with new stories But now there will just be a book on august second which you can now go order One thing we could do is we might be have a book plate that people that I would send people with a signature and a lovely little note If they showed me proof of purchase, but if somebody out there has a better idea about um, what special offer we can make to Gabb Fest listeners send us a note at gabbfest at slate.com.

John is so wonderfully engaged and obsessed with this history It's really fun to listen to and it's been a blast to To write it's been It's uh, it's been it's been a lot of long hours between all this other stuff, but it is it's um It's really it's so much fun.
