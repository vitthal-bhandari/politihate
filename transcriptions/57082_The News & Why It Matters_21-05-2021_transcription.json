    "text": " Today, the greatest con man of all time, Dr. Fauci says the public is misinterpreting CDC guidance on mask mandates for unvaccinated people and a certain city's Department of Education features a drag queen for a show aimed at three to eight year olds aired on PBS of all places. We've got a lot coming up today and it starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Happy Friday. I can't believe it is finally Friday and we are joined by his maiden voyage on the show today. Taylor Hanson, investigative journalist, not to be confused with the musician Taylor Hanson, but you look nothing alike so you're good. I mean apparently we do according to everybody. Really? Apparently I am Taylor Hanson from Bop. I really don't understand that but hey I mean it's all right it's a good label. I'll take it for a while. Well we're genderfluid so why not just personally? That's a normal thing nowadays. Be whoever you want to be. Also joined by Pat Gray of Pat Gray Unleashed here on Blaze TV and it does feel a little bit weird having you here on Friday again. Yeah like I feel like we're confusing the audience because usually it's well usually it's Pat and Stu Thursday's and you're on Thursday's so it is Friday. Was she one yesterday? No. Neither of you are on on Thursday so I think we've just messed everyone up. All right. All right so let's get into the headlines of the day. So Dr. Fauci said this week that the public is misinterpreting the new guidance for the people who are vaccinated versus unvaccinated when it comes to the mask mandate. He said it's important to understand what the new guidance on masks were directed at and you know the people who are vaccinated can feel safe but if you are not vaccinated you need to continue to wear a mask here is a little bit of Dr. Fauci. First of all it's important like to understand what the new guidance on masks were directed at. It said that people who were vaccinated can now feel safe that they do not need to wear a mask either outdoors or indoors. It did not say that people who are not vaccinated should abandon their masks. It said people who are not vaccinated should continue to wear masks and should get vaccinated. So I think people are misinterpreting thinking that this is a removal of a mask mandate for everyone. It's not it's an assurance to those who are vaccinated that they can feel safe be they outdoors or indoors. So it's interesting because I don't recall anyone dying and making Dr. Anthony Fauci King of the world yet here he is telling us that the mask mandates you no no no no you can't lift the mask mandate for the people who voluntarily choose not to be vaccinated. Pat I'd just like to tell Dr. Fauci to stick it up in his rectal cavity because I'm tired of the mask mandate whether vaccinated or unvaccinated. I I I can't keep it straight. Every time I leave my car I leave my car naked faced and I get to the door and I think damn got to go all the way back to get the mask and bring it back in at least at church they've said if you're not vaccinated you can come on in without your mask and you don't have to wear it the whole time and we're not going to ask anybody so since they didn't ask it might have been true that there were some people in the congregation on Sunday who weren't vaccinated yet didn't have masks I certainly would know about that no no I'm just assuming it's possible it's a plausible scenario yeah of course I mean I I'm at the end of my rope with the restrictions with the and in Texas supposedly we're done with the restrictions yet everywhere you go don't just still see people with masks every the grocery store you anywhere you go they still have a mom I was outside enjoying some sunshine with my family in our neighborhood just the other day and there was a person exercising in just on the sidewalk with a mask on and I'm like what are you doing what are you doing somebody's going to yeah I'm gonna die from this I don't want anyone to die from it but I don't know what I do want though is for if there were to be someone who went into say you know a grocery store somewhere like that where they still have the signage up on the front someone to actually pass out in their store and then sue them yeah because yes because all of these businesses are so worried about oh my gosh what if someone catches COVID on our premises will be liable well they're not realizing they could be liable for someone with a you know an adverse reaction to wearing the mask medical condition they can wear them you're liable for that right I mean I I'm like I feel like we need for this to happen I don't want anyone to have any long-term effects from it but it's like jeez if these people are having medical events please get in touch with the lawyer and see what your rights are because if we get those lawsuits on the books as a precedent maybe then they'll step back the businesses and say okay maybe there is a liability issue to be concerned with on both sides oh and by the way you can't prove where you caught a communicable disease Taylor what are your thoughts well and I like what you said is who made you know King Fauci why is why does he get a desired everything he says people are miss you know representing or misinterpreting this mask mandate being lifted for you know vaccinated vaccinated people who determines that and isn't it supposed to be his job to keep us informed that's why he's one of the highest paid government employees isn't that his job so if they're misinterpreting him they're quite literally misinterpreting Dr. Fauci so that sounds like his problem sounds like he should go and clear it up and he just tried apparently but when does it stop yeah when does it stop well that's a great question I feel like never yeah I it's gonna take us I think with a little civil disobedience with a little Fauci disobedience and it takes us that's not even an issue because we don't we don't have a mask mandate we're not told we have to wear them in fact we're told quite the opposite you don't have to wear them and and I guess they're allowing businesses to conduct their business and do whatever they want but Fauci about a year ago in March admitted that that masks are not the be all an end-all they what he said in the very beginning of this was that they might stop a few particles safe from coming into your mouth but what he was saying was they're not that effective right these masks especially the ones we all wear the cloth mask the surgical mask they don't work they're not protecting you from anything and we can continue to kid ourselves and pretend and play make believe all we want but I'm really tired of it well you know it is interesting because Dr. Fauci said that at the be well a year ago a little over a year ago and then Rand Paul got him on the stand and questioned him about all of this being political theater now that everyone had been vaccinated and Dr. Fauci said no no no no I completely disagreed that is not true and then all of a sudden what what was it earlier this week he came out and said well I just I didn't want people to see me without a mask on oh so you mean it was political theater right so now it's all kind of shaking out sure gets paid a lot to be an actor that's all I'm gonna say I mean he could just join Hollywood and live us the hell along I'd love it if he would just do that all right so here in COVID news I found this very interesting one of the largest dating apps in America or some of the largest dating apps in America are teaming up with the White House to add Vax stickers on the profiles of the members so what is it there's Tinder and let's see okay Cupid and match Bumble I mean a bunch of them plenty of fish plenty of fish they're giving members the option oh grinder good that's wonderful giving members the option to add a new vaccinated badge to display on their profile so that everyone knows that they're vaccinated gosh that's great I am so old I remember the days when it was no one's freaking business whether or not you were vaccinated I remember when our medical history and you know our records they're private right whatever happened those I mean when I want to almost start when people come up to me and ask me if I'm vaccinated happens all the time like well do you have HIV have you ever been exposed to HIV in your life oh does that question make you uncomfortable right then leave me alone because none of your business if your vaccine works so well in your masks then why do I need to do it yeah yeah if we're gonna tag I was just thinking the same kind of thing if you're gonna tag it for vaccinations why not syphilis right you know I'm gonna read free or I've got syphilis whatever the case maybe I've got herpes and we're gonna have a little tag on match.com and grinder and Tinder for that as well I mean why wouldn't you start a stop at just the vaccine right well especially when you're talking about again a vaccine for a virus that is not like very lethal yeah 99 survivability I don't think that a bunch of 80 year olds are on these dating websites so if they are kind of take them out of the especially grinder I don't think they I don't think they know what that dating site is well and with on the dating sites too I think they're actually offering benefits and free you know free swipes and free super likes and stuff like that as well free premium content it's almost like they're you know they only want to match people that are so programmed up with people that are programmed again and they just want to continue this cycle over and over and over again honestly I'm fine with those people finding each other and I mean they don't have any hope for any of the normal people right exactly but okay so Taylor you brought up the privacy issue and I do kind of want to get get both of your thoughts on that because I know yesterday we talked about Oregon and they have made the decision to force companies to basically police people at the door they can take away their mask mandates but only if they check the vaccine cards or proof of vaccination with all of their customers who are coming in the stores and I know that you know HIPAA it does kind of get dicey because HIPAA really only applies to like health care providers and people third parties who are looking at your health information from health care providers but I also do know that you know there is the ADA that's on the books and there is medical discrimination that happens and you have to believe that if they made if they enacted these laws to protect people's medical information a loophole to say like well it's I mean these aren't doctors who are looking at your information it's just a grocery store it's like well right that's worse right exactly like we made that law because the doctor was going to be the person who was most likely to see your medical information not because somehow a grocery store owner should be allowed to see it and the hospital can't sell you know can't disclose your personal information I mean to me it's like surely surely that is illegal I know not directly under HIPAA but I keep waiting for all of these lawsuits to come down the hike because there's no way that that is not protected information Pat no I don't I don't think there is and you know the Democrats have been so married to HIPAA over the years it was Hillary Clinton's baby and they were proud of it and they continued it with Obamacare and so it's apparently pretty important to them and yet that's completely out the window now nobody cares anymore about sensitive medical information right study your business who's vaccinated and who isn't yeah which at the same time and I know Taylor you brought this up but at the same time that they're saying oh no you know you should definitely show your vaccination status at the door they literally are decriminalizing if you purposely infect someone with HIV they're decriminalizing not in places like California rest of your life especially if you're not if you don't have no realization that you've been exposed to it and they're making it legal like you said earlier with ADA is it's all of this is a slippery slope as why do I need to tell my private medical information regardless of what it is yeah to a grocery store clerk why does she have more power than nearly anybody nowadays is why can you turn my business down because I don't want to tell you if I've been vaccinated yeah I mean certainly you're right certainly you're creating a second class of citizens and then again all for a virus that for all intents and purposes over 99% of people will survive I mean I've had coronavirus back when you know it wasn't here supposedly when the Chinese wanted to lie to us I mean it's not that bad there's a reason why it has over a 99% survival rate especially with people my age and their 20s we're all healthy well you even for on I mean unhealthy people yeah it's still not killing them at a crazy rate that we've never seen before yeah you what you do bring up an interesting point because there have been a couple of preliminary studies that have come out on people who are getting the vaccine who already have had the virus and they are showing that the side effects for bad reactions yeah three times two to three times more severe than people who have had it vaccine but I haven't had the virus but none of that is taken into account right when we're looking at show your papers please yeah well nobody even it's almost like the side effects all these companies and especially the left and even there right nowadays is everybody's dancing around it everyone's dancing around the side effects and especially with people that have already had coronavirus and they're being exposed to all these terrible side effects are getting bruises are getting all these things nobody wants to talk about it yeah nobody wants to talk about I mean the fact that you know you can legally give someone AIDS in some of these states you don't have to disclose it and now it's just the same slippery slope going on with the coronavirus and going on with our vaccines I mean you're never it's almost like it's just kind of keep repeating and repeating and repeating itself until people finally wake up and say this is none of your business what I'm doing have you noticed the new side effect of the magnetization of the injection site so people are slapping it people laugh about it if my arm is turned into a bionicle I'm not going to be laughing I'm gonna be crying I mean what is that it is very weird obviously people will insinuate that okay well it's some sort of chip some sort of tracking chip in there it might just be the heavy metals in the vaccine itself yes yes I don't know but maybe again not great either well right metals in your arm for a virus with over a 99% survival and why at the ejection site and then nowhere else I mean it falls off your arm anywhere else or your other arm and it's interesting because I thought at first okay maybe that's some kind of YouTube hoax absolutely not we've had lots of listeners call and show us or send us YouTube videos of their situation my producer Keith from Packeran Leashed had his mom and his stepdad both stick a Magnus to their arm and they stop so weird secondhand information there it really is true and it really does work yeah I'm just amazed at these people that you know all these majority of the videos the main majority is that you see is there they laugh about it they laugh it off it's like yeah I do laugh and but like oh what did I just put in my arm you know like if I'm laughing it's gonna be a cry laugh because yeah what did you just do to yourself it's funny now until you grow a third arm yeah I'm gonna be laughing yeah exactly we've got more to come first we want to think our sponsor Bonner wines so if any of you are big winos like me I gotta tell you how to make your wine ten times healthier first

wearing her face mask properly this was in Colorado and he has since been fired and faces multiple charges including one of child abuse so just we have this video if I mean if you have any smaller children in the room anyone you don't want seeing this just so you know I mean it is it's disturbing to me in the sense that I want to like kill this guy with my bare hands here's the clip yeah yeah it is it is a man so if we could so let's let's watch that one more time they're obviously in the right hand side and if you can hear her she's saying I don't want to wear it it makes me sick he pulls it up on her you have to wear the mask why because I mean wow like if I'm that parent oh yeah you have to pry me off of the ceiling because I am going after like for sure someone bring bail money yep absolutely if you do that to my child but I just would like to I want to get your thoughts on this gentleman but I just would like to I want to just point out how close that man was to her face so I'm just wondering if it's worth slapping a child over because it's just so scary this virus that we have to wear masks why the hell are you going to be so close to her face while she doesn't have the mask on path yeah we see that kind of thing all the time always videos they're right up in your face yelling and screaming a lot of times they pull their mask down to yell and scream at you spit all over your face but they're so committed to the mask that they're really offended when a 10 year old girl won't wear one properly it's you know with so many of these things with the left they're cult like in their behavior this has almost become like a religious fervor if you don't wear a mask you're creating some sort of sin and they feel like they're more righteous and they're the ones who are the righteous ones yeah who will comply with this yeah so yeah I think it's gonna take some yes earlier what it's going to take to get us through this time and I think it's gonna take people like this 10 year old girl saying I'm not gonna wear it and they certainly shouldn't be slapped around by a bus driver hopefully he's lost his job by now I would think so yes he did and and he is he is facing multiple charges but also hopefully the parents lawyer up yeah oh absolutely cuz I am I am suing the hell out of everyone that I possibly can if that happens to my kid Taylor what are you're that's what are we all taught when we were kids and what I mean art what are our kids taught is that school bus is one of the most safe place I mean the safest places for our children it's supposed to be it's supposed to be right and why is a man which I don't know what he identifies as and maybe that's why he felt the need to hit her is maybe he thought he was in the right because he's a woman in his mind but he's not you don't hit a 10 year old child in the face and it wasn't soft and it's almost like the emotional abuse of these masks and of the indoctrination system that they put our kids through it isn't enough anymore I mean you're seeing a bus driver abuse a little girl when he's right up in her face for what not wearing a mask I mean it does absolutely nothing for their case at all when they when they build it I mean like you said Pat is it's almost a cult like behavior from all of them now is they want to be obedient they want bigger government when we all know I mean bigger government is what causes all these problems all these people saying you need to wear this you need to wear this it just seems like it's never gonna stop and then what it's gonna take is like little girls like you said standing up and saying no no way no way hell am I gonna wear this mask which I've seen I don't know if you guys have seen at the different school board meetings with the children going up to speak yeah it's incredible it is really really incredible so far there's been a 10 year old boy doing that and he was really eloquent and he killed that yes yes and an eight year old girl who is also really she she was a little on the sappy side yeah a little on the sappy little sarcastic but wouldn't you be I mean if you're being forced to wear a mask and you're told you can't go to school for over a year I mean schooler these kids lives and then they're they have to stay at home learn a home and do you're preaching to the choir I had to pull my son in homeschool him all year so you are preaching to the choir with that one all right oh and by the way in Texas now at least they can't mandate the masks in schools anymore right thanks governor Abbott I mean we could have used that like in the fall you could have never signed a mandate right exactly yeah I would have out of the things that you did but also like thanks for doing it in time for summer I'm sure all the kids really appreciate that for the entire school year all right so a federal judge this week rejected a Christian college this is college of the Ozarks rejected their request to bypass new rules under the Biden administration that forced religious schools to open their dormitories including shared bedrooms and shower spaces to members of the opposite sex they they did not get the temporary protection that they were seeking and this was of course because of the executive order titled preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation this was done in January and it was it was in line with the administration's new interpretation of sex the directive holds that entities covered by the Fair Housing Act cannot discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity so a transgender person who is biologically male identifies as female must be permitted to share dormitory spaces like bedrooms bathrooms showers based on gender identity right you know it's not actual gender right right so you've opened it up again to being dangerous to women yep they don't care about women anymore not are they're saying that I mean in the wide open yeah they want them to shower with them and to share dormitories with them just off of identity not that you've had the surgery you haven't actually transitioned yeah it's just because you identify I mean I can identify as remotely anything I want nowadays and I mean an attack helicopter they probably accept that too and it's just I mean it's so dangerous for the women like you were saying and how many dirt bags are going to identify as female so they can get into a female dormitory yeah I so dangerous well I mean and by the way I mean this is a private Christian college this is a private school who typically you would say they should be able to make their own where's the separation church and state right yeah so we're always hearing about where is it with these I mean it's a private institution if private institutions like we just backtrack a little bit earlier they can enforce mask mandates now why can't they say no you can't have your you know BS gender identity that you made up here you can't come and you know raise the sexual assault percentages on our campus just because you identify this way and you want to share bathrooms with women I have a feeling if it goes the way that it typically goes with not transgender people in general but the movement itself the special interest group that there will be many of them who will choose just to go to college of the Ozarks just to screw with them you know we saw Jack what is his name the baker in Colorado who had the case with the wedding cake and he's being sued again because they seem to like they just want to force everyone to accept everything that they are and do and like if you don't love it we will cram it down your throat until you love it and sadly the Supreme Court had a chance to stop that nonsense yeah and they passed on it I mean they ruled on a very narrow portion of what happened there in that case and it didn't it didn't cover the bakeries it didn't it didn't protect anybody and so I think this will end up with the Supreme Court again and the religious situation will wind up back with the Supreme Court to you know schools who are having to open up their dorm rooms to anybody who identifies as a certain gender that it's just you're asking for trouble yeah that's nonsense Taylor last word it seems like it's you know it's their way or the highway that's how these people operate and even if they don't get their way they're gonna do it until they get their way and it doesn't matter I mean they they talk about you know the right being fascist a lot they love that they love that terminology not fascist or isopremacist and it may not be true and a lot of it isn't true but then they force it until it's true until it sticks until it's on mainstream media that's the new talking points I mean these people get what they want because of their I mean their influence honestly is they have programmed people to an extent of where oh if you stand up I mean you're terrified even business owners is it terrified of getting their businesses burnt down because it's their way or no way yeah this squeaky wheel definitely gets the grease here all right we've got more to come first we want to think our sponsor built bar if you are looking for something that tastes like a candy bar but is not going to expand your waistline you've got to try built bar I know there are so many of

PBS it was an episode in a series called it was called let's learn this is a partnership between PBS member station W net TV and the NYC Department of Education and this is PBS yeah which means our taxpayer dollars are going to exactly exactly this is just a New York as well yeah it's New York City Department of Education is partnering with them to present to you little miss hot mess watch they finished the dance of the dragming goes twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl twirl the dance of the drag and goes twirl twirl twirl all through the town big finish excellent give yourselves a round of applause I think we might have some drag queens and training on our hands oh some drag queens in training on our hands wonderful but no they're definitely Pat definitely not trying to indoctrinate the children no definitely definitely that sound you here in the background is the clippity clop of the four horsemen of the apocalypse galloping through downtown right now that's about time I mean is there a better sign of what's going on in our society than that no this drag queen thing why how did this begin it's it's absolutely insane it's asinide there's no English words that are sufficient to describe just how bad this is and we the other day we had a story you know who's who's what parent is allowing their child to go to these to this was a video conference thing so this was a virtual yeah little class with her but they have in the library where the kids are all sitting around the three to five to seven year olds are all sitting around listening to store time from drag queens why why are you indoctrinating children like this this week we had a story of two parents who have a two-year-old well the two-year-old is four now but at two they allowed this girl to become a boy because she wanted to because she said I think I'm a boy and so they obliged and they allowed the transition to a boy with the clothes and I you know I don't think it's legal left surgery yet but in every other way they're they've made that transition at two years old Wow that is I mean that is that's a blatant child abuse yeah I should be there's no other way around that at all yeah CPS should come show up at their door yes we're seeing all these situations yep it's a great question because I mean over in Canada our neighbor or Canada that CPS is coming but to take the parents and eliminate their rights when they don't affirm the kids chosen gender identity so that's how backwards it's gotten Taylor this is I mean it's the most like you said the most blatant form of child abuse that I think I've seen in a long time and it's continuously happening when it's happening everywhere right now there's you know these drag queens going in libraries and in a place where children are supposed to be learning and being educated they're being indoctrinated instead I mean it's just like our school system all over again but it's getting worse and what kind of people you like you said what kind of parents are bringing their kids to these things their parents have to be I mean the maskers the ones that are indoctrinated beyond belief to say it's okay to yeah let's confuse our kids gender identity when they're at the most impressionable age psychologically let's dress them as a boy and tell them they are a boy even though that's not what they have between their legs I mean it's child abuse there's no other way to put it and you know I mean it's interesting too because I think that these the drag queen story time hours and all of these things they take it to the even the next level because it's not even necessarily about the gender I mean it is but it's so much more than that because you've got these people twerking in the story time hour so it's they're sexualizing the children really why do you have these you know drag queens whatever whatever they're you know you call them why are they twerking for kids right why are they you know engaging in a sexual act for children something that was founded in the bedroom and now it's made its way into mainstream media and now into our children's I mean children's life everyday lives too yeah yeah I mean as a mom I can't say that I've ever pat looked at the library calendar and been like oh drag queen twerking hour oh sweetheart let's get in the car and go I'm just gonna strap you in your little car seat and you're gonna learn some tricks now yeah yeah and that noise that's hitting your roof that you think was hail its brimstone so I mean seriously this is the end of civilization demonic yes it's a district what they are doing to these kids it's like they almost want to turn them and corrupt their minds at the most impressionable age I mean you're gonna you're going to make a bunch of serial killers seriously by doing this to our kids brains it's one of their most impressionable and you're causing all this drama putting them around these drag queens that a lot of them I mean they have records of sexual abuse to children yeah how was that okay yeah I know yeah that was it the president of the story time story hour yeah was arrested for for pedophilia charges I mean and this is so prevalent you would think that drag queens and transgender people are 80 percent of our society not 0.7 percent it's not even a percent is a thing so yeah why is our media and our feelings and Joe Biden our ministry don't matter you know not even one percentage yeah what the other you know a hundred percent doesn't matter I mean all of us don't matter that's just let's just put these people you know way up on the hierarchy chain than us why because they all just it's abuse that in the simplest term it's abuse and indoctrination this isn't indoctrination like we've never seen before yeah and it is I mean I don't I don't know about serial killer but I will say it is it is a bizarre world when parents are pushing their children to a place where all the statistics say that they are at least more way more likely for depression suicide all that especially when you're exposed when a child is molested at a young age and this happens all the time with these drag time story hours right it's just a cycle of abuse is because they're taught that it's normal so when they just repeats itself and repeats itself and in a few generations I mean that's gonna be the norm yeah it's gonna be the new normal yeah and even after the you know for transgenders even after the gender transition what is it 47 or 43% of them still commit suicide they're not happy after these well and then higher percent of them are ready as well right right right yeah and then there are a lot of detransitions people speaking out saying hey don't set your kids up to do this because it's a mistake don't cut your privates off yeah please yeah I'm old enough to remember when they would just put you in a mental institution yeah try to do that all the good old days right all right we've got 2014 I'm old enough to remember 2014 all right we got to take a break we'll be back all right CNN host Don Lemon now I know yesterday we brought to you the story about fellow CNN host Chris Cuomo who was getting criticized rightfully so for his his participation in these conference calls strategy meetings for his brother Andrew Cuomo which I know there are not a lot of actual journalists left these days but you're not supposed to do that you're not supposed to participate in those types of things and call yourself a journalist well CNN Don Lemon CNN's Don Lemon he says that listen he's actually not a political person oh but by the way screw the Republican Party watch the only party now that is operating in reality is the Democratic Party the Republican Party is obsolete the Republican Party is not dealing and living in reality so you cannot negotiate with a party that doesn't operate on logic and so I don't know what the answer is when it comes to the Republican Party I think at this point it needs to be restructured and perhaps Americans who who want this country to be a country that is sane and rational rational and equitable and equal that perhaps they need to challenge the Republican Party more but I don't think the Republican Party at this point is I don't think that that they can be changed I really don't I think that they it is gone way too far and it's it's it's just sad to see I'm not listen again I'm not a political person no I'm a personal political person I'm a journalist I'm not a political person I'll touch on it twice no I worry no I've told you is it the Republicans are insane and Democrats are the only ones with a brain in their head but I'm not political no no I'm just saying the Republican suck and should probably be in prison camps and Democrats should rule over them but I'm not political it's just a journalistic remark all right that's all it is he wants to talk about you know not being political and any directly contradicts himself like you were saying and he talks about how we have no rational thought as Republicans what I mean what about defending unborn lives of children and he I mean he's in the black means part of the black community so number one killer of black lives in America and in New York they have a negative birth rate within the black community but don't know that doesn't matter at all I remember in 2013 when he used to actually be kind of a real journalist and he wanted to address the wedlock rate in the single parent rate in the family and to the black community and in the black on black crime about how it was the highest in America you almost got canceled for that and now you see his true colors coming out right here but don't worry he's not political don't yeah no way epic levels of projection oh when people people believe it that is what is amazing to me how can you actually take this in and be like oh yeah don't lemon he's the most unbiased journalist ever not political at all no and you know with the with abortion issue as you brought up they don't even believe the baby in the womb is human they get you they're so detached from science they won't even make that admission well they're they talk about being the party of science the science backs life beginning conception but you know that's that's an inconvenient fact we'll push that out and they talk about racism they talk about all these things they don't talk about how Planned Parenthood was founded the type of people that created these industries that actually are discriminating against these you know cultures they try to say men can have periods that doesn't seem scientific to be half men can have babies I mean we've got to call them birthing birthing persons yeah people to offensive it's persons now men might start giving birth through what I mean I'd pay to see where is that coming out if you guys could develop that I would be amazing but I'm kind of done with that I love for my husband they're all c-sections my big goal yeah they're all c-sections I hope so yeah they are yeah it'll be interesting to see what happens in the midterms I think because I mean I would like to believe in an America where the majority of people yeah don't think that any of this going on is rational at all all right we've only got a couple minutes left but I have to bring this lovely story up so the CDC has you know not only are they handling all of this COVID pandemic and talking flip-flopping on masks back and forth but they're also issuing a very very important warning for Americans against snuggling and kissing their chickens there that they have so it's this is a there goes my nightly ritual I am very sorry it's a salmonella advisory they said don't kiss or snuggle backyard poultry and don't eat or drink around them but they're such good kissers have you ever you're every tongue kiss to chicken such good French kiss darn it they just want to take all the fun away first you're making us cover your our faces yeah now you're not letting us kiss our chickens how's it where does it stop what do you want you miss a freedom you better get so I mean who's doing this why do they maybe tell people this I don't understand it's the Democrats I'm convinced Democrats it's definitely the Democrats Taylor give us the your is much insight as you can on the CDC telling us to stop kissing and cuddling our poultry I'm looking for something really good here the Democrats like you said who is going out and French kissing their I mean French kissing their chicken their horse is all this the only person I can think of sink you get when he made his comment about pleasuring the horse and the horse can't say no so it's all right he's gonna pleasure that horse what did he really say that he said that on his own show like it's like and that's okay like it's got to be the Democrats to wait but he was being serious yeah if he's not being serious he's talking about yeah the horses you just say like what Democrats definitely living in reality okay those are the people who are living in reality unlike us Republicans who are just crazy people not talking about having sex with horses we gotta take a break we're not no no
