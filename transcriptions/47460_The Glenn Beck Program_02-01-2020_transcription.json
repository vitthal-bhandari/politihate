    "text": " the you're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program patent Jeffy for Glenn today triple eight seven two seven B E C K the number to call you know what's refreshing is not hearing something about this U.S. embassy being attacked in Baghdad not hearing something that's of a fairy tale because that's what we heard last time yeah and that's what we would have heard again this time I just a movie I you just grunted their mourners whole bunch of mourners in mourning yeah no this is an Iranian backed militia they've set up several of these groups around the Middle East and one of them happens to be there in Baghdad and that this is who's behind it Iran is behind it so the Pentagon under the leadership of I don't know the commander in chief who's a little different this time than the last one we had thankfully sent a hundred marines to the embassy also the soldiers inside the embassy fired tear gas and stun grenades plus some warning shots in fact sixty sixty two of the hundreds of fighters who broke down the main door to the compound and set fire to the reception area they got a little dose of hey no we're not going to let you just storm in here and take take our people no so it's amazing to see what happens when you respond with some strength rather than responding with total weakness like Carter and Obama did and a totally different outcome so hopefully this time there's no you know two year three year standoff with Iran while they while they do whatever they do to our hostages that would have been horrific that sure would have and look is it you know there's the argument to be made that it's time to get out of there anyway yeah it is well I think it is I do to yeah I am I think it's a long past time to get out of both to that at all they're they're actually saying that they're going to poll the troops completely out of Afghanistan so not peacekeepers or trainers people they're training their militia or overseers or supervisors everybody supposedly is coming home good it's only been 18 years I don't know what the rush is what is the hurry here let's think about this for a while we've got another routine at least to to build this thing right you would think so yes I know I know so 18 years thank you it's amazing that's amazing to think it's been we're going on 20 years now in Afghanistan sure as and look we've heard the argument you know for how much how many times that Afghanistan is the you know the nation killer yeah and it's proven over and over and over and over again yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's time to stop stop beating our heads against the wall first of all we thought we could we could bring I guess we thought we could remake them in our image in Iraq and Afghanistan and really doesn't seem to be it doesn't seem to be possible no it doesn't no it doesn't they've just got a different mindset they've got different priorities they have a different culture and they have different principles of governance and you know what okay yes fine you know what leave us alone and we'll leave you alone yes yeah I mean it's all for that now the initial attack on Afghanistan where we went to take out the Taliban was totally appropriate since they were involved you know somewhat indirectly or directly or indirectly but we also had to flush out al-Qaeda out of the afghan area so okay we did that a long time ago yes let's stop with the nation building and come home now okay does anybody contest that I don't know I don't know anymore can't be too many people who want us there still what do you say they're like a hundred years like john mccain was talking about in 2008 or a hundred years if necessary no how about no on that one I don't think america needs to fight a hundred year no I mean who's who's left in the the warmongers Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham yeah definitely you think of warmongers I mean that's that's who you think of right I don't know who else but I'm sure there are some yeah there are some definite hawks like like him but I think they're fewer and farther between and boy that's a shame yeah it's it's really time unless we're attacked leave them to their own devices and that's my point leave us alone we'll leave you exactly and and I just how we'll leave you alone that is what that is exactly what our our founders intended and so that should be I think our mindset as well you're not gonna go back to the founders founders of constitution yeah with the rich white slave owners which they're not for a couple of weeks during the impeachment they weren't though they were rich white slave owners all of a sudden they're revered like crazy well we love these men like there are dads like there are very own benevolent fathers really they were the greatest of the way democracy and that constitution was not some dusty old living document we can interpret anyway we want well we will we go to sleep with that every hug it's yeah except I don't want to wrinkle it so I make sure it's well protected it I sleep on it on top of it's in a box that I sleep on because I don't want it to be damaged i don't go but i don't care that's how much i love the constitution that thing has to be strictly adhered right i mean so transparent so obvious but you know they've got no shame so they have no problem in in pretending whenever it's convenient for them that they're all about the constitution i had never heard a republic if you can keep it as many times in my entire life as i've heard it in the last two weeks or three weeks with these democrats has Benjamin Franklin said you've got a republic if you can keep it i pledge allegiance to let me let me consult my notes to the to republic of the republic republic democracy republic for which it stands one nation invisible with libertarians for a little bit of justice for everybody yeah but man i love it i love this country love that pledge and stuff all about it the hypocrisy is amazing isn't it it's truly truly amazing triple eight nine hundred thirty three ninety three this was kind of interesting and maybe a lot of people don't know the significance of major garret actually praising donald trump could be because he used to work for fox and so i think a lot of people are under the impression that major garret is you know some kind of solid conservative i don't think so at all major garret uh i i don't know that he's a friend to the right um sir and not republicans either but here here is what major garret had to say about president trump on face the nation so this is pretty significant because nobody says anything good about donald trump on face the nation i don't think i mean is he still alive i don't know i don't know that you can right right is it is it even law i don't know i don't know well let's find out here's what he said about uh trump's minority policies to be fairly said that this administration because of president trump's quiet prodding has done quite a bit for funding of historically black colleges and universities the first step step back which was a massive first step toward criminal justice reform just a couple of weeks ago in this newly signed defense bill there is a law that says if you are seeking work for the federal government or any contractor you don't have to be asked and you cannot be asked about your criminal history until right toward the end that's a significant long sought by criminal justice advocates plus opportunity zones and attacks bill directed at communities of color that is a legacy on the agenda side that almost any president after three years would want to claim what wow yeah he's right about that i cut it off because that's what they dragged off the yes yes he is missing now uh major garret is missing and see no trace of after this particular statement he made uh but that's pretty brave that's pretty brave of major garret to to go against the flow like that on on a show like that when you're in a paneling you know everybody's gonna hate you for saying it oh yeah he said it anyway good for him uh also the u.s according to chief justice john roberts the u.s has quote come to take democracy for granted unquote well yeah who cares we're not a democracy so it doesn't matter doesn't thank you while we finally have the democrats saying uh this is a republic and they've said it several times they have said it several times but they all they throw it in there like i mean that's the obama rule right they throw the republic in yes what do you mean i call it republic but then the rest of the time is democracy sometimes in the same sentence absolutely it is roberts uh slayed of course to oversee the senate's impeachment trial if if the articles of impeachment ever go to the house so far we that hasn't happened uh but he's going to oversee the impeachment trial when it happens uh used his year end report tuesday to laud the federal judiciary's work on civic education while issuing a thinly veiled warning about the fragility of american democracy in this fractious time now why would a supreme court justice even a supreme court justice is giving us this a bush appointed supreme court justice giving us this democracy nonsense we have come to take democracy for granted and civic education is fallen by the wayside well yeah with you as well apparently civic education didn't get you to the point where you realize we're not a democracy he said in our age when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale the public's need to understand our government and the protections it provides is ever more vital it sure is sure sure is this is the best of the blend back program hi it's glenn if you're a subscriber to the podcast can you do us a favor and rate us on iTunes if you're not a subscriber become one today and listen on your own time you can subscribe on iTunes thanks well if you want to know what to expect this year i do and do i you know where you turn psychic nicky of course psychic to the stars uh many of our predictions from last year came to fruition so and listen to what she forecast okay you would never have seen these coming worldwide protests yeah i don't know where she came up with that but that happened now she said this was going to happen yeah before before it happened right okay how about this a roller coaster ride in the stock market meaning stocks will go up then they'll come down then they'll go back up again then they'll come back down again then they might even out yeah and then even out for a little bit but that happened they went up and they came down and then they went up so i mean right now you've already proved your point right but there's more there's still more extreme weather events who would ever see an extreme weather event what like a tornado or a hurricane snow what is it this was globally though right yes okay so somewhere on the globe there would be an extreme weather event i mean no normal person could have foreseen any of those events you've got to be psychic in order to come up with this uh so it didn't stop there either here's what she's saying this you're not resting on her laurels because after a year like that i would just shut up and say i know i've done what i can i just showed you it just showed you everything i can it's a psychic nicky psychic nicky she now says get this hilly clinton is a possible candidate in the 2020 elections whoa she's going right on the limb already oh the blue which is what she says if she does run it will be out of the blue okay all right and she's not the only possible eventual candidate oh no michaela bama could run uh no but who's ever considered that and Oprah winfrey what she doesn't say Oprah she but she says Oprah could could run uh regardless she does see a female candidate in our future at some point thank you i didn't i didn't ever think there would be a female candidate did you know i mean i don't like to be psychic but aren't they all barefoot in kitchens somewhere what here's what she said though get this i feel good about michaela obama although she could deny it there could be a female vice president as well i see the initials m oh what can only mean one thing michael obama hmm right right and look bichael it's unbelievable wow again no normal person could have foreseen any of that oh no no uh but she says whoever uh winds up on the ballot they're gonna have some serious issues well certainly global warming could make the list of serious issues what and here this i'm quoting now and the new generation as well is going to be worried about climate and changes and ecological disasters wow she is amazing powerful man she is powerful don't mess with this psychic niki it's like niki is she is she actually real yes she's actually what do you mean of course she is listen to this i love this is my favorite part now i'm quoting now i see a lot of penguins and polar bears leaving the arctic uh if you see penguins leaving the arctic that would be amazing well they have are no penguins in the arctic they're in the ant arctic they already left they left a long they were ever there they left a long time ago went to the other end of the planet okay but now she sees a lot of penguins at polar bears leaving the arctic and dying and coming down for food all the arctic circle and all the ice shelves are melting greenland iceland gretta meaning gretta thunberg obviously is certainly on the right track here what she's doing i think she's really fantastic and i think you're going to see more of these activists coming up not just her but others the younger generation so that's a trend too she says wow whoa and they're already is one from the younger generation uh look at this climate change kid from columbia you won't believe this really yeah do we have the columbian kid these 10 year old from columbia we want to we have to care for the environment columbia's leading climate fighter 10 years old there is no plan b he says this is the only planet in the universe that harbors life and if it's the only one and it comes to an end then life ends wow that's powerful logic right there uh so we spoke to the columbian senate i call on you all as senators of the republica on the government and the senate to legislate for life on the planet okay you can stop that now oh wow wow that's powerful now apparently he knows that there is no other life anywhere in the universe so right this kid's in the know uh and we should listen to him look as he's 10 they are though yeah they are i know i mean and we and we had uh i mean Angela Merkel is an angela it's Angela Merkel Angela she even said that uh in one of her uh year end speeches that everything humanly possible has to be done to deal with climate change during the new year i mean okay she's right and she probably got that from the 10 year old from columbia or psychic nicky or psychic nicky who had more predictions get this as if all this weren't enough yet to show you the power of psychic nicky i mean i'm i'm ready to sit down i want to see what's i'm glad you're sitting because you'd fall over if it if it weren't uh for the fact that you're sitting right now you still might i don't know you might tip right over backwards in your chair when you hear this it's gonna blow you away she i'm quoting now a lot of people will have their own businesses wait no when will that start to happen aren't all businesses government owned how is that possible i think they'll work out of home i don't think there's going to be a lot of stores in the next 10 years now wow some people might say well she read the article where the 9400 businesses closed last year and she's just extrapolating that's going to continue because of the internet but no she's just foreseeing all of this she says get this people are shopping online what stores are going bankrupt i think everybody's going to do it from one master big computer where they can go and do whatever they want all right then she says a lot of people will retire the baby boomers will retire earlier well let's see if you're in the baby boom generation you're already retired if you're on the mid to upper end of it you're already retired we've i'm on the lower end of the baby boom generation i don't know dying yeah so yeah but there i mean they're what 80 some of them 85 yeah in the baby boom generation and she says and the next generation their home life will be more luxurious because they're going to have everything they want right there get this imagine a world like psychic niki predicts where there won't be a need to go to a movie they'll have it in their home what you mean like something like on demand what that's not possible or a streaming service i can't imagine i'm not gonna be able to stay at my home and watch uh watch a film or watch a show you can't promise these things to me and get my hopes up like this and then squash a mess i hope she's right about this psychic niki what are you talking about get this if you want to order food you can get it in your home and she what would you call that like door dash or um uber i mean i'm just taking stabs in the dark you know i i'm i'm foreseeing maybe a company called grub hub what i know it's a silly name it's a stupid name but they would just bring food to you whatever you know when i just bring it to you how would they do that though well i see i don't know what they i don't know we have psychic niki because i don't know how that stuff works okay i mean just we'll ask you go online and then you order what you wanted and then you tell them where you were at and then someone would bring it to you there i guess i'll do they make it at their house and then bring it to your house and then when they make it from the i guess i don't know i don't know pat i don't know because it couldn't drive to a store pick it up there and then take it to your house but now you're just being serious too many steps involved there oh you just she's got some numbers too for you oh boy if you're a numbers player i don't know what you do with these numbers maybe you play the lottery with them uh but here's which i'm quoting these are quotes i like ten for you i like the number ten i love the number ten i like the number four which is unlikely i like the number four which is unlucky for some people but lucky what wait wait what it's unlucky for some people but lucky yeah okay then she goes further 13 is usually bad luck in north america good luck in europe i like 13 yeah okay so so far we've got 10 4 13 and that's what she says i've got 10 4 and 13 but there's more help me in the lottery for you you know well i guess there's more yeah it does i love 21 for you okay so she loves 21 and then i like 22 oh how about that okay i love 19 oh so 18 is gone 18 it's out it's a stupid yeah i mean i know it's your number because that's all you can say but she doesn't like it for you okay so then there's let's review here there's 10 4 13 21 22 and 19 okay and i'm further quoting and i like five okay that's my that's my power play five five five it's the five it's the five okay so 10 4 13 21 22 and 19 and she likes five for you all right excellent yeah if you think i'm not playing those numbers you are sadly mistaken i like the number 46 if anybody's interested and 47 well you're not Nikki i know so don't even start with me but i do like 48 for you and 12 i like 12 well you know what i know what i love people a lot of people don't like 18 but i think it's lucky you like it right even though it's unlucky it's lucky okay so weird and so stupid i mean how how many times do we have to be shown how unpsychic these psychics are i mean sure there's some that are real uh no sure there's some that are real i can see the future and i know that only the ones with the one nine hundred numbers from years ago remember them i did some of those were actually real yes you're okay you're right i'm saying yeah all right you're listening to the best of the glenbeck program this heartwarming story of a transgender man who has given birth to a non-binary partner's baby with a female sperm donor isn't that wonderful isn't that wonderful yes so the transgender man had the baby this is a miracle because the woman uh no the tr- i'm sorry the transgender man okay gave birth to a child that he had with a transgender well non-binary person so i guess that person doesn't identify as man or woman uh but then there was a uh a female person with sperm somehow who donated to the whole cause and the whole thing is just really wonderful and beautiful isn't it it sure is it speaks to our wokeness doesn't it thank you it speaks to our wokeness here even i'll tell you that they even had this couple the non-binary and the trans um man even had a transgender doctor so let me so let me read the story to you because it is heartwarming beautiful proud dad rubens sharp tells how he gave birth to a miracle baby in britain's most modern family the 39 year old transitioned to a man 12 years ago except for the fact that he still had obviously female parts because you can't have a baby in a man uh so kept kept the female parts in there as well but identifies as a man so obviously he's a man he's transitioned but you know he he had maternal instincts and six years ago stopped taking testosterone in the hope of one day having a child eternal and that dream came true when he and partner jay had a bouncing baby jay is non-binary so does not identify as male or female i mean the sperm donor was a trans woman and even the doctor was transgender in this one so they so they had a sperm donor yes the couple right who was um who was a woman the woman was sperm somehow identified identified as a woman but had male parts because obviously the you know the non-binary and then the non-binary partner i guess a non-binary partner didn't have much to do with the birth to my knowledge i don't think it's really as much to this sounds like maybe maybe the non-binary didn't want anything to do with the whole thing it does sound like it does although i'm sure not shirking their responsibilities with the baby it's beautiful it is beautiful and while a handful of other UK men have fallen pregnant after transitioning from a woman uh rubin and jay are the first couples to speak out about their remarkable journey uh but it is remarkable it is remarkable it is remarkable it's a remarkable journey because you don't really see well you do you just don't it happens every day where a woman conceives a child from the sperm of a perfect stranger it happens every day every day so every day little jayme arrived three months ago and uh the family just enjoyed the best of chrismises beaming with pride wedding photographer rubin uh says it's taken six years to get this far but now we have a baby in our arms and that was the ungoal i finally feel complete i wasn't that uh it wasn't that i was desperate to have the birthing experience or pregnancy experience but i wanted a child and i had the facility to do it i so you're saying you have facility you got the woman mechanics inside of you but you identify as a man so again i'm gonna say uh you're a woman you're not a man okay let's just talk biology here too bad still it was just terrible is that terrible yeah and the person who donated the seat are you still going it is um is a man not a woman okay because women don't have uh that particular uh item the road to parenthood has certainly been long and
