    "text": " Welcome back to the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Jordan Boyd, a staff writer here at the Federalist. Today I'm happy to be joined by Miriam Grossman. She's a board certified adult and child psychiatrist, medical doctor, and she's here to discuss her new book, one of five that she's written. So Miriam, welcome. Well thanks for having me, Jordan. Let's start by telling us a little bit about this book and the idea for it and sort of the driving force behind why you wanted to publish this particular message. The name of my book is Lost in Trans Nation, a child psychiatrist's guide out of the madness. And I felt after a few years of seeing families with a child who was questioning whether they were male or female and also helping that child or young adult, I'm just very deeply concerned about the belief system that is being the rhetoric about gender that is being presented indoctrinated into our young people because it's a belief system that is not based in science and it is not based in medicine and is being presented to young people, well to all of us, but especially to young people, as if we're, you know, it's scientifically proven facts that you can be something other than what your body is and that what you feel you are overrides what your body says you are. Now you can have that belief that that's possible, but what I'm saying is number one, you're going to pay a price for denying your biology and sometimes a very high price. And number two, that this belief system, because it's not based in anything scientific, should not be taught in schools. I mean, a lot of people believe that we have a soul. That's not a scientific belief. It can't be proven, right? But nonetheless, it's a belief that many people do, you know, have that belief, but we're not teaching it as a fact, certainly not in our public schools, but we are teaching in our public schools as a fact that children may be born in the wrong body. And that is a very destabilizing idea that has, again, no scientific basis to it. And I am arguing that kids and families are paying a really high price for these beliefs. Absolutely. And you know, I couldn't help but notice that your book leads with, I think I counted more than a dozen pages of dedication to various people and groups and even some anonymous internet accounts. Can you tell me a little bit more about your decision to include that long list? Yeah. The book is dedicated to parents who have children or young adults who are in distress over their being male or female and who have embarked on this journey of living life as the opposite sex or as some other version of the sex that they are. So the book is dedicated to 500 parents from 17 different countries. And these are the parents, many of whom I spoke to by Zoom or on the phone and they, many of them were in their bathrooms or their basements and they were speaking to me as if it was some criminal act to seek my advice, which it certainly most certainly is not, but they felt that way nonetheless. And so I dedicate the book to them. They are the heroes. They are not the criminals. And I say the criminals are the individuals, the sex educators, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the guidance counselors in schools, the individuals in our government who are all promoting this narrative that is completely unscientific and for which kids and families are and will pay a devastating price. You touched on this a little bit ago, but in the book you discuss this concept of settled science. And we know there's no settled science that gender experiments such as chemical incarceration and mutilation are good. But what kind of evidence based consensus is there that blocking biology is damaging and irreversible? And is the medical community, the psychiatry community, are they just blissfully ignorant of this or is this something they deliberately look past to kind of advance an agenda? Well, you see, this is also another issue that parents are woefully unaware of. And one of the reasons that I wrote the book was to bridge. There's this chasm between what parents know and what they need to know on this subject. And when I say parents, I'm not only including those parents who are dealing with this issue now in their home, I'm really addressing all parents because no family is immune. And this atom bomb of a child suddenly turning to his parents and saying, I'm not your son, I'm your daughter. And I need for you to call me this new name and new pronouns and take me to a gender clinic so my puberty can be blocked. This is like an atom bomb falling into your home. And parents need to be prepared for it. So I'm encouraging even parents, well, especially parents of small children to inoculate their families against these beliefs. The answer is that there is no medical consensus on this issue. What there is is a debate. And it's a very heated debate. And it's a debate that parents are not hearing about. They are being led to believe by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society and other groups, and by government authorities such as Dr. Rachel Levine, they are being led to believe that there's a medical consensus, meaning that there's been extensive research and debate and discussion and back and forth and very, very careful deliberation before guiding parents on this issue. And that is simply not the case. There has been no careful deliberation, at least not in this country. Different countries, yes, Sweden, Norway, Finland, England have all very carefully examined the evidence, the scientific evidence, the data that we have collected over the past decades on this issue. And they have all unanimously agreed that we simply don't have evidence that there's long-term benefit of medicalizing these kids. But we do have evidence of long-term harm. And that is why if you lived in London or Stockholm or Oslo and you have a child who is questioning and wanting to, you know, asking about delaying their puberty using medication, it's going to be nearly impossible to get that puberty blocker unless you qualify to enter a study that's being done like in an academic medical center in which you will be screened very carefully and followed very carefully. And that's going to be a small number of people that are accepted into a study like that, clinical trial. So in all those places, you simply can't get these puberty blockers. Whereas here in the US, puberty blockers are given out like candy and they're given out sometimes the first, the very first visit that a family may make to a gender clinic or second visit. And how do we know that? How do I know that? Well, as I write in my book, there's an incredibly brave, courageous whistleblower by the name of Jamie Reed. And she used to work in the gender clinic at St. Louis Children's Hospital. She worked there for four years and she was on the front lines and she saw what was happening there. And it upset her so much that she ended up, she became a whistleblower. She went to the Attorney General's office in Missouri and gave testimony as to what was actually going on in that clinic. And it's just astonishing, Jordan. I mean, it's just hard to believe that doctors would be, you know, just knee-jerk reaction to these kids who are mentally ill kids who have all sorts of issues, emotional issues coming in and demanding that their puberty be stopped. And instead of exploring their mental health issues and giving them the help that they need, they put them on the assembly line toward these medical interventions. And the quote that was so disturbing that Jamie Reed provided and that I use in my book, in fact, I dedicate two chapters in the book to Jamie Reed's testimony. But she quoted one of the doctors that she used to work with because she left that gender clinic. She couldn't stomach what was going on. One of the doctors described the work that they were doing there as we are flying the plane while we are building it. We are flying the plane while we are building it. In other words, we don't know what we're doing here. We're treating these kids and we're kind of finding out if this is a good idea, through treating them. I mean, it's terribly disturbing. And I used that quote, in fact, when I was at the House of Representatives in Washington in June, this past June, and I testified on this issue of gender affirming care. We cannot be building the plane while we are flying it. I mean, are you kidding me? If we are providing interventions to children that basically are going to cause lifelong disfigurement and possibly sterilization, we better have really good, not gold level evidence, but platinum level evidence before we even think about doing anything like that. And what I explain in the book is that the evidence isn't there. The US is really an outlier. The US and Canada are really outliers when it comes to these treatments. And a few weeks ago, there was an astonishing letter published in the Wall Street Journal that was signed by 21 different experts in gender adolescent medicine and from nine different countries. And that letter to the Wall Street Journal basically said it was directed toward the president of the Endocrine Society, endocrinologists, of course, being the doctors who prescribe hormones, blockers and cross-sex hormones. And this letter essentially said, what are you doing? There's no evidence for this. What are you doing to your kids? This is really remarkable stuff that's going on in the field of medicine, but parents aren't going to hear about it. The Watch.org Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski.

And one of the things that you mentioned in the book, you kind of kick off your introduction with this profound confession that after 40 years, I've realized my most challenging fight is not against dangerous diseases, but dangerous ideas. And in your experience, how has the dangerous idea of radical gender ideology evolved from theory to practice? Like, how did we go from cross dressing to mutilating children in the span of just a few decades? I think so many people are taken aback by how quickly this seemed to come upon the normal public. And how did that happen? Well, it does seem like it happened at tremendous speed. And certainly the epidemic that we're in in the middle of now, the tsunami of kids, the 5,000% increase in the number of kids that are presenting with this issue, that is very recent. You know, that's maybe since 2015, 2013. So that has happened recently and quickly. But the ideas have been around for a long time. The idea of having an identity like a psychological identity that's separate from your physical body, that idea has been around for a long time. Gender theory has been popular in the universities, gender studies, and other radical, you know, radical social movements. Let's put it that way. So I discovered when I wrote my book, I wrote a book in 2009 called You're Teaching My Child What? And that was a book about sex education and how, and what we're doing to our kids in our so-called comprehensive sexuality education programs, exposing them to graphic, really pornographic material and not providing them with the biological facts that they need in order to stay healthy and in order to make smart choices. So I discovered when I was reading and researching sex education that, look, I just stumbled across this stuff about gender. Now, this was in the late 2000s. And so I found all these different like Planned Parenthood and an organization called SIKIS. Most people haven't heard of it, but it's a very prominent federally funded group that provides sex education curricula that as part of their sex education, they were doing the gender education as well. And they were telling kids that sex is assigned at birth, that phrase that drives me crazy because sex is established at conception, not assigned at birth, but they were, you know, they were introducing to kids this belief system that male and female is only one of many choices. And to separate humanity into male and female only is false and is oppressive and is wrong. And that system has to be taken down. So it was couched in these political sort of Marxist kind of revolutionary terms. We have to fight this. This is oppressive. Now, you know, biology tells us that, you know, all mammals and we are mammals are sexually dimorphic. So we come as either males or females. And it's not a oppressive binary. It is just simply the truth that that is what male and female means. So when I discovered that these things were being taught to students and often pretty young students, I was terribly alarmed. And so I included a chapter in that book. You're teaching my child what it's coming out in paperback for the first time next month. I included a chapter called gender land. And I predicted that this gender, these ideas about gender being fluid and, you know, that you could be many different genders. And it was your choice, which gender you're going to be. That that was destabilizing to kids and it was dangerous to kids and that it was going to end in catastrophe. And Jordan, it gives me no pleasure to say that I was right. And it has ended in catastrophe. So most people really only discovered this belief system very recently, but it has been around in sex education and in the universities for a long time. It's so crazy. And you know, it's not even in schools. I mean, one part of your book, actually, before you even get into really the nitty gritty, you have a whole section devoted to language and how how you changed your even perspective on calling you a man a she or a woman a he. Can you walk us through that evolution on your stance and talk about maybe there's people out there who work at jobs who are required to use pronouns in the workplace and use inaccurate language? How can they strike a balance between what is thrown in their faces compassion and what is biologically true and necessary for society to move forward and function? Yes, yes. The answer is yes. There is help and there are resources and I have a lot of them listed in the book and on my website, MiriamGrossmanMD.com. There are parents support groups. We didn't have this a few years ago, but we do now thank God we do have a network of parents support groups. There are organizations that are dedicated to supporting the parents and helping them find therapists that will not, you know, that don't buy into the narrative and a therapist who understand that when a child makes this declaration, what they are saying is that I want to be a different person. I don't want to be myself and the therapist's job is to figure out why. There's a reason for that. A person just doesn't randomly come up with this idea. A girl doesn't just randomly say, I'm a boy or I want to be a boy. My life will be better as a boy. I'll feel more comfortable as a boy. I just know inside of me that I really am a boy. These are things that have to be explored closely and over time it takes time. You have to get to know the patient. It's just like any other kind of therapy. It takes time. You explore. You know, you learn all about the patient's life, their family, their friends, what's going on at school, how do they feel about themselves, what have they been through in their lives, what trauma have they been through, what are their dreams. What are their concerns. And then slowly, and I described this in the book, I describe a few patients that I've had that have gone through the process of therapy. And they have come to, they have returned to accepting who they are, their biology, and they've turned away from a path that would lead them to medicalization. And they are at peace with their bodies and they are grateful for having avoided and their parents of course are extremely grateful to have avoided those interventions. So I would tell parents that there are many resources and I would tell them also that they should start early when their kids are still small and educate the child and tell them things like, you know, you were a boy or a girl from the moment that you existed, from the moment that you were created. You have always been a boy or a girl and you will always be either a boy or a girl. Now that doesn't mean that there's only one type or one way of being a boy or girl, there's so many different ways. And you want, you know, you want your son to know that there are boys who are not into sports and they're not into, you know, building things and what have you, all these stereotypical, you know, rough and tumble play and all those ridiculous stereotypes that we have. There are boys that are interested in what might be considered more feminine things. And it doesn't mean that they're not boys. That's just a ludicrous idea. There are different types of boys and different types of men, different types of girls and women. We are all a mosaic of male and female, but we do not want to harm our bodies in any way. We want to find ways that we are comfortable expressing that mosaic of male and female without hurting our bodies. So I want kids to be hearing that. I want them to know especially that sex is not assigned by some random person who happens to be in the delivery room when you're born. I want the child to understand that that is not true. So when they do then hear it from other people or other sources, a red flag, you know, they think about it and they can say to themselves, no, no, no, no, that's not right. I know that's not right. I know that male and female is determined at the moment of conception. So you have to reach your child first. I promise you, there are many people out there that want to reach your child before you do and influence your child. And even I would say recruit your child into their belief system. So you need to be on top of it. You need to certainly be on top of their internet use. And I have an entire appendix in the book written by an expert on parental controls of the internet. I can't emphasize enough how important that is. I also have two appendices written by lawyers who are experts in parent rights. Parents have the constitutional right to be in charge of their child's education, upbringing, and medical care. And schools are infringing on that right. I have a chapter on schools. I want parents to know no matter what age their child may be. I don't care if the child is a month old. I want you to know what's going on in schools. And I want you to know how to be proactive with that school so that if one day your child happens to announce at school to the guidance counselor that she's not sure if she's male or female, that school is going to have the heads up in writing that in no way will you go along with them permitting her to change her name, change her pronouns, or use the bathroom of the opposite sex. This is what is going on at schools behind parents' backs. And you know it's not even in schools. I mean, one part of your book, actually, before you even get into really the nitty gritty, you have a whole section devoted to language and how you changed your even perspective on calling you a man a she or a woman a he. Can you walk us through that evolution on your stance and talk about maybe there's people out there who work at jobs who are required to use pronouns in the workplace and use inaccurate language. How can they strike a balance between what is thrown in their faces compassion and what is biologically true and necessary for society to move forward and function? You know, I can certainly I can talk about what I did, but I cannot advise people who in the workplace, you know, they may lose their job, they may be shunned and deal with all sorts of issues. Everyone has to decide on their own how they're going to deal with that. What I talk about in the book is the decision that I made regarding the use of the pronouns for transgender identifying people that I was going to be discussing in the book. And I had to decide at the beginning if I was going to use that new vocabulary that included words like non binary and cisgender, whether I was going to use pronouns, you know, preferred pronouns for individuals. And what I thought about early on was a few things. One is that first of all, this new language that's being foisted on us, really many of the words have no coherent definition. The word non binary, the word cisgender, I'm not comfortable using those words because I really, I don't know what's meant by those words. They don't make sense to me. I mean, I know how they're defined. I know that non binary means neither male nor female, but that doesn't really make sense to me. So I was also aware of the fact that these new terms and new ideas erase an ancient word, the word woman, and that if we're saying a man can be a woman, which is what the new language obligates us to do, then the word woman means nothing. So you know, I thought hard about it. Maybe I should just decide case by case and call a woman she if maybe if this person had lived as a woman for decades or made great efforts to appear female, or maybe I need to do that just out of kindness and respect. And I explained how decades ago, if I had had such a dilemma, I certainly would have called a man she because I am respectful and I am compassionate. And it would have been a very rare instance, you know, one in many tens of thousands. And why not just be courteous and why not, you know, be, be empathic? It would be an empathic kind of behavior. But you see, we're living in different times right now. And we're living during a time when there's a crusade, a turbocharged crusade, I would say, that seeks to demolish male and female. And part of that crusade, the success of that crusade, I should say, hinges on controlling our language. And so if I, under those circumstances, the way things are right now, to call a man she is giving in to that crusade and in a way joining that crusade. And I'm not going to do that. I emphasize in the book that male and female are permanent. And I urge parents to be honest with their kids and consistent with their kids and to stay grounded in reality, biological reality. And I've always done that and I'm not going to stop right now. So anyway, long story short, Jordan, that was kind of long, but I decided that even though it's cumbersome, that I would avoid pronouns for transgender identifying persons in the book and that I would reject the new vocabulary because I've seen the suffering, which it leads to. And I will simply, I will have no part of it. Right. Well, I think that's a great policy to have. That's one that we, the federalists have to. We prioritize truth and it's true to call a man a man. So thank you, Dr. Miriam Grossman for joining us today. Can you tell everyone where we can find you and your book? Yes, yes. My website is Miriam, M-I-R-I-A-M Grossman G-R-O-S-S-M-A-N-M-D.com.
