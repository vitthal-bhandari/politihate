We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. I want you to take a listen to this. So hundreds of protesters took to the Oklahoma State Capitol on Monday protesting Governor Kevin Stitt for taking a stand to protect minors in his state. He was giving the state of the state a dress where he said this. We must protect our most vulnerable our children. After all, minors can't vote, can't purchase alcohol, can't purchase cigarettes. We shouldn't allow a minor to get a permanent gender altering surgery in Oklahoma. That's why I'm calling for the legislature to send me a bill that bans all gender transition surgeries and hormone therapies, one minors in the state of Oklahoma. We're going to talk to Governor Kevin Stitt who just got reelected about why he's taking a stand on this important issue. We'll also talk to him, Joe Biden has wreaked havoc on our economy. So how does he as a governor fight against those headwinds? We'll also get his take on the Chinese balloon and why Oklahoma has banned Chinese nationals from purchasing farmlands. All of that and more with Oklahoma's Governor Kevin Stitt. Well, Governor Stitt, first of all, congratulations on your reelection. You were doing important things in the state of Oklahoma. So I'm so glad that you've got more time there. So congratulations. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. It's a lot of fun serving your state where you grew up and just having a blast. Well, and you're doing great things including standing up for young people, you know, fighting against this push from society to encourage young people to mutilate their bodies, to take hormones that could potentially lead to infertility and damage them in ways that they're not even thinking of right now. But, you know, of course, it's created a reaction. You know, there's hundreds of protesters gathered at the Oklahoma State Capitol on Monday protesting, you know, protesting on what you're doing. Why was this an important issue for you to take a stand on? Well, first off, you know, we have an obligation to protect our young people. I mean, minors, we're talking about minor children here. They can't buy alcohol, they can't buy cigarettes. And in Oklahoma, we think it's preposterous to let them have a permanent altering surgery that potentially could sterilize them to your point. And so again, we're not against any person. But listen, hey, if you're going to have an elective surgery, let's wait till you're an adult, your mind is fully developed to go do that because we don't want that to happen in the state of Oklahoma. You know, overwhelmingly, Oklahoma's agree with me. This is just common sense to us. And you're always going to have a few naysayers, but we don't want that effectiveness for, you know, continuing to do what's right. You know, we're saying in society, you just culturally really this push for young people saying that this is okay. And to your point, you know, you can't buy alcohol in your minor, you can't purchase cigarettes. So why is it okay to allow a minor to mutilate their bodies at such a young age? Well, we don't think it is. And last year, when I found out there was a, there was like a clinic in one of our university hospitals, I found an executive order to shut that down and then ask the legislature to codify that in law this year. And it's going to be on my desk within the first couple weeks here of session because Oklahoma's overwhelmingly support me on this. And again, we're talking about kids under the age of 18. Why would we let them do that? There's not another procedure in the country. There's no other procedure I can think about where you would go into a doctor's office, self diagnose yourself, and then also prescribe the surgery you want. It's just it's nonsense. We're not going to let it happen. This is this something that's an elective surgery for for after you're fully developed and you're you're an adult and you want to go make some kind of decision. But we don't want even taxpayer dollars spent on that. I appreciate that. I think you're doing the right thing on that. You know, I also wanted to ask you, of course, you know, if you get the state of the union this week, Joe Biden's going to try to make claims that aren't true about the the economy. Somehow he has created this strong economy. We know that it's not, you know, you've got a record number of Americans saying they're worse off financially since Biden took office. You know, as a governor, how do you fight against those headwinds? You know, those national headwinds and this economy that Joe Biden's created. We talked about in Oklahoma, I mean, we are Oklahoma masking for tax cuts. We want to continue to be the most business friendly state in the country. And if you look, we're top top 10 right now in net migration people move into our state because they're fleeing some of the high tax states. They're fleeing some of the Democratic led states because they're seeing our pro business, pro freedom policies in states like Oklahoma, but inflation before Biden was at 1.4 percent. And now it is 6.5 percent. And this was in my state of the state address that I just did yesterday. I mean, before the pandemic, a gallon of milk is is is 290 something like that. And now it's 421 eggs were $1.50 now they're 550. So there's some real issues with inflation right now. And then you can all point it back to the attack on oil and gas and not having an honest conversation about about a reliable energy grid and an affordable energy grid with domestic energy production from oil and gas companies as well as wind and kind of on all of the above approach that we have in Oklahoma. Well, you know, and that's the thing, you know, Biden can say whatever he wants. You can have Pete Buttigieg go to the Sunday shows which he did over the weekend, you know, trying to tout something that doesn't exist. We all know it's not a strong economy, or at least not nationally. How bad are Americans struggling right now? You know, how difficult do you think that's going to be for them to try to sell something when we all know that we're paying more each month because of inflation, you know, you go to the gas station, you're paying more. We see it with our own eyes. That's right. And then, you know, obviously, you know, the borrowing cost are really, really starting to affect the average person, business borrowing cost, home prices. We're starting to see a slump in home prices because of raising interest rates. So all that stuff goes into effect. We've got to let the free market flourish. And when government and these type of policies continue to clamp down and over regulate things and try to pick winners and losers, who's harmed? It's actually the American people are harmed by paying higher at the gas pump, because the same, the same people that they say that they're trying to protect are actually harming with the cost of everyday items right now in the, in the state and also in the country. You know, I also wanted to get your take. We also as the Chinese balloon, which was a spying balloon, you know, violated our aerospace, flying over nuclear silos, air force bases, and you know, they were going to withhold it from us, the Biden administration took a week to shoot down. You were taking a stand in Oklahoma by making it illegal for, you know, the Communist Party of China to purchase farmland in the state of Oklahoma. Why do you think that's important to not allow that to fight that? And like you said, we made it illegal for Chinese nationals to purchase farmland in the state of Oklahoma. We're cracking down on that. I ban TikTok from all of our state devices. You know, they're an adversary of ours and they share information from these companies. So we're not going to let that happen in our state. The Chinese balloon is a real head scratcher, myself and all the Republican governors across the country just could not understand. We got brief. We called the DOD. What's happening? I called my National Guard to find out what our options were if it came into the state of Oklahoma. But this is something that is really the American people should be asking ourselves. Why was it not shot down before it came over? Why would we allow that to happen? And those are things that, I mean, elections matter. And you can look at the different leadership between what's happening right now with what we happened four years ago or several years ago with President Trump. And hopefully we take back the White House in 2024. I joked sadly, but it's true. You know, might as well have been shaped as a middle finger because that was essentially the message China was sending us, you know, they did it because they could, because we have a weak president. I wanted to ask you, I've been wondering this, what authority does it, would you be able to as governor instruct the National Guard to shoot it down? Or how would that work? Well, obviously, as a commander in chief of our National Guard, we've got a, you know, F16s at our air base at our National Guard base in Tulsa. And that's something that's a it's a huge question that we would have to obviously be in consultation with the big army and the Department of Defense. But, you know, I don't I don't have a direct answer for you. Thankfully, it did not come into the state of Oklahoma and I didn't have to make that decision. But it's something that I'm actually checking on as we speak and talking to our, to our generals. But the big question is, why is our president not taking care of it before came into Montana? I mean, I think for a lot of Americans, right, I talked to people, you know, even I was at the airport at a restaurant, you know, waiting my flight and everyone has been paying attention to this thing. And there's just this sentiment that we're not as strong as we used to be, you know, that this is a sign of weakness for America. And I think it's understood for all Americans, whether, you know, regardless how much attention they paid to the media or to politics. And I think we all kind of shared the same sentiment of just feeling like we're not America anymore. You know, we're not the strong country we used to be. I mean, that's exactly right. You know, Afghanistan exit. I mean, we kind of forget about that. But think about how disheartening that was, as we withdrew everything from Afghanistan, and we saw these people hanging on to airplanes. We just left our friends and allies behind and people that fought for us and broke our word. And they were holding on to airplanes because they knew they were losing their chance for freedom. We saw moms handing their, their child over to a serviceman, just hoping that they could get them to freedom. So very, very disappointing, not counting the billions and billions of dollars worth of assets that we left there. So again, all these kind of things are just head scratchers to us and what's going on. But you're right. And then to let the Chinese fly a spy balloon, a balloon, and just kind of track it slowly over the US. We're like, why? Why would we allow that? Why would we allow that? Do you think they would allow that? Allow us to fly a balloon over their country? Well, and I think it really just comes down to showing America and how important leadership is. You know, it's important to have a strong president. It's important to have strong governors like you. Leadership matters. 100% does. Leadership does matter. That's why it's so important. These elections are so important for us to think about. And do you believe in freedoms? Do you believe in a free market system? Do you believe in personal responsibilities? Or do you want a government telling everybody how to live their lives? What to do? No, we don't want that. And that's why you see people flooding to states like Oklahoma and Texas and Tennessee and Florida. And in these states that were free, I was one of the only governors in the country that refused to do a mask mandate when I saw this overreach from Washington, DC trying to tell everybody how to live their lives. And and we're going to push back against the Washington, DC bureaucrat. Governor Kevin Stitt, I know you've got a tight schedule today. We appreciate you making time for the show. And we appreciate you taking a stand in the state of Oklahoma. So thank you for what you do. Hey, thank you so much, Lisa. And thanks for sharing truth with with Americans. We stand behind you. That was Governor Kevin Stitt. He's doing a lot of really great things out of the state of Oklahoma. He just got reelected. And thank God for that. We need strong governors like him, like Governor DeSantis, Governor Kim Reynolds out of Iowa, who we've had on the show. We need people like them standing up for freedoms here in America and in their states. I want to thank you at home for listening as well, Monday and Thursday. But you can listen throughout the week.
