    "text": " And we're back with an all new keep it. I'm Iron Madison the third. I'm birthday boy, Louis Fertel. Oh my goodness. Yes, it's Louis's birthday. He's turning 86 guys, which makes him the same age as like Shirley McLean. That's the last. OK. Happy birthday, Louis. And my name is Aida Osman. Thank you, Aida. We're supposed to say happy birthday to you, bitch. I know it was coming too. I had a whole thing. I was going to commend you. But here you go. Truly was coming. You couldn't wait. No. No. And now you've ruined it. I know you hate astrology, but you are more and more Leo every time you speak. I'm just saying. That is not untrue. No, no, no. I accept my fate. And again, I have the Leo condition of believing Leo is the only sign that means anything. So I know astrology is a little bit true. I'm turning 34, and my references are turning 175. So enjoy. But happy birthday to our white prince, second only to Timothy Chalamet. You're right. I like being a runner up to him. That's it. I have a lot of other white princes. Oh, really? Maybe that's part of the problem. See? You need to cut off some white princes. I could say you need to come to the red table to talk about the white prince problem in your life. But yes, for your birthday, I'm going to be replaying that viral video of you on Jeopardy, like for 10 hours straight. I was talking with Ayita about that video earlier when I was on Jeopardy, got a daily double snapped. I would like to say like, Oh, what a kitschy moment you caught of me on camera. Actually no, nothing could be more telling about me. It literally is definitive of who I am. Just keep watching that. Yeah. The competitiveness, the narcissism, like it's the confidence I crave and wish I had. You know what I'm going to do, Ayita? I'm going to send you some YouTube links to Lewis's old video series. Oh, that Adam Ripon brought up verbal voguing. Yes. You'll learn about it. It was called verbal voguing. Verbal voguing, child. The gayness jumped out. If I were to host that show now, might not call it verbal voguing, whatever, but you will see Ayita. You will see Ayita Osmond in terms of profanity and quote unquote going there. Maybe our brands overlap more than you think. Okay, Lewis. I really want to see that I want the perversion. I love it. She really did like it. I just thought it was right there. His hair at that point too was a marvel. Well, I noticed it like literally was like Newton's fourth law, the way to fight gravity and physics and all types. So like I need to understand how you got it to be that high. I really did a Jimmy Neutron thing for a long, long time. You really did. Yeah. And it was him talking about pop culture and you know, making snappy comments and many of the references that he makes now, but more, more, more wild. Lewis has toned down. Thank God. Thank God we have keep it so we can temper him and tone it because this is like you just free range Lewis. No. Wow. Yeah, you're getting adult contemporary Lewis right now before it was like gritty R&B Lewis. Yeah. And he's bouncing off black people with sense. Sense with sense with sense. Keep in man line. I feel like you were still making those videos when I met you. Yeah, I did it. I only did like 12 or 13 of them, but I probably did it well into 2012. So I think I knew you then. Yeah, that makes sense. But that was the reason anything happened to me. I was like a blogger at a bunch of places that don't exist anymore. And then I started making videos and then I got on like Chelsea lately and then I wrote for Billy on the street. Now I'm here with you guys delivered to listeners. Delivered. Yeah. We have an exciting episode just for Lewis's birthday. Truly. Yes. We have Bob the drag queen joining us. Legend. I watched that season with baited breath every week. He was constantly hilarious in a way that in a way few queens are on the show. I hate to say like really truly consistent. Maybe you can show Bob some your verbal voguing videos. Oh, I'm sure he's quite familiar. I'm kidding. There's no way he's familiar. They were also formative to him as a queer youth just like Adam Ripley. Also we're going to get into this Ellen business. If she still has one. If she still has an Ellen business. Also there are layers to this like the versions of expose that have come out. Each one deserves its own repulsed reaction. There have been updates within the hour too. So I might have to be googling while we record their thing coming out. Yeah. We may just have to watch keep it Ellen edition where every day there's a daily update to what's going on with Ellen DeGeneres. We can call it Ellen not so generous. There we see. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Exactly. Producer Aida. But before that we're going to talk about some culture including black and white. Black is King from the Beyonce. We'll be right back. The gods of music have blessed us with much to discuss this week. Who have we been listening to y'all before we get into what I've been watching nonstop which is black is king. Nonstop girl. Okay. We will get into that. But right now I mean I can't not mention Brandi's new album that I've been playing on absolute review. Yes. B7. B7. It's so good bro. It's so amazing. It's just I've never had a laughing attack to a name of a track but her last track by bipolar killed me. Absolutely killed me. Absolutely killed me. Baby mama with Chance the Rapper. Chance needs to chill. Baby mama is a wonderful song. Borderline. Beautiful track. Everything was just so wonderful. And I mean Brandi has been making music since she came out of the womb but watching her mature into this mother woman goddess that she is. I love this track. Love this album. Love everything about B7. Also I will say a bi bipolar which sounds like a gimmick track when you hear the title. It's my favorite song on the album. It really is. She also has a very interesting history of being articulate and super explicit about things that are happening to her. She has a song, Ira helped me out here. I think it's on Afro DCAC where she talks specifically about whether or not she should stay in the music business and is just literally weighing the options. She's like, should I go? Should I go? Should I go? Should I go? Very the clash. Very London Brandi calling. Atlanta calling. It's her final track on Afro DCAC as well. She listened. Those final tracks on a Brandi album will give you something to chew on. I actually really, really enjoy B7. I don't like the video for borderline where she is in a psych ward wrapped up in a straight jacket. I was like, this feels very TRL 2001. Yes. Drive myself crazy in sync. That's what you're talking about. Yeah. I just don't know how much I trust Brandi to handle issues like this in the way that they need to be multifaceted and textured. But she did give the girls something to eat. I mean, she gave us more than in a moose booth. But, you know, there's an entree. Padma, that is enough. Thank you. I'm from T's. What I really enjoy too is just spending this week diving back into Brandi's discography. My best friend who got me into Sufion the past few weeks. I've been getting him into Brandi. Yes. This white black tradeoff. I know. The Silk Road of music. The color of French. Yeah. But because it was prompted to by remembering that old Solange tweet about Brandi, do you remember them? Oh, maybe. She was going off on white indie music critics and she said, right, this was in 2013. She said some of these music blogs could actually benefit from hiring people who really understand the culture of R&B to write about R&B. Like, you should really know about Brandi deep cuts before you give a grade or a score to any R&B artist. And then three years later, she followed it up with, last few days has brought up so much emotion recalling when it was made a joke by indie white guys that I brought up Brandi album cuts. When, to be honest, don't you ever dare speak that six letter name without understanding the value. The blast for me. The blast for me. I mean, true. She is called in the game like the vocal Bible. Brandi is fantastic. And I included on the playlist the songs that you would know like, you know, best friend, almost doesn't count. I want to be down. But I also have like, where you want to be, you know, like, I'm so sick. Piano man, you know, like, I've really been getting into 2011 this past week that really underrated album of her. The one that has that meme of her on 106 and Park where they give everyone in the audience a free album, but we need the audience to buy the album. And she looks panicked. Like this is all on TV. It's also been a joy having more. We should back on TV. Oh, please. Yeah. It hit Netflix and I've been watching it. And if you haven't seen it, you should watch it and early keep it. I'll just say keep it to the very boomer mentality of older people complaining about young people watching like, we should for the first time and pointing out that like, there's fat phobic jokes in it, you know, like maybe there is some like misogyny in some of these jokes. I'm like, I promise people discovering mawisha is not going to ruin the show for you. Yeah. Rubble in the fact that we're getting anti-Sharolie Ralph back in the conversation, you know, please, please. Also, she ruined her own show. Sorry, spoiler alert. The last season, Shirley Ralph left because Brandi and her mom got executive producer control of the show and then they introduced a plot line where Frank, the dad had a son out of wedlock from his previous marriage and Ray J played that kid. And Shirley Ralph reportedly hated that storyline and what they did to that character and the family that she's only recurring in the final season. I'm sad. You know too much, first of all. You know too much. You really, truly know too much. Call me a Hitchcock film. The only film he remade, yes. I will never underestimate what the Norwoods have done for every facet of pop culture, whether it's music, TV, just absolutely obsessed. Ray J. and Kim Kardashian. Ray J. Like the Norwoods are the blueprint for pop culture. Of everything. Of the porn industry, of every industry. And also frustrating that people would go on Twitter and warn us about like, warn younger generations who maybe didn't grow up seeing Mowisha as if we don't have a context of the times. And it just kind of inflates this idea that we are just exaggerating our issues with real problems in writing and pop culture. If anything were smarter than like say that gone with the win conversation. People like needing a disclaimer before watching a movie like that and knowing like, oh this movie is racist. Like we can watch back and know some of these jokes and things are like fucked up, but we can also still enjoy it and keep it moving. I'm going to say we're still watching friends, right? Right. They got it. Right. I just want to add also that when I was in high school, the big brandy song was what about, which is one of the few songs I can think of that I thought was so annoying. And then I heard it enough times and then it became good. That's my feeling about that song. I will also point out that when you play what about now, it sounds completely modern. Yes, I know I agree. It sounded annoying and like electronic back then. But now it sounds exactly where music sort of went. And I feel like she anticipated a lot of stuff like that. I mean, Afro-DZ-Act, a perfect album, has like, Coldplay samples and then she has our other song I tried where she mentions Coldplay. And I credit brandy with me becoming a Coldplay fan. Yeah, speaking of indie white men, maybe some do like brandy. Yeah, I just brandy growing up, I would play her out. Like my mother would be sick of her just me trying to get all the little runs and try and make myself sound exactly like brandy. She really is like we said, the vocal Bible. Like I studied her bibliomantically every day. Even today, I don't really go nowhere without playing. I want to be down because every day, bitch, I want to be down. I want to go. The feel of that song. I mean, that's just, it's an era of R&B I miss. You know, like back and forth by Aliyah. That kind of like easy party. I just really enjoy that. Yeah, kickback R&B music. Right now, R&B music is, I mean, it's still great. Like, you know, Kalani's album, Janae Ico's album. But those are more chill and... Athereal fairy. Yes, there's like a transcendent quality to the relaxing. Yes. Niss of it. Yeah. Lexa Pro, music. It's gonna be warm. Sometimes I don't want to be sedated. Come on. That's your book. Here we go. Executive producer Ayaena and author. Beyonce, I'm coming for the crown. Yes, well, speaking of Beyonce, you know, she did drop. Black is King, the visual album to the gift, her Lion King compilation soundtrack. And you know, it is her and a bunch of African artists on it. You remember when it dropped? She's only on a few of the songs and it's really sort of just like highlighting different artists from Africa. And it was in conjunction with the release of the Lion King. And we sort of just thought it was, oh, here's just an album from B, you know. But now here comes this whole visual component to it. And I really enjoyed it. I will actually say that it is not lemonade for me. Oh, yeah. It is not lemonade. My enjoyment of it is much lower. That I understand. To be honest, but I did enjoy it. If only because lemonade prepared you for what this is. Like we already know what a visual album looks like from her now. And this is basically if you had it described you, you could kind of guess what it would be. It really is highlighting a lot of different African artists. It really has the majesty of a live action Lion King in certain ways. Like just looking at water, for example, you know, just like there's like a lot of moody, atmospheric, nature looking things going on. That said, lemonade was also very intent on giving you the songs. And I feel like there's not really a standout track here. Yeah, I would say if I had to pick one, it's brown skin girl. But other than that, here's what I think about black is king. You all know I was excited. We talked about it a couple of weeks ago on Keep It. And I probably broke my Apple TV remote trying to play it when Disney Plus actually put it up. But I think girl, it does too much. It does too much. It does too many visuals, too many sequence. Don't know what the hell it's supposed to be about. I know what it's about in its essence. It's about the Lion King. Yes. But it's also muddled. Very much so. It's about the entire thing I kept being like, is she alive? Is she dead? What is the story narratively? It's the baby Moses. What it like they needed like a story editor, someone to just like this is how we get from A to B. But great gowns. That's true. A lot of it too is imagery that we're not familiar with because it's from Yoruba culture or it's Nigerian culture. And a lot of it is Easter egg. So I'm going to have to go back and watch it a million times to understand how she's subverting all this imagery and trying to make strong claims. But it's not readily visible when I watch Black is King the first time. What I would actually say is unfortunately I don't feel like there's much subversion going on in Black is King. Actually I feel like it is a beautiful adornment in a rich tapestry of cultures. Although it was pointed out that a lot of the designers are white. New it. Unfortunately. That was in the New York Times piece on it. But I would say that a lot of it is just repurposing this idea of inherited royalty. For Black people that's a thing that's also on the song Crown I believe on Magna Carta, Holy Grail of Jay Z's which is then repurposed onto Beyonce's flawless. The idea that Black people were descended from Kings and Queens and slavery and the diaspora ripped so much of this lineage from us. And Damon Young from Very Smart Brothers sort of articulated how I've always felt about that in a piece recently just this idea that like listen we didn't all come from royalty. Exactly. Exactly. Like just statistically speaking we did not. If you put the chart together. Nor did we all come from Africa like this very specific. Also the fact that like do we want to have all come from royalty? Because royalty in general is just not really a good thing. Really? You know and it's not merit based it's birth based and you know it's like maybe there were some good people in the context of rule but you know like. Girl we know Jay Z. For the most part people of the ruling class were probably not great. Surely. And we know Jay Z's a hotel. We know that about him. That's undeniable. And I think that the only thing that I was saying when I think that it subverted some imagery there was a very specific song and this is again speaks to the problem about Black is King I don't know what the song is called but it's the one where they're celebrating Black hair and they have Black men in the old constitutional wigs that were worn by the judges in like American Revolution times and that's the only time that I think that she was really very easily trying to get at something that I felt like I could grasp at. But other than that. I can also say Brown skin girl too you know because that has the like the cotillians which is very reminiscent of Jack and Jill which historically. So if you read Margot Jeffers it's Negro and historically has just been sort of about like Black people who could pass the paperback test. So you know really sort of highlighting Brown skin girl you know with that imagery is also a subversion but you know I mean like the a lot of the other stuff was just like a doorman in high fashion and you know like like mood forever one of my favorites of it is you know like this mansion and you know it's got this like 1940s style swimming scene and you know like old holler I'm like that that is great and I also loved power. I will say the one thing that she really did is introducing me to new artists. Yeah. It's just the point of this. It's very about dissentering her herself. Yes. I never really listened to Yimmee Alade before and I love listening to her music now you know I was introduced to her on No Jealous Me and Power and that I think if the intent is to introduce her audience a Black listeners to other artists from Africa you know like this Nigerian artist like I think then her job was done. Yeah. That personal story intent that Lemonade had and honestly that Homecoming had which I think was actually I love even more than Lemonade you know because Homecoming is a narrative of the concert but also what it took to get her to there and so it had a built in narrative. This one felt a lot like life is beautiful which I felt like was a documentary that was also muddled and sort of a mess. We can fully admit that now. One thing I will say about it being having some personal moments is when she brought in Kelly Rowland and it wasn't just like here's Kelly Rowland but here's basically a tribute to Kelly Rowland that I thought was very very cool. Love seeing of course Lupita. Imagine Lupita not like being radiant in something like Naomi. Yes. Yes Naomi. Guys blue Ivy is here. She is grown and ready to go and ready to perform like she is here here. I'm very excited about it all. I would say the only thing that quote unquote took me out of it was that I don't find the movie the Lion King to be wise so when there are like snippets from the movie I'm not taking much from it especially when out of nowhere I hear Billy Eichner's voice in the house. Billy Eichner took me out of Black is King. That's a man I gossip with about Ava Gardner and here he is now. The snippets of Lion King were really not it for me and I get that it is a Disney production and I get that she was probably given all this money to make Black is King because of this Lion King connection but the Lion King stuff takes me out of it. Also just like sort of lemonade she uses war songs poetry again but it also just didn't really fit for me in this story the way that it didn't lemonade. It felt more personal in lemonade. I really feel like Black is King did what it needed to do within the confines of what she was given and what she was intending to do but I have to mention the no name of it all only because there is this strange thing that's occurring now in an effort to find our roots and to understand blackness. All the black rich people are like man some moosifying themselves and trying to africanize themselves beyond what I think is comfortable to watch. It is very ironic for me to see Black is King that has themes about water and how rich Africa is and in that same night I am trying to what's at my cousins in Africa to make sure that their dictator has plumbing on in the country. There are so many it's very interesting that Disney Plus isn't offered in Africa who's going to see that who's going to see that over there. Wifi is scarce. There are so many contradictions that are inherent in making this thing at all but I understand in that same vein that I'm happy it was made and I'm happy that a lot of black women and little black girls get to see how beautiful and how beautifully done this project is. My also response to that though of the no name of it all is like we're sort of in this place you know where everyone wants to yes you know like black wealth is capitalism you know like black wealth isn't liberation these sort of conversations but I also like would say that that's a lot of things in just popular culture in general and there's always this like nagging sense of like focusing on Beyonce which I think no name does too much to be honest. And when hip hop culture in general and so many other things like are about the propagation of wealth you know like you can listen to any sort of song and it's about like even a Megan song you know it's about like yeah my bank account you know things like that you know it's like that's just the culture that we have it is carried within that music that some people subvert and some people don't and I just think that there's a way to spread the wealth in the criticism that isn't always focused on Beyonce. And I would also say that I've always enjoyed when she does that in a sense because the thing that I enjoyed the most about Beyonce projects is when she sort of subverts gender and has like her King B personality you know like when she had bowed down and stuff it was like her existing in this male dominated world and giving you some sort of gender flipped resonance unfortunately there's not really much of that in this because it's Disney and it's fitting the Lion King story it's very patriarchal in nature. Which that is also what I found a little disappointed. And by the way you are on record as saying you don't like the song if I were a boy but you are right. So I'll allow you to keep it's a bad song. All right when we're back Bob the Drag Queen. Our guest today is a champion, a comedian and an activist and after winning season eight of Drag Race is now on the Emmy nominated and recently renewed we're here on HBO. Hi Bob the Drag Queen. Hi how are you? We're good. It's so great to have you here. Thanks for having me. Bob I was saying at the beginning of the podcast that you were one of the few Drag Queens who on RuPaul's Drag Race who from the minute you stepped on the comedy was so in place and so did not need to quote unquote mature. Like you just kept it up throughout the entire season and I always wonder if you were self conscious of the fact that I feel like a winning narrative on Drag Race is always that you really saw the improvement from week to week when in fact you were just so consistent. Did you ever worry like oh I have to like make a show of quote unquote getting better at what I'm doing. I always tell people if you're going to a competition the best thing you can do especially if it's on TV is just try to win and try to play with integrity. But if you try to like create a story or emulate something you've seen already is you're really going to have a hard time on a rude awakening. Wendy Pepper season one of Project Runway that was her downfall as far as I'm concerned. Thank you for putting your finger on. You know it's a Wendy. Someone had to say it calling out Wendy Pepper right now. This is the podcast is going to bring down Wendy Pepper. She deserves it. By the way she passed away so I'm not upending anything. Yes. Attack of dead people Lewis. Really fighting the good fight and you know we got some we're coming up for Dave Thomas next. I got a bone to pick up at my spicy chicken sandwich Dave. The crazy thing about Dave Thomas is that he had other daughters but only one that he named a restaurant chain after it concerns me. You know about Wendy's chicken sandwiches are famous but we don't know much about Amanda's much less popular. See chicken pot pie company right because people weren't interested in those and then his son Brandon had a burrito company. Right. No one Brandon's and Amanda's did not thrive but Wendy she came through. You know chicken pot pies are just really hard to like get through the drive through. Right. It's shake. Right. Think of the consistency of fun. Yes. And his wife had a whole sheet cake. It was all family. Wendy came through the front of Wendy. The thing I would say I really also enjoy about we're here which we talked about on the show recently. The idea that it is expanding this narrative of queer stories that are on TV. Oh yeah. It's very interesting watching it in contrast to say like a queer eye which has been about historically from the original queer eye just like showing straight people you know like this is what queer people can be like and what they can do for you and they can also help you know you design your kitchen. But this is what then you all finding queer people in small towns who are living lives not dissimilar from the ones that we have in bigger cities but they got some other shit going on you know like they're walking past Trump and science you know. And Confederate flags and all that stuff and that's no shade to queer eye. I think queer eye especially queer eye for the straight guy the original was a landmark show for queers and really helped people see queers for who we are. And I think Carson Krustley and the entire cast and Jay and everyone for that show all the time because it quite frankly paved the way for shows that tell queer stories like RuPaul's Drag Race like we're here like a pose I believe that that show helped with the queer show that tell queer storylines. No it reminds me a lot of when I think Joe Biden had mentioned that it was watching Will and Grace that sort of like helped people around him sort of like realize oh gay people like they're yeah people you know that and we're coming into people's homes. I mean if that's real to them that's real to them you know I mean if that's their truth then that's their truth I mean I heard it say Will and Grace didn't do their fee. I know I love Will and Grace as a child I know that I related to Will and Grace with friends at school and my mom would watch it together with me. So when you're going into these towns and you're meeting queer people who are you know like in these small towns where they're dealing with all of that stuff what is that like even addressing you know someone when you're like yes this person like maybe likes the same how culture is me maybe has the same conversations with their friends I think there was that one episode too where that kid who was having the trouble with his mom was really sort of like key king with like his black gay friend there too and the other queer friends at that one restaurant and it was just like seeing how oh it was in Louisiana Russ in Louisiana he was shangelous for his name was yeah it was nice seeing you know like these communities that are existing in these other cities but you know like how do you even go in and approach like talking to someone first just when you're first meeting these people on the show. I mean there's I don't know there's a whole science to it I just kind of introduced myself away I would introduce myself to anyone I would just say hi how are you my name Bob and then I talk about what we're doing here and that's how I was working with Stacy who was a former fire fire like a retired firefighter and I don't overcomplicate it I just say hi and introduce myself I think that's where you get you have an opportunity to really get in your head too much because a lot of people think that we're going to these houses to help people like our goal is to go and like help these people but it's really just to uplift their voices so they can continue helping their communities it's not about us these Hollywood saviors coming in and saving this town it's just about us relating to people who have something in common with us and amplifying their voices. One thing that the show dives into obviously lightly is a lot of the political stuff that goes on in these cities how do you feel you know as a queen now especially in a world where you know we are asking more people in pop culture to be more politically knowledgeable specifically drag queens you know I feel like black ones you know obviously are always talking about these things but you know how has it been for you navigating this as someone who's come from drag race. I mean I've always been political with my drag so that doesn't seem new to me I do think that people are waking up becoming more woke to a lot of the injustices that their fellow citizens go through every single day and I think that what's happening is like once the sheets pulled away you can't put it back you know I mean people are seeing things for the first time and I think people who like have been political for a long time the reason why they've been political was along because they know they've seen too much and now they can't go back to ignoring things. What's your favorite way about the show has evolved or maybe hasn't evolved? I wish that we could see a bigger diversity across the gender spectrum in its casting. I am not interested in also in joining in the erasure of all the amazing trans people and non-binary people who have been on RuPaul's drag race because we have some amazing people like St. Celine Matthews, Pepper Met, Jekylli Coliente, Kenya Michaels, some really amazing trans women also as well as non-binary people myself, Shekulei, Sasha Velour, Aja across the gender spectrum so there has been that and I don't want to engage in that erasure but I wish that the stigma wasn't on the brand in general. I'm really excited to see that some of the things that people have come to with concerns have been addressed you know when they change the oo girl she got I'm glad that's not still there and I would like to see more of that. You brought up Pepper Met and you two you know have your show together which I really enjoyed watching and then you obviously had viral moments you know like the fracking joke moment between you two but like have people reached out who maybe are other queens asking like maybe how they can get involved recently or just like better ways that they can be allies to other black queens who've been on the show because I feel like talking about the pulling back people are starting to realize you know that like the fan base even treats black and white queens differently. There was a moment maybe in the two weeks following George Floyd's death where I was getting a call or text per day asking me what to do and I was like this too much it was like I can't tell every I can't tell every white person what to do. I was like you get at some point y'all are going to have to do research you're going to have to because I can't I literally can't even. So yeah lots of folks have been reaching out asking what to do and I was like the thing is you know like you know you just want me to tell you. Yeah that's been one of the whole things about this current era you know obviously there are people whose job it is to enlighten people. I've always said that you know like on this show when we talk about issues you know I'm saying it because I want people to learn something but there's also people who just don't know that we all have the same Google. Yeah sure. Are there things that don't get into the episode on we are here that obviously you're fitting it into just an hour's show but what hits the cutting room floor that you wish got into the show more if anything. I mean we shoot for nine days and we do a one-hour episode so most of the stuff is on the cutting room floor. I don't remember missing anything being like oh why didn't they show that in the first episode we shot for 15 days it was our pilot. So we did so much stuff that didn't make it in there. One of my favorite moments was we went to this like you know living historian there are these people who like kind of live like they did back in the days. Oh yeah. So there are these living historians these ladies who run this house in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. We went in there and there's like if you go to one of these historical houses you can like go in but then there's like roped off right at the door so you can't actually go in and touch stuff. So there's one room that we go to and the lady was like we never do this but we'll we'll let you all see what's in here. So we undid the little velvet rope when we all went in we went around and then the first stop she goes and this quilt is about 200 years old. It is the pride and joy of our establishment and we cannot believe that we are the ones looking up to have it. And we all just keep walking except Shangela. Shangela stays back and she's admiring this quilt and we're all looking at something else like a chair or a table and behind us we just hear and we're like what what in Shangela has knocked down this 200 year old quilt after the ladies made such a big deal of how like remarkable and delicate it was and for the rest of the tour I was just like mortified is the only word I could use to describe how it was mortified. What the fuck did she do? I throw herself out of her. All she did was touch it but none of us were looking at it. It was just Shangela. So according to Shangela all she did was like first of all why would you even touch this the lady said it was hundreds of years old why are you touching the ladies? That was wild. That is like the people who have the need to touch a thing in a museum I've never got that. Well I will say that what I do have a need in the museum is if you go to the Met when you get close to a piece it just big goes big. If you just get too close it goes big and I remember being in the Met thinking to myself like I want to get beeped once. I want to just be beeped at least one time. Well I mean I got beeped twice so I feel pretty good. I've never I've never beeped I don't think but I've definitely had the ones where like the security guards are like extra watchful and you're looking at something and they're like hey I love that I'm not I'm not Pierce Bros and I'm not I'm not gonna steal a painter. I think I got beeped on a Georgia O'Keeffe. If it was a Georgia O'Keeffe out school it should have moved when you got close to it. It should have but it was one of the it was one of the vaginal paintings. Love those love those. I feel like I did not know what they were in school but I'm from Milwaukee and like there were constant in like my elementary school like paintings of like Georgia O'Keeffe's around. They're like well Ira this is one of our amazing pussy paintings we have on our own. You know how those breed posters in most high schools we have Georgia O'Keeffe posters that just say pussy on them. Pussy pussy pussy. But speaking of museums and shit like you are a person who is um for most people part of their pop culture you know like we watched you on the show when we think about culture and things we watch like you are heavily involved in it what is the stuff that you like to consume like what feeds you what you're like girl that's inspiring me or stuff that you like to watch that you're just like whatever it's just me watching this all Saturday. I love art but I love like trash and so I'm like recently I've been really obsessed with this series the genre of YouTube and his YouTubers doing videos about other YouTubers and I cannot stop watching them. One of my favorite challenges is this kid named Pre-Mink and Pre-Mink never shows his face and he just does videos about other YouTubers specifically if they're problematic or if they have it out with their fans and I don't know it's just so intriguing to me like I'm obsessed with it. I just I watch hours and these videos are like 40 minutes long and I watch like three in a row they're great. We talked about one recently like Tati Westbrook do you know her? Do I know Tati? Listen the funny thing is I actually don't watch the videos of the YouTubers I only watch the videos about the YouTubers if it makes any sense. So I'm not really familiar with Tati Westbrook's work I'm just familiar with her drama because I was so intrigued by this whole James Charles thing and how in the beginning he was really not doing well but who would have predicted that a year later he would come out smelling like fucking roses like who would have assumed that he could be deep in all this shit and come out smelling like fucking Estee Lauder perfume you know? No I totally agree by the way like I don't think I could sit through a Tati Westbrook video or whatever but underneath that video every time are like 50 minute responses that are like meticulously crafted seemingly by like somebody who understands television like they know I'm continuing to pay attention even though I don't literally know who she is. It's shocking. That's what it is it's so interesting but these documentaries these little documentaries are these little tell-alls they tell you who they are and then tell you why they are how they are so you get the whole it's like watching feud you don't have to actually watch every single Joan Crawford in Betty Davis movie but if you watch feud you get caught up real quick in like eight episodes. So people should watch feud for Judy Davis yes. Well also what's her name who just passed away Olivia de Havlin who passed away at 104 anyway well I mean she's not any of it it's about her anyway I also outside of the smut I do really get interested in watching documentaries and I've been intrigued I think that either Netflix and Hulu and all those things either know that I'm watching or they're just all pushing their black social awareness content to the front because it's always there man I watch I watch all of it like I watch all of it 13th is still my favorite one also have you seen when they see us yeah oh yeah the fact that when they see us did not sweep the Emmy Awards last year is the oddest thing I think it is probably one of the best scripted shows I've seen ever top three for sure. Well the title I guess was appropriate right I have not seen it yet. When they see us yeah we're gonna get the image that it'll get that it'll look some late image. Yeah exactly but it's brilliant and there's two Avery Duvernay pics that I've just called up now so. Oh right yeah I think 13th is my favorite thing she's done I didn't watch all of when they see us but 13th is also like the most information per minute in a documentary maybe ever and you can consume it like it works out that way yeah. Louis you have to go finish this it's only four episodes yeah you have to. No I'm on the first episode yeah I love what's Jorrell Jerome right yeah. Yeah he's oh my god you don't even know you don't even know because that once they get to the girl oh girl that fucking I think of the third one gets you together. And Nissi Nash in it is Nissi fucking and John Leguizamo and and Isis King is so good. All faves so I'm gonna make sure Louis watches Nissi yes I will I will harass him each week. Mmm-hmm so now you just mentioned Nissi Nash and I feel like rewatching Getting On which is one of the weirdest TV shows that ever existed and amazing. I didn't see that but listen Louis you and I will get together on a zoom. All right oh good I curated some questions. Yes. I think I might start doing like monthly black history movie and television like a big zoom party where people join us once a month to learn about like black classics but also the terrible ones too not just like the color purples and the beloveds but we're going on soul plane. Please love a soul plane moment. You know what is one of the craziest black movies that I feel like people nowadays have not seen that goes underestimated in terms of its insanity is mahogany. Oh mahogany is wonderful oh mahogany is such a Diana Ross is so great man movie but yeah that's the thing I'm also going to watch uh have people watch Harlem Knights which is if you ever want to see Eddie Murphy in a fight scene with Delores then I read my mind. I love I love Harlem Knights Harlem Knights is a classic for me. Oh and now you're going to shoot me in my pinky tails. And I would have people watch vampire in Brooklyn. Oh you class it. You know the scene where he walks into the church and yeah and he starts smoking and he goes God damn and everyone just turns around because it's a passive yelled god damn and then he goes uh god damn anyone who doesn't come outside. Praise the one of my more embarrassing moments on this show is Angela Bassett was on and I told her I love vampire in Brooklyn and her initial facial reaction was to look at me like okay why does she do that. I meant it though. I meant it though. Why does she look at you like that. I feel I feel like people don't tell her that often. I feel like people aren't going around telling Angela like vampire in Brooklyn is it. Well folks are probably telling Angela Bassett they love what's love. She probably gets what's love got to do with it more than anything. Yeah maybe a little music of the heart from people. Right. Like yeah I saw Angela Bassett I met Angela Bassett that kind of matter before I was on drag race. I did watch happens live and Angela Bassett Kathy Bates and a few other people from American horse or were there as well and Angela Bassett is like Angela Bassett looks science fiction young. To quote first wise club. It's bananas. No it's like she has that death becomes her potion. For real. Like looks flawless smells moisturized. It doesn't look so moisturized. She's a jar of like sad child tears in her basement she drinks every morning. She has to. If you haven't seen it you need to watch this interview of her. I think it's when she was doing Mission Impossible. She's asked about her workout regimen and it was one of my favorite. Videos that it's ever been seen. It worked. Because they asked what they asked what she eats. I'm like what she does is she goes on this whole like thing about how like doesn't do yoga. She eats like Ezekiel bread. She talks about what she does her weight trading like it is phenomenal. She lied. She's like I want to say that she I drink orphan blood twice a day. I pray to Satan to maintain my youth and beauty. And then I sleep upside down like a bat in my mansion. It wakes up like most for all two. If everyone. Vampire in Brooklyn was a documentary. Exactly. Thank you for being here Bob. Before you go I'll tell you one quick story which it kind of rhymes with that one. So do you know Matteo Lane? He's a dear friend of mine. He's a popular queer comedian. He's one of my best friends. And he was on the red carpet for like Divas, VH1's Divas and Vanessa Williams came up to him. And he said to her like oh my god I really love your Christmas album. And she goes well what's your favorite song? And he goes I can't run up to him. He was like little drummer boy. And she was like I didn't sing little drummer boy. He goes yes you did. And she was like no I did not. He was like you sang little drummer boy. She was like under no circumstances. So he's having this really intense moment with Vanessa Williams. But then he later found out obviously he was mistaken. He was thinking of someone else. Whoa I did not expect that. I did not expect that. But imagine you look like imagine you have Angela Bassett on your show and you accidentally say something like I love you in the movie Rat Race. And she's like I didn't I wasn't in Rat Race. And like the chills that must run through your body. Also the best Vanessa Red Red track is comfort zone. He should have known that from the start. Come on Vanessa Redgrave. Vanessa Williams see now I'm in on it. See now you're now you're on Vanessa Williams shit let's do Vanessa Williams never gonna do now she's never gonna do this fucking podcast. Sorry. She gonna pull out that knife. I love Vanessa Williams. Just cry. I saw her alive once if you go see her alive. She kept mentioning that she go that she went to Syracuse. Like she kept mentioning like over and over and over again that she went to Syracuse. Like it was like Yale. Like she was like well when I was at Syracuse and I was like girl is Syracuse. Like like what are you talking about Syracuse. It's so weird. Like she was like I went to Harvard. I was like all right go on whatever you brought up. So let's go on. All right thank you so much Bob my pleasure. I'm glad we had that Vanessa Williams key kid there and y'all be safe. Well she gonna have some trouble dancing her way out of this one. Girl not dancing. Not dancing her way out of this one. Also the idea of literally dancing your way out of something like out of door. Drop can't stop the feeling and watch Ellen jitterbug away from. I cannot believe the news this week because BuzzFeed News last week published their second story in a month about rampant abuse and misconduct at Ellen DeGeneres's immensely popular talk show. These stories were shocking to absolutely no one at all because we've heard many stories about her attitude and poor treatment of those beneath her and people who work with her. But these reports are very interesting in that they weren't just reports of you know her being like mean to someone right like that old report we heard of like her not being nice to a security guard these were reports of black people at work saying that they faced just sort of like racial insensitivity and microaggressions and then there are also reports about sexual misconduct from producers of hers with other employees so seems like we got some real stuff going on here. I was going to say the first time there was an expose about like behind the scenes stuff. I mean the racial stuff alone was horrifying gross that anybody and especially in a environment where you're putting together a comedy like who wants to put together like a cheery show when you're dealing with that. It just it's it makes it impossible to do your job I think. That initial piece also pointed out to me how hard it is to identify toxicity in a work environment because it wasn't all coming from Ellen it was kind of coming from producers you know are you corroborating this with other people do you have to it just to me I felt for the people articulating what the problem was because that's I work on a talk show myself and if for instance I think I knew in who in HR I would be able to go to but it seemed like these people were confused about what even to do and I was so thankful they had a reporter to report it to. Yeah there's some things to me that's so eerily suspicious about and I get that it's daytime TV but maintaining that level of like jubilant all day every day and then me I have to believe that you go home and they're not a horrible person or you to your staff you're not a horrible person it's just odd to me and there is a also a level of how long is Ellen been doing this for decades there is an exhaustion and she's Ellen just needs to go I'm not justifying her behavior I'm just saying that it's suspicious this is very suspect very suspect and then fife opham here Porsche come talking about I stand by Ellen we know you stand by Ellen girl you sleep by Ellen like that's just lesbian redundancy oh god Porsche Porsche Der Rasi also her instagram post about it also had a horrible font um with just this like blue background and the words I stand by Ellen uh written and then like these hashtags I stand by Ellen I stand with Ellen DeGeneres hashtag stop bot attacks and Ellen is being attacked by by by just bots what that was bewildering that was a crazy response and also by the way I just wouldn't point out an additional strange thing when I went to Porsche Der Rasi's instagram her official description says former actress I did not know that I thought she was still among us doing her thing I loved her I'm better off Ted I do believe it's a loss yeah yeah and then also there's that odd thing that happened with Katy Perry where she defended her today yes this morning Katy Perry is like I you know I can't speak to these stories but Ellen has always been very nice to me you don't say yeah girl what and even right now wouldn't it be weird if she weren't yeah yeah Kevin Hart is tweeting the same shit and it's like do you guys not understand that like murderers have friends of course Kevin Hart shined in because I would say that part of this problem is the fact that she's come out to say nothing about the fact that employees have said that they were subjected to racist remarks like I'm sorry I only know the names of the white people who work here or the fact that people were fired after taking medical leave or bereavement to attend family funerals or that one of her EPs Kevin Lehman you know was accused by 36 former employees of asking if he could give them hand jobs or oral sex or or grabbing PAs penises or groping productions assistance you know like she has not really responded to any of this except for like just been hearing light daily male stories which who knows if you can believe that about maybe she'd want to walk away and it is so telling because if you recall that Kevin Hart situation was people reasonably being mad about him you know having homophobic jokes and simply wanting him to apologize for it and he didn't apologize for it and that's why he ended up not hosting the Oscars but then he went on Ellen's show and they had this whole like rich famous people sit down there was basically a conversation about like why should you have to apologize for anything that was the thrust of it right so here you have a situation that now involves her she doesn't want to apologize or even address it seemingly and it's I think it's really shitty thing to do you know and I think it probably is a sign that those stories about her are true and I say sign like I know they aren't fucking true like yeah they so yeah you know we all have friends who have worked on Ellen actually we do something did bother me about before BuzzFeed got into the picture before it became an official news story I do think there's something strange about posting a tweet to the world that's like well we all know how bad Ellen is and then expecting strangers to chime in okay and fill in the blanks for everybody because by the way I will just say in recent history there was a similar line of twitter based revolt against a celebrity which often ends up being necessary not saying it's 100% a bad thing one of the people who wrote a long response about how this one particular celebrity was terrible to them I personally watch that celebrity get fired from a TV show for treating the host terribly so it's not like everybody who's ever responded to this is necessarily it's not vetted it's all I can say like we're treating this like Yahoo answers and it's actually a serious story you know so just I really appreciate when actual it becomes actual news with that's been vetted and reported I also want to say about Twitter's response to this there's been a lot of talk about who might quote unquote replace Ellen it's a syndicated show I don't know if there'd be technically a replacement but people have been pretty fast about who will replace Ellen and I just want to say it is never in doubt that Ellen is phenomenally talented so I just want to say like the hundreds of thousands of responses as if anybody can sit in the chair and do it it is a grueling job Ellen has the particular gift of being able to tell jokes in very few words with timing that is always surprising like like even at its most basic I do have to say I fucking laugh she really has a gift for saying something strange and having like a quirky timing response that really takes me off guard and makes me laugh so I just want to say let's talk about who's going to replace her if in fact she leaves the show but it's a serious serious talent level she has and I don't mean to paper over however she's treated people if in fact of course but in fact she actually is I think it was just announced this morning that she is coming back to host the 18th season after we get coronavirus figured out so it might not even be a conversation that we have and it's actually unfortunate that the BuzzFeed article and all the things that are coming out really did zilch to affect what was going to happen in the upcoming season well I mean she'll talk about it the way that she talked about the George Bush thing right you know being like talk around I'm friends with people across the aisle you know like really talking around it I will say one of the wilder things about this and maybe this is getting to what Portia was talking about with the hashtag bot attacks she unfortunately happens to be one of the people involved in the insane QAnon conspiracy oh girl I'm trying not to talk about it but let's go I know but it's like QAnon is this insane cult conspiracy of these people online who believe that there are a lot of high profile celebrities who are doing like sex trafficking in minors like pizza gate was a thing that originated from it and Donald Trump is going to save the world listen there is plenty of reading that you could do on this there's one piece of writing in the Atlantic that I would point you to it's called the prophecies of QAnon that sort of like spelled out the whole cultist nature of that whole conspiracy theory for me but Ellen is one of these celebrities at the center of it and so a lot of the responses to our people being like yeah you know take her down for like sex trafficking and I'm like those are being mixed in with the people talking about legitimate concerns so that is insane to me but I think that Ellen is also smart enough to know that this entire thing is not being propagated by QAnon you know I would fucking thank my god but you can read the article or you can DM me I am a new recent new recent pizza gator and I do entertain the conspiracies mostly for entertainment but they're kind of fun so DM me not you going Tracy lets us bug right now I'm gone I'm gone come through DMS is open when we're back keep it and we're back with our favorite segment of the episode it is keep it who's going first we'll let's go first it's his birthday happy birthday thank you thank you thank you uh mine's rail on

life is basically no different than when I was in my 20s and also my life is better um I don't know where that comes from like if you're in your 20s that's the only time you can be cast as a female lead in a transformers movie I don't know like I don't know what values were um propagating espousing in that scenario but I personally in my experience I don't think there's been a moment where life hasn't gotten better I really truly enjoy my friendships in my 30s I enjoy having an actual ton of experience both professionally and just you know emotionally now it's just it's it's a lovely time I really recommend everybody getting older I enjoy it nothing has changed for me I still have really good vision by the way isn't that weird I don't wear any glasses whatsoever you wouldn't pick that

tired of her now girl I know but I've been I've been holding out I wrote I've been holding out because she's done hell us every week it's a new doja cat thing that I have to listen to and deal with and this week doja cat has coronavirus really I know that yes I thought she recovered by now she's recovered but honey you could you should have kept that little positive reading to yourself because

she should be glad she's not laying there next to her McCain well hermit cake doesn't that story feel like a distant memory already and it's like and it's bewilderingly shockingly insane terrible yes but even even wilder that he was fully laying up in a hospital bed dying of coronavirus and his team was sending out tweets still being like the democrats are evil right you're dying you're literally on your deathbed oh my god unthinkably awful unthinkable it's just the wild part of republicans always claiming that people are trying to pull it as a death like that semen jackal tucker Carlson right yeah um did when he was talking about uh obama politicizing john lewis's death at his funeral which while imagine politicizing the death of a civil rights leader this is supposed to be for everybody um you know and it's like y'all were letting this black man die and still using his twitter account to try and push out your racist s message fuck all the way off tucker Carlson and his fucking orville red and bakar ass fashion can fuck off i never want to hear that name again well you know what does she cat does still continue to do what she needs to do on tracks like um city girls it's pussy talk which is because truly my jam i you know i'm sorry okay yeah i mean listen say so look say so it's amazing in your eyes remake the weekend a beat machine she's a song writer but she can go ahead and enter the ranks of the half a million cases that we have coronavirus enjoyed that and we've gotten get gotten to mention him from a show got but you know like you can trade in some doge a cat listening for a flow millies album which is please our queen flow send it flow sound like that bitch hey by the way we're also allegedly getting new robin too isn't this such a crazy time for dance music like every gay icon is turning it i truly expect like judy garland featuring alia to happen any second i'm gonna pass on that one featuring aritha you think it won't my keep it this week is to um keep it regular at this point terry cruise mmm a legend of this genre yes our house house nigga the people who are in constant rotation on this show it's it's very funny because i feel like that week we're talking about connie and joe kennedy in the same week and someone else uh fan of the show tweeted at us that they started going back and listening to old episodes of keep it and they were like there's literally of one of our first hit episodes like a 2018 keep it where we are talking about connie and joe kennedy oh wow what's wrong with us it's like the exact same topics from that episode where the topics of the 2018 episode wow truly it's them it has nothing to do with you guys or or us it's just it's them they're consistently doing stupid shit so speaking of consistently doing stupid shit terry cruise responded to the fact that gabriel union was on jammell hill's podcast unbothered that is the name of jammell's new podcast um inside note i am bothered that gabriel have not done keep it yet but how about it but anyway uh she was on talking about america's got talent and you know um the interest in the conversation was being renewed um just because you know all this um Ellen stuff going on you know and all of the current stuff talking about just dealing with racial issues in hollywood and workplace and gabriel was just like people hit me up all day long and are like what's happening uh and she says the only thing she knows for sure is that terry cruise still gets three checks from nbc you know like she pointed out that he definitely was not an ally for her on the show and with everything that she went through which as we know was being let go from america's got talent for speaking up about um racism that was happening behind the scenes on the show uh he tweeted out this will be my third public apology to gabriel union if a fourth is needed i will continue to apologize and push for reconciliation between the world and more importantly the culture i grew up in i'm sorry gabriel union this man first of all terry cruises twitter mentions have become like the hottest new club for racist white people oh you cannot you cannot go through this man's mentions without now seeing like the kind of white people who love a good negro responding like um thank you so much terry you know for like trying to stop racism and trying to stop divide us etc like the kind of white people with dogs as their twitter avatar or um or a or a poorly lit selfie in their car oh sure yeah yeah uh his i'll do it a four-time if i need to how about you just apologize correctly because he hasn't apologized for what he's actually done he keeps being like i'm sorry and i'm trying to be better to you you know black people to black people is like do you know what you're apologizing for i don't think you do because he continues talking about what he thinks black supremacy is right like he tweeted about black supremacy because he thinks that black supremacy is this new idea that is um black people wanting you know to not be shot at by the police and to be treated with dignity as human beings is somehow going to put us above white people and we need to worry about um i don't know holding hands across fucking america yeah that is too bad uh also just like bringing up the amount of times you've apologized to Gabrielle union it's like are you i mean are you trying to throw detractors her away i mean just don't do it i who cares if it's the third or fourth time or whatever she's not a historically wrong person so i mean i just it just it that seems a little um petty to me yeah everything every time he speaks it's always laced with an attitude like the self-righteousness what you've done nothing terry you've literally done absolutely nothing and i will stand by Gabrielle until i die because we're both nebraska girls oh is she an Nebraska person i only get her she of course yes she's my only one it's amber roughing me and Gabrielle union that's it i mean the power of three will set us free okay what's that chondry boot um the one thing terry did do is um first of all i have this nigga block so i like rarely see his tweet but terry who's truly he gave me a birthday gift last week because all by birthday he tweeted conquer our own negativity which is um an ad for coon because people kept calling him that in the midget and
