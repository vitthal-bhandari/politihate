    "text": " The following is a quarantine recording presented to you in a round sound. Hey, this is Lady Don't Take No. Your weekly roundup of all of the real and none of the fake. I'm your host, Alicia Garza. This show is pro-black, pro-queer, proudly feminist and pro-do what you like. Every week, you're gonna get the best of what goes on in my head, what we're loving on and what we hate on, what we might be and what we ain't going to. Politics, pop culture, an actual presidential transition, we cover it all. We are recording from Oakland, California, the center of the known universe, where we are dealing with Rona and Reconstruction. It's a challenging time, a changing time, a time of transformation. It's all the things, all the time nowadays, but we're gonna help you understand the dynamics of this time, every single week. So be sure to tune in, tell a friend, and leave a review on Apple Podcasts. We do it for the culture, so the pod is $3.99, because we know that with a country in chaos, the least we could do is keep you from putting your money anywhere else than where it's needed. I know that something might ain't be. Our guest this week is the founder of the Black Male Voter Project, a national organization with a sole purpose of increasing Black men's participation in electoral politics. He has appeared on Democracy Now!, Al Jazeera, NPR, and countless other media outlets. Mondale, my friend, is also one third of the team for Clickbaby, Political Thirst Trap, which is a video podcast that is literally so funny and so fun. He's also my homie, and his name is W. Mondale Robinson. Hello, Mr. Robinson. What? I can't believe I'm over here. What's good, what you said? What's good, what you said? Unbelievable. What's up? What's up? I'm so excited to have you on. I feel like y'all done wrangled me on Clickbaby quite a few times, and each time I was like, you know what, I'm plotting because I need to go in. We need to go in. So, I got to ask, we are, despite popular opinion in some places, we are still in a pandemic, so can you tell me what has your quarantine life been like, and have you developed any unique habits, live and direct for Ms. Rona? So, normally pre-Corona, I had this crazy regiment where I would be up 5-15 every morning, riding my bike, trying to get 20 miles in the morning, 20 miles at the end of the day. Because of Corona, all I've done, I traded in my bicycle for a pizza box. I've learned how to eat two large pizzas, and I'm 40 pounds heavier because of that. That's amazing. That is absolutely amazing. I fell in love with this weird pizza. It's thin crust, chicken, and pineapple. That's my pizza of choice. I could eat two of them large. Oh my gosh, I'm so jealous. I wish I could do that because you must be exercising, though. I'm supposed to say yes at this point, but nah, I literally, I feel 41 for the first time in my life. My first job was the Marine Corps, and not out of no patriotism or anything like that, but just because I needed to escape poverty. But I just let myself go, for real. Look, I support it. I mean, I stopped cutting my hair, I stopped shaving. It's just like, it is what it is. I'm going to show up how nappy I want to be. And, you know, like, let me don't take no. That's how I'm living it out. If lady don't take no, if lady don't take no was a black man. I remember in the beginning of this pandemic, you know, people were gardening, people were baking bread, right? It was like a real DIY type of feel. So I got to ask, like, are there any new skills that you've developed for the apocalypse? So what are they? So people, people are going to want to have some fun, some relaxing time during the apocalypse. I am a huge hooker head. Anybody that you know that knows me know that, like, I'm trying to figure out how we advertise Black Male Voter Project on hookers. That's how much I love hookers. So, but to light a hooker, you need to use charcoal. So I've learned how to take apart appliances, like hairdryers, glue guns, anything with a heating unit in it, and learning how to circle it on top of the hooker so as to create a cleaner smoke. So my new skill is electrician. I've always wanted to do, like, carpentry work. I make furniture at a recycle palace when I was in law school at Arkansas for all of the Black and Brown students. I didn't have beds or didn't have money to buy a bed. I would just take, like, six or seven pallets. If they wanted a queen with some book studies, I could make those. Or if they want to know, king, I could do that for them as well. So just add electrician, pseudo-electrician to my repertoire. Okay, we need that. We need that for the apocalypse. So I know now who I want on my island. You know what I'm saying? I can figure something out. You know, okay, I'm with it. We have a coconut metal detector. I do it for you. Ah, yes. Yeah. Okay, I like this. So let's talk about your work, my friend. And first and foremost, before we even jump into all that, one of 13, I mean, I can barely remember my baby brother's name sometimes. So I'm trying to understand how are you keeping track of all them siblings? How is this happening? Yeah, so I'm blessed. Like I told my parents, like, they think they were slick. It gets easier the more kids you have said from a person who has no kids, right? Like, but we were raised in sections. It's like four, then four, then the rest of us all together, except for the last two. But yeah, I'm the middle child of 13. I think that made it easier because it was either I'm fighting the older group or the younger group, but never like there was a different spot where we're going to take care of Monday. So probably because I deserved it because I was always doing something silly. So it was like one of the best experiences that I didn't know until I was an adult because so many things that I were protected from by my family, the sheer size of it. Never having to like pretend to be friends with anybody. It was never a thing where I'm going to pretend to be cool with somebody or I'm not going to do what I want to do because I'm going to go home and have enough people to fight and also have best friends with. So I had this wonderful luxury and privilege of being me since I was able to even think about anything about personhood. And I think that that you're absolutely right. It had a major impression on like how I was going to show up, especially in a political space that constantly pulls you to the center of what they call liberalism or centrices, which is not a good thing for me. Okay, facts, I understand that. So talk to me then, what was it like growing up with 13 siblings? And how did any of that experience shape your involvement in politics? Like how are all these things coming together? So like 79 the year I was born was an interesting time. I think partly because I came from an apolitical family like my family up until recently had never voted don't vote they didn't vote. They just very poor people from the South, Eastern North Carolina. My dad grew up working on the plantation that my family that his family was raised on, but he was a he was the son of a share cropper on the same in the same plot of land. Think about that. So he also it was also the space where he got a felony conviction because the white guy who owned the farm, his son, who my dad had undoubtedly grew up playing with because they were similar in age, smacked my grandmother and my father reacted. But in the in the 50s and 60s, a black man can't hit a white man regardless what he'd done, especially not something he did to a black person. But my dad reacted and got a felony for hitting that white man. And I think growing up hearing that story in my life, that was probably one of the most impactful thing, not to mention that the white guy that used to spray my mom with a fire hose when she was a child was still the fire chief in my life when I was growing up. So feeling like that that feeling of not being able to every day I wanted to do something to this fire chief, but I'm eight nine years old. There's nothing I can do. But I knew what he did to my mom. And I also knew that the laugh and the smile that she tried to put on when she told those stories as if it was funny was not her normal big smile that showed all of her teeth and her wonderful gap. And it made me feel something type of way, which is when I began to fight for equity. Like early on, and I knew I didn't want to be a firefighter. I didn't want to be a police. I didn't want to be a politician. I wanted to be a voice piece for black folk and equity. And equity does not just stop at the ends of a racial skin tone. It's actually for anything. When I see and hear anything about inequality, I lose sleep. And it didn't just start as my entire life. I've been that way. So yeah, I think those those things influenced me a lot. And then one time I was extremely rude to my mom. And it taught me how to be extremely self-sufficient because it was like Christmas. And I got a tape because we were extremely poor. I got a cassette tape that was, I don't know if you remember the bootleg tapes from the stock, the flea market. And I'm like, man, why can't I get regular tours like a regular kid? And my mom was like, just be happy you got anything. I was 13. Just some people didn't get nothing. I'm like, man, whatever. But later that night, when they thought all of those kids were asleep, I heard my mom crying to my dad about that being the worst day of her life because of what I said to her. And that literally was the, that is literally the last time I've asked my parents for anything. And I started digging in the trash can for like back then, we used to have glass soda bottles and you could recycle them for 10 cents. So I used to help out my parents with that. And I stopped asking for shoes to go to school. And I would just like, they buy me his Nike's to go to shoes. I'd take him back, go to the dollar store to sit the super 10 and get like, like some cheap shoes and some t-shirts and be fresh with new t-shirts and give the money back, you know what I'm saying? For my parents. So, and I started selling pecans and everything like that, like, because we country folk. So I could sell stuff like that and help out. And that's what I would do. And it was the last time, literally the last time I asked. And once I was in a dumpster, I found a jewel. It was the solos of black folk by Debbie DeBose. And for the life of me, I'm certain that 14 I didn't fully understand what he was talking about. But I felt like this is, this is what I want to do. Like, I want to be, I want to be that preacher and everything else he was talking about in that book. I wanted to be, you know, that, that mystic or that, that medicine man or whatever, everything he called the preacher, I felt like that's what I was supposed to do. And I literally tried to do that in my life. Went to law school because of that book. I went, went to divinity school because of that book. I went to college. You got a political science degree because of that book. Everything about black folk or the solos of black folk, I tried to live out that couple with Eddie Murphy movie Boomerang. Yeah, you just came out to cut with the boomerang. I'm maybe with this deep story. You know what I'm saying? That you're like, Oh yeah. And then by the way, Boomerang. Yeah. Okay. I got, I got, I mean, my therapist is working on a toxic side of me. And I'm telling you, it comes from boomerang. And that is not me trying to deflect on like me not owning my problems. I literally thought that was like how successful me and was supposed to show up in the world. Oh my God. I'm still trying to shake that right. Oh, funny. I love this so much. Months ago, my organization put out a report on the political participation of black men. And we have this theory that black men were potentially swing voters in this upcoming election cycle. And that largely that had to do with a lack of attention that was paid to black men in the political process. But we were not the first to see this. I mean, you started an organization called Black Male Voter Project to address this head on way before this report came out, child. Y'all been around for a second. There's been a lot of conversation about the role of black men in the selection cycle. And unfortunately, none of it has been positive. So help me break down. What the hell is going on here? And can you give us some myths and facts in particular about what just happened and what we've been dealing with? Yeah. So let's start with, let's try to ground it in fact, right? So first of all, we were this little organization, Black Male Voter Project. So the work that you all did was actually extremely important, right? Because we know about access. And when people are talking about things that need to be said, sometimes folk can't hear from my voice. And we need a need echo. We need the voice to be amplified. So let's not even minimize what happened over that day. But a lot of what's happening right now with black men and their turnout, this massive amount of energy and turnout for black men is grounded or being grounded in myth because people are talking about one exit poll from Edison, right? Edison is the same organization that did a poll in 2016 that said 54% of white women voted for Donald Trump. No one ever asked him to come back and correct that even though we know years now, like later, that it was so wrong and that report was latent with lies like that same report said 85% of white women had college degrees. We know that's not true. What exit polls actually are are meters for a certain type of people, not the entire electric, right? So that the polls are exit polls, especially our polls for certain type of people, meaning people that are willing to stop and talk to exit polls, 20% of those black men voted for Trump. But that was only 4% of the black men that they try to stop or they try to have conversation with, which means that that was not representative of the entire black men that participated. Also, if we look at the facts, these same polls said there's no energy. There's a lack of energy from a democratic base, right? There's no Donald Trump is winning on energy. The problem is you were pulling black people on Joe Biden. That doesn't even sound like an exciting, peal for black people to swallow, especially black men who don't buy into this idea that personalities are enough to talk about a level of excitement, especially when after white men, supposedly we were the first to receive our right to vote, which actually was the 15th amendment for black men really was another opportunity for us to begin a pigs for suppression of humanity, right? And it's never stopped. So what we do know though is if we look at the primary, it's a better way to tell how black men voted because some states have closed primary, meaning you need to be registered a certain way to vote in that primary. A great example of this is in Georgia. We saw 144,000 black men come to the poll in the democratic primary that did not vote for Barack Obama in 2008, didn't vote for him in 2012, didn't vote for Trump in 2016, and didn't vote for sister Abrams in 2018, nor did they vote in any of the midterm elections in between those elections. Now that tells us a few things. One, first, these are not kids, right? These are at least 30 year old because you've been registered for 12 years. And also there's a motivating factor of something different than the norm that makes you go to the poll. Also, it is highly unlikely that these people were so energetic that they didn't vote for the opportunity to have a first black president two times and then came to the poll and voted in the democratic primary and then switched to Republicans in the general election. That makes no sense at all. So when we, and then when you couple, right now we don't have all of the numbers from Georgia or in the state for that matter, because elections are just being certified now. But what we're seeing right now in Georgia is a large number of those brothers who did that did vote in the primary came back out and voted early in the general election. So for instance, we knew about before the day before election, we were counting early votes of that number that 144,000 black men that are named. 80,000 of them had already been back and voted early, meaning 80,000 people, black men who didn't vote for Barack Obama, Trump or Stacey Abrams came out and voted early. And these are the same people who voted in the democratic primary. What is the likelihood that these people took time to go to a primary, a democratic primary and then switched their mind? That's my first problem with the exit poll. They're not, they're not really talking about it. And then also, if you look at the sheer number of spaces where black people are over performed their 2018, 2016 numbers, 2012 numbers, you see a pick up of votes in these spaces. These are heavenly, I'm talking small precincts that are majority black. And then the numbers that they're trying to say are belong to a black man voting against Joe Biden doesn't add up real well. Like, for instance, there are districts in Georgia that are over like 90% black, that you can't win that district without the participation, not the levels that Joe Biden won of black men and voting in some spaces. So I just, I'm a whole data nerd over here. And it just doesn't seem true that we're gonna base what we've said about black men on exit polls. Plus, I've been sitting on calls where people are saying things that are based on just wild ideas. For instance, I just see, I just got off the call with the Senate majority packet, I was pushing back on their poll because they literally had a list of names of dead black bodies. I mean, like, this is a motivating fact. And I'm like, first of all, I'm getting sweaty on my inside that you're thinking this is how you're gonna motivate black people by using this, this death, right? But to make it even worse, they didn't even name a Mard Aubrey. In Georgia, too? In Georgia, exactly. You're in Georgia. He's like, oh, because of joy, what we saw happened in George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and he lists all these names. And I'm like, and it's like, it all started because of George Floyd. And I'm like, first of all, you discount so much local work on people who've been, we didn't just start dying because you saw it on Facebook, right? That was not the first nine minutes of death for black people by agents of the state. And when we think like that, I mean, like, that's a, like, you're depressing the vote, especially if you're on the phone talking to people in Southwest Georgia, which is so funny because of that poll, that's where the candidate is, where the week is. And I'm like, it's because you're polling people about black death and not even mentioning a resident of Southwest Georgia that was murdered by a cop this year. So, I mean, so I think that we have these polls that are telling us, and people are using polls like they're factual in a very fictional way. And we need to own that too. I mean, this is part of the problem when black folks don't design these campaigns. Yeah. You don't go get me on this whole train about how basically insert a name that becomes the proxy for what white folks think is the only thing that we care about really, which is criminal justice reform. I'm really sorry. On behalf of BLM, I'm really sorry. You're a black man and you're a voter and you have been working with black men to engage black men in the electoral process because you see where the gaps are here. What do you think is the potential of black men in politics? What's the different story about what black men are doing and what black men could be doing if sufficiently organized? Indeed. I mean, the potential is our sisters, what y'all doing, right? Like, we have the same potential that you all have. I mean, y'all dope-ness is your dope-ness for sure. And I'm not trying to compare, but I'm just saying with some reality added to the way we interact politically with black men, then we too can increase a deficit of a demographic that we definitely need to want easy to load of sisters and also just when black men are voting like women, we are better off as a country. We save the world and not in a hyperbole way. Let's literally think about it. If we care about progressive issues, then we need both those demographics participating in a higher than normal for other races for this party that so many people say we should leave when in actuality, I argue against leaving because we made this party what it is and leaving it gives away too much infrastructure that we already sweated for. So here's what I think. I think black male voter project, we threw out traditional campaign. We do not talk to black men about elections being your saviors or candidates being saviors. What we talk about is elections as an entry point to civic engagement. And the way that we talk about it is basically voting is brushing your teeth socially. You still got to take a whole bath, right? You still got to bathe. So if you don't want social halatosis, you got to vote. So and the way we do that is it's grounded in lessons learned from Maslow hierarchy needs, meaning you can't approach people who don't have their basic needs met talking about things that are self actualization. And to black men who are literally living with their backs against the razor wall, we can't think the way we present polling to them or elections to them that it's going to be seen as anything other than self actualization. So we know that this is a demographic that makes up some of the lowest markets in this country, be it education, how we're over represented in expulsion, suspension, special needs, classes, etc, etc, etc, short is life span, all of that. And to say that this demographic is to buy into elections that come around every four years with some fried chicken and a church fan is beyond ridiculous. I mean, so we have to also address we need to address those issues that they're facing, not from a group of pollsters that are divorced from their community, but in a way that that values and also shows their issues as more important to candidates. So we created this approach called B M E P editorial approach, and it does just that. We spent a lot of time listening to brothers more than talking to them. Like we have 4000 conversations with black men this year, and it was no cameras, there were no women, no white people just black men in a room. And we we overpopulated for gang members for what the people call drug dealers. And we had a couple elected officials and a couple political folk in the room, not so that they could like fill a bus to the conversation or ground the conversation, but so they could see how wrong they were. And it was so amazing to go around this country and have these conversations and see those that are elected officials or democratic creatures of the Democratic Party raised their hand around issues like what is the number one issue with black men is that health care almost always people that were connected to the part of it raised their hand and the rest of the room be looking at them like they got three heads like that is not the number one issue. If a cop killed me, I don't need health care. I'm dead. Right. So I mean, I, I, it's just a wonderful way of centering recentering the issues that are most important. What we are saying is if you engage black men the way you engage everybody else, Democratic Party, which spent $1.5 billion on these elections and less than 5% went to black people. If you engage us the way you engage your conservative cousins, then you would have a a smaller population of what y'all call, I think they call them low information or sporadic voters. I call them low investment voters because they don't invest in them. That's right. I even down this truth. So much of what we talk about with respect to black people and elections is fraught with tropes and stereotypes and misinformation. But there's also contradictions that we're not dealing with. How do we have a both and conversation? Because I feel like with black people, that should always be the conversation both and okay, not either or for a whole bunch of reasons. So how do we have a both and conversation about black voters that could help us unlock what black voters really need, not for white dominated political parties, but instead really and truly for us by us. You see where I'm going here? I do absolutely. I think I think there's there's like so the trauma associated with like black community and people like you always go to always go back to the trauma. And I'm thinking because it's grounded in everything that is the black experience in this country require us to do a both and like right because anything else is going to be incomplete and it's not going to be grounded in reality. It's shifting sand as my country Christian folk will say. So I believe that it's a hard space to create. But I think without cameras and with like people that are really looking to do that work, if we invest in it in a real way, I think it's possible. For instance, there are some issues with with black men around certain progressive ideas. And I think, you know, just shutting them out or cutting them all or canceling them may not be the way we can go for it and be sustainable as a community without at least first trying to address because I know a lot of a lot of black men that we were talking to were not where they needed to be. The idea of masculinity and trying to divide masculinity from toxic masculinity was a whole lot of our early conversations and trying to explain through that and how we would be able to organize around like there's a difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity and how necessary it was that we pointed out which one was which so as to make our community whole and also for people to be held accountable like because you got to reconcile before we can go forward with a lot of issues. And I think I think there's a lot of work to be done around that and all of the things associated with patriarchy in this country and how it shows up in our community and which is usually a on a more intra relationship which is so scary because that means you're doing more harm to people that love you, right? A lot of the times the political space that I'm looking for checks or knows and yes or knows the trans-action or nature don't give space for that or don't see that as power or even something that they want to invest in. So I think I demand of donors like don't come over here thinking you're going to fund me or position in my organization for this election and then you're not going to so I need you to fund an organizer not just through January the 5th but for two years because we got work to do in our community and it requires more than just your victories on January the 5th in Georgia. So I think we as a we as a people who own space in proximity to white money we're obligated to ask for more than what they want. Don't just think I'm you're gonna fund I don't do voter registration but not night in my people that do don't think you're just going to fund voter registration over here without giving us you know donations and funds to do other stuff that is super important i.e. addressing the harm that comes from black men to other parts of our community and also what is what is that root of that harm too and how you know what I'm saying like because white supremacy doesn't just hurt black people it hurt white people so the same is the same is true about the toxic stuff that sometimes live in in our community from us so yeah I think that question is is beyond the politics it is a political question because it requires us to really address what people call the tricky or the trickiness of black men which I think part of it is so for so long we haven't had sister and black men talking to sister and the black man about sister and the black man stuff in a way that is not considered a shop top in a way that's not grounded in you know science and hurt and hugging and loving and we should we should definitely begin that and I think I think you know black male voter project I tell people all the time the voter tricks you because we're more than a voter organization we are in a holistic organization based in the lessons from my aslo hierarchy needs but we it also goes back to the my my aslo hierarchy needs when you think about it if your basic needs aren't met it is impossible for you to skip two levels and go to the space where you can create healthy relationships so I mean so there's some grounding that we have to do but then also we also need to know that up that pyramid is the place where we have to correct broken relationships and harm caused by us. I'm completely obsessed with you. Family. I'm totally obsessed. And just like that it's time for our weekly roundup of all the things that lady just ain't gonna do this week. Number one act like thanks taken is not a holiday that celebrates the colonization of a people. Look I hate to do the thing that kills the joy but you know what also kills the joy genocide knowing that lots of people chose to focus on what they're grateful for and that's nice loves but telling fairy tales doesn't address what is in many ways still happening to indigenous communities. Lady encourages learning about indigenous people's histories not just on the day of things taken but every day. I highly recommend Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz who wrote an incredible book called an indigenous people's history of the United States. There are many many more resources and I encourage you to check out our socials to get more info on why we should just literally stop celebrating this holiday. Speaking of things lady just ain't going to do this week it includes clowning you for gathering. I know look I get it. We all want to be with our friends and our families and all that. I miss the people I haven't seen in nine months. I miss my life but you know what I also value my life. Look my cousin is an ER doctor in Boston. BT Dubs hey I'm money. What's good girl. Thanks for saving our lives and shit. Anywho my cousin's an ER doc and you want to know something? The emergency rooms not just in Boston but around the country are beginning to be overwhelmed from people who got the rona from the small inside gatherings y'all been having. Look y'all I don't want to lose you too. Stay home. Keep your pod small like really small. Remember that every single person you're in contact with you're also in contact with everyone they've been in contact with. In other words stay home mask up and really to stay home. And in the latest of conspiracy theories team Trump is insisting that the election was a hoax. The same way they insisted that the rona wasn't real and then child look what happened. Well let me break down what happened here for anyone who is confused about how the president could have lost the selection. Y'all ready? It's huge and it's breaking news. He didn't get the votes because he ain't got the range. Not enough votes equals no victory so there you have it folks. And after three recounts in Georgia weeks of legal battles and whatnot he lost. So take a minute with that one if you need to but the truth is the truth and the truth shall set you free. In other news here's what we want more of this week. Number one transition transition transition. I mean look folks your president has tried almost everything possible to stay in office looking more and more every day like a petulant child who is sitting in the corner pouting because they lost their game of monopoly. This week lady loves that the general services administrator Emily Murphy she went on ahead and gave the green light to the transition. Regardless and yes I said regardless because that's the actual word and I don't care what Miriam Webster has to say about that. Anywho regardless of Trump's temper tantrums. The role of the general services administrator just so y'all know because you know we learn about government here especially as the government was about to be hijacked so we got to learn about how the thing works so that the thing don't work in spite of us okay. So the role of the general services administrator it's to jump start the transition process and to make available the resources that are needed for a smooth transition. This includes things like computers office space security clearances etc they do not however decide the election. That date is coming up quickly with the electoral college vote which you know we've been talking about this that's happening on December 13th. We will be back to give you news that you can use about that process and of course we expect shenanigans but what else should you expect from this president? Nothing but the best of the nonsense as per usual. Other things that Lady loves this week is caring for our elders. So this week my friend Malchia Cyril organized a fundraiser for our elders from the movement many of whom are just now returning home from damn near a lifetime of imprisonment just for daring to be free and too many of them don't have what they need to live a dignified life. The goal is to raise $50,000 so that folks can access the medications that they need have food in the fridge and keep a roof over their heads. Lady loves making sure our elders are living a good life especially when life has not been good to them. Check out our socials to learn more and to donate and just to pause for the cause I'm matching donations up to $1,000. So get to it we need you. Lastly Lady would love to give her beauty recommendation for the week which is moisturize. Winter is almost here but for sure the temperatures have dropped and that means that everyone and everything is ashy. So the best products honestly can be found at home. Avocado face masks to keep your face moisturized, coconut oils for your elbows, your hands, your knees, and your feet also put socks on after you've moisturized because you know it helps keep the yeah anyways and also for your ends like your hair ends keeping your ends from getting split use that coconut oil use some olive oil for your scalp remember heavier oils on the scalp, light oils on the ends and always hydrate hydrate hydrate. I am so so glad that we had you on the pod today. I really am appreciating and taking to heart quite a few things from this conversation but one thing in particular is what does it mean to invest in our communities not for the gaze of white folk but for us for us to be sustainable for us to be dignified for us to be whole and to allow us to be human together and that that be a part of our healing journey. I appreciate you how can people find you how can they follow you how can people find you and just before you answer this question you know I have my girl dream and I'd say this every podcast but I just thought it was so funny you know I asked her to tell people how they could find her on the socials and she was like yeah so I'll catch you on the other side I don't want you on my damn socials so I just want you to know that's an option but how can people find you and how can people follow your work.
