    "text": " Hello, everybody. I'm Lou Dobbs, and this is The Great America Show. Truth, justice, and the American way. It's our way. And welcome all. Great to have you with us. These are, at best, difficult and disturbing times which we're living through. There was great doubt about Joe Biden's capacity to be President of the United States when he was a candidate. To be honest, many, if not most, Americans couldn't imagine Joe Biden being elected. But there it is. He was elected, and it's now clear to any rational person that the general assessment of his capacity was indeed correct. Biden is impaired cognitively. It's always even money whether he'll even finish a sentence. His son claims he'll take up any subject that Hunter tells him to in his public remarks, and I isn't that comforting. We knew Biden was in the sway of his puppet masters, but most of us wouldn't have dreamed his son would be among them. President Biden is now a tragic and a pathetic public figure. He's also extremely dangerous, whether he's doing what some dark cabal tells him to or having an episode of outright cognitive failure. The Marxist Dems who are influencing public policy emanating from the White House are driving this country in a hard left turn on everything from open borders, bringing in millions of illegal immigrants, devastating the petroleum industry, and the result in sky high prices for both gasoline and diesel and the financial pain of tens of millions of our fellow Americans. The Biden White House and the Marxist Dems haven't relented in the slightest in their aims to indoctrinate our children, to intimidate our Supreme Court justices on every major issue, particularly on abortion, and be assured that the left means to control the outcome of the 2022 election by whatever means they can. And Republicans and independents have no responsible choice other than to volunteer wherever possible to participate in our elections at the local level and be diligent. We're in a fight. We'll win in a landslide as long as we're there with the Dems when the votes are counted. Be of good cheer. Be of good heart. And let's keep our sense of humor as we go into the electoral battles and be sure that truth, justice and the American way prevails. Our guest today is a man with a great sense of humor. He's an author, host, Washington Times columnist, serious ex and patriot personality, conservative commentator and comedian, Tim Young. We follow him on Twitter where his handle is at Tim runs his mouth. That's at Tim runs his mouth. Tim, great to have you with us here on the Great America Show. Welcome. Hey, here's the thing, Lou. You know, I might I learned when you asked me to be on your show that my friends really don't like me or they have no faith in me because I said, I'm gonna do Lou Dobbs show. And they're like, the Lou Dobbs? I'm like, wait, come on, like they think I'm gonna be on some bootleg show. So I'm so glad that I'm on the real Lou Dobbs show. My friends finally can believe in me. Well, you know, what anything that we can do to support you because you bring so much laughter and entertainment with with just your tweets, let alone your your broad comedy. And you've got now you've got street cred by being associated with me and the Great America Show. I mean, I expect to see a lot of swagger on your part from here on. Well, I'm gonna need swag from you to swagger. I'm gonna need some Lou Dobbs merch. So a hat and a knife. I've seen you that cool logo you got. You better believe it. And John Foset producer extraordinaire, load up the swag for Tim Young, if you will. And we'll get that out to you just straight away, depending, depending on your performance here over the over the episode. But anyway, I think that okay, you know, I'm expecting a great deal. So here we go. What was what's a great line? Be funny? Is that the is that the one? You know, man, Lou, hold on. Lou, the worst not to not to interrupt you, but the worst interview I ever did. I did this radio interview in in Dallas once and they brought me to the studio and just before the interview started, the interviewer goes, Hey, can you be funny? This time, the last time you were on here, you were terrible. All right, let's record. And I'm like, Oh my gosh. Well, you know, the fact of the matter is, I know that you're going to be funny. The only issue really is whether or not it'll be clean, comedic fun or, you know, your normal witty, clever humor that's in all of your tweets. I mean, I'm serious. I really do love your, your tweets. And I recommend everybody. We go to Tim Young at Tim runs his mouth. And as you can see, he's interrupted me four times already. We've just begun. Since so he's got a great Twitter handle. Tim, that's me being funny. Let's let's start with the issue of the day. And that's Hunter Biden. He's always serviceable, right? Who knew that Hunter really had the country's agenda in his hands. I mean, his father, he says, does exactly what he tells him, speaks to whatever issue he determines. And I've got to give the Washington Examiner a lot of credit. I want to play for the audience. Sound a self recorded message. I mean, this guy is not it's not bad enough. He he loves a selfie of himself more than anybody I've ever seen. He's got a self recorded message uncovered by the Washington Examiner's cyber expert. And they're great reporters at the Washington Examiner. And here he is. Who knew that the country's agenda was being set by a crackhead and a drunk. Listen to the first son. He's going to talk about trusted formality, other things I wanted to talk about. Anything that I wanted to that she believes in. If I say this important to me, then he will work away and wants to make it a part of his, of his platform. My dad respects me with respect to anyone in the world. And I know that's absurd. Well, there it is. I mean, a claim that he can back up that Joe Biden was following his lead. Your reaction to that piece of sound and and the statement, the bald statement that the President of the United States is doing whatever his, his law put it this way. Impaired son suggests. You already caught him a crackhead, Blue. You know, here's is it too late to be nice? Is it ever too late to be nice? Come on. It's too late to be nice to these people. I, you know, here's the thing, Blue. Would you rather have Hunter Biden or Joe Biden right now in charge of the country? I'll be honest with you. I think Hunter, look, he got him. He got himself a lot of business dealings around the world. He obviously knows how to buy and sell human beings. You know, he might be better as president than Joe at this point. You know, maybe Joe should listen to him a little bit more. Well, according to Hunter, Tim, we've got a two for here. We've got them both running the country and the slide edge goes to Hunter since his father is saying whatever it is that he wants to throw into the public agenda. I just find it stunning that the Department of Justice, the Attorney General and the FBI had all of this from 2000 December of 2019 through to October 2020 in the final presidential debate that year just before the election. And they didn't release any of the information that they had, including these statements, the relationship between Hunter and the entire Biden family and their criminal enterprise. It's an influence peddling enterprise, the Biden family. And if they just released that, we would have had an entirely different outcome in 2020. Certainly your thoughts. Yeah, no, I mean, what was it already? They said 16% of Biden voters. I believe there's a poll that said that they wouldn't have voted for him if they would have known about just the laptop without this information. So I'm willing to bet that I bet 30% 40% at this point regret their votes for Biden. I mean, that includes my dead grandparents, people's pets, whoever voted in that last election. You know, they're very, I'm sure they're all regretting their vote at this point. Yeah, I think if there's ever been a reason for buyers remorse on a presidential election, the Biden voters have got it right now. And it really is difficult to grasp how amazingly incompetent and that this man is, he cannot express a coherent sentence. He cannot get off a stage without someone's assistance. He walks around lost every time there's a crowd and he finds himself in the midst of it. They move away from him and ignore him. I've never seen any president have to contend with people just ignoring him. Well, they know that he's not worth talking to and they know that he's not the person in charge. And I think the the example that and the prime example of all of this and where we really saw who was in charge was when Obama visited the White House, everyone was surrounding Obama and completely ignoring Joe when Joe was trying to get Obama's attention. It's very clear that that Joe is not in charge over there. And who is, I guess, is the real question. We know this president is a puppet. Now we know that it's at least Hunter's pulling some of his strings. But who else do you think would be in the puppet master cabal that is actually running things? Well, we know it also isn't Kamala or Kamala or whoever she wants to say her name this month. Because when she speaks, it's like she's trying to do a book report on a book that she hasn't read. Like she sees the cover of the book and it says space. And so she says space over and over and over again. I mean, it has to be the Obama cabal that's been around forever. This is his third term. And you know, if it wasn't for Trump's presidency, what's happening now we would have had a more gradual increase of problems in this country to get to where we are now rather than them playing ketchup on trying to destroy our great country. And there is a reason, isn't there after all, that Barack Obama is the first president in living memory to stay in Washington after his term in office ended. He bought a big mansion planted himself right there, because he wanted to be close to the action where he could manage everything it seems. He has what is clearly becoming and becoming clear by the day, clearly, significant influence over this administration and all the policy that's being created by the staff of the White House, irrespective of what Joe Biden says. Well, that end culture. And if you look at it, I mean, look at his deal that he got paid out at Netflix and created a bunch of things there. But Susan Rice was on the board at Netflix. I mean, these people, they knew what they were doing. And I wish conservatives were better at and were able to play the game the way that the Obama administration did and the way Democrats do. Because when they left office, they immediately went into cultural positions and major cultural positions. And so it's no wonder that conservatives, Republicans are always playing catch up because they just don't get the game the way that the left does, and especially that Obama administration. Well, the Republicans are really kind of a dull bunch when you get right down to it. Many of them are lazy. I'm talking about the Ryanos. They don't want to work, otherwise, they'd be in the Democratic Party instead of the Republican Party because they agree with the Democrats on policy and values. But they want to be in the Republican Party where they just go on the Sunday talk shows to show what idiots the Republicans are. And it's really amazingly stupid of the Republicans that they tolerate these left wingers called Ryanos and their party. But there's no, there's no counterpart in the Democratic Party. The Democrats don't have 10 or 20, 30 Ryanos or Dinos, if you will, no Dinos over there. And it's really interesting that there's that gap. I mean, there's a real gap in betrayal of the part of the Democrats. They need to pick up their game a little bit and look as stupid as the Republicans do when they tolerate the Ryanos. Yeah, it's interesting to me. You know, I feel like, you know, the GOP, the RNC, are a bunch of rubes who have been played for years now. And when you've had a Liz Cheney sitting around, when you have all of these characters who have just kind of been, you know, Adam Kinzinger, these Mitt Romney, I mean, the fact that Mitt Romney was even the presidential nominee for the party in 2012 is shocking to me. I wrote a book, a little web book that was actually number one in political humor to plug myself back in 2012 about Mitt Romney. And I said, I'm sure I'm on some read. Yeah, 50 shades of Romney. Yep. And and look at man, Lou, you did your research on me. I'm the Holy moly. You're like a pro. I've got people telling me these things to my ear. Look, I just tell you what, man, I wrote that book and I said, I can't believe he's he can claim to be a conservative, let alone a Republican and people were like, Oh, you're a socialist. You're this terrible person. You're a sellout. You're just trying to get him to Liz. I'm like, no, take a look at this guy's record. It's right there. How how we don't have a better filter, a better like, I don't know, draft system, I guess, for the Republican party shocks me. And it's just like they're asleep at the wheel in DC. They're happy making their money. And that's that. I mean, it's they don't realize nor do they care that there are bigger things. It's sick. Yeah, it's almost like they've got the Republicans have an esteem problem. How, why else would they put up with this nonsense unless they think they're just simply not worthy and should be punished as a result by having what is it something like 20 of them in the Senate, certainly 10, 10 to 20 of rhinos. It's disgusting. And there is a parting gift to Pat Toomey, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and Rob Portman from Ohio, are retiring. And so their parting gift is to take away your second amendment rights and take your guns. It's just disgusting lining up with eight other rhinos to join with the Democrats. It's just it's appalling. And the leadership of the Republican party doesn't even want to discuss it. Well, you just nailed it in kind of a passing comment you just made. It's an esteem problem. Right. So when you take a look at it, and I always, I always say this to people and they're like, wait a second, you know, we always talk about how terrible the New York Times is, right? But if a Republican or a conservative gets in the New York Times bestseller list, they throw that everywhere. And they're very excited. They're very excited for these establishment corporate media groups to to praise them or to give them this recognition that when when they have 90% of time, talk about how terrible these organizations are, they speak out of both sides of their mouth. If you actually believed in yourself, you believe in your policy, you believed in conservatism, you wouldn't be kissing up and you wouldn't be proud to be associated with the New York Times or Washington Post, right? Exactly. Or CBS News or ABC News or MSNBC CNN. They all love to play to to that crowd. And it really, it does raise the issue of just what audience does Mitt Romney play to? He doesn't endorse Mike Lee, the senior senator from Utah, who's a conservative. And I believe it when he says that, but I don't have much proof of it other than his constitutional positions that really have nothing to do right now with policy because they're doing everything unconstitutionally. But it's just he's just an ignorant man. He doesn't seem to have any real values, any real substance. And, you know, for example, decided to go he really thought it'd be a really great idea for the United States to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would have meant war between the United States and Russia. So said Bill I'd Mayor Putin. And 40, 40 US senators who are Republicans signed on to that nonsense. The Republicans have a way of getting behind a Lindsey Graham, a Mitt Romney, a Tom Tillis, Susan Collins for crying out loud, or Lisa Murkowski. It's just it's pathetic to watch it when it live it in color. I'll put it that way. Yeah, I just and I don't understand it. I don't understand how they continue to have the support. I don't understand how there haven't been better primary challengers. So many people woke up under Trump. I would rather have an active an active mom who goes to school board meetings who is a true conservative in the Senate than one of these establishment hacks who's been there, you know, forever like a Murkowski or a or a Romney or someone. And I'm just, you know, I think the way that America is now with the issues that are on the table with, you know, not just gun control, but what's happening with indoctrination of kids in schools. Like why don't we have an awesome mom? The money is there to support these candidates. But why we aren't getting the push from the GOP to have real normal human beings in the Senate in the House of Representatives makes no sense to me other than it's a money game. Absolutely. I do want to share because I've been bragging about your your tweets. I want to give the audience a sample here. The and here's one of his tweets 24 minutes ago when we pulled these this morning. The completely rotten and corrupt apple doesn't fall from the tree in the Cheney family. I think that's terrific. The people who believe men can get pregnant. The men, the people who believe men can get pregnant want to use red flag laws to determine whether or not you can own a gun. What could go wrong? I love that as well. And this red flag law, people don't even realize what what it really is about. It's about giving your neighbor control over whether you have a gun or not. And if your neighbor happens to be a rotten son of a gun, left wing and motivated, they can create all sorts of trouble for you. I mean, the red flag law is just an un-American. See something, say something, piece of nonsense. Your thought. Lou, I mean, not two months ago, maybe three months ago now. Again, the news cycle feels like it's been eons since everything is getting screwed up now. But the DOJ listed parents who went to school board meetings as domestic terrorists. The same people who want these red flag laws said that parents who went to school board meetings are domestic terrorists. This isn't just about a neighbor. This is about stripping every concern of anybody who is against the current narrative of all of their rights. Right. And you'll be pleased to know that Merrick Garland, the attorney general is assured the national corporatist media that his January 6 prosecutors and the justice department are watching everything that's going on in the January 6 hearings, which is sort of, I would say, mean punishment for them. But the but the fact of the matter is Merrick Garland turns out to be this evil nasty guy who was being portrayed when they were talking about him for the just for the Supreme Court. He is a vicious left wing ideologue. Can you imagine him on the Supreme Court? Well, we just got one put on the Supreme Court. I mean, every one of the nominees that comes out of the left from now on is going to be the exact same characters Merrick Garland. And even though they may present a little bit better, but they all don't know what a woman is, of course. They can't do. They're not a biologist. They couldn't define what a woman is. But all of these these characters that we're going to see are the complete opposite of anything that a conservative or Donald Trump would put forward. And it's really scary to know that, you know, they always talk about all activist courts. This is going to be an absolutely activist court. And it's so critical that we protect our Supreme Court justices at this point, because apparently, you know, it's been memory hold. But, you know, the media doesn't want to talk about or be outraged about the assassination attempt of Brett Kavanaugh the other day. I mean, if we lose him and who got, it just, this is mind blowing to me. And sorry that I'm kind of locking up, my brain locks up when I'm thinking about this, because it just seems like the left wants to assassinate Supreme Court justices. And that's one of those statements that if I would have said it a few years ago, if I would have hurt myself saying this a few years ago, I'd be like, you're a conspiracy theorist, you're crazy. But it's the reality now. And it's really scary place to be. It is scary. And what else is scary is what we're accepting in this country. We accept a media that doesn't want to report on a person who meant to kill Justice Kavanaugh. And we have a media, a national corporate is media that we're talking about how he was upset about Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood, B. Casey. I'm sure this 26 year old was really down in the granular levels of abortion law and federalism. But the truth of the matter is, whatever he was, he said, clear as a bell to the dispatcher, the police dispatcher, that he was mentally ill. And he was frightened for everyone else because of his state of mind and a mind that was sick. And the left wing media didn't report that didn't report it for days. First, they had to talk about how upset he was as if somehow if he's upset, it's okay to pick up a handgun and go looking for a Supreme Court Justice. It's just pure ignorance on the part of the left wing corporatist media. And it goes on and on without comment, not from the Republican Party. They don't hold. I don't know what you think of this idea, but I would have a group, a ready group covering everything in the Republican Party covering everything that this left wing corporatist media is doing. And I would hammer them over the head every time they do things like that, because they are corrupting our society. It's not just political corruption. This goes to the very values of the American way. And we've got to end it now. I agree with you. You know, and the only way we can do this is by legitimately changing culture. And I'm so tired of, and I'm sure you've seen this, Lou, because you've been in media for a while, too. I'm tired of organizations. You always see these groups, especially conservative groups that show up, and they're like, we're going to make a difference. And really, all they're doing is making a paycheck for themselves. And they get all their donor money and they get billionaires to back them. And it's the same schlocky, you know, just garbage that they take a couple of boxes, keep making a paycheck, and don't move a needle at all. They're not even trying. And this has gone on for so long now that we're out of health to die on, right, when it comes down to the issues that are of the day. So I just, it's so frustrating for me, it has to be frustrating for you, and the people who are kind of awake to this. And I think there are just so many people who are awake to this that something can be done now. But it can't be done through, I mean, over and over again, I'm like, oh, look, it's another, you know, conservative media company that's going to do some sort of version of, you know, TV news, and then some sort of like ABC family movie. It's like, no, we have to do something different than that. It can't be the same thing over and over again. We have to legitimately change the culture and fight back. With our question, with our question. But you know, when we're talking about these red flag laws and the left and the rhinos joining in the Senate, all 10 of them, to take away our guns, it is, it's only been weeks since the Democrats and the Biden Marxist White House had come up with the Ministry of Truth, the disinformation governance board to decide what is truth and what is fiction. The government for the first time would have had that power if there hadn't been such a protest. And suddenly, all these rhinos are perfectly willing to have the same group of people be in charge of handguns and the Second Amendment and deciding whether a man or woman in this country should have a red flag or their guns taken away from. And it's really chilling to see how stupid these rhinos are. And I mean, let's think of, let's really put this into perspective. Just because that disinformation governance board doesn't exist doesn't mean that they're not already doing it. They're not continuing to do it in DHS. It's already established there. There's just no, you know, there's no flag. There's no office with a tag on it for what they're already doing. But you're right. It's the fact that they just go along with this. I don't understand. But I guess, you know, again, Lou, you and I have been around in media for a long time now. Like a lot of people don't know. I've been in my first article. I wrote 27 years ago when I was 14. But I, you know, when you get to Capitol Hill and you've interviewed a bunch of these people, you know, they're not smart. Right. I mean, like it had to be. And I'm sure this has happened to you. There's a moment where you're talking to a congressman or a senator and you're like, wow, you are the dumbest human being I've ever met. How did you get elected? And I think that's really what's happening now. Well, I don't talk to John Thune, for example. That's just, that's a bridge too far for me. I don't talk to Lindsey Graham. I won't talk to you. You know, Bernie Sanders, I'm not going to talk to a host of people. You know, Kamala Harris. And I mean, and of course, Mitten's Romney is, he's just, he's so appalling on the face of it. So I do have some standards. The people I talk to on this show, I don't, I really don't, I really don't bring them on unless I have respect for them. And unless I think the they are intelligent and well-meaning, I seriously just will not put a great, some of them who I don't consider to be a great American on this broadcast. It's one of the, the privileges, I guess, of a, a man of my age, I'll put it that way. I'm not, I'm not going to tell her. I do the same thing. I do the same thing when I do radio, when I'm hosting for Sirius XM or when I'm doing my podcast, which is once in a blue moon. But you know, it's, you meet these characters, right, that are, you know, these charismatic people on TV, like a Nancy Mase or a Dan Crenshaw and you meet them in person and you're like, how did you even have a normal job? How did you ever work doing anything? Sometimes I doubt if they even know how to read, to be honest with you. It is, it is mind-blowing. And that's why I always say, you know, I want like a mom that goes to a school board meeting, who's angry, who's justifiably angry, who's actually read policy, to be a member of the senator, a member of the House of Representatives. That's a better character and somebody with probably better morals than a lot of people than a lot of the members of Congress right now. And that wouldn't be bragging, would it? And this, by the way, as Tim's tweet on, on that particular issue, I wouldn't trust any red flag law from the same society who had the DOJ label parents at school board meetings, domestic terrorists. And that goes to the heart of it. These are ideologues, left wing, these are Marxist ideologues, driving the Democratic Party right now. And I love quoting myself when I tweet, what I said this morning was that the Democrat Party is now because of the Marxist leadership of the party and the cabal that are the puppet masters for this presidency. There are, there are clear and present danger to every American and to all things American, because they hate us, they hate America, they hate you and me and everyone who thinks like this. They do, but here's something fun. I hate them. So like that's, and I think it needs to be look, a lot of you, Sterellis, so it's, it's one thing, look, I understand that a lot of people, you know, they love their faith and God and they believe they should be kind to others. I, of course, am a very faithful person too, but I hate these people and they need to be eliminated from positions of power. And we need to fight back against them. And we need to be just as mouthy as them really. You know, if they're willing, I'll go ahead. No, I was just going to say, you know, speaking of that, this tranny library hour that no one else, you know, was putting up with apparently the, the proud boys, by the way, I don't know much about them, but they did have the sensitivity to interrupt a session with young children in the public library in San Francisco, and say, you know, enough of this nonsense with these drag queens reading books to them. I don't know how that started. I don't know why it's permitted in a, in a public space, like a public library or a school library in some cases, who in the world in their right mind would want to expose young children, kindergarten, pre-kindergarten at first and second grade. It's outrageous what's happening. It's, it's, again, this is a conversation that if you would have told me I'd be having with you five years ago, I would have said, no way, this is conspiracy. But it's, I think there's a pedophile problem in this country. And I never would have believed that I would be saying that now, just five years ago. And you know, there's, it makes no sense. What adult would want to do that? That's really the question. When you look at it from 50,000 feet, what adult wants to teach a five year old, somebody else's five year old, let alone their own about sex, about gender, about that kind of stuff. That is such a gross kind of cringy topic to talk about with someone else's kids. And these people are fighting for the right to do that. That's disturbing. Well, it's disturbing to who their allies are. Their allies include Disney. I have to tell you, you know, we love to take our grandkids to Disney World. I wouldn't go near Disney World. I wouldn't put up with any of it for a moment. It's a sick corporation wanting to do, as the president of Disney Entertainment said, half of their productions are going to be for LGBTQ plus and underrepresented factions within our society. I mean, that's sick. That is absolutely nuts. This is a child brand that should be a safe and glorious place for imagination and, and, but above all, safe. And it's no longer the case. And when they take on parental rights, as they did in Disney did in Florida, we're reached a point in this country where it is it's us versus them. Because that is a clear line of demarcation. When teachers suddenly think they have the right to talk to five year olds about sex and gender in a public school classroom, it is what many have said. And I, by the way, didn't believe this. It's a form of grooming and indoctrination. And it can't be tolerated. It's got to be stopped. Yeah. I mean, it's crazy when they say that they're underrepresented, by the way, right, Luke? Because I mean, like, I, you can't go anywhere anymore without seeing something gay or some sort of like trans thing or something. I don't want to hear about underrepresentation. If you, if you, if there's an underrepresented group in entertainment right now, it's conservatives. When, when has there been a and, and oh my gosh, I'm going to call racist and all sorts of things for this comment. When has there been a normal, straight, white, male, Christian conservative who looks sane on television on a, on a major broadcast? When like, I can't, in the last 10 years, it has not happened. And so if you want to talk about underrepresentation, that's, that's an underrepresented. Where, where are people like me on television right now? They aren't. They aren't and they won't be because it, it's, it's, when you watch these, let's talk about the commercials and instead of the, you know, the programming, the programming is awful enough, but the commercials are now at the vanguard of this, this diverse, gobbledygoot nonsense that's pouring out all over Hollywood and in entertainment and media. It's disgusting. It's appalling. And I, and I don't care who hears me say this. This is not, this is not a healthy society right now. We're a sick society because of what we tolerate or what others are trying to do to this society, to our children. Children right now are not safe in this country. They're not safe on our schools because of the teachers, the indoctrination, the outlandish idea that they should be having gender discussions at five years of age or five to nine years of age, pick the age group. It's, it's horrific. And who in the world has ever trained these people to have any pedagogical ability to impart any kind of knowledge, let alone dealing with something so sensitive and so irrelevant to a five to nine year old as a sexual identity and gender. It's ridiculous. And it's tragic. And it's coming from the same people who say that 18 year olds aren't old enough to be able to handle an AR 15 or a gun, right? Their brain, literally Jerry Nadler last week said that an 18 year old's brain isn't developed enough to be able to handle an AR 15 or a quote unquote whatever they're trying to label a weapon of war, right? But they can, but these same people say out of the other side of their mouth that a five year old can have a sex change, that a five year old without the consent of their parents can can agree to have a say that makes literally no sense and it's disgusting. And the idea that we are allowing and that the medical profession itself is allowing the mutilation of children because of this insane idea that five year olds or nine year olds are old enough to know about gender identity and to make life changing decisions, it's ignorance. And the other day talking about this the other day or the other month, talking with Dr. Oz, he was pointing out that 80% of the kids who have have gender operations regret it, it would like to reverse it. This is this is just such specious and evil nonsense that's being spewed as fact and science and it's far from that. And the medical profession has a lot to answer for that they wouldn't even permit such conduct on the part of a professional physician, I think. Yeah, I mean, and the thing is again, from a 50,000 foot level looking down, what adult would want to let alone deal with this issue with their own children? Because it's cringey and tough to deal with, but someone else's children, you have to be a very deranged individual to go along with this to teach this to kids to want to teach this to kids to want to want to fight the government like in Florida to want to teach this to kids. This is this is these are sick people. Yeah, absolutely. And in Florida, it's just a you know, Rhonda Sandis is just a governor just made for the moment. He is a great American, a great governor and he is doing just I can't think of a single policy that he's initiated with which I disagree. And I think that the people of Florida are richer in every way for having him in in the governorship. Biden, we're told next month, we'll be going despite his denials going begging the Saudi Arabians for oil. As meanwhile, we have more than the rest of the world. And yet, we're not producing it, not drilling it. We're not exploring to to create a more potential oil fields. And we're shutting down all the pipelines. But Biden, Biden wants to go beg the Saudis for more oil production. Is that not pathetic? Yeah, remember remember when we could just drill and we had we were the number one producer of oil in the world under Trump just like three years ago? I mean, I paid way back. Way back in 2020. Yeah. Yeah, look, when I went on the road, I covered the effect of COVID on small business. I traveled throughout all of 2020 for the Washington Times. And I was paying 99 cents a gallon for gas. And that was because we had such a surplus. I mean, we had if not for Trump, we wouldn't have had the surplus is to be burned out by Biden right now. I mean, the strategic surplus, I mean, Lord knows what we're down to in that. I mean, this is there's no way that you look at this and don't believe that this isn't being intentionally done to destroy this country. Without question, the Marxist dims, the that lead the Democratic Party are trying to destroy. The border is wide open. And there's only one reason to do that, because the Biden administration and the Marxist dims are pro cartel. The cartels now control both sides of that border because the United States has given up its side of the border to control. Furthermore, Manuel Lopez Zobador, Mexico is now ordered that the caravans coming up from Central America. All of those people are being given transit of visas within Mexico so they can go where they want when they want, and they all want to go to the United States so that they can travel through Mexico freely. Manuel Lopez Zobador under President Trump had 26,000 troops in Mexico defending the Southern border and the Northern border with the United States. And that is a huge difference. And we are looking at immense, immense consequences of this open border in terms of the the scale of migration, if you will, from the from the South American and Central American countries across Mexico into the United States, five to seven million in the next year. Already two million under this president have come into the United States illegally. I mean, it's insane. But you know what, maybe we could stop it if we start showing that they're conservative. A lot of you know, a lot of Central Americans, a lot of South Americans are think conservatively are much more conservative than most of the Democrat Party. Maybe if we get them to start voting Republican, they'll close the borders down. Well, we're seeing that happen. Under Trump, he got 40% of the vote in 2020 of the Hispanic vote, which was the best ever. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to overcome Zuckerberg's money. William Barr's decision not to intervene in the election because he knew Joe Biden was lying and he didn't want to ruffle anybody's feathers about, you know, family corruption and Russian disinformation and tell the truth that it wasn't Russian information. So, Tim, we always give our guests the last word here on the broadcast and you have earned that special honor. We can we turn to you for your concluding remarks as we wrap up here. I'm on the hot seat here, Lou. I don't know what to say. I've really enjoyed hanging out. I feel like we could have talked for another three hours to be honest with you because I really enjoyed this this chat with you. Well, we've got but at this way, I think you owe us three hours then. So, we'll take it to smaller bits, but you know, 30, 45 minutes to the time, we'll get to that the next month or two. Look, you and I need to get together. I don't know if you drink or not. We'll grab a bourbon, we'll hang out. We'll talk about every the next time we hang out, Lou, I want to talk, I want to interview you and I want to talk about all the terrible guests you've ever had to tolerate because I think that the hell of a conversation has because you have dealt with everyone souped in us and I cannot wait till the next time we sit down because I'm going to grill you on every moron you've had to tolerate. We're going to get to the bottom of it. I want to hear all these stories. You've probably got great stories. Well, you know, I do, but I reserve those, for myself because the truth of the matter is there are a few people, I guess, that would come to mind over time and I'm talking about 30, 40 years worth. But the truth is the people I have on this show, I actually, I delight, I revel in our discussions and I love the fact that this audience loves to talk about these issues or concerned about these issues and knows that this country is facing challenges and threats, the likes of which this country has never faced, certainly in my opinion, never at this level in our history with the possible exception of the civil war because this could also be headed in precisely that direction is the reason I reserve it. This is in peacetime the worst threats, the worst challenges we've ever had. But I look forward to talking with you again. I may reserve the space to be the questioner rather than the interview week, but we'll we'll we'll I'm going to source something over that. I'm young, you're great. I'm going to turn it on you. You got it. You're a great American, a great guest and we thank you for being with us. I wish you all the very best. God bless you. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being with us everybody here tomorrow. We'll have with us Colonel Doug McGregor to talk about China's threats and the Biden appeasement and the outlook for Ukraine and the war with Russia. Please join us here on The Great America Show tomorrow. Till then, God bless you and God bless America."
