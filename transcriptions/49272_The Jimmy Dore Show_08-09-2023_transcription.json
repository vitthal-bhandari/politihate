    "text": " Hey, so come see us live on tour. We're going to be in Detroit. That's Rochester, Michigan, Tampa, Boca Raton, Orlando, Dallas, Houston, San Diego, Bloomington, Illinois, where I went to college, Indianapolis, Levittown, New York, and Red Bank, New Jersey. Go to JimmyDoor.com for a list of all those shows. Hey, this is Jimmy. Who is this? I mean, it's present Joe Biden. Oh, hello, Mr. President. What a surprise. Thanks for calling. The surprise is all mine. It always is. Well, how you do it? Are you okay? Well, yeah, why wouldn't I be? Well, lately with all due respect, it sort of seems like you may be just a little bit out of it. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Are you sure about that? Yes. No. Other options. Well, just just the other day you bestowed the presidential matter of honor on a veteran, and then you abruptly exited the ceremony before the ceremony was over. This drew a lot of ire. Can you explain? Well, I was done. You weren't from here. Put the thing around his neck, and then it's basically my whole job. And I did it. What else does he need me to do? He's a big boy. He's a goddamn war hero for Christ's sake. Couldn't you have stayed at least till the end of the ceremony? Jimmy, I had to get back to my wife, where the time was dying of COVID. He's not dying. She has mild symptoms. It's only crime. Yeah. Well, someday she will be dead. And then we will say it was COVID that. Yeah, but you will. Hey, speaking of you seem to violate your own White House masking protocols that came after the First Lady's diagnosis. Do you really expect me to keep any of that straight in my head? Take it off when I talk. Sit down. Unless I'm eating, it's like the freaking hokey pokey. Of course I f that up. It just seems like these sorts of gaps and moments of confusion. They just keep coming on more and more. It's all perception. Yeah. Oh, losing. At least I'm not a Alicia, not Mitch McConnell standing there freezing. She that man, what an old guy. Right. He seems like super old, right? Oh, come on, Mr. President. Sorry. I can't hear you. I'm putting on a cool type of hat that only young people wear. Why would that make you not be able to hear me? Because I also have earbuds in because I'm listening to my favorite podcast. Oh, what's your favorite podcast? I forget what it's called, but it's too really funny guys who aren't even comics who get stoned and talk about how old Mitch McConnell is. Do you want me to download you the link? No, thanks, pal. Wow. You really are feeding off this McConnell distraction, aren't you? I can always use your good distraction. Trust me. Actually, hold on. I'm getting another call. Hey, this is the Jimmy Doris show. Who's this? Oh, my God. Why are you calling? Oh, just calling to remind you and your listeners that I am not in fact gay. Oh, thank God. Now, now, Joe, that's not what we say. It wouldn't matter if I were gay. I'm just saying I'm not. No, no, I know. I just say, thank God for this distraction. This is a pretty fucking great distraction. Yeah. Of course, I don't care if you're gay. Hell, it'd be a great thing for this country if you were and a Democratic party. Hey, we elected the first gay president, dude. But we didn't know about it till afterwards. Kind of ideal. Yeah. I mean, when that does happen, that's the way we should do it. The guy comes out afterwards. And after the inauguration of his successor, you can't do that with black or Asian families. I don't see how you could. Okay, gentlemen, is this the whole thing here? Barack Obama isn't gay. That's right. That's it because I know your buddy there, Dr. Carlson, having some guy on the show and all sorts of crazy things. And they're just that crazy thing. Well, I guess it's his word against yours, huh? Yeah. Well, you might want to believe the guy with all of the pretty good rule of thumb. It's never let me down. Hey, don't worry, buddy. I know you're straight. When I served as your vice president, you were more than just a boss. You were a guy that I knew was always checking out the exact same broad that I was. After we left the room and we were alone, it was always, Oh, do you see her? Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. Can you have a friend like that? You know, he's not gay. Thank you, Joe. I appreciate that. And I still remember some of those women to this day. Okay, are we done here? Honestly, we don't care about your private life, Obama. Can we just move on to more important issues, please? Yes. God love nothing more. All right. Thank you, Mr. President Biden. When are you going to address your obvious cognitive decline? Well, I, I, you know what? Maybe I'm a little gay. All right. Thank you, buddy. Okay. I'm done. I see how this works. I got to go. Goodbye, gentlemen. I have to move on. Always a pleasure, Jimmy. Joe, I'll be in touch this week. I can't wait to be surprised to hear from you. Jimmy, I'll call into your show in about five minutes. Okay. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Spears. and jumps the medium and hits them head on. It's the Ching-tore show. Welcome back to the show Dr. Cornell West. Oh thank you my dear brother. I think about you. I think of George Carlin you know the Union Seminary is right across the street from George Carlin place. Oh really no kidding. The Grand Genius he grew up on a hundred and 21st and Broadway next to Corpus Christi Church and they got a beautiful sign saluting him and look beside Richard Pryor. He's got to be one of the greatest comic genius of the last 50 years my brother. Well I certainly wish he was still alive right now because I know he would see through all the propaganda that we've been living through at least since 2015 but I want to just before we start I want to get this out there because some people misunderstood my coverage of your parents with Anderson Cooper and they took it as an attack on you when I was merely helping trying to help you get the message right about the Ukraine war because as a radical part of your job is to educate people on what's actually happening and you have to be crystal clear in explaining it to people especially about what's happening in Ukraine so people took that as me trying to attack you when I was I was doing it more as a coach trying to uh help you and get it right and that's what I'm going to be doing in this interview also because I was thrilled to hear that you're running third party. You got more courage than I do to do it. You're a better man than me and uh so I mean I appreciate you doing it because you're getting the message out there about the Ukraine war about the two party duopoly. This is really important and so so if uh I just want to tell people so if it seems like I'm being critical of Cornel West from here going forward to the election what it is going to be is me trying to help make his message even better than it is because I think it's really important that his message get out there. That's what this is about. Um so anyway just wanted to clear that up. Oh sure sure sure I think the important thing always is about that you know wait wait the anthem of black folk has left every voice not left every echo. You got a voice. I've got a voice. Our voices overlap. Our voices could have tension. Our voices can conflict. We can learn from one another. We proceed. We've got a similar critique of the predatory capitalist society. We got similar critique of a whole host of issues in certain things we disagree with. Well that's understandable too. I'm learning from you. You learn it from me but it's the respect more than anything else that's crucial here and I think I appreciate you starting off with that kind of reflection my brother very much so. So now people make a big deal out of the fact that you endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and now you're running against him and the reason you well what was the reason you endorsed him in 2020 and what has changed since? There were one hours thoroughly convinced that we needed an anti-fascist coalition and that included the kind of milk toast war among great neo liberals like Biden. Now it's fairly clear Biden had four years yet four years is still the thunder from any kind of Trump challenge four years of trying to speak to the needs of poor and working people four years to try to cut back on the military adventurism that's been characteristic of his whole career and it's clear to me now that if the only opposition to the escalating neo-fascism in the country is going to be Biden Biden Biden or Biden like then the fashion is coming anyway. We're going to have to have alternative vision alternative institutions alternative infrastructure that has an alternative passion and so if all we can do is produce democratic administration that are caretakers postponers of the Trump or Trump like candidate then the fascism is coming anyway the only way you really get at the roots of fascism is the break from the corporate duopoly to show how the two-party system is an impediment for the unleashing not only of American democracy but also trying to dismantle the empire in terms of the 800 military units around the world and the military budget taking 57 cents for every dollar and so in that sense there's been a shift there's no doubt about that and I keep in mind you know I supported Ralph Nader and Jill Stein and in between I had early supported Bill Bradley and I had supported John Kerry as a kind of anti-anti-right wing coalition too so that my jazz-like activity certainly can be characterized at times with a certain kind of inconsistency but it's the timing of it each moment has its own context. So now our friend Nick Cruz says that many climate activists have no idea how much they destroyed all their credibility by endorsing and supporting Joe Biden the Nord Stream pipeline bomber and the largest echo terrorist in modern human history for president why should anyone take climate or environmental issue seriously when you obviously do not now do you what what do you say back to that kind of critique that you by endorsing him you lose your credibility. Well it becomes I mean I think you know I've been on my dear brother show a number of times and I think there's always a certain force in the argument of trying to be consistent and leave third party across the board having no relation whatsoever to the bourgeois politicians. I think there's force to that but I think the credibility that one has really is holistic it's wholesale rather than just retail and the credibility you have in regard to being consistently against war consistently against capital consistently against white supremacy even if it has different kind of stances from one election to the next that would be one of the ways in which I would try to respond to that that would be the beginning of a response to that. Okay here's another tweet from Nick he says the same professional managerial class gaslighters want us to take it easy on Bernie they use civility politics as a weapon so they can comfortably sell out the working class must reject this and start holding these people accountable for selling us out so Bernie had sold us out and I don't need you to call him a sell out or anything that's fine but I do want to see this is your response because Billy Bernie was asked about your campaign and he said it was it shouldn't happen and he's against it and he's in board and endorsing Biden and of course that is just garbage and so this is how you responded you know you even in love people have deep disagreements about these things but I think again he's he's fearful of the neo-fascism of Trump. So when my what I would say to you here and this is a big point and I would try I'm trying to impress upon you going forward that when you do that you you sound a little bit like Joe Biden and what you're doing is you're giving a pass to Bernie Sanders and anybody else for voting lesser of two evils so you're endorsing the Democrats message in their campaign and so now people can dismiss your candidacy and say well we got to worry about the neo-fascism of Trump as if Joe Biden isn't worse which he is he's a bigger fascist and he just crushed a union strike on the railroad which is the definition of fascism. He's now trying to save a rattle with two nuclear powers nuclear war nothing more important than that and what he's doing in Ukraine you know exactly what he's doing right so he's the worst war monger in the world took 300,000 Ukrainians have already been slaughtered in this proxy war that was provoked by NATO which you know so when when do you think that when you say that about when you call Donald Trump a neo-fascist and you don't say that about Joe Biden what do you say when I tell you that you're undercutting your own campaign and you're you are propping up the Democratic message which is that they are the lesser of two evil and you have to vote for Joe Biden so we don't have fascism by the way we already have fascism as we all know fascism is the joining of corporate and government to screw the worker and that's exactly what Joe Biden the Democrats and Pete Buttigieg did and so they and they will keep doing it and they're not stopping it and they're they're also for censorship which is the hallmark of fascism so this idea that Donald Trump is more of a fascist than Joe Biden undermines your own campaign there's no doubt about that and so what I would encourage you to stop doing that well what do you say back I hate Donald Trump we deeply disagree on that though brother I don't think and this is what I disagree with Nick too that and I appreciate your your advice here you know cast in in a respectful way but we do and I disagree with brother Nick on this too that the man just got back from Mississippi you know that you know what the Jenkins and Parkinson's are two brothers brutalized by the police they're at the church the Klan still running wild not just with votes but terrorizing black folk the goons squad finally got caught by the two lawyers brother Malik and brother Trent now what does that mean that means and when you talk about fascism you're talking not just about the rule of big money not just the rule of rule of big military not just the rule of corporate power so that it's oligarchic in essence but you're also talking about dictatorial rule no elections the elimination of dissident voices and then the scapegoating of the most vulnerable which is to be emigrants it can be workers it can be black people Jews Arabs and so forth see with what under Biden what you have is a fascist dimension domestically especially against black folk and others you and I through in fact we're having this dialogue without being eliminated overnight a fascist regime could completely call in the question with what what the use of arbitrary power that's what happens in the mass incarceration regime visa before black people and others right that is the fastest dimension and so in terms of militarism abroad so that there's fascist elements my brother's fascist dimensions but with trump when you have calling in the question transfer of power and so forth that is not the same thing and so that doesn't undermine my campaign and all the campaign about truth hundred percent and undermine your campaign hundred percent you're shooting yourself right in the dick before you even start so that's just bad you're getting bad advice i don't know who's advising you but they're giving you horrible advice jane reese i'm a free man i'm a free man bro so jane reese but i want to hear your argument i want to hear your argument as to how Biden is more fascist than trump even trump just let just let let out right well i'll tell you right now the reason why the the deep state Russi gated trump was because uh he wouldn't bomb enough to calm them down so he wouldn't do enough bombing the reason they impeached him because he wouldn't ship arms to not to not season you grade and he was against that and so that's the that's so just are you are you defending trump it's somehow being a person who is so i don't understand i don't stand your argument at this point no man what what are we talking about okay so there's i want to understand what the content of your argument is because one can in fact okay ring critique the bear on the system as a whole with the two corporate wings but somehow people what do you say to what do you say the trans engagement and lesbian brothers and sisters in terms of their right so uh that's again uh it's that joe joe biden is responsible for the mass incarceration not donald trump who who is more responsible for black and brown people like being locked up and america being the largest penal colony in the world is that donald trumper would it be joe biden by the way this conversation is a loser for your campaign sitting sitting here trying to make the argument but you it's going to be a loser for you too don't try to make trying to make the argument you trying to make the case that somehow we see the democrats are more fascist than the republicans the the fascism cuts across the board but that's not how you say it though you say it's only donald trump you don't say it cuts across the board you call joe biden milk toast and you call donald trump a fascist so you're not saying that joe biden is a fascist really fascist dimensions to the to the biden project you're absolutely right but it's like you're campaigning for joe biden almost when you're doing this that's what it sounds like that's what it's i'm not saying you are doing that i'm saying that's what it sounds like but it sounds like to you that's what it sounds like you and you got a right to be wrong you got a right to be right you sound like to you but it doesn't sound like that to a whole host of mothers at all don't bother not at all okay all right again i'm saying this out of love for you because i do have a deep love for you i have deep respect for you and we agree on almost everything except the message of your campaign right that's the only thing i i would i would hope it would become even more focused let me just put it this way but are you suggesting that the message should be that biden is a greater fascist than trump is no no i'm not saying that you should talk about fascism or any of that stuff i think you should overpass you that was very real i think you should fascism is real in the country it's we're living in it we're living in fascism but i'm talking about escalating in terms of intensity you know it has since since biden became president and certainly has escalated in intensity they've censored everybody they've crushed unions they've tried they've started another war and now they're saber rattling with two nuclear powers i don't know how what they they're i don't know how worse it can get and by the way he still hasn't let people out of prison he still hasn't given student loan he's still denying us health care he doesn't he's an enemy of the worker in a tool of military industrial complex and wall street there's no bigger fascist in the country than joe biden the reason why black around people are locked up again isn't because of trump it's because of brother biden and joe biden is a is proud of that he brags about that he brags about the crime bill and he will never apologize for it so i'm just letting you know that i really want your campaign to pick up traction this is the opposite way to do it who was ever advising you sounds like an infiltrator but but but why do you keep saying advise i'm thinking for myself but i'm okay i don't mean to sell you that's not that's not that's the question with body okay i'm asking who's advising you you think you're a free man too aren't you're right you're right okay i i'm sorry i was trying to put it in a nice way i was used that kind of language my brother you want to be respectful i'm trying to be respectful that's what that was my appreciate i know look like sometimes but i appreciate but we just have this agreement to each day again i'm the money if i undermine the campaign for you then you free to have your own view and be okay people are free to listen okay people are sweeter than i i've got my i'm listening for your insight absolutely right who died about that so let me just say this so the point of running a third party campaign is is to offer an alternative to the two major parties to bring together disaffected members of those parties along with independence and others who feel alienated from the political system as it exists and and the best way to do this is by running on economic issues that unite us but which neither major party is willing to address because they're both beholden to the same powerful corporate interest the democratic party long ago abandoned the working class in favor of beating the drum on cultural issues and now that's all the democrats have to run on so if voters are looking for a party running on trans rights and calling Donald Trump and his supporters white supremacists they can already vote for democrats the role of a third party is to focus not on the identity politics that divide us but on core economic issues that unite us along class lines like christian smalls did and statin island do you think he's he led with lgbtq trans rights and white supremacy or do you think he organized along class lines that's what we have to do you have to organize meet people where they are that's uh so what is your plan to organize along class lines or are you going to keep talking about white supremacy and all those identity politics which are there not from the ground up from the top down to make sure we stay divided what is your plan to organize along class lines well i appreciate again the clarity and candor what you have to say we have profound disagreements brother when i when i when i organize around white supremacy i'm not making some utilitarian calculation i'm speaking as a black man who comes out of a tradition that's been terrorized and traumatized by white elites and that that does not in any way mean it takes me away from class issue class issues are crucial trans class issues are fundamental but it doesn't mean that i'm putting up with white supremacy one of the problems is that you get too many folk who want to talk class class class class and can't say my mumbling word about white supremacy police brutality can't say mumbling word hardly or when they do say it you call it identity politics as if it's not connected to class i'm hitting these head on i'm standing with the workers when it comes to stripes i'm standing with the workers when it comes to greedy bosses i'm standing with the workers when it comes to obsession with profits and the needs not in any way being satisfied but i'll never for a minute be silent i'm not or not raising my voice in terms of vicious treatment of black people indigenous people gay brothers lesbians sisters or trans it's not an either or and that's that's where you and i have a deep profound disappointment so if i see for example i'll watch your show and i notice you hardly say a mumbling word about white supremacy because it's some kind of identity politics and i'm against it but i don't want to talk about it only want to talk about what people hold in common with black people not going to hold it in common if you don't say a word about white supremacy but maybe some of your white friends will so who are you talking about when you talk about in common are you talking about just a majority or what my dear brother i will never ever in a million years not talk about vicious legacies of white supremacy male supremacy homophobic transphobia and others but class will always be very much at the center what brings you and i together is what our fundamental solidarity would work in class it's not just here but around the world but oftentimes when i when i hear i hear about your show you say wow you know these class and these these identity politics if you get in the way get in the way now hundred percent way not getting in the way hundred percent they're used by that so the democrats that's all they have to run on and when you say that stuff you just saw like a democrat because that's all they have so if you need if if if the talk about the dignity of black people in the face of white supremacy makes me sound like a democrat you got the wrong ear plug okay you're not listening clearly because if you if you can't hear the critique of wall street if you can't hear the critique of militarism if you can't hear the critique of the foreign policy in ukraine and all you can hear when i talk about white supremacy is identity politics then something ear plug though bro something's wrong but we just have to disagree with that but what it's disappointing it is what it is you you are profoundly disappointed in that sense but if i still love your brother i still love me too i still love you too i know you i know you're due you i don't disagree with what you're saying i'm talking about having a campaign i'm not there's a okay so um but the campaign is that by utilitarian calculation is i don't look at black people like a utilitarian calculation i can't say nothing because these people over here somehow are alienated i'm telling the truth i'm fighting for justice and if people feel as if to talk about white supremacy is a lady then they gonna be alienated i'm talking about my momma i'm talking about my daddy this ain't no abstract dialogue about politics in the makaville and sense not in all my brother what what what what learned he caught charged together for class politics we march together because that's real but if you if you think to talk about white supremacy just identity politics we got the disagreement that's all so i'm sorry to go on it no no very kind to let me go no go right ahead no go right ahead i don't and i an honest everything i'm saying here it coming from my heart i want your campaign to succeed and i want i want you to have the strongest campaign possible but bernie caught on because he would always if he was given a cultural question or an identity politics question he would always bring it back to class and economics and it doesn't well here i was talking to one of bernie's campaign managers and this is what he said yes i personally agree white supremacy is one of the causes but if i lose two potential allies because they roll their eyes and stop listening before i get to their concerns i've already lost the civil rights advancements women's rights the environmental movement they didn't happen because people like my dad voted democrat because that stuff mattered to them it happened because democrats appealed to them on economic issues and a lot of the democrats they voted for because of economics also happened to vote for that other stuff and it doesn't work in the inverse so i'm just that's i'm just giving that to you no i understand honestly but you can see again how i disagree keep in mind right civil rights movement was not because white folk doing x or y because it was a social movement led by black people in the south that was multi-racial but led primarily by black folk and neither party would have done anything without that social movement hundred percent right you're a hundred percent right no no doubt about it and i think that's my tradition that's my tradition i could you talk about no i love i and i love to hear you talk about all that stuff and and that's good for a radical black activist who's representing his community but i'm just uh trying to impress upon you that there's better ways to to run a presidential campaign and so that for for a black radical activist that's great that's honey but for someone who's trying to appeal to a wide swath of people disaffected republicans independence people that's a death for that campaign that's my opinion that's what we'll we'll have see but keep in mind though brother that one i've never ever said that the all of the followers of brother trump are fascists i said he the neo-fascist piper his followers went out of eight went with bernie went out of twelve went with barack obama he's got a heterogeneous diverse group and i can speak my language of truth and justice that connects to capitalism imperialism white supremacy male supremacy transphobia whatever it is and there's going to be some people who listen and there's going to be some people who don't but this is not just a question of political calculation and microbellian reflection brother this is about the quest for truth and justice you got to be real you got to be authentic i can't i'm not listening to consultant who tell me to use this particular kind of language with this group in this kind of language with that group that is the essence of managerial bourgeois politics i reject it so i heard you say one time that uh someone asked you the same question why don't you call joe biden a fascist but you call donald trump a fascist and one time you said that it was because donald trump criminalizes and demonizes his political opponents and that's what fascists do well of course now they've been trying to criminalize and put in jail donald trump joe biden's number one political opponent just like they did in brazil and pakistan and so the global elite is doing this to anybody and they'll do it to you if you actually become a threat they will criminalize you they've already started to call you right wing and white supremacists of yourself and that's the game they'll call you a sexist they're going to call you your followers are going to be sexist violent uh racist and white surprise all that you're going to be you're already been called a right winger by the establishment so that's the game that they play and what they're doing right now is trying to throw in prison the anybody who the donor class doesn't want to run and it's going to win they'll throw in prison they'll do it to bernie they'll do they rush to gated bernie they said all his followers were sexist and racist and violent they said the same thing that they say about trump and they would have criminalized bernie and put him in jail if he had a spine and he would have stood up to the establishment instead of folding into it so it's it's important i think that people call out what's happening right now i don't like trump one bid i oppose almost everything he says uh almost everything he says and what but he know he called for ending nato so i i join him with that and and and i'll i'll join with anybody to do good and nobody to do wrong okay they're here i'm with you i'm with you on that too and so what's happening right now is what's what they usually do in third world countries but they're doing it right here the donor class doesn't want donald trump to become president and he will if he's allowed to run and so they did this they did the they're they're now they're now four different indictments each one written more ridiculous than the last and here reko the georgia anti-racotering law is being used to charge donald trump and now the reason i bring this up is because they're the same people that did that to donald trump are using the reko charges to go after activists from stop cop city so let me just give you the story and then you can comment on it so georgia prosecutors have filed racketeering charges again 61 people accused of involvement with stop cop city a protest movement against a controversial alanapulis training facility the list of defendants suggests that the case implicates people who have already been arrested on tenuous evidence like a legal observer who was jailed while monitoring protest activists who ran a bail fund for other defendants and a trio of activists arrested while handing out fliers with the name of a cop who killed a fellow protester the reko charges come as georgia's reko statute receives national attention donald trump and a collection of his associates were charged under the state severe reko salute last month statute last month the same grand jury that indicted donald trump on reko charges also indicted the stop cop city defendants are you giving the game now the atlanta journal constitution reported that on tuesday the cop city vote coalition a group that gathered more than a hundred thousand signatures to put the facilities construction up for a vote this year condemned the charges as authoritarian measures by georgia georgia attorney general chris car the group also noted that charging documents as ascribe the alleged racketeering scheme as beginning before the police training facility was even announced laurin reagan executive director of the civil liberties defense fund which has been working in support of defendants said the scope of the case is designed to dissuade people from supporting the stop cop city movement it's been very clear that georgia's intentions and how they've conducted themselves regarding the resistance to cop city has been to try and scare even above ground law biting participants from taking part i think by roping in a legal observer and people running a non-profit and running a lawful bail fund is absolutely intended to scare people from supporting this cause now and in the future in september of twenty one elana approved plans to build a police training facility dubbed cop city by opponents in the city south river forest the plans were controversial approximately seventy percent of locals who weighed in during a public comment oppose the facility citing its costs ninety million dollars its environmental impact and its potential effect on over policing in atlanta when the city moved ahead with the plans for construction activist protested on the proposed construction site police shot and killed a protester manual tortugia esteban paes taran in january when they accused taran of firing a gun subsequent autopsies have cast doubt on those claims soon after taran's killing police charge more stop cop city activists with terrorism despite many being accused of nothing more than misdemeanor trespassing around the proposed construction site in a later crackdown police conducted mass arrest at stop cop city music festival accusing some people of engaging in property damage at a nearby protest on the questionable basis that those people allegedly had mud on their shoes the music festival was held in a forest one of those legal observers was an attorney with the southern poverty law center in the national lawyers guild footage appears to show thomas jurgens being arrested while wearing one of the neon green hats that identifies nlg legal observers we had some differences when i say we i mean myself and the attorney general's office about who should be charged with what they should be charged with boston told w a b e she added that jurgens case was one of the touch points of a number of touch points that ultimately led me to make the decision that i have made here now the value set of our office is that i will only proceed on cases that i believe i can make beyond a reasonable doubt the reko charges also named three activists who were arrested this summer in charge with money laundering and charity fraud connected to their work running a bail fund that supported stop cop city defendants prosecutors allege that the trio committed felonies by spending some of the funds money on such things as gasoline forest cleanup totes covid rapid tests media yard signs and other miscellaneous expenses marlin kauchts one of the bail fund organizers named in the reko charges told the daily beast that the indictment was part of an effort to discredit activists these indictments are just the latest chapter in a long-running campaign by governor campin at land authorities to terrorize political activists since the beginning of the movements against cop city the georgia attorney general has shown a willingness to abuse the legal process as a weapon against political opposition judges hang on judges have questioned the constitutionality of their methods and even local prosecutor sherry boston has publicly condemned this prosecution as baseless and refused to participate make no mistake this indictment is not about enforcing the law it's a desperate overreach in an attempt to discredit legitimate political opposition and it won't work that's exactly what they're doing to donald trump that's exactly what they'll do to you that's exactly what they'll do to bernie sanders that's exactly what they'll do to me they'll do to anybody who is a threat to the establishment and so we get a pretty and let me get a word i'm going to let you so i just want you to so i just want to so go ahead take it where you will i'm very glad that you're zeroing in on the struggle we shut down cop city i'm in deep solidarity with them we're working together in the coming weeks virtually and so forth but there's a logical fallacy a rational gap in your attempt to compare freedom fighters against a vicious system in the name of every day folk in gettos in hoods and working class commuters against the police versus trump trump i'm not in solidarity with trump i wanted to have a fair trial i'm not in solidarity with trump simply because they use the same law against courageous visionary freedom fighters against police brutality and police murder versus the same law against the gangster like trump doesn't put gank trump on a spectrum with freedom fighters brother at all get that put him on respect him at all that's the fundamental difference between you and i in this case but i'm glad you're talking about a couple of shutting down cop city because we know it's planned to be in another number of other cities of the well but i'm in mrs. sippy it was a goon squad the goon squad is shot through cities across the country we saw the members of that land in cicado but the idea of you recognizing that the same weaponization against these courageous freedom fighters is somehow on its spectrum with trump i radically radically reject that i want a fair trial but i think he's probably done a number of things that warrants a serious fair child with him going to jail but we shall see so you're for prossy so you're for prosecuting the last president after he loses an election you think that's a good way to run a democracy because again you don't see the connection that this is the donor class criminalizing anybody who they don't like and they'll do it to you and they'll do it to bernie and they'll do it to anybody else and so you don't have to like uh donald trump i don't at all but i see what the game is being played here and you don't see that game being played you don't see this game really i see the game the same law against the proud boys i wanted a fair trial oh my god but at the same time they're doing for the proud they're being subsidized but see but i think you're i think you're supporting trump is deeper than you you're acknowledging you can't i don't like trump i don't like trump how can you compare trump with with freedom fighters against totally i'm not compared i'm not comparing that i'm saying that the i'm saying no i'm not saying i'm not it is of course they're going to use it against anybody who is the government okay if that's amazing that you don't see this and it's unbelievable that you don't see this it's such a loser for you there's opportunity to show the deep deep differences very deep differences though but you you you do what you got to do what i'm doing i got to do what i learned from you and i hope you can learn a little bit from me but we shall see the biggest story of my lifetime if it wasn't russia gate uh which led directly to the ukraine war and i said it was going to in 2017 when they did this and i told everybody at the young turks they're going to use this to start a war they're going to use this and they did and so here we are and uh so what i want to read the the second biggest story is probably the covid lockdown if not the biggest and so many people who are supposed to be out in front on this drop the ball uh people like no chompsky so here's the green party what they said they said the green party which you're running with the green part of the united states steering committee strongly supports the use of vaccines vaccine mandates and quarantines as part of a comprehensive public health effort to curb and eradicate the novel coronavirus pandemic that has swept the globe since early 2020 the whole thing was a hoax and here's what the black caucus of the green party said they said the national black caucus of the green party of the united states strongly opposes the use of force vaccination via mandates and the discrimination that is being generated around these policies lockdowns mandates and passports are the major issue of the day with millions of people protesting against them worldwide in fact what has become known as the medical freedom movement is arguably the biggest and most diverse international movement in world history vaccine mandates and vaccine passports are among the most vile unconstitutional immoral unscientific discriminatory and outright criminal policies ever forced upon the population and goes against everything the green party stands for under social justice these policies are coming from an out of control government at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry the mainstream media and social media are also working in lockstep to censor any and all doctors scientists and investigative journalists who have an opposing view or who even question the current mainstream media orthodoxy workers are being forced out of their jobs many with medical exemptions from their doctors students are being denied entrance to educational institutions needed medical treatment is being denied medical privacy is being violated constitutionally protected rights to movement and assembly including the right to travel are being threatened rights to normal societally participation are being decimated it has taken a while but more recently many medical professionals elected officials and federal judges have come out fully against lockdowns vaccine mandates vaccine passports and of course massive censorship the national black caucus of the green party of the united states adheres to the principle that inform consent in all personal health and medical decisions is an enable human right under no circumstances sell any medical treatment or procedure including psychotropic medications vaccines or other injectable treatments be mandated or coerced individuals should be allowed to protect he and heal themselves in a manner that best supports their medical spiritual beliefs so i i did want to i don't understand why you are outraged by that why don't do you share the sentiment of the black caucus of the green party and have you talked to them but one thing is good to have a green party where you have a variety of different voices that are clashing and the tensions are very real i think there's no doubt that the pharmaceutical company has played a disproportionate role in shaping public policy i think they're the kind of concerns that you and rfk jr and others have certainly well well grounded in that sense on the other hand we know there's been a whole host of vaccines in regard to other kinds of illnesses that that are much more effective the question becomes making sure and one of the things i want to do i want to have a truth commission that find out exactly what was the level of corruption that took place during these years be able to see not just the text we know the books are out there but they have a truth commission so that we can see what voices were marginalized what voices were pushed and make sure it never happens again i resonate with the spirit of what my green black brothers and sisters are saying but the green party itself does allow this kind of disagreement and so on but i'll say this though but i know i got to go but i must say you see this is where you and i do in some ways live in different worlds because as as crucial and as important as the issue of vaccines and the covid situation was when you say that's probably the most important issue in your lifetime on the last 25 or 30 years in light of all the war in light of what palestinas are going through and light of what workers are going through 63 percent i'm living paycheck to paycheck in terms of all the vicious attacks of the police and the murders and so forth and yet this vaccine issue is the most important thing i say okay that's my dear brother jimmy he's got a reactor raised this force i'm not going to in any way push it away but i just live in a different world as important as vaccines have been if i had another chance i'd be leaning much more with the black caucus but that but what i think was the deaf weightiest issues vaccines does not come immediately to mind it just doesn't that's the kind of world we live in brother okay we i spent you know well here is black business owners collapsed by 41 percent black business because of lockdowns if you carry yet well 70 000 workers in one state were fired because of vaccine mandates when are you going to care do they all have to be trans how do you when are you going to care about these workers what are you going to care about what are you going to care about this they have to be trans for me to care we don't care why don't you care about this why would you excuse me of course i care about it you're just you're saying it's not important i didn't say it wasn't important i said it was not the most fundamental issue in my lifetime last 30 years but forced medical experiments forced medical experiments that the skin was the new one oh my god so you missed this story and you're not

one who's kind of wandering off and losing it at times how about this guy over here he only happens to be the president of the united states take more look at the orange thank you uh mr president thank you oh my god at the end of such a momentous event he's still thank you seems kind of inadequate but for all the millions whose lives will be saved for the communities where life will be transformed thank you so thank you president biden for your add stand um hold on sorry i was texting done again because i like you got to make a dance a biden dance yeah of like that dance he does uh-huh should get your almighty like this hey where you go man hey where's dave hey he's still calling out names and then stop and go like this now do you have a sniff he did you remember when he was at the g7 when he just went wandering off into like a cafe no in either disease and he had on those white sneakers that you see at the nursing homes that they put on you so you can walk and you won't trip those on but the thing about it is is that a lot of people are saying that you know with his mental capacity kind of fading away now he just doesn't remember certain stories and whatnot but that's not the truth because joe biden before he even started losing his mental capacity yeah was always a liar took around my mouth when his brain worked yes it wasn't good yes it sucked for 50 years it's probably better how bad his brain is because if he was in charge i mean he'd be carrying out much worse stuff i bet he signed on for every bad idea that if you're a liberal you pretended you have a problem with but now have somehow forgotten because you can't remember anything since trump got in that one time i don't know about that there's people out there that will still argue that donald trump is worse than joe biden i want joe biden you said that biden did better we're different than trump give me one i know one okay i know one i but it's it's he lessened the restrictions and the sanctions on cuba he did biden did you uh yeah donald trump a week out of his presidency and more on you do and then biden loosen i thought biden loosen them when he almost like a year into it he lifted some of the remittance restrictions in other words you had a cap on the remittance you can send you couldn't fly there he canceled all flights that don't get me wrong he still didn't like unclassify them as a state sponsor of terrorism so he could tell what obama did before he left yes oh i didn't know that well there you go yes for a round there i don't know specifically but but no not no not completely maybe with loosening up the restrictions on remittances and allow planes planes to go there and people to go there right he still left them listed as a state sponsor of terrorism well then light of evanis syndrome yeah so biden loves to recall certain stories but some aren't incredible no shit i've never heard him tell a story that wasn't made up he's always got one listening corn pop president by and like many politicians likes to tell stories kurt uh stories that attempt to connect his life story with his audiences and make up an essential part of his persona oh god speak it to survivors of the devastating maui fire fire on august 21st this is when he was speaking biden recalled how lightning had one struck upon outside his home sparking a fire my fellow pineapple rico i know what it is to have a fire you you be a black guy person do you to make sure uh to make a long story sure i almost lost my wife my 67 corvette and my cat he said i think all kidding aside i'm serious my my my wife my car and my car i almost lost my cat but throughout his career most famously in his presidential campaign in the 1988 election cycle then after the fire the auginer government pulled a fence around my house to cover it up so no one could see what happened in my kitchen and then he only gave me seven out of bucks man biden's propensity to exaggerate or embellish tales about his life led to doubts about his truthfulness no doubt about his untruthfulness there's no contemporary news reports on the house fire do not match his telling of it oh my fanny criticism that he had lied to a vulnerable audience i don't know any audience that's vulnerable this is a match so wait they don't match kurt he lied and now it's fanny it wasn't a 67 corvette and a cat oh god what was it it was an 83 malibu and eternal wait oh no i have no clue i thought you were gonna give me something juicy and you just said that to me i know i'm not as talented as you guys i can't think on the fly well neither buzzes talented as biden because this is a sweet ass video that you have teed up it's one of my favorites of all time in 1988 he had to suspend his presidential run for what plagiarism as a flying when i was a kid i remember that yes that was such a big political thing that was a kid that really stuck out so there was sixth grade maybe and now he doesn't on a regular basis buddy i was in ninth grade they called i was a freshman okay they call him uncle joe yes nickname around town's uncle it's not good you know unless you live in china then you may be a respected you know i call him joey b it's a term of didn't get it yeah it's a term of like uncle joey's a little weird that's that's how it works he's a gangster i've always called him joey b joey bananas joey b he's gonna call everybody a nickname he got to take a look at this video over here this is back in 1988 so biden today faces a controversy three weeks ago at a debate at the Iowa state fair he used phrases identical to those delivered by british labor party leader Neil kennick biden seemed to be claiming kennick's vision and wife as his own why is it that my wife is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college wave kenn is the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get the university my ancestors who worked in the coal mines in northeast pennsylvania know come up after 12 hours and play football eight hours underground and then come up and play football it's because they didn't have a platform upon which to stand there was no platform upon which they could stand the notion that every thought or notion or idea you have to go back and find and attribute to someone i think is quite frankly ludicrous the problem is that's kind of like he called his audience he'd just been thinking about these things and he failed to give any credit at all is rippish i think a lot of people are uh karles mincea and apology yeah stop his career went right i mean straight down yeah he should have ran for president yeah it's different for these guys the predator class the elites the one percent they get to go get away from it they are throwing it in your face ladies and gentlemen at this point 81 million votes my eye wait what does that mean you know i was thinking on the way over here now that's a little too much because as you point out what's behind the words what's there and a lot of people are wrapped on biden has always been that it's just a surface i should have said to paraphrase Neil kennick see only time i didn't yeah no kidding never used it but cbs news found a tape of a second instance no it reappeared in the new york times with a new charge that biden had appropriated a famous litany from the late robert kennedy about what the gross national product cannot measure cannot measure the health of our children the health of our children the quality of our education for godly of their education god and not the joy of their play for the joy of their play biden gave kennedy no credit or if he's also poised to paraphrase john kennedy jubre hum free and pretty slaver party leader neo kennock all without credit joseph biden admitted today that he committed plagiarism when he was in law school he said it was a mistake but that it was unintentional he quoted five which time someone else's work without proper citation i've done some dumb things i'll do dumb things again no she wouldn't even an f i've been dumb to the political community in washington i done dumb things i do dumb things again four more years yeah i know right now that now think how great it's going to be now that his brith said even better but trump kurt what you know i think that to you don't try to take my thing all right this is uh let's trump kreg does that goes keeping his promise i'll do some dumb things again right okay i i mean kurt they have to be rubbing this shit in your face at this point right now they keep wheeling this guy out they can't even speak because he lost all his mental facilities doesn't all of my friends and i mean a friend of mine when i was back in on the east coast who went to harvards it was smart dude who i i think by his basically a good guy you know i'm like i'd have a beer with him no no you didn't say that no come on that's what they said about george bush i know your boomer for even remembering that let's play he goes i think he's basically a command and so all the people they're supporting him are on purpose not watching anything he says on purpose the people that are watching it and like you like that that's the hardcore like jim jones they would drink whatever drink they were given kind of yeah yeah well whenever i ask people hey how's that biden thing going for you anything's better than we had before him it's literally worse than no you mean your emotional state you know i uh my dad when i got elected vice president he said joey uncle frank fought in the battle of the bolts you're not feeling very well now not because the battle of the balls but he said and he won the purple heart and he never received it he never never got it do you think you could help and get it well surprise him so he got on the purple heart he had won it in the battle of balls and i remember came over the house and i came out and he said presented to him okay we had the family there i said uncle frank he won this and i went to peace and i don't want the damn thing i'm serious he said i don't want it i said what's a medical frank you earned it he said yeah but the others died the others died i lived i don't want it god you know and the stories are hacky too by the way he makes up stories that aren't worth listening to even all right so check this out joe biden says after he was elected vice president he awarded his uncle frank with the purple heart he earned at the battle of the bulge there is no evidence any of this is true and biden's uncle died in 1999 while biden wasn't elected vice president into two thousand was uncle frank there's like more things wrong with that we did this before and it came out and he oh here we go yeah there'll be a biden story about uncle frank doesn't add up yeah classic biden every part of it was wrong it says it's a good thing that he graduated top of his class i don't know if you're talking about class right the bottom three or four out of his class i was voted most likely to become the vice principal of the united states of america he's been voted most likely to wet his pants in the oval office that's
