Make sure you download and subscribe to the podcast plus download our radio app and be able to take the show with you everywhere as well. Now we have talked as those of you who have downloaded the podcast will know a great deal about the Hunter Biden case New York Times confirming that Merrick Garland's Department of Justice would not allow charges to be brought in California. We've talked about the consequences of that the media coverage surrounding the Biden crime family. We talked with Senator Ron Johnson in the last hour. We've discussed the latest on the Daniel Penny case. Now let's dive into the most consequential I would say boycott. Maybe in modern American business history. I can't think of a more consequential boycott than what has happened to Bud Light every single week now. The amount of Bud Light being consumed sets a new low nearly 30% decline so far as we move into June. There are now reports that Bud Light is so desperate for its product to be consumed that they are considering just giving it away for July 4th because the beer will go bad if it's not bought. You guys have continued to send us clips and footage since May when I did the experiment buck to see whether or not anybody would actually drink Bud Light. It's only gotten worse since then. You guys have sent all sorts of photos and videos of people buying every beer but Bud Light. It has become so consequential this collapse in Bud Light market share that they now are the second most popular beer in America probably trending towards third or fourth as their market share collapses. Meanwhile Miller Light and Coors Light have been the beneficiaries. This infestation for lack of a better way to describe it of the woke virus has now spread by the way from Bud Light to Bud Wiser and also to Mick Ultra which are under the same larger parent company. So Buck things have gotten so bad that the CEO of Bud Wiser decided hey I need to speak out I'm going to go on CBS's morning show and it didn't go very well for him. He was asked whether he would still make the same decision as it pertains to Dylan Mulvaney. I believe we have a cut of what it's fair to say was a disastrous attempt at rehabbing the Bud Wiser brand. Here it is. I asked you what you do it again and people on the trans rights side of things that supporting that community want you to say yes of course we want that fortitude and people on the right would criticize you for saying yes so where are you on the issue I mean wasn't some mistake. Bud Light has supported LGBTQ since 1998 so that's 25 years and as we've said from the beginning we'll continue to support the communities and organizations that live supported for decades but as we move forward you know we want to focus on what we do best which is brewing great beer for everyone listening to our consumers being humble and listening to them making sure that we do right by our employees take care and support our partners and ultimately make an impact in the communities that we serve. It's just not good enough. That's just not going to work. It's just so bland you know at a minimum he's got to say I understand right. We on we know what's going on here. He doesn't want the activists to come after him from the other side because while the beer drinkers are not activists it doesn't matter the activists of the LGBTQIA plus plus plus community have a lot of funding and a lot of power in corporate America as a result of well many years of building up this machinery but what he could say is look it's a mistake for us to get political at all. We disrespected our audience by doing so. We will never make that mistake again. Take ownership. This whole we just like to make beer and we just want to focus on the beer. It's like yeah we get that that's what you want to say now but what happened was disrespectful and really in a front to your core audience or core consumer in this case except that be honest about it ask for their forgiveness and say this is never going to be an issue again. Bud Light is an American beer for Americans and we don't do the politics thing. We don't squabble. We don't lecture. We don't undermine people. We don't hate people. We just want everyone to you know there's a way to do it and the way to do it is not corporate doubles speak because you're afraid of because really what what the LGBTQIA plus plus plus community wants is for him to bend the knee again. Yeah because if he shows that the lesson learned is some consumers don't want that stuff that activism other companies might get wise to this too so they won't let this go and he knows that that's why he's caught in the middle here but ultimately if you're a company your consumer is your boss. That's the part of this dude I said this to you. I mean yes we have a boss I heard media but really who do we work for? Yeah we work for this audience. This audience that rush built over decades we work for the audience and in that sense the audience is our boss but light works for the consumers of their beer and they forgot that and they still don't really want to go back to basics here go back to first principles as a as look it is a great American brand or it was. Yeah Buck this was the entire thesis of my last book and I took a quote that Michael Jordan has now admitted to saying that I think every CEO should emblazon in his mindset and he was asked why did he not get political? Why did Michael Jordan never really step into any elections in the 80s or the 90s or the early 2000s? You know what he said Republicans by sneakers too and I think it's just such a smart quote right if your goal is to only service one segment of the population then I understand if you're Bud Light and you're like we want to be the beer of the trans community that is our identity then I would say okay this makes sense but if you're that big of a brand you want everyone to drink your beer you can't be the number one beer in America and only serve Republicans or only serve Democrats or only serve independents and that guy and look I'm sure the CEO has probably been bathing basically in PR consultants and what you end up doing when you bathe in PR consultants is you don't sound like a real person I think so many politicians have this same disease you guys sometimes hear them on this show when they talk they don't sound like somebody that you're having a beer with and if that CEO wants to connect connect with America he has to sound like somebody who has a beer would sound like and what I would say is a lot of what you said hey we want every single American to drink our beer and if we made the choice and we ended up alienating football fans and we ended up alienating blue collar workers which you did and we ended up alienating dudes out there in America by saying our humor was too fratty and they were out of touch we blew it and we shouldn't have done that and that's why we fired our marketing execs because we lost touch with who we are and who we were and I'm gonna fix that that's not scripted I just said that I think it would play well and it's natural it's authentic and it's real the fact that these guys can't do that is I think a testament to what happens to so many of these brands but can you know it you get big enough and then you start listening to the people in New York and LA who were never in your base and they don't understand your audience and you end up looking like a fool you get these CEOs who really just care about what the foursome at the half a million dollars to join golf club think about what's going on and not what their core customers and consumers need believe want and and you know the way to best serve them I've been mentioning the LGBTQIA plus plus plus community I think it's also worth noting Clay that people are starting to get a funny feeling about some of this and not just those of us who are on the right but more broadly like what's going on here this was from one of the pride parades it was actually here in New York City we have the audio of this here they are saying chanting well I'll let you hear it from them play okay I guess they said it the one time there with other times where they said we're here we're we're coming for your children and this was a chant that was heard there was it was also said other places and we know that not only because of the video of this now isn't amazing how many people everyone walks around with the ability to go viral at any moment based on what they see if they record it it's really changed our perception of what's happening in a hulk otherwise if you had to rely on standard news organizations to tell you that there are pride parades where there are activists or just you know people participating this saying we're coming for your children very strange NBC News trying to clean up this because people say what is that all about what do you mean you're coming for our children NBC News wrote the coming for your children chant has been used for years at pride events according to long long-time march attendees and gay rights activists who say it's one of many provocative expressions used to regain control of slurs against LGBTQ people okay this did not have the intended effect i think clay that they wanted nbc news because first of all what is at the center right now of the lgbt activist debate and the rest of the country should children be transitioning medically whether through hormones or surgery so there is a coming for the children reality here and the chanting of this at pride marches this is not this is not a good look a lot of people are saying what is going on here i i think this is an emblematic buck of what i said i think yesterday and i'm not claiming to be an expert in the gay community but i think there are a lot of gay people listening to us right now gay people who voted for Donald trump are trying to decide who they're going to vote for in the republican primary this is not an insubstantial percentage of the gay population i think it's probably growing and a lot of these people i think are seeing this argument about children having surgeries to affirm their gender which is what they try to say and they think it's this craziest straight people do because gay people are raising kids now and they don't want their eleven-year-old to be coming in and saying i need to get my boobs chopped off or i need to get my penis removed most people believe that biology is real of all different types and persuasions and even a lot of trans people i think buck would say yeah under 18 trans surgery or giving people hormones to stop them from going into puberty so that you can change their gender and flood them with estrogen or testosterone or whatever direction it is it's crazy and again this is why i think slowly and it is happening to slowly for me we are winning this argument and clips like those i think are going to eventually blow up and create a civil war in the lesbian gay larger unity platform because there's lots of disagreement i think in the gay community where people would step back and say yeah we shouldn't be chanting we're coming for your children and we shouldn't be encouraging young kids to have this gender reassignment surgery and so this is part and parcel of what i think is ultimately going to occur this is one of the thesis of my book and i'm i'm a optimist as you well know buck i think the identity politics eventually collapses on itself because of warring identities and the oppression olympics requires that somebody be the supreme victim and it's easy to say oh white men are the problem but now when you have to sort of self analyze and look internally i think what you're starting to see is much of this left-wing craziness is collapsing on itself maybe i'm too optimistic but i think this is emblematic of it what you see inside of the gay community um as we go forward we'll talk about it more i gotta tell you we live in a thriving technology filled world between buck and myself man we've got so many different website social media platforms you know we got more than 20 computers working on this show every single day and guess what if one of those goes down we're in trouble two or more go down we're actually screwed uh we know it that's why we have backups and we have backups of our backups and probably i'm jinxing us and the backups of the backups might fail but if that happens guess what we've got iDrive with iDrive you can backup all

such thing as 11 foot long shark but i'm saying in the hierarchy of an animal that could end you there are the animals we were like fair play you know if a nyl crocodile or a 15 foot great white or a siberian tiger decides it's your number i get it a lemon shark a lemon shark is this is like the bud light of sharks you do not expect to get ended by a lemon shark okay i don't even think there's ever been a lemon shark fatality in history even though they're a little bit on the bigger side bull shark yes even the uh the oceanic white tip if you're in like a ship disaster can be very dangerous great whites and tigers are usually the ones people are so worried about so i'm just saying i don't know anything about lemon sharks but you just obliterated them by calling them the bud light of shark i'm just you know and now if i were to get got by a lemon shark one day out there swimming on the beach in miami it would be justice for the animal kingdom because i'm calling out the lemon shark it generally somewhat docile and not particularly dangerous fish but have you even gotten in the ocean yet in miami yeah a couple of few times i'm far out did you go prepping for this show oh i

get some of your calls here momentarily wanted to mention this buck several maybe like a year ago we discuss sage steel who is one of the uh honest and forthright and sane espian employees she filed a lawsuit against espian which is of course owned by woke disney and in that lawsuit she said that she was punished because she went on i believe it was jay cutler's podcast uh jay cutler former nfl quarterback uh good dude is one of the owners of the beer here in nashville by the way buck craddis which i would encourage all of you who like america to drink um but uh in tennessee but the interesting thing about it is she said and criticized at the time that she didn't think it made sense for espian to be requiring that everybody get the covid shot and so she was she said punished for going out this wasn't on espian airwaves this uh a podcast outside of espian's network she said she was punished over this follow lawsuit now word has come out that espian has offered her five hundred thousand dollars to settle the lawsuit and she is refusing because she wants to stand on the principal that she was right when she said that espian shouldn't have mandated the covid shot so good for her um i hope she stands to uh stick to her guns and holds disney slash espian responsible for what they did to all their employees in mandating that shot yes i mean this is standing on principal over dollars which is frankly all too rare all right uh tom in oak creek wisconsin truck driver what you got for us uh this is a man i got a lot of points to make my my daughter's actually a lesbian and i got a conversation with her over father's date about all these subjects that you were just talking about with uh alphabet alphabet Nazis um um first of all buck if um if you're swimming man don't get forced into a transition surgery by uh by uh uh one of them sharks okay because they like the nuts and berries okay worst place worst place to be bit by i mean oh that's a good point you don't want to get bit on the on the groin the lemon shark coming after you don't be fooled by the name buck i feel like you've jinxed yourself lemon shark lemon shark just like a little nibble you know it's like it's like what you get from a chihuahua no big deal anyway listen really closely though she talked about the transition stuff right she said um stay away from the kids uh she still thinks that 18 is too young to do it 25 if you want to get your uh twig and berries cut off go at it because you don't know anything at 18 can i just you know one one thing and tom thank thank you for calling in and we we love all of our uh truckers all across the country because i just we got a lot of truckers who listen but the great thing is they listen for three hours a lot of them at a time right because they're all and they go from one affiliate to the other so we sometimes they'll pass through multiple areas multiple radio affiliates so it's great we really appreciate all of you guys and gals um but you know clay and we've kind of got into this a little bit the other day equality means the same standards for everybody right yeah so okay pride parade fun we've got gay marriage fun dancing naked and fun little kids not okay for anybody not okay for gay not okay for straight not you know this is because because we're going to treat everybody equally right we're going to understand that sexualization of children is something that we should all and this is what's so interesting the gay couples i know who have adopted kids or how to surrogate or whatever they feel the same way as you and me and this audience does you know so that's that's when you start to really like yeah exactly we have the same standards right the standard has to be enforced why is it that these left wing activists and i think it's in part because what are the activists even fight you know the trans issue and pushing the age issue on trans lower and lower all the time it's really all you know that's what they exist for now what do these activist entities exist for like what are they even really doing other than running around and trying to make companies destroy themselves by trying to sexualize children or have trans influencers selling beer that's one of the challenges i said that came out of the decision to allow gay marriage to me we've reached the full extent of progressive values at that point in time and i don't i wondered what was next i mean and and maybe polygamy in 25 years more even alarming than that buck i think is the idea and you we talked about it a little bit yesterday you're starting to hear people argue that minors should be able to consent to sexual relationships right it's a fringe opinion but it's one that you never heard 20 years ago like nobody would have even floated the idea it was activists if you remember when when during the during the covid pandemic um there was the the issue of of monkeypox and the activists kept trying to push against that go on cnn and some of the someone worked for the Biden administration member in health was trying to say you know oh well we can't share the data the data is that it's overwhelmingly from orgies yeah that's the problem that mean and overwhelmingly like 90 plus of the spread was occurring at orgies and so orgies yes and so what if we're talking about health i want to protect people from this it's is disfiguring it's you know it's serious it's it's a nasty illness you know we got to look at the facts and you can't say oh but you know we're all everything's the same we're all equal but we're gonna we're gonna change health data because we're afraid of stigma for some subset of a community it's like no no no health is health let's protect people let's give them the real information they need to avoid the health issue let's not try to change the data or massage it in some way that it gotta be careful yeah makes it more politically palatable it's funny too that you mentioned that because all the things that they told us we had to do during covid they weren't willing to tell the gay community hey just don't have orgies for a little while that doesn't seem like most people out there to imagine like have never managed have managed to avoid gay orgies their entire life do you know who and i mean i can name so i can name some of them friends of ours you know who are in media who are gay they were the harshest critics of that whole monkeypox messaging thing of like well we can't tell people it's guys be careful you can get this at an orgy that was the medical reality at that time of that disease but we were not able to say that out loud the gays that i know and generally the gays were married and have adopted a kid or two or whatever they were like yeah that's what's good they were the ones who were saying it so the activists are bullying within their own community on some of these issues too which i think is exactly what tom the trucker who called in about his daughter who's a lesbian was saying yeah and buck i also think this builds on some of the arguments are totally incoherent for instance remember when it was hey you can't refer to covid as the china virus and then they built it even further and they said they tried to argue that it was racist to suggest that covid might have come from a chinese lab same yeah but remember what they were arguing instead that it actually came from the wet market and the reason was because of how dirty the wet market was and you know where the wet market was more racist right like the wet market argument actually seems more racist than it escaped from a lab so they're not even consistent their argument was it's so dirty in chinese markets that there are tons of different viruses spreading there and it's really unsafe the the lab virus actually seems way less racist what's really not even about just the the cleanliness of of these so-called wet markets the diversity the zoological diversity that they have there and this is not very well known but it is true these so-called wet markets popped up in china this goes all the way back to the Maoist famine of the had to eat everything roughly 1960 where because of the idiotic communist policies you had tens of millions of people in the 20th century everybody starved to death and so they started to eat anything to stay alive and so there were these markets where Chinese you know peasants agrarian uh you know agrarian societies would eat bats would eat you know salamanders would eat anything basically that they could get their hands on and then it became kind of a cultural over time practice in some of these areas and actually became kind of big business so while china has said you can't do this anymore as a policy government policy they still pop up in places because people make a lot of money and they're used to eating pangolin in some spots that's how this all goes communism bad things it does bad things it's a rule just saying it's good for people to know we'll get to some more your calls here in a second look famed economist and best-selling author no-me prince is out with a new warning she says a small group of

we got a vip email from gabe clay he writes hey guys gabe from the spicy shark hey we are a hot sauce company oh wow i like that i like the slide plug well done we are a hot sauce company but we work in shark conservation i've ran with sharks many times including bulls and lemons no shark deserves the disrespect of being the bud light of sharks but yes it would be talking like death by chihuahua for a lemon shark stay spicy so i'm now gonna try this guy's spicy are you a hot sauce guy in general i i do do the hot sauce regularly not really but you know they've done so many of these spice spicy challenges on youtube that my boys are obsessed with it and obviously here in Nashville we have hot chicken which is now spread everywhere and so they have different flavors of hot chicken so that is kind of a local delicate and you ever tried the Nashville hot chicken i can't because it's breaded uh yeah that's sad for me that's pretty good so but the boys they have all these like ghost pepper challenges and all this different stuff uh and they love it on youtube so we have done some of that uh just because the boys have gotten so into it because of those youtube clips go viral yeah um let's see we've got bill in long island new york place i love and i spent tons of time bill what's going on hey guys great show as always listen uh buck and and tray uh first of all about the beer i switched from uh micha-lo ball trip to uh ying-lang which is the oldest beer in the country it's an absolutely great beer and uh this thing has been bothering me and a lot of people i know and it's about joe biden do you think because tray you're up you're a lawyer and buck you work for the cia do you think the president committed treason i mean he left all these classified information stuff all over four states and the one that bothers me the most is because i'm a new york city fireman i've worked down in china town he left some of this stuff in china town which is the no the craziest thing i ever heard in my life why would he leave all this classified information all over the states so so bill states uh we've uh first of all thank you for for calling it from long island and thank you for uh for what you do making sure if you need a fireman you need them when you need them um but uh i'd say this the treason issue klai and i talked about this on the show as a legal uh definite the legal definition of treason is very specific and it's a very high bar and that would not the espionage act stuff has to do with handling mishandling and miss sharing if you will of information but it's not actually espionage that biden is being accused of which is an important distinction it falls under the espionage act which is a big umbrella law like when i was in the cia we'd play always we were always worried like oh my god i don't want to get you know jammed up under the espionage act that could happen even if you say uh you know if you shared information with a reporter that was classified now that reporter is a you let's say it's assuming it's a u.s citizen you're not helping a foreign power but if there's that disclosure even if the reporter didn't further disclose it publicly you could be nailed under the espionage act so it's not committing espionage necessarily it's mishandling of classified but treason is aid in comfort to the enemy during a time of war so that's a very high bar to hit i think you could hit hunter with conspiracy charges relating to a variety of different attempts to conceal his income from foreign sources certainly for all sorts of tax evasion i also think that there is if you had a really thorough investigation the potential that some of that money was being funneled to joe biden and he did not report it on his taxes i also think again the biggest story now associated with hunter to me buck we've known that he did the tax evasion for a long time i think you could really hit him with the lobbying for foreign government based on what he was sending in these what's-app messages and the money that he was getting and i also think that the obstruction by merit garland and other elements of the department of justice is a huge mess for the entire biden administration going forward up to it including in my opinion joe biden who was willing to do whatever it took to protect his son from any sort of consequential uh treatment there let's see who else we got on the lines here um walt in Panama city florida walt what do you got for us hey good afternoon appreciate you having me on here um i was in this is off topic but i was in a hotel in trolston couple weeks ago they have a gated parking lot adjoining their hotel and as we were pulling in there was a big sign that said electric vehicles are not allowed in this parking lot due to fire hazard and i just thought that was humorous the way that the libs are pushing electric vehicles on everybody but they've got all these issues with them well also the electricity that thank you for calling in the electricity that they use tends to come from coal plants so there's so there's that with the whole we're saving the planet clay big lemon shark kind of like big tobacco is weighing in feverishly in our vip in box here at clannbuck.com subscribe today stan writes buck wrong again when i was a navy diver lemon sharks were a species of concern more dangerous than a white tip but between a black tip and a tiger especially in murky waters cheers from our obviously i'm gonna tell you right now look if you're gonna be worried if you're gonna be worried about somebody's pomeranian biting you that's up to you folks i'm lemonsharks are the pomeranians the chihuahuas of the sea they're just technically you could get bit but let's not be wimps i do not know if i would be picking sharks as my enemy of choice from an irony perspective if i were you living in miami i would i would have my head on a swivel next time i go in the water you know what else all these clips will get pulled i know if you get attacked by a shark and i they're gonna be everywhere it's gonna go viral because you you've attacked the shark community to such an just watch now i'm gonna stick to swimming pools and a gator is gonna take my hand one day in the greatest irony of all time don't mess with the animal kingdom folks you'll be like tubs and happy Gilmore with lucky land slots you can
