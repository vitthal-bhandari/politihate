He's looking for voices in the country that are pro-Trump that want to Help with history and you'll hear that today also I think in regards to that a little we should touch a little bit on How to win friends and influence people away for you to actually not have a civil war At your Thanksgiving table. I think the answer is intimidation and threats the more you intimidate and threaten people the more they do What you want strangely not the case, but also yesterday we picked a name of Somebody who could come out and spend you know the Saturday with us at our Mercury one gala Her name was Jodi. She won I called her today to verify that she was coming. She told me some news And it actually turned out to be an amazing story. We'll end the podcast with that You're listening to the best of the plan that program It's Friday November 16 Relief factor a Company that has changed my life. Thank you relief factor If you have a hard time sleeping if you have a hard time moving you have a hard time playing with the kids You want your life back? My son asked me the other day.

Yeah, not good So anyway, so anyway if you want your life back to be able to just Move the way you used to try relief factor 100% drug free created by doctors four key ingredients that help fight the body's inflammation Which causes most of the pain try it for three weeks? It's so worth it 70% of the people who try it order it again month after month after month I do it works relief factor Dot-com go there now relief factor dot-com Okay There's something that the there's a new tactic being employed by the left and it came out this weekend Or this week and if it doesn't backfire May I use the president's word bigly Then I think we're in serious trouble and when I say we I don't mean the GOP. I don't mean conservatives I don't even mean we as a country. I think I think we as a species are screwed First it was a commercial ran by Planned Parenthood And it used a precious looking little baby in a lullaby and then these words She deserves to be loved She deserves to be wanted She deserves to be a choice Wait, wait, wait, what? Am I the only one that's not dead inside? How evil do you have to be? To see this beautiful child to hear a lullaby see this cooing little baby and and then try to think That this baby Could have been killed and it would have been a good thing. I mean, it's just really it's crazy You know if you were struggling This baby deserves to be loved unless it was inconvenient for mom and then mom should have killed it. Oh My gosh Now this was just the first crazy ad the second crazy ad I don't even know what it's about I Had to ask around what the hell is this? Celine Dion everybody's personal favorite Celine Dion has just launched a new clothing line You know, that's just what I've been waiting for I mean, I've been I've been hearing the clamoring all around the streets of America going Could we just get a clothing line from Celine Dion? Well, yes, yes She now she's launched her clothing line with a little mini movie style commercial But I have to warn you it's one of the creepiest things you'll hear Well, I was gonna say all year, but we're still three four weeks away We might hit something even more creepy by the end of the year. Listen to this our children As we are all just links in a never-ending chain that is life For us, they are everything But in reality, right we are only a fraction of their universes Mom and dad missed the past They yeah dream of tomorrow. Oh, that's great. We may thrust them forward into the future Yeah, but the course will always be their Of course now they're they're wrapped in pink and blue blankets, but she's about to Blow out of her hands some sort of magical Well, it kind of looks like ashes And it floats around the room of this nursery in a hospital and All the blue and pink goes away. It all goes away. Oh Isn't that great And then everybody's wearing black and white because our children aren't really ours Yes, they're the focus of our lives, but we're just an insignificant little nothing to them Uh Celine it doesn't make me want to buy your baby clothes in fact. It makes me want to do the opposite really does really does This is Marxist propaganda Now our children are not our children and this has been coming for a long time now Celine loves this because in she Canadian Canada's been on this this whole thing of oh, you know your children, you know They're your children until we tell you they're not your children Because really they belong to all of us, you know the great we oh My gosh, by the way, does anybody know what? 1984 they claim that George Orwell may have stolen this idea of 1984 in 1984 is a big government it controls everybody everybody has a number and and a name and and and big brothers watching you but it's actually and now that I've read the book I think you could make a pretty strong case that it was stolen from a Russian novel in 1922, you know the name of that in the Russian novel is we We have you read anthem by I N Rand? Where nobody can say I or me? Each individual is we because the individual doesn't exist You're not an individual you're part of the collective you're just a spoke on a giant wheel That's all you are and you know if we start to run down to too many spokes or you know not enough spokes You're not really even a spoke Because you have to be identical to everybody else and you're just part of the collective This again is Marxist propaganda And Celine Dion is shown in this little mini movie breaking into the hospital nursery Where she delivers the line? They have the right to choose. Oh really? Which turns the hospital into some Orwellian you know black and white room Removes all of the pink and blue and changes all the boy girls simp You know symbolism Into like hospital crosses that are just black Honestly, it looks like they're almost wearing prison clothes It's beautiful. No, I seriously I love my kids so much where where they just everything is black and white in their world You know gray. Oh if we could get them those naeru jackets if we could get them the old communist, you know Like Mao jacket for the kids wouldn't that be cute? The scariest thing about the past seven days or so is I haven't heard any real backlash from either of these Have you seen a backlash where a beautiful baby is is is used as a choice It deserves to be loved deserves to be wanted and deserves to be a choice Mom should be able to kill this beautiful baby. Are we dead inside? Or are we so Are we so Marxist now Has the has the cultural Marxist movement washed over us so much that we're now either just dead inside from all of it Because we just I don't know it's just Where are we starting to believe it? How long are we going to allow this crap how long before we all? Start standing up and saying no our children are our Children that that's my child my child My child is an individual my child is not a number for the state not part of the collective It's my child I Have the responsibility No government no Marxist no capitalist has any claim to them and gender You know I really feel I really do feel for Bruce Jenner I I will call Bruce Jenner Caitlin out of respect I Can't I feel for him I feel for the life that he led I Feel my heart breaks to think the guy that was on my Wheaties box At the whole time felt like he wasn't himself is he spent his whole life hiding That is horrible It's just horrible But he's still Bruce Jenner He's still a guy he might have changed his name and if he wants me to call him Caitlin, I'll call you Caitlin Because I don't want I don't want to be a part of any of your pain But if you have to put me on the stand and say is that a male or a female that's a male It's a male period. It's Bruce Jenner And I can understand but I am not going to change Reality Now if Bruce Jenner wants to become Caitlin Jenner and wants to have surgery and everything else He's an adult he can do that He can do that You have a right to do that, but it is child abuse child abuse to To suggest that a 10 year old should be giving hormones The 10 year old should be allowed to choose at that point. This is crazy talk Any attempt to trivialize and to diminish life Any attempt to trivialize or diminish the family Any attempt to trivialize or diminish the individual into the basic we Any attempt to trivialize or dismiss basic science should be met head on Now I don't know how many people can still stomach hearing my heart will go on one more friggin time But please for the sake of sanity See Celine I'll buy a ticket to your show. I'll I'll endure that if you will just Close your mouth Stop trying to preach Marxist propaganda And we'll listen to your damn. Oh my gosh the boat is sinking song The best of the blend back program So Yesterday this this guy this kid in junior high calls me up and he says Glad I'm having a really hard time Educating my friends because they don't really want to hear it and I can I can be I don't remember the word he used exactly But it was basically I I can I Get heated at times belligerent. Yeah a little belligerent was that the word that he is? I don't remember but yeah, it was it's that they were that was probably not that strong But it was in that neighborhood and so he asked for advice and the thing that came off right off the top of my head Was you need to read how to win friends and influence people now? I haven't read this probably since I was a teenager. This is my dad. My dad was I mean How to win friends and influence people is the greatest book ever written out change your life I'm Last night I reread it and it was like having a conversation with my dad and I realized Where so much of what I believe comes from I mean if you really want to know who I am or the the basis of of me a cornerstone of me It's this book and it's amazing. It is amazing. I had forgotten how good it was You're going to have dinner. Welcome to the program Pat Gray You're gonna have dinner with your relatives who are absolutely the on the wrong side of every argument Here's how you here's how you have a really Good Thanksgiving. I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you the highlights fundamental techniques in handling people number one don't criticize condemn or complain Human nature does not like to admit fault when people are criticized or humiliated they rarely respond well to give honest and sincere appreciation Appreciation is one of the most powerful tools in the world people will rarely work at their maximum potential under criticism three Arousing other in the other person an eager want Together we want from another person we must forget our own perspective and begin to see things from other people's perspectives Six ways to make people like you more be genuinely interested in other people To smile This is something my father did if he told me that story one more time my father was He looked he was he was horribly abused as a kid and he he had nothing to go on so he just looked for great ideas he um He was kind of a willy loman kind of guy where he just didn't have a lot of friends and he just worked all the time But he his friends I found out later in life were people like this norma vince appeal that were just his book friends And he would take these ideas and he would apply them and he told me he said son He said I want you to do this he said I did this when I was like 18 I walked down the streets of seattle and he said I I walked down one side of the sidewalk one side of the street and I frowned at everybody And I just kind of looked at them and just kind of dismissed them and he said everybody I met was a grump He said that I crossed the street after a few blocks and I decided to smile And everyone I met on the other side of the street greeted me with happiness He said so Either there's a problem. You're on the wrong side of the street or it's what you're putting out This is norma vince and peel again smile Remember that a person remember a person's name. Oh, that's a really hard one Be a good listener encourage people to talk about themselves talk in terms of other people's interest blah blah blah blah Okay, now listen to this If you apply these at Thanksgiving you're going to find a completely different atmosphere Listen to these 12 ways to win people to your thinking One the only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it Whenever we argue with someone no matter if we win or lose the argument We all still lose the other person will either feel humiliated or strengthened And will only seek to bolster their own position we must avoid arguments whenever we can to show respect for other people's opinions never say you're wrong Many times we said that many times have I said that We must never tell people flat out that they are wrong It will only serve to offend them and insult their pride. No one likes to be humiliated We must not be so blunt. That's the word that kid used blunt Three yep three if you're wrong Admit it quickly and emphatically whenever we're wrong. We should immediately admit it Uh for begin in a friendly way if we begin our actions interactions with others in a friendly way people will be more receptive Five start with questions to which the other person will always answer yes That is that's the theory of in my book about the unum what do where do we agree? Where do we agree find the things that we agree on start there? Let the other person do a great deal of talking Number seven let the other person feel the idea is his or hers Try to see things from the other person's point of view other people may often be wrong But we cannot condemn them. We must seek to understand them Success in dealing with people requires a sympathetic grasp on the other person's viewpoint Uh nine be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires people are hungering for sympathy They want us to recognize all that they desire and feel if we can sympathize with others They will appreciate our side as well and it will often come around to our way of thinking Now think of that When people say I don't want to know what they're thinking. I don't want it because it's wrong Well, no, you know, no, you're the looking at the solution Listen to what they're feeling What they're feeling is real Their solution may be bogus, but what they're feeling and think about you Where is a lot of this anger coming from this anger is coming from the place where we don't feel heard If the media would actually listen to us Actually listen to us our world would be a lot different if they reflected our point of view And if they would look at us and say well, that's not racist. Wait a minute. You have to understand what these people are feeling is a loss of the country that they grew up in A loss of the values that they grew up in and those were values that have been here for 5,000 years They're not racist or xenophobic They're having all of the basic principles shift under their feet Wouldn't you be more apt to listen to somebody who understood you You Dramatize your ideas Throw down a challenge the thing that most motivates people is the game Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth if we want someone to do something We must give them a challenge and they will oftentimes rise to meet it But be a leader Don't give offense or a rouse resentment begin with praise and honest appreciation Call attention to call attention to people's mistakes indirectly No one likes to make mistakes and no one likes to have others pointed out in front of other people Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the others ask a question instead of giving the direct order Let listen to this one. Let the person save faith face Nothing diminishes the dignity of man quite like an insult to his pride How many times have we said For those people who Let's take on our own side for those people who are been with don't trump the whole time What are you doing? What are you doing? When you have people that are come like for instance me or anybody else when you have people start to come into the tent Why would you say? Well, it's about time you were so stupid. Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Welcome them if you have somebody from the other side well you've been wrong your whole life You know, it's part of your problem that we have these problems. They're not Stop They're coming into the tent Embrace them hug them. Oh, man. We're glad you're here See this with the clinton thing right now is one that I struggle with because there you know Oh, I know where where was the media? Where was the left during all of these years where bill clinton was the same horrible person? He is today now finally after hillary's lost a couple times and the family is going you know see this but this is set out to pasture It's okay, but this is I think where we miss the boat because we immediately jump to the media and the politicians They're not honest. Yeah, no, that's not who i'm talking about Forgive the media for what they're doing. No, let's point out when they're right Let's point out when they're wrong And let's welcome them when they're right, you know if that ever happens Uh, but it's not we're not talking about them. I'm talking about the people at your table next week I'm talking about the neighbors. I'm talking about the people that you work with This is about one on one. This is not about changing the media This is or or washington. This is about changing the people around you Yeah, because we do Basically the opposite of everything you just described in the from the book right now We're doing the opposite of all of it. Everybody does both sides. Uh-huh one side's worse than the other. Yeah And i don't know i mean i think because i definitely handle issues on this show differently than i would handle them with Your friends i was trying to convince. Oh, okay Like if i was trying to commit because you know because we do this for a living Yeah, when you go out to dinner with anyone they basically ask you lots of political questions Because you know and that's what you do you talk about the other person's work And if the person i'm talking to Is not on the same side of the issue. That's me. I tell them how stupid they I tell them how dumb they are No, it's wrong with you. Why are you such a dumbass? I am not reaching for the check when it comes You try you do almost all the things you just listed and I would do I do those all the time Yes, you want to if you're trying to convince them or at least trying to make them open their mind to the possibility that maybe they're not right Yes, you use those things now when we're on the show. I don't do that now That's the problem. I don't know if it's a problem or not I'm conflicted with it because part of it is we're talking to an audience largely that Understands the basic foundations of what we're talking about right like Like this audience generally speaking is going to know that higher taxes are bad Right, so I don't need to I don't need to slow play that and and and no but try to convince them of that No, but here's where we don't do why was rush limbaugh so popular in the 90s Because he taught you how to win an argument Okay, and he had to talk he had to teach you He wasn't talking about how to finesse it He was just teaching you the basic principles that we now you say we all have that this audience understands basics You know the basic principles. Okay But what we didn't do that was back in the 90s and that worked because nobody had any of the facts We needed to have that baseline and we still need to teach people baseline stuff. Mm-hmm, but now You know around 2000 that was over people people were condemning rush limbaugh and if you said it came from rush limbaugh Well, you roll your eyes now. It's fox anything comes from fox. They roll your eyes You used to say you didn't want to put your own names on your books You didn't want to put your you didn't want to put glen back on the book because it was just right people wouldn't take it seriously if they were Correct correct. So what we need to do is start teaching people and you can't here's lesson number one read this book how to win friends and influence people read it Because it has all of the answers on how we can move forward and actually make a difference not just politically but also At the Thanksgiving table next week You're listening to the best of the glen back program Like listening to this podcast if you're not a subscriber become one now on iTunes But while you're there do us a favor and rate the show Relief factor. Yeah, this is types We've seen a huge change in glen over the years because of relief factor Which is good for me too. It'll help change the lives of people around the person in pain because the person in pain is less annoying I don't think that's the way. That's the slogan of relief factor. It's a real. Yeah I can you'll be able to tolerate the people who are in pain Okay, so empathetic of you. Thank you very much. You struggled with this, you know a long time Yeah And I was at the end of my rope about a year ago and my wife said just try it just try it Everybody at the work is trying it and I'm like, it's not gonna work Um it did I took it for three weeks I saw an enormous change and I haven't stopped taking it since And that's about what 70 percent of the people who try it for three weeks That's about 70 of them do exactly what I did. Oh my gosh. It works So take it relief factor try it for three weeks if it doesn't work You know, you're out 20 bucks in three weeks if it does work you get your life back relief factor.com that's relief factor Dot com mr. Bill O'Reilly It has been a pretty hectic week, but I don't know the last week that we went No, really nothing happened Uh, and I think we should start with your op-ed today. Uh the trump media war Okay back. I'm ready to go Good then go The trump media war is I would say depressing to americans who are thinking people um because it basically Signals that there's not going to be any unity in this country while president trump is holding the office Because neither side is going to back down All right, but then I uh, I took a letter out of my historical collection by harry truman Which makes the column really worth reading and I say this is nothing new Um and truman just excoriates the media and gives examples about how it was so unfair Abraham Lincoln and george washington and other presidents So I really isn't new. What is new is the machines the tweets Uh the hysteria and cable news all of that is new But you know, it seeps into the culture and it makes us a uh a more disagreeable Population back so let me let me go back because the you know the first paragraph of Your um your op ed which is honestly the only paragraph I read um preparation was uh Was uh about it was about jimma costa So so let let me let let me go here because you're you're absolutely right on This has always been this way. It's just Everywhere now and it's in our own personal life and we are participating in sharing it now So it's everywhere. Um, but let me specifically go to jimma costa because i'm really i'm i'm I'm sick of this uh debate here. I think and correct me. Tell me where i'm wrong here I think the president taking away jimma costa's Pass white house pass Is justified in this case Because jimma costa needs somebody should be cnn to say jim there are rules And you can ask a follow-up question. It used to always be sir. I have one question and I'd like a follow-up Yes, go ahead. Then the follow-up he would not stop asking questions the president answered He really tried to answer to the best of his ability and peacefully and nice nicely Jimma costa really didn't even ask a question He was just trying to condemn the pr- he was picking a fight with the president Um cnn should have said jim stop it. We don't behave that way and I don't care how the president behaves We're not going to behave that way So the the the question is Is this a freedom of speech issue or freedom of of the press issue? I don't think it is No, it's a quality control issue I'm dole rally.com. That's where the column that you were refused to read it In fact, you're wealthy enough to have people read it to you. Oh, I can't pay people enough I can't pay people to follow you and read it. Oh, they can't do it. They're like, please comes on dole rally.com and yesterday we brought in a guy a lawyer former prosecutor who Went down line by line over cnn's complaint and pointed out at least a dozen inaccuracies in the complaint To the federal judge they were flat out wrong and provable wrong you can see it up with your own eyes And I said well, we'll add influence the judge cnn's not telling the truth about jim Acosta and the Uh, what happened in the uh, white house briefing room? We'll add he said well It shouldn't influence the judge's ruling on the constitutional request But it'll tee off the judge because the judge will see that cnn is lying Which they clearly were in the complaint So that tells you that cnn has no interest Give me the give me the lies because I I miss that And that sounds like the first say below riley.com every night. I know it sounds like the first segment in three years that i've been interested in Jealous guy Okay, go ahead. Okay So basically cnn alleges in its complaint to the federal judge that acosta simply asked a question That's that's lie number one. Yes, what he did. All right. He harangued the president and insinuated that he was lying When he labeled the caravan an invasion correct. That's not a question It's an insinuation and a harang and everybody knows it Nobody's gonna say it isn't Even if people have cnn wouldn't say it isn't no, that's yet the management puts that in writing to a federal judge Come on. It's ridiculous. So Your question was shouldn't see it in try to reign in Uh, it's chief white house correspondent from disrupting A national press conference and the and the answer is Cnn wants the disruption. It's the only way they're going to get in the news their ratings are horrible Um, and and so and their business model is to destroy the trump presidency. So of course they're going to say jim You know go on and cnn's not dan from the white house. They have correspondence and covered a presidential press conference Just not a costa because he will not obey the rules of decorum Well, here's the here's a let me play devil's advocate and I don't I do not think this is what's going on But we have to protect. I don't want a You know, I wouldn't want You know fox news to have who was it major garret was really good at holding obama's feet to the fire Uh jake tapr when he was I think with abc he was really good at holding they were the only two that did And I don't want the pr- Hang on So um For I don't want the president to be able to say I don't like the fact that he asked me tough questions What I want is they have to be respectful and those guys were they were always respectful Of the president and the office. That's not what's happening with jim accosta if he were asking Questions tough questions He would have every right to do it and I would celebrate and I would stand behind his right to ask the toughest questions But that's not what he's doing But it's obvious. It's not what he's doing and the white house denying him The press pass was not based on editorial content. It was based on behavior He was misbehaving in their In their opinion in the white house opinions another judge has to make that termination as say was it the banishment of the cost of based on his Behavior or was in an editorial statement. I think it's clear clear. No that it was behavior Bill you will see if the if the judge who is a trump appointee Comes back today and gives cnn relief All cnn is asking for today is a restraining order against banning A cost that not the whole Decision, but what the judge will say is yes or no Um, you have to give him the pass back which what did he what did he ask for an extra day? I don't know. I I believe that This is obviously the judge's big moment in the spotlight and he wants to probably go over his decision Every word of it because he knows He's gonna get hammered either way. Yeah, whatever his decision is the judge is going to get hammered So he needs to once go over a little more time and just get the wording correct That's speculation, but that's what I would surmise bill separate from the actual court proceedings As you said something I think I totally agree with it, which is cnn wants the disruption This is the way they're making news. You know Jim Acosta doesn't care about the truth Jim Acosta wants to be a star He wants to make he wants to put himself and elevate himself to the level of a fight with the president of the united states My question is just strategically from the trump administration's standpoint Doesn't this elevate him and put him on this platform where it's a trump versus Acosta And it's giving Acosta everything he wants to be a martyr for the first amendment Well, trump sees it differently in the sense that trump wants to build a wall Not only to keep out migrants on the southern border But against criticism from the national press and part of the wall is convincing Americans that the press will never report accurately on him And look at this guy look at him So trump the trump administration believes that Acosta's aggression Helps them by diminishing the press in general And and you know, I'll tell you what if you look at the surveys about americans and how they feel about the american media They're down there in the thirties now. They don't trust them. They don't like them So this it could be something to that. Well, that's why trump is doing it. Why did fox take the stand with cnn? Well, that's an excellent question Beck Course it is a game for me. I know a guy who doesn't read the research material before he interviews You know, I read every word of that damn thing. I had to take no dos to get I know that This is a evaluation on the glenbeck radio program based upon my knowledge of what is happening at fnc Okay regime change That happened when roger als left the company Now the new people are not Um of the same mindset of mr Als, all right, that's number one. So there has been a change a shift And the shift has basically been We have to become more mainstream not more liberal. All right, but more mainstream. We have a powerful brand Um, we have a loyal audience And now we have to get Closer to the other national media. That's what we want to do. That is the strategy that won't work Okay, well, maybe not well. I mean what is mainstream? What is it? Why they did what they did? Right, but what what does mainstream mean? Uh, we want to be closer to the mainstream in the club Now never be in the club Well We celebrated when you and i were there we celebrated the fact that we were not in the club We enjoyed the maverick status. Yes, which propelled fox news to the top of the news ratings Right that attitude like we don't care about the corrupt media because we know they're not telling the truth And we're happy. We're not in that club that has changed The day that the day that fox news Fires their entire prime time lineup and to replace it with shep smith is the day they would consider Consider allowing fox news into the club for about two days Well, that's true. I mean the fox news is so demonized by the far left that no matter what it does but Fox news does not want to be criticized by the washington post and the new york times and cnn so They said, okay. Well, we'll throw in with the freedom of free Peace of freedom of press movement and we'll file in a micus brief and maybe that'll Send a signal that we want to be friends. We want to be friends with you guys Okay, so bill riley when we come back i want to talk to a little bit about the border and what is happening Uh and something i i actually heard today driving in on Mmm. I remember what it was it some liberal podcast That i was listening to driving in and they said You'll notice that the the left is or the right is not even talking about the border They don't even care about the border. They've dropped that no no we're talking about it. We're very concerned about it. In fact i'm wondering What the president is going to be doing about this now so we go to the the caravan And mexico and how mexico has provided police escorts to our border When bill o'riley comes back bill some news just broke That the judge has sided with cnn on yeah, i see it yeah Your thoughts, well, you're so lucky to have me here. I know i am i'm it'll be interesting to see if the white house appeals Um because basically the judge is saying this is timothy j kelly Um, you can be rude you can be disruptive and he says it All right, you can do whatever you want and not lose your credentials that doesn't make any sense Okay Does it make any sense? Yeah, well, certainly He will be overturned i think By the supreme court and then you know if they appeal it to the liberal appeals court in dc they'll lose but um If they want to bring it to the supreme court they win Uh, no doubt in my mind they win but the other way to handle it is all right Uh, uh, casa, you know, he's your press fast back and never mention him again never recognize him never call on him Just freeze him So when you do that and then if he disrupts the press conference if he like says i want my question You haven't called on me or whatever then you can say thank you ladies gentlemen We'll see you soon and walk up the stage. He won't do you know you could do that you could you could do the passive aggressive thing Uh and just ice them or you could try for the big You know kahuna and have the supreme court say no Uh, the government does have a right on its own property To regulate disrupt the behavior, you know There's nobody in their right mind. You cannot run a society There is no civilization without being civil that's right without rules right So I mean there this doesn't make any sense at all you cannot just act any way you want The trump administration the first thing i have to do is make some rules And distribute the rules that don't have those now Okay, but again if they did then they they sue on that Oh, you mean you're limiting our access to the president limiting what we do it. We can't do bad ruling Um, what are you gonna do? This is our democracy. This is the way we do it. Okay, so the trump administration has a couple of avenues to go If they want them let me let me go back to the border you say that the The new incoming president of mexico says he's going to legalize all drugs Um doesn't this take the al Capone No It's all it does is cut the overhead for the cartel So they don't have to bribe as many mexicans and hire as many gunmen has shoot at the police in the ormy Wait, but you don't have to shoot at the police of its legal. I know that so it cuts the overhead So they don't have to spend that All right, and all he goes without thanks Where do they make their money back? Not quite a lot. I'm in our mexico city They make their money in chicago, New York l.a. All american cities So it just makes it easier for them To bundle up their product and send it al nortay So this is the best thing that could possibly happen to the cartels. So what does that mean for? America and our policy Twice as many hard drugs here. No, I mean our policies our policies where for instance I am I'm I'm done with mexico when they when they escorted those buses They escorted the buses with fedderalis To our border that's not what a partner does not to protect the migrants.
