    "text": " Thank you for listening to this podcast one production available on Apple podcast and podcast one Your life your country your listening to the Laura Ingram podcast Well, I think the left has to be careful which hero they Adopt in the moment because they tend to be blowing up on them. We'll get into that here on the Laura Ingram podcast also a really interesting Perspective that I think is is lost sometimes in the other controversies over transgender athletes And who should play what what team and whether they should be allowed as a man or woman? How important sports are for the young developing mind especially in this era of Technology and constant communication the importance of sports and I know that seems like well, it's a generic topic And I've been thinking a lot about this and I'm gonna share my thoughts about why I Think I had this at a young age a drive to win and how so much of it was motivated by great coaches and I Mean some probably raw talent too, but great coaches and how getting your kids into athletics of some type Could actually be the answer to a lot of other things that doctors want to medicate them for Really interesting stuff. So I can't wait to talk to all of you about that and we'll hear about that We have more concerns about What's happened of course with the border crisis Heather Higgins is gonna stop by because she made a lot of waves now recently with her piece about the coming pandemics brought on by open borders and is this also an issue that women especially who concern Themselves so much with their children's health and health and schools and so forth that women need to think about more forget take Trump out of the equation just locality speaking so we'll talk to her about that and the The fact that the media have glommed on to this e gene Carol woman I Mean I knew it was going to be bad last week when I heard you had written a book and she was gonna use this tidbit this allegation about Donald Trump from How many years ago 30 40 a long time ago? That this was of course the meat it's catnip for the media anything that will put Trump in a terrible light We definitely have to grab that they did the same thing with Kavanaugh anything that could put him in a bad light that Elevate it give it full weight until then of all of a sudden the allegations are coming from people like Michael Avenatti then you have to just pretend you never said those things so now this woman is doing the rounds and She made it a dishorrible allegation about Donald Trump in a dressing room at burgdorff Goodman in New York City many years ago and She's been on with Don Lemon. I think or or and no no she was on last week with Lawrence O'Donnell. I think for most of the hour, which is ludicrous and He's desperate for ratings because he never beats us. Sorry, but he Rarely if ever Can it clips the ratings of Fox? Okay, so he thought that would deliver him ratings So he has her on and in last night Anderson Cooper thought maybe he could get a little ratings magic with this Woman making these decades old allegations against President Trump. Let's listen You don't feel like a victim. I was not throwing on the ground and ravish which the word rape carries so many sexual Connotation this was not this was not sexual It just it hurt it just what it just you know I think most people think of rape as a I mean it is a violent Assault it is not I think most people think of rape as being sexy Let's take a short break of the fantasies We've got to take a quick break if you Instagram will talk more on the other side now so they cut to an ad After that Comment now of course my mind goes to Imagine if I or any conservative host had had a guest on making an accusation against any Democrat let's say Make a Cory Booker Bernie. I mean whatever and that guest said That that what you just heard that some people consider rape to be sexy and there wasn't vociferous pushback from the host immediate how can you say that like what are you talking about like the coverage would be something akin to conservative hosts entertain's idea that Rape is sexy conservative hosts indulges guests Blaming the victims or Calling rape sexy and that's the way it would be couch right indulges the guests now he did sort of in a very kind of meek way say well is it Well, yeah They were on me for some graphic that popped up on the screen that I didn't even know who was in the graphic because Guess what television hosts don't design their own graphics. I do a lot, but I don't do my own graphics So they take a graphic that was compiled From an AP story about people who are silenced on Facebook and it was Like what who I don't even know was in the graphic But you actually have someone on your show who says the comment about people think well Right is considered sexy You'd be off the I mean I think they'd try to get you off the other try to get you boycotted But it's okay when you're Anderson Cooper Or anyone on CNN or MSNBC because the ultimate goal is to destroy Trump So your goal is noble so anything you say along the way anything that's false anything that's wrong anything that that is offensive anything that is defamatory libelous Is okay? It's excuse because the ultimate goal the shared goal is to destroy Donald Trump Long winded way of saying the ends justify the means That was a shocker and By the way This is what this woman said on Lawrence O'Donnell show just a few days ago, which should have indicated to everyone warning warning warning maybe This is not a good idea to put her on TV Would you consider Bringing a rape charge against don't from for this why not? I Would find it disrespectful To the women who are down on the border who are being raped around the clock down there without any Protection they're young women. They've you know tried to come into the head there there as you know They're there by the thousand the women have very little protection there. It would just be disrespectful. Okay that answer is an indication of some type of mental Situation going on. I don't know what it is. I'm not a doctor can't diagnose it, but but you invite her back Or if I turn on and oh that that interview was such a bang-up interview. I'm gonna invite her on my show People to get it's just ludicrous by the way. I'm gonna thank all of our sponsors Genuine Delta animal rescue and sheaks they help provide this podcast free for you every week But we have a lot of other issues We're gonna tackle today on the podcast and can't wait to hear your views remember always email me at engram.podcast at gmail.com We got enormous concerns about the health implications of Thousands of people who have been in adequately screened entering our country screened for communicable diseases obviously no way to real check immunization records and many of them ultimately ending up in public situations public Schools public accommodations restaurants and so forth. So a lot of people are concerned about that. We'll talk to Heather Higgins in just a moment It's important to point out the sheer hypocrisy and emotional manipulation attempted by Democrat leaders on The crisis at the border that they denied was actually happening. Let's listen So when I spoke to the president said look I'm a mom I have five kids seven nine grandchildren and and Your children are scared We're scaring the children of America not just in those families, but their neighbors and our communities We're scaring the children Scaring the children Well the sad thing about Nancy Pelosi is that She is so obvious in her selective moral Indignation that it's easy for us to expose it in 2015 when judge Dolly G Who is a leftist Obama appointee to the central district of California federal district court judge She ruled that the Obama border patrol facilities even the temporary facilities Contained deplorable conditions That were filthy that were not according to the previous court order that were not You know could not be described as anything but substandard and words such as inhumane Intolerable We're used to describe the Obama Border Patrol Processing centers, which of course are not Designed to hold hundreds and hundreds of people Because we never had this problem up until like the last six or seven years Nancy Pelosi did make a big deal of it back then because Obama was president Jay Johnson the DHS secretary back then was trying to Scramble because of these ridiculous court orders that you can only hold people for a certain amount of time to adjudicate their claims Johnson wanted to lengthen the time you could hold families Because he thought that would be a quick easier way to adjudicate claims You could adjudicate them right there and then if necessary people can be deported out of the country But the court wouldn't allow them to do that so if they were scrimmed what are we gonna do? We're not a we don't have family detention centers. There's no reason Unless you have a porous border unless people were gaming the system that we would ever need them. Why would we need family detention centers? So Jay Johnson was trying to get the court to be more flexible So the US government could process people out of the country What did the judge say? Not letting you the maximum you can hold people are 20 days. So family units and children so now Family units this was under the Obama years 2015 ruling family units All say the same as kids can only be held maximum 20 days So just so you know what's going on not a peep from the Democrats about this deplorable conditions a federal court ruling multiple times against the Obama administration okay, so another point I have to make The kids Nancy cares about the kids nobody wants to see a kid whose parents made an irresponsible decision Uh suffer no child wants to we want no child to suffer no child to die No child to to to be in any way struggling for basic necessities, right? Then why didn't Congress fix this why didn't Congress spend a weekend sitting together saying you know we're not gonna get everything We want gotta fix this gotta stop this asylum bleed into the country It's that we can't handle it We don't have detention facilities and we can't just release people who we don't know Whose health records we don't have into the population. Otherwise we have no rule of law They decided not to do this because they in some way shape or form Like the fact that we have this crisis because then they can say see Donald Trump's really mean That's what's happened and by the way How many of you remember this case and there are many many like it February 14th of this year? Guatemala National living in the US illegally please guilty to raping a Lancaster County girl Magdio Diaz Vazquez 22 pled guilty to the rape of a child Deviate sexual intercourse statutory sexual assault unlawful conduct with a minor corruption of minors He's now in prison six to twelve years This is a big case in Pennsylvania, okay? He was living in the country illegally when the abuse occurred He'd been deported back to Guatemala several years prior Made his way back into the United States That I mean if the Democrats even once Raise the issue of an American kid or a lot of this in this case. I believe it was a a little Hispanic girl Who whose life is probably? Altered in such a horrific way none of us can ever imagine We have Hispanic kids being abused We have American kids being abused we have a DWI over the weekend in New Hampshire where seven US Marine vets were killed seven by a head-on collision by a Ukrainian national living in the United States who had already been convicted of multiple vehicular offenses and Other offenses who already should have been deported out of the country seven Americans are dead The biggest most tragic accident in New Hampshire history motorcycle history ever in history the state of New Hampshire I think it's one of the biggest in the country This man should never have been in the United States He had a quote green card, but it already committed so many offenses He became under US immigration law an immediately deportable alien, but he wasn't deported. Okay, so where's Nancy on that? We also had another case in I mean there's so many cases just depressing so I don't want to keep it keep reading them but you know we've had so many of these that They almost become We we become numb to them twice deported a legal alien charged with child rape in Alabama in March David Ramirez Gonzalez 29 was found hiding in his closet Following a 911 phone call reporting a 12 year old female had been sexually assaulted. He was charged with first degree rape He had been previously deported from the United States in 2008 in 2009 It's unclear when he re-entered the country a third time But police report state that he had been known to you several aliases. So guess what someone like this guy comes now He's released unless he's now put back to Mexico, which is what Trump's new policy would be I Want to remind everybody by the way, how much you know for me my Dogs are such an important part of my family so many of you feel the same way about your pets and they deserve a life of love and and Just caring fun. They give so much to us and we need to protect them That's why I love the Delta animal rescue sanctuary. They have a no-kill care for life sanctuary It's it's the best of its kind in the world It's a super sanctuary actually and it's home to 1500 animals and they've all been abandoned in the wild or left for dead Or just they have nowhere to go and are injured and need help Well, guess what? 100% of your donations go directly to the animals of the Delta rescue super sanctuary So for more information on Delta rescue tax saving estate planning options just visit Delta rescue dot org slash Laura That's Delta rescue dot org slash Laura to learn more about the great benefits of your estate contribution Donate today at Delta rescue dot org slash Laura. Who do you hold responsible for these children living in squalor? It's the president make no mistake. We've had four different secretaries over at Department of Homeland Security And of course that's inexcusable, but ultimately it's the president's responsibility This is one of the most embarrassing chapters in our modern history and it's happening under the watch for president believes that if you get tough enough yourself the problem he's wrong Dick Durban as usual is a complete and utter fraud and on this issue All I need to do is Huh, let's go back to July of 2015 dick because the New York Times has a really big piece that day Judge orders release of immigrant children detained by us a federal judge in California Rule that the Obama administration's detention of children and their mothers who are crossing the border illegally is a serious violation of a long-standing court settlement. That's the florist settlement Judge G also found that migrant children had been held in widespread deplorable conditions at border patrol stations after they were first caught And said the authorities had quote wholly failed to provide quote safe and sanitary conditions for children even in temporary cells Judge G had rejected the Obama administration's appeal to I Think make her a her earlier ruling less onerous Because her decision was based on this 18 year old settlement and this decision known as florist so the detention centers in Texas that were run and set up under the Obama administration ready They were called by the federal district court judge and Obama appointee a quote material breach of provisions requiring that minors be placed in facilities that are not secured like prisons and that are licensed to take care of children and remember they were They were initially saying at the DHS under Obama that they were detaining the families to quote send a message to others in Central America To deter them from coming to the US illegally But remember they were Donald Trump's trying to punish people by using detention as a deterrence What do they think detention partly is? It's it's both it's both punitive and It's deterrent across the world in in developed countries at least But they're like well Donald Trump is trying to deter people so there's just no honesty and reporting on this stuff There's certainly no honesty coming from the Democrats This is a problem because we don't have facilities to hold a hundred and forty thousand people in One month. We don't even have facilities to hold ten thousand people in one month So in a lake you don't want to fix the system You're not gonna have the perfect conditions at border patrol stations where kids are supposed to be staying for 72 hours You're listening to the lower-engrim podcast delighted you're with us always remember to be part of the Fun and we want to hear from you always email me at ingrum.com Podcast at gmail.com send us your name and number and we'll get you on the air Heather Higgins joins us now She's the president and CEO of the independent women's voice wrote a terrific piece last week for Fox News calm About concerns about a possible coming pandemic caused by these the Swiss cheese approach to screening or Any type of checks at the border with the crush of humanity. We're seeing coming in We got a great reaction to her appearance on Fox. She has a special message for women who are caring about These health related issues and their children. She joins us now. Heather good to have you with us Thank you so much for having me. Heather. What do we need to know? Let's first let's first talk about this just blatant hypocrisy coming from the Democrats Suddenly claiming to care about the way kids are held in in Processing centers for 72 or you know a hundred hours. I did a video for PragerU that came out about two weeks ago Talking about the double standard for conservative women versus liberal women But but it's all about media techniques and it applies as much to this issue as to that so there's a standard pattern among the left of if somebody on their side says something that's a problem They either bury it Or they front run it But they certainly don't get upset about it or use it the same way they would if a republican did exactly the same thing so went yeah, so when the judge in the in the jay johnson case in 2015 slammed the conditions where children are being held 2600 people in brooks county, pennsylvania and these two detention facilities in texas They just they right now they're just pretending it didn't happen correct They're they completely pretending it didn't happen But remember that the left is really good at working hand in glove with with the extreme left so You have frequently had things like sweetheart court decisions and stuff that went to you know, they they were pretending that they were upset about it But it was actually working in their interest Um, so you had obama talking like he actually didn't want to have illegal immigrants coming in But they again get democrat judges to make the rulings that oh gosh We have to just sort of release them Um and get rid of a lot of the deterrence. It's not dissimilar from the american pediatric association in i believe it was 1995 issued their first rule or Recommendation that there be vaccinations in 1996 you have congress passing a bill that mandates that there be uh vaccination requirements for legal immigrants But nothing is said about illegal immigrants and and why there's this hole that they shouldn't have to abide or temporary visa holders, right? Um, you would think that vaccinations if they're good for legal immigrants would be good for everybody coming into the country But but there's this grille glaring hole Well, I think Heather. Yeah, I think Heather that part of the problem here is that And it's just sort of a separate conversation, but it's related Well, yeah, we we would be nice if we had beds for 140,000 people But we're never gonna have beds for 140,000 people coming in one month. Okay. We're not we just don't have the option so But rather than scrambling to fund beds and fund facilities and build family detention centers We should be enforcing our border so people don't cross the border illegally and and when they come they're immediately adjudicated The adjudications happen within the first 36 hours and if they if their claims are not valid Uh are returned or they have to wait for their claims to be adjudicated in mexico and they can't come back That's I mean, we just cannot we cannot process this on a Facilities basis on a health basis Uh on a screening basis for chronic criminals because now we have a lot of criminals coming across as well We just don't have the we don't have the bandwidth and all the money. We don't have the Facilities to do this. So we got to stop people before they Cross in Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening Yes, if you are a rational actor looking for the best public policy But if you're a cynical democrat political operative you view all these people coming in as potential democrat voters Uh potential buttressing to the census question if they don't have to ask about citizenship Uh and fantastic visuals if you think about it in 2018 one of the big memes of the left is how cruel the gop is Whether it's on health care or immigration and because they know that people who may not like Trump's style or manner will still vote for him because they care about the economy and various national security other issues but if you for most people if you actively think that somebody is evil or cruel you won't like yourself for voting for them So the left is doing everything they can to paint The republicans is actually cruel. So having 140,000 people come across is terrible for those 140,000 People but it's good for the politics of the democratic party You know, well, it's terrible for the us taxpayers Yes, it is people who send their kids to public schools in northern, Virginia Uh, i'm now hearing from teachers in northern, Virginia friends of mine and uh in formerly rural maryland said you can't believe this I mean we're we're we're having to be mother father translator Uh, it's it's busting us that we're busting at seams here We and in some schools are no they're almost no english speakers at all None, um, this is so true And I think for a lot of the not the political operative left but the general the genuine left people who are there because they lead with compassion Um, and they think that they're that this is caring more for people who are fleeing terrible conditions um This is one more reminder that there's a reason that anybody who thinks about Philosophy and and political philosophy Understands that if you don't have rules in place that are fair and for everyone and start with that Rather than starting with compassion Compassion makes sense in a context where you've got rules that keep it fair for everybody But if you start with compassion you wind up making hell on earth for everyone and they're hurting the immigrants They're hurting the citizens of virginia. They're hurting the teachers They're overwhelming the health care facilities and everyone else who needs to take care of it and our concern is Ultimately, this is just a matter of time and a game of numbers with the world health organization proclaiming that there is now a pandemic Being the new normal is the is their view And a lot of that is because of porous borders and you see these outbreaks happening around the world and people are coming here As you've documented on your show showing up with wads of cash somebody is facilitating and paying for people to travel here Faster very often faster than a disease will incubate So even if we're looking for people who are presenting diseases They won't necessarily yet be presenting a disease if they have it They won't even know that they're sick and they can get other people sick But I guess we're we're led to believe that this is just the price we have to pay I mean, this is the price americans have to pay like you just don't have any say in this I mean you're no one wants this as far as I know me some activists might think open borders But the regular people they don't want this they like well immigration and they're fine with legal immigration But they don't want this but doesn't people feel like their views don't even matter they have this guy donald trumpin and He's you know, the crisis seems to be worse than ever the democrats don't want to do anything and And we're just supposed to turn around and say okay. Well, I guess the rule of law only applies to certain people Uh sadly that is true and a lot of people felt that way and and If anything trump needs more support in congress Um because we are set up as a divided Potentially government and you need to be able to get The legislature to cooperate with the executive to get a lot of this stuff done The good news is fortunately he can do some things through executive order, but as we've seen that's limited so, um People calling their congressman calling their senator Talking to their friends mobilizing people explaining what the risks are that's all really important We're talking to heather higgins of the independent women's voice And uh, tat bernie sanders was at this telemundo event last weekend heather And made this comment about what we could do with well other giveaways We will organize the american people Around the concept That all people in this country have the right to health care and at the end of the day We are going to win that struggle Senator would you include the 11 million other comment? Absolutely, absolutely when I talk about health care being a human right Last time I heard that undocumented people are human beings as well So, uh illegal immigrants also get medicare for all It's it's a little bit fascinating that the democrats are effectively advocating for open borders anybody who comes We should not be stopping them. We should be welcoming them And we are saying that we should provide health care and we pay for it for anybody who comes here Um, that only makes sense if you have absolutely no sense of the scale of the population of the world or how relatively more um advanced in terms of economics and health care and everything else we are we are going to be overwhelmed and inundated um by this approach to turning something into a right that This is something that we've lost in our language when jefferson appealed to rights. You know this I'm assuming a lot of your listeners know this but it's good reminders for millennials who I guarantee you have not been taught this Jefferson was able to appeal to rights because they were the lowest common denominator They were the universal appeal They were the things that applied to everybody at all times They came from outside of ourselves. You couldn't manufacture them In that meant you also couldn't take them away and they didn't require anything of anyone else They were the things that let you have your own life your own liberty the fruits of your own labors Um your ability to speak it didn't occur any obligations on anyone else The left has taken this word as they do so many others Which has brought appeal and then they've applied a different definition to it Um, I would agree with them. I want everybody to have health care But I don't pretend that it's a right as though nobody has to pay for it It just magically comes from somewhere It actually comes from doctors and nurses and people who make drugs and Communities putting their resources together to pay for it And so that's why we need a vibrant robust healthy system of care where we can afford to take care of everybody Not one where it's just to give away and you wind up with a lousy standard of care as you're starting to see Elsewhere in the world. It's a great idea while people are healthy. It's really a dreadful idea if you're actually sick Heather People are messaging me and emailing me knowing we were talking and saying where does this end where does this I mean we it can get depressing for people and people like to do feel good podcasts and Where it's just you know all love and spirit and kumbaya and that's fun But people want to know how we can get through this period of time where not people don't agree on everything We've always been a divided country really but on sort of foundational ideas of america's boundaries in borders and Just basic court orders being ignored That's something different. I think It's it's something very different Um, it is but it's not actually that different from life um sometimes I get the feeling that there's this sort of Libertine view um that it's you It's almost like telling a child that they are Able to do whatever they want, but the reality is is that we give children the ability to have more and more Agency when they exercise more and more Responsibility if you don't have rules and borders Then it's not possible to actually be free and to exercise your freedoms. Um, and so This is about trying to find that balance and the petition that we've put up which is on the importance as a public health matter of closing this the loophole that's in the cdc that says that legal immigrants are treated differently Uh, then people who come in as visitors temporary visa holders or who come in as illegal immigrants Whether they're seeking asylum or not Um, which is really actually if you think about it counterproductive and cynicism and it's a little bit cynical When you think about all the times that they're spending advocating for the rest of us to get vaccines But they're letting in all these people and without vaccines not vaccinated. Yeah, right Right and to and because it's important to have a secure border so that whoever does come in We can make sure that they're healthy and we don't put our populations at risk and our populations who are at risk infants who are 12 months and younger cannot get a vaccine So they are the most at risk for a lot of these things like measles most people don't realize this Measles lingers for at least a couple of hours and and sometimes even longer than that So the person who sneezed or whatever may not even realize that they're sick is long gone and somebody comes through the same You know store in the shopping mall and the baby is exposed to the virus and measles can cause brain damage It can cause death There were 110,000 deaths worldwide just in 2017 and most of those were kids who were five and under Um, the unvaccinated are at risk the anti-vaxxers are actually at risk Um, and but we're making logical arguments Heather your point was well taken earlier They're telling a story We we like to make these logical arguments based on natural rights and and the founders and the federalist paper But they're meanwhile using social media and The emotive power of images to drive narratives even false and from orwell on down I mean, we know how easy it is to manipulate people's points of view and understanding of the world just through one photo That's why photo journalists in vietnam like that one photo the little girl screen I mean people remember the one photo and and yet conservatives are always doing charts and graphs and that that just that doesn't work Numbers don't work. It stories and storytelling works Yes, I couldn't agree with you more and sadly I I hope though that reason can prevail and we don't have to get to horror stories of mislepidemics or ebola because I was hearing yesterday that there's some indication that People are arriving from Congo a lot faster than they were before the ebola vaccine takes up to 21 days to Justate before you even know that it's there Um, so you could have people arriving here Before they even know that they have ebola and there is no cure for ebola Um, there is fortunately now a vaccine, but we no longer require it Um, but if you get it the vaccine is only 70 percent sometimes 100 When I brought this up Heather they were saying oh No, don't worry about ebola because it's an incubation period of 21 days 21 days you Then begin to show signs I guess and these people have been on a longer journey than that I'm like, how do we know how long they've been on a journey? It's the most ridiculous Reassurance I've ever heard non-mariachments. They're not they're not paddling across the Atlantic. They're flying So the question is how fast can you get from Rio to the southern border? And there's some indication now that it's for many. It's a lot faster than we thought Yeah so so this is a big concern and It's not Unreasonable and I would really rather not wait until there are actual epidemics here For us to have to do something As much of a wonderful narrative as that might be I think being prophylactic and Preventing harm has a lot to be said for it and women are usually the ones leading the way on The caution front and especially on issues like this Now about it, but I don't think most women actually know how serious even measles is or Or mumps. I mean Kids are now there was a story this past week that there are kids in florida at a college who are Vaccinated against mumps, but there is now a new strain of mumps that's come in and they're all getting mumps You know, these diseases don't just magically appear They come from somewhere and we kind of seem to be overlooking that little Yeah, and all the hassitic jus the hassitic We're out of time, but they have acidic jus. They get blamed for everything Like they know the hassitic jus but okay They really they're they're they're responsible for every single new disease. I'm absurd heather higgins We've we've posted your online petition, which I think is great on our facebook page and people need to go and Sign up and find out more about the independent women's voice Heather hiccans does such a great job And she has for years the president and ceo there and a terrific writer and friend and all those great things Incredible family great team incredible family.

Wow uh, i've talked about this issue over the years and I think even wrote about it in one of my books, um of the izang which is this parental obsession With sports specialization as the golden ticket into into colleges, you know a lot of this is the parents The parents are kind of living their own Vicarious fantasy or they think everybody else is doing it. So i've got to do it and I just I never got into this. I mean I I dabbled a little bit in with my kids and some of these You know sports and a little little thing here or there, but I found the kids weren't happy Now I got I tried I tried uh, well daughter plays lacrosse and she's pretty good lacrosse player But I don't even think she wants to play it year round. She likes doing volleyball in the winter She likes playing basketball And and I said maria. That's what I did. I played field hockey basketball and softball Yes, I was class athlete of 430 kids in my class. Okay. So yeah, I was a serious. I only say that because I was a serious serious athlete, but I played three sports And we didn't have any money and my mother didn't sign up any special lessons And But I loved it and it really helped me in my life helped me in everything I've done to this day Kevin allen's daughter Natalie has been playing tennis since she was six Older she gets more you like to stay specialized and try to see how far you can go So that's our philosophy is getting better in the sport as opposed to the jack and multrades But experts caution doing the same motions over and over can cause wear and tear on the tissues and joints Across the nation or the p edict surgeons are seeing more career ending injuries doing pretty major surgeries and younger and younger athletes um such as owner collateral ligament tears or tommy john surgeries and acl tears Joining us now to talk about this and so much more and maria anderson Uh and holly mck pique uh both are the co-hosts of sports like a boss podcast on podcast one Uh both of course, uh phenomenal athletes in their own right Um over the course of her career and maria covered six olympic games nba playoffs super bowl golf majors Uh done so many incredible shots and and features for espn Uh nba today in sport center. Um holly is a three-time beach volleyball limpian for the united states How cool is that? Of course, uh, 2004 games and aathans they got the bronze medal there Uh and she was the first woman worldwide to surpass a million dollars in career earnings Uh in 2002 and she retired in 2009 Uh, this is amazing both of them incredible incredibly inspiring people and I cannot wait to talk about something. That's not political Ann maria and holly. How you doing girl? We're not gonna agree. You're right up our alley boy To board Now it's a little hard to have two guests on a podcast as I don't have to tell you guys this So i'm going to address each of you separately so we can um we can hear what both of you're saying because you're both have such great Uh, just I love your podcast number one and I just love love your voice on this holly let's start with you because To get to the level where you you were as a as a volleyball player Like moms would say or dads who are very competitive would say Well, you have to be that focused you have to do it year round you have to have to have to Oh, how would you answer that with this concern about the the specialization obsession? Well, actually I didn't specialize at an early age. I played soccer I played beach volleyball and I played indoor volleyball and you think volleyball same sports But beach and indoor are very different moving in the sand giving your body a break So I played three sports all the way through Um to my junior year in high school and I think it really gave my body a break I looked forward to another season And now we're hearing from college coaches when we talk to them that they really treasure multi sport athletes Athletes who are specializing too early are coming in to college with injuries They're injured before they even step on the court and it's it's really scary too much Too, I mean, they never get a break. We used to have the whole summer off and I couldn't wait for summer Did you anything anything different than what I do all year long? Which are those sports as much as I love them. It's nice for your body and your brain to have a break Yeah, and I got to say ann mary when I talked to my kids a lot about this I have a 14 year old daughter Who's going into eighth grade and then I have an 11 year old boy and a nine year old boy and they're all you know like all kids are all different and I talked to them a lot about this but the When the when the fall when that first, you know, crisp feeling of fall comes I still remember the feeling of of hitting the field hockey ball I still remember that feeling of the smell of the of the bag This the the the feeling in spring of the of the first uh crack of the bat Uh in softball. I mean every sport Brought me something different basketball was my least favorite But I still that was fun too because it was freezing in connecticut and it was fun to play basketball, but Just that differentiation as cliche as that sounds brings you a whole different set of experiences and I think activates your brain and your body in such positive and powerful ways versus the constant repetitive stress of the same thing over and over and over Or am I am I just exaggerating it and I'm trying to make this be like all the good old days were better than today's days like all old fogies do No, I I get it. I mean I I have the same setup at you a 14 year old and 11 year old and a Seven year old part of the problem though. Laura isn't just the parents With wanting this it's the coaches demanding Year-round now or trying to but I'm with you If you miss it Then you tend to love it and so if you take a few months off go do something Something else use some different muscles then you can pick you said basketball wasn't your favorite You wouldn't have known that if you hadn't played the other sport And I think it's important to dip your toe in each sport some of it is apparent yet But some of it is the coaches saying we want we want they get money from when you're at the tournament They they get money from the extra coaching and so as parents I think we need to pull back on that and say no You may not have my child all year round. I think it falls on the parents to say You may not and as you point out sometimes the parents are taken because this is the ticket This is the ticket to college and it isn't Holly this is really this is actually You know, it's it's kind of obvious I guess but we we forget that this has become this has become a huge business So the the lacrosse camps Just focusing on the explosion of youth lacrosse That is big big money and I think to amore and marie's point There are a lot of coaches and you know entrepreneurs Who are giving parents a false sense of? What his or her child's talents are you know i'm saying like if you're gonna devote this much time Like year-round and spend thousands of dollars sometimes you don't have it But you're you're spending it because you think you have to But your kids, you know, some kids are gonna be great athletes because they have the genetic Material and they have the drive and they have that thing but some kids just aren't The period but they're they're sold a bill of goods because it's huge huge money Well, it's interesting because I own a beach volleyball club and people come to us with the hope of us Preparing them or training them to get to the level where they're able to compete in college And we don't guarantee it we say hey, we're the best coaches. We can prepare you in the best way But there's no guarantees we can expose you to all these different coaches It's the dream of the athletes and the coaches Excuse me and the parents Luring this for you know, it's hard to get into college So anything extra on your resume that can help get you in that door even if you're a walk-on athlete I mean we saw the big college admission scandal I mean they were using sports in the wrong way because they didn't even compete in that sport But there's athletes who can walk on and compete and really Contribute to college team. So if you're playing and you're training and preparing at a high level You can have opportunities, but not everybody can and you know, it's tough We don't guarantee it. We say we're gonna do the best we can to get you there But we do not um, you know promise anything Yeah, it's funny when I was listening to Some parents this was must have been four or five years ago now at one of these little lacrosse uh clubs and in dc Washington dc And my kids just I just wanted my kids to have somewhere to go in the cold weather months like to throw a ball around and goof around Because I have two boys and one of them is a real ruffian. He's really funny So I wanted him to do something but I literally heard mothers who were Mothers of six and seven-year-olds Talking about dukes lacrosse program and how she heard that if you do this and this and this and this And I just stopped them. I couldn't resist. I stopped and I said How old are your kids? She said oh, you know, Trevor is eight and I have another son who's nine and you know We trained at the University of Maryland. I'm like what? I just I'm sorry, but I'm like, okay. I played in college to sports I played it. I mean I wasn't an olympian, but I was pretty good And like this is just madness. This is complete in utter madness and the kids all look exhausted by the way They just look exhausted all the time It's funny that you say that because we talked to Tony alzavada this week. He's a five-time Olympic water polo player Oh phenomenal. Yeah talks about the parents Really putting the focus on hey, we got to win the u10 the under 10 h group for water polo It's like you don't have to win that and we have the same problems with beach volleyball indoor volleyball They feel like they want that trophy. They need that title the u10 or u12 champ When they're not even focusing on getting better with their skills They just want to compete every weekend and we Tony as a coach and myself have that battle all the time I said you guys don't need to play every weekend You don't need to do that. You need to get better because it's gonna catch up to you and then you're gonna regret it And you know what amary when I was Um when I was getting ready for the show today. I thought I thought to myself If I had every dollar back that I had spent on All the things I've spent like hockey like I actually my two russian sons, right? So I thought well hockey they it's much genetic They must just they just wake up and they just want to skate right? I I took them over to the caps hockey rink because they have this caps practice rink in northern, Virginia The kids were like can we go out? You know use our little remote control boat in the pool because we like doing that like we don't want to do this Stuff something that the quip man. Oh it is just but it kind of you feel I look back on some of those decisions I made it's not the end of the world. It's not a big deal But like there are a lot of people who can't afford it and who feel like if you're not doing it you're a bad parent Yeah, it it and it isn't helping the kids because as you said as soon as the game's over They want to go get ice cream. I mean it's it's putting the money into it is not necessary and putting your Your hopes on your child playing well And you're one of the things we see a lot and we talk about a lot is how the parents are so invested in every stroke of the child Athleticism and if the child makes a mistake you can see the parent defeated In the stands and if the child is a great thing you can see the parents chest puffed out the kid doesn't care The kid just wants to play and then go get ice cream And so the money that the parents are putting in It's for what you're not getting that money back and I'm right with you I'm just as guilty as everybody else. All my kids play a ton of sport I had to talk myself off a ledge half the time about no He does not have to be in this tournament And when I don't register my kids for that tournament I get a note from the coach half the time saying hey, how come your kid isn't going to this tournament? And I say well We're going to beach. We're taking it. Oh, I say, you know what I say. This is like sundays I say, uh, sorry We're not we're actually going to be in mass on sunday morning because like when I grew up like I I you know, I was not super religious or anything and I'm not like a holy role or anything But we go to mass on sunday like we can't miss mass. That's just our thing like we go to mass like we can't We're we're not going to like travel to roan oak, Virginia to play 11 year old uh soccer I'm just not going to do that. Yeah, it's just it takes away from family time. It takes away from Um, well, I think the stress is not Lessened by this travel. I want to just bring this up to our listeners as well and get you both to comment on this Uh, there's a piece that came out in forbs. You might have seen it in april About the money that parents spend to try to get their kids a scholarship into a university Uh, and it's interesting that 40 of the thousand family surveyed Figured that their child could get a scholarship on on athletics 34 said their child could go pro Or even make it to the olympics the actual rate of high school athletes who receive a college scholarship of any kind Even a partial one two percent and of course, uh, uh, uh, holly can speak to how many people make the olympics like 0.0005 But that's just uh, that's a perception deal. Uh, holly you can chime in on that Yeah, well, it's it's crazy. I mean, I remember youth sports and and my two older steps when they were playing and their kids on the team at You know 12 thinking. Oh, yeah, I can go pro and i'm like, you know, and they're not even playing at the youth level I mean they've got this type stream and you know, obviously nba or whatever the olympics aspirational So these kids grow up with role models and they want that but I mean getting there the whole different thing You know, we're looking at like the negative the too much, but there's so many great lessons that come out of sports too You just don't need you just don't want to overdo it. I mean teamwork Competitive learning how to deal with a problem figuring out a solution Interacting with you know your teammates and finding a way to win together. I mean there's so many great things But it's just been pushed too far Yeah, and amary. I say this a lot to my kids how I You know when i'm when i'm thinking about the best memories of of growing up, you know, they're simple memories but that that team spirit and that and the perfect pass and the and the in the time that we lost the state tournament and feel hockey by one goal like Just these memories they're just they're such powerful memories and And I think the holly you see you said it right. I think it was holly said It's just it takes away from that when you're Putting so much pressure on yourself or your kids to be the best and to go to every game tournament match Uh and every professional trainer because my gosh, what would we do without sports? I don't know what what I would do to this day without sports No, and and what we learned from it you take. I mean how many times lord have you got gotten the job that you want Well, you sometimes you lost the tournament when you were a kid. That's how you learn resilience and That's what sports should be about and when the parents are all clogged up in there and saying yeah My kids gonna get a scholarship and I believe me. I'm talking parents off the ledge Every tournament I go to and I do it with the numbers. Hey, there's only four and a half scholarships for boys in this It's chopped up between 12 kids your kid my kid and that kid none of us are getting scholarships but what they are getting here is learning resilience and I think that's lost. That's the biggest thing that we use in our lives as broadcasters and business women now is When I lost I came back. I worked on the things that I needed to and I did better Now I do the same thing in broadcasting. What do I need to work on so I can go get the job? That's what it's supposed to be for um, and marie, do you Do you have any words of advice and then I'm going to ask collie before we close Any words of advice for the young women listening and the and the folks listening to this Uh about wanting to you know, get into the business of broadcasting and in sports I mean people ask me about the political stuff all the time and I don't know if I even have any great advice But the sports world is super super competitive on the broadcasting level What did you need to bring to the table to stand out from all the other women out there who've wanted to to break into the field So i'm in my 30th year in I hate saying that number two, but uh 30th year in sports television I know it's brutal. I need to start saying that. You're so good. You're so talented. Oh my god. It's you're great. You do such a great job Thank you. I appreciate that What what you need to bring is a love for the dirty work A love for listening for the right sound bite a love to learn. I feel like and now i'm really going to sound old There was social media and the likes and the emphasis on what you look like A lot of women getting into broadcasting and sports broadcasting now are focused on that I didn't have any of that it had to be my brain. It had to be my brain coming in and so Look at the people that you admire and ask them to mentor you. We all got helped by somebody along the way You need to ask but Laura. I'm sure you have the same experience people ask for help I offer to help and they don't follow follow up. I am not going to chase you to help follow up. Oh, that is so funny that's or they'll send you a text My son wants to get into the do you have any idea? I mean, you can't just be so glib about it. You have to be you have to be very deliberative about trying to You know get help and network with people and I think anemarie I say I have to be careful what I say because people take everything out of context But I think the whole emphasis on looks period in sports is really You know, it's just it's bad. I mean and we're saying this to holly with the beach volleyball players who somehow are all good looking I don't know how that is but they usually are really good looking. Let's just be honest about that Okay, that's not a stereotype. That's just a fact But but with especially with broadcasting holly. I do say that it's almost in it's in it's bad for me because I'm Maybe I'm making a generalization, but the better looking you are You know, I think people say oh, okay. That's how she got the job But there are some really good looking people who are just really good what they do So you can't hold it against them, but I think we should that shouldn't be the reason in in politics sports or anything Any company that you get hired But you know, I guess that is kind of the reality that we're dealing with yeah, there's a focus You know in our culture on how people look no matter what they do. So, you know, it's it's our culture. It's social media You know everybody's getting the attention when they looked at But for me when I broke into broadcasting, I got an opportunity. I was a three-time Olympic athlete I'd won the next a double-h championship. So I got the opportunity and guess what? I was really bad I didn't even know what I was doing But I did the work I did the work and it still took me a long time I didn't even feel that comfortable till my fifth year because there's not that many opportunities to work on tv For volleyball. So I I didn't have that many opportunities to get better But I worked with somebody we could take my me on video and it was the most painful thing But I wanted to get better and I'm coachable and I think that's one of the things that I learned from sports Being coachable is so important in life. Do you want to get better if you want to do things At the highest level you have to be coachable. You have to be willing to do what it takes to be the best Have you both gone back and looked at your first or second or third runs on television and I Proned full it is painful. We did the same thing at the podcast I I told holly like you have to listen to it. We have to get better each time It doesn't it doesn't change no matter how long you've been doing it got to listen back to your own work get better You do you do and I always say I don't once I do it. I don't want to see myself I don't want to see myself on tv. I never people say do you ever google yourself? I say literally I've never googled myself Not one time not one time. God knows what you'd find You guys are amazing. Oh incredible just an incredible inspiration. I think for Uh so many folks out there especially women, but just everyone women men Uh people who set a goal fulfill their goal who've who've succeeded in across so many Businesses and in sports and in broadcasting. I hope you guys will come back and I'm so excited Of the success of your podcast sports like a boss on podcast one. It's really really popular and just thanks so much for being out there Thank you so much for having us. All right, andry anderson holly mcpique We're all gonna go out the way we all have to go out together and like really talk about these things with that maybe we'll bring the cameras in Okay, because then it'll just that'll even be better. Let's go to peggy in florida peggy What's on your mind about this sports mania with kids? Well, hey laura, um Outcase might not be the majority but after completing her first year of middle school My daughter decided that she would prefer to you know focus on academics rather than gymnastics Um she had been into four years competing and she was really good at it And we don't like to say she quit, but she just decided um, you know, she wanted to focus more on school and Keep up. She wanted to attain the top 5% of her class. Wow Yeah, so I mean It's definitely not a quitting situation for her. She always said we'll maybe i'll go back But you know we support her decision and we're happy that school is taking precedence for her Well, I think that is first of all that's a I think that's incredibly refreshing my friends daughter Similar thing she was a little younger. I think she she stepped away from gymnastics a couple of years ago. She was phenomenal I mean she was She was really really good. She was you know traveling and a member of this gymnastics Uh traveling team and she just said i'm done i'm done And she's playing little across a little this a little that and she's one of the top students in her class So I think you know when when kids quit sports You know, it's unless they're quitting because they're attics to drugs or Some other horrible thing so what? Maybe they just want maybe they're not interested If they can do some physical activity, that's good But if they don't want to play, you know competitive sports big deal, not everybody's an athlete I I think that's completely fine. You just don't want him sitting around eating junk food But you know your daughter is a total star and wants to be a academic Success more power to her. That sounds like a really mature kid if you ask me You're listening to the Laura Ingraham podcast. Thanks again to all of our sponsors We supported this show genia cell delta animal rescue and sheaks Remember america now and forever the laurie ingraham podcast"
