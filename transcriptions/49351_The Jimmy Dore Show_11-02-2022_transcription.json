    "text": " We're doing live stand up comedy in Los Angeles on February 12, February 18, February 20th. We're in Philadelphia. We just added a second show and back on February 26th here in Los Angeles. It's our intimate 60 seat theater. Go to JimmyDorkcommy.com for a leak. And then while you're there, you can also become a premium vendor. You get access to all our stuff. Hey, the Oscar nominations just came out the other day. And I say we call our favorite thespian friend Al Pacino. And let's get his take on things. Hello. Mr. Pacino. It's Jimmy Dore. Jimmy Dore from the Jimmy Dore show calling Al Pacino. To what do I owe this honor? Well, we wanted to get your opinion about the Oscar nominations. I haven't seen a single fucking one of those pictures. Are you serious? Never even heard of them. Not a one. Been there way for about five years now. Well, okay. I mean, I'm pretty sure lay them on me. Let's see. What's up for best picture? Well, Dune is in there. Again, we fucking do. Dune. Who's nominated for Best Supporting Actor? Don't get out of her. What about the licorice pizza? What? Licorice pizza. What is that? A code word? What the fuck you saying to me right now? No, that's the that's the name of a movie. It's called licorice pizza. What? No, it's not. Yes, it was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. No, that makes sense. I get it now. Let me tell you something. Any director pretentious enough to use all three names can kiss my ass. Next. How about Kenneth Bronis film also nominated for Best Picture? What's it called? I don't know. Belfast. It's called Belfast. Oh, let me guess. The common of age story is set in Ireland. Oh, we're poor. Everything's hard. The Irish have made an entire identity based on why and about being Irish. Bro, the fuck up. Okay. How about West Side Story? Oh, I love West Side Story. Did they re-release that last year? No, they remade it. Whoa, what? How do you remake a masterpiece? So you didn't see it. Fuck that. When it comes to West Side Story, if it does a star read a Moreno, Al Pacino is going to say no. Tell me who directed this unholy abomination. Steven Spielberg directed it. Spielberg. What? Does it have Danish and fucking dinosaurs? I'm a Triceratops, you're a Bronisaurus. Our families would never approve of our love. Uh oh, here comes a fucking spaceship. Okay, best actress, Nicole Kidman was nominated for being the Ricardo's. Needless to say, I didn't see that. But cast in Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball. It's like casting Dame Judy Danche to play Phyllis Diller. What the fuck? I've said it many times you can't pretend to be a comedian if you're not. No actor can do that. It's hubris. Thank you. Thank you. You get it. Fuck it. Hey, right? I do. What else you got? Well, let's see. Kristin Stewart is nominated for Spencer, the lady die pick, biopic. I'm sure she's lovely and talented and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But enough with the British royal family already. They got like eight TV shows every year. Some broad is nominated for playing a fucking queen. Like that's hard. I could play a queen. Oh, heavy as they heard that wears a crown. I never found true love in life or I did fucking whatever. Speaking of Denzel Washington was nominated for the tragedy of Macbeth. I famously love Shakespeare, but I want nothing to do with Macbeth. Why? Because of the superstitious theater curse surrounding it? I don't know how fucking moron because that king's first name was Macbeth, not his last name. And Shakespeare calls his wife Lady Macbeth. That's like saying hi. I'm King John. This is my wife, Lady John. I could never get over that. Takes me right out. So what movies did you see last? Did you see last year? I saw that fucking Spider-Man picture like three times in theater. I love all that stuff. That's superhero stuff. You know, all the different Spider-Man flying around fighting all those old villains because Dr. Strange created a multiverse. Well, they think of next. That's it. I think so. I'm going to see Jackass forever tomorrow. I can't wait to see these jack-offs. Absolutely end each other's balls. I would have thought you'd be a bit more of a film goer though, really. Jimmy is just a job. When I'm off the clock, I want to turn my brain off just like everybody else. Do you think author author is a movie that I would go watch? No, I was just in the fucking thing. See, OK. Oh, I got to go. Real housewives is on. I think some crazy shit's about to go down. At least that's what they were implying into teasers. I remember that. All right. Al Pacino. Al Pacino, ladies and gentlemen, nicely done. It's the best media sets of audience lighting. So good luck. Oh, shoot, they can't afford my moment in this. Oh, what you see as a jack-off, the media speeds and jumps the media. And then hit some head on. It's the Jimmy Tour show. So Joe Rogen is they released a video of compilation out of context of him saying the N word. Now, I had already seen this before. Like a couple years ago, I thought anyway, and Joe had already addressed it. And I thought we'd moved on, but no, that so the establishment is trying to shut him down. They do not want Joe Rogen around talking about Joe Biden or COVID or anything that goes against the establishment status quo because they're losing control of the narrative. And they've got to get it back. So somebody. So they, this video starts circulating, right? Look at that. 1.8 million views. Right? So I'm not going to play it. So it's him saying the N word in a bunch of places there. And then Andrew Schultz, everybody knows. And the hilarious Andrew Schultz, he says, who you all think is behind this attack on Joe Rogen? Well, guess what? We found out. Wait. So Jimmy, I just want to mention my friend that sent me that stuff that I would take you last night, my buddy, V from his channel's Romanian TV. He's the one who made me aware of that. He goes, you want to know who's doing it? Because this isn't like secret leak stuff. He dug it up these companies. But that's where I found out about it was from a game from Romanian TV. Yeah. And so Kurt gave me the heads up on this yesterday. And then we also found this Twitter thread that kind of explains it pretty clearly. Woke a distance. Is that what it is? Wokel. Wokel. I don't know what that means. It's like social distance. Okay. Yeah. That that is. Since you asked and I love your work, I'll tell you this is the professional political attack. Three waves, one right after the other is not a coincidence. Good spacing, good timing. So it's absolutely professional. But who wasn't you ask? That takes some digging. The video compilation of Rogang saying the N word was dropped by Patriot takes. That's the Twitter account at Patriot takes six days ago. You see the video in this tweet is in pick one and Patriot takes credit for republishing the information in pick two. But they take credit is important and you'll see why shortly. So as you can see in their bio, Patriot takes has partnered with. Midas touch. Midas touch. And this is where maybe I am dyslexic and this is it's not spelled right. If their name is like my list or something. Oh, okay. That's I want to say medius and I'm like, that's not how that's it's my this touch. Okay. So and this is where it gets interesting. Who is Midas touch? Well, they are a professional political organization. In fact, they are a Democrat super pack. More on that in a moment run by three brothers and you know that Joe Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders who was to the left of the Democratic Party and that angered all the Hillary Clinton voters and then an A and angers all the Joe Biden voters. And so he's an enemy of the Democratic Party. So this is a Democratic Party hit job. And the Jonas Brothers of propaganda. Yes. From the Jonas Brothers of propaganda here. Here is their, uh, there it says Patriot takes. That's who tweeted out this video. And here's where it comes from partnered with Midas touch. 440,000 followers, Ben, Brett and Jordan. Midas or mysles. However, they say that my mysales, masala, all of them have worked in media and have expertise and understanding and manipulating media. The most important thing for us is that Brett was a social media manager for Ellen DeGeneres. Oh, great job, dude. And as Tim Dillon said, and Ellen DeGeneres was running Abu Ghraib in the back is an expert editor, which matters because behind Midas touch, how three brothers slammed Donald Trump daily with razor sharp viral videos. That's a variety. How much you want to bet they're not razor sharp? Ah, here, here. Let's read this. Midas touch a political action committee formed earlier this year by brothers, Ben, Brett and Jordan, mysles who have deep connections to their entertainment industry. Their father is a top music attorney, Kenny Mysles, who reps, Sean, Diddy Combs, lady Gaga, the weekend, Lizzo and others. Ben, who's 35, is a litigator and civil rights attorney who represents exiled NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and led a class action suit over the disastrous 27 fire festival. Brett's 30 is a video editor and former head of a post production and social media for Ellen and Jordan, who's 27, is an executive at Steve Stout's branding and marketing film translation firm translation. Oh, by the way, Ben, the somebody might be just a message. He's retweeting that nonsense video over and over again to try to make sure the algorithm picks it up as much as possible. So that that little smear job that they put together, this is just retweeting it over and over and over right now. Okay. Try to get it out as much as possible. So patron takes works with Midas touch. And I'd say it's a safe bet that given their expertise in social media management that the N word video is created by Midas touch, but we are not done. Midas touch is a super pack. Well, what's a super pack you ask? A super pack is political advocacy group with a special twist. Super packs may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations, and individuals then spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates. This means that a super pack can take unlimited amounts of money and then spend however they want politically. Midas touch is a super pack. They can take in as much cash as they want. 4.7 million for the 2020 cycle and 1.5 million for the 2022 cycle to be exact. To recap, Midas touch is super pack, which can collect as much cash as it wants from pretty well anywhere and is a professional strategy and media firm run by people with deep ties to entertainment likely had a hand in the N word video. Patriot takes used to attack Joe Rogan. So the question is why? Why would they do this? Why are they doing this and what do they have to gain? Well I think the clue can be found in the letter Patriot take they wrote about all this. Look at the highlighted part and what does that tell you? So the highlighted part says this. This past week Patriot takes republished and brought to the national spotlight dozens of record recorded instances where Joe Rogan used the N word. The videos have now received millions of views. Why is that important? Patriot takes his bragging about their millions of views and how they made the videos that center of the national conversation. They are bragging about their clout. Rogan is the one guy that left his can't cancel. If a group could cancel Rogan, it would be a massive show of power. Rogue people and legacy media groups have been trying to cancel Rogan for ages because he steals their audience and doesn't play by their rules. Rogan also offers his enormous platform to people like Jordan Peterson that woke progressives in media circles really don't like. The group that takes out Rogan would gain a lot of clout and a lot of power. The group that can say we cancel Rogan if we can get him, we can get you too, would be able to swing a very large stick and that's what this is ultimately about. It's a play for power. Look out David Brock. There's some new bottom feeders in town. That's right. That's exactly right Kurt. In short, Midas Touch is a political super pack that is very likely behind the Patriot takes account. They're attempting a viral hit on Joe Rogan so they can take him out because they don't like him and because they want to monetize clout for having done so. So Andrew Schultz, that's who's behind this. The question is, what can we do about it? If every person who Joe helpful said we are with him, who if every person who helped Joe out, is that what that says helped out said, we are with him and we will tell our audiences to cancel Spotify if they cancel Joe, this would be over in a day. The next thing, well, I would never went to Spotify before Joe Rogan. I don't ever go there for any other fucking reason. I'd catch him on YouTube still. I would never, I would never, there wouldn't be a reason for me to go back to Spotify, believe me. Yeah, right. If everyone won't stand up, we need brave people to lead organic pushback. Brett Weinstein has been doing this with his thanks Joe Rogan hashtag. And finally, it needs to be made clear to Spotify that if they cave, they will pay a significant cost. We have to make that clear. They need to pay a cost for this. If we can do those things, I think we can protect a guy who has done so much for so many. So just in case anyone still thinks that the attack on Rogan was organic, we have pre-made scripts out there about canceling Rogan and they're the same word for word. That ain't organic. So here's one I'll show it to you. It's from Paul Kogan. He says, it's time for Spotify to be accountable to listeners and stop the spread of disinformation on the platform. Spot shares are down 30% and they've lost 4 billion in market value in the past few days. Sign the petition. If you agree, Spotify needs to drop Rogan. And as the Buddha says, it's time for Spotify to be accountable to listeners and stop the spread of this. Holy shit. So this is the actual misinformation. This is actual propaganda. So Joe Rogan again, isn't the liar, isn't the bad faith actor. He's not the propagandist. He's not the misinformer. It's the people who are against him. Of course, who's against him? The government and the corporate media. And politics, political organizations like the Democratic Party and their super PACs. Here's some more. It's time for it. This is Whit Gormano. He him. It's time for Spotify to be a cut. There it is. There's another one. The exact same message. Is there is there more? Here's another one. Time for Spotify. That's gene phoenix. It's time for Spotify to be accountable. Listen, there it is. So Midas Touch absolutely advises and works with Patriot takes. And by their own admission, Midas Touch helps Patriot takes with strategy, building and boosting their fundraising profile. This is all professional. And so was the hit on Rogan. And I found this on Twitter. This was kind of, well, here. In troll you. And you made a really good point. You said the thing is, if you sense yourself just 1%. Do you say, I'll just censor myself 1%. That's what they want. I'm going to make them happy. And then they're just going to keep moving it. They're just going to keep moving it forward, moving the gold posts and providing you with more money and giving you more things, but keep moving it in a certain direction. And if you keep giving into it, they're going to have a hold of you and they can control you. Can you made a really good point? So I don't think they can control Joe Rogan. Even though they gave him $100 million, I think Joe would have no trouble walking away from that, but he's not going to walk away. But if they cancel him, he gets, I'm sure he gets to keep that money. So I'm sure the incentive is for them to keep him, but he doesn't need them that he's, he doesn't need him. I'm not saying Joe Rogan is bigger than Spotify or bigger than YouTube. I'm saying he doesn't, he could go to Joe Rogan.com. And I'm sure those 11 million viewers will follow him. I would probably have more. I didn't lose viewers going to Spotify in the first place. Yeah. There was a big slump when he or, you know, they lost a lot of, they lost me. I couldn't figure out how to work the goddamn Spotify app. And then I think they, they rejiggered it around and now it's a little bit better. So anyway, now they're, you know, he's, and by the way, why are, why aren't people, so there's this? I don't know if you've ever seen this. This is Howard Stern saying the N word in the most vile way possible, right? I was believable. I'm not going to play it. I can't, I'm so relieved. I can't play it. I'm not going to play it. I'm sure it violates community standards. I can't play that's Howard. I think that was just, I thought that was Justin Trudeau. And you saw this before, right? Kurt, I don't have to show you. I mean, he says, I saw when it came on as a child. It was just. And, but open making a video of him doing this. Why is that? Why aren't they passing a video of Howard Stern around? Why? Because Howard Stern now props up the status quo. He is the establishment. That's why they never have to worry about Howard Stern saying anything that's going to upset the establishment, which is why he's on family television at 7 p.m. That's why he's on ABC at 7 p.m. doing a talent show because he is no longer a threat to the establishment. You know, Howard Stern's real talent was he was able to get, you know, he brought on women to have sex on his radio show. So what he did was he got people to listen to pornos. That was his real talent. Anyway, I'm not going to go through any more of this. Oh, how about this? What? So they're trying to make him out to be raised system. So watch this. Here he is with Ben Shapiro. The way to fight against that is to make good decisions. And so the you fight against the system to make sure that the system has rules that apply equally to everyone. Right. But you clearly see that there's a big difference between people coming over here willingly and doing so in order to better their lives versus someone whose ancestors were dragged over here to be sold as property. And then dealing with the repercussions of that being your family history and redline laws and all the other things that were put in place to sort of keep them in very specific areas, which to this day remain crime ridden, gang ridden, deeply impoverished community. So that's all like a racist or crazy right winger. Or is that's all like a guy who has empathy and understanding of a social problem that affects people of color. And he pushes back against Ben Shapiro right there. You can't pretend that everything's equal, Ben. That's what he's saying. That's what Joe Rogan saying. That's the opposite of what you would think he would say, right? If you just got your information about Joe Rogan from the establishment media or Twitter or Facebook, there's what Tim Dillon says. It's a political hatchet job. It's obvious to anyone with eyes. The debate about the vaccine has been over. UK just opened no restrictions. They don't want him on the air for the next election cycle. Press secretary asked Spotify to do more. It's not a conspiracy. It's out in the open. The government is urging corporations to censor voices that are dissident. Remember when Trump said Russia, please hack Hillary's emails. I really was a crime. This is not at all disturbing to any of the people that want this to happen because they just don't like Rogan. So here's what Glenn says. It was only a question of time before the all-out war on Rogan began. He's way too big and off key to permit him to keep going. The concept of free speech in the United States is a mirage. You have it right up to the line where it matters or can threaten power centers, then you don't have freedom of speech anymore. Although give you freedom of speech, you could do well, well, wet-ass pussy videos and all that stuff on CBS. But if you actually threaten the establishment, that's when you lose your freedom of speech like Julian Assange, like R.F.K. Jr., like Dr. Robert Malone. So, you see what Glenn put me because he's way too big and off key. That's like good wording because I've heard that the last like 20 times there was some move to cancel video after his tone deaf comments. You're not, whether it's wrong or right, it was tone deaf. That's always the, you can't hear the song we're singing and you're not going to sing on key with us over the same song because we're all singing it. Here's what Glenn went on to say, every major institution is united to destroy Rogan, including the White House, the press secretary speaking on behalf of the U.S. government, demanded, Spotify do more to stop him and this is treated as normal and benign. As Julian Assange, if effective dissent is permitted. The power derived from controlling the flow of information is immense. That's why every tyrant and authoritarian wield censorship power, tyranny can't exist without it. And as Orwell and Chomsky have both said, the most effective form isn't jailing dissidents, but doing this, censoring them. Read what Orwell said about why censorship in the U.K. during the war was so much more effective than the overtly autocratic regimes that just imprisoned dissidents. The Britists don't have to. They have their compliant media unite to punish and destroy the reputation of dissidents. And here it is. The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. Unpopular ideas can be silenced and inconvenient facts kept dark without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news, things which on their own merits would get the big headlines being kept right out of the British press, not because the government intervened, but because of a general tacit agreement that it won't do that it won't wouldn't do to mention that particular fact. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with the surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals. We're at that point where we also arrive in these cycles. If you're object to the attempt to silence Rogan, then you will be instantly tarred with the same brush used to try to destroy him, your racist, anti-vax, etc. That's the enforcement mechanism to keep everyone quiet. This racism charge from splicing together a bunch of context-free snippets over the years reeks of desperation, but it too was inevitable. Racism accusations are the central toy to every silencing game in the United States. You can make anyone look racist with it. Good times to post this one as Barack Obama's best moments where he denounces what he calls woke activism as the superficial and self-serving delusion that it is. Explains that it's just about the self-esteem of the denounces and mocks the idea that silencing people is activism. Let's listen. This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you. I think one danger I see among young people, particularly on college campuses, Molly and I talk about this. Y'all go to school with my daughter. But I do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people and this is accelerated by social media. There is this sense sometimes of the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people. That's enough. If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or use the word wrong verb or then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. Because man, you see how woke I was, I called you out. I'm going to get on TV. Watch my show. Watch groanish. That's not activism. That's not bringing about change. If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far. That's easy to do. Isn't it weird Barack Obama got that? How did he get that right? You're just seeing what happens when the establishment can't control the narrative and Joe Rogan. This is what happens. They do character assassination and that's exactly what's happening. If you actually go against them in an even more real way, who's this guy? This guy was the head of Quest. It was a telecommunications company. When the NSA came around and they wanted him to give all the information on their users, the customers over to the government, he said, no, this doesn't seem legal. What did they do? They fucking ginned up bullshit charges against this guy and put him in jail for five years because he wouldn't turn over the data of his customers. You see what they do when you go against the establishment? Do you see what they do to you? Here's NBC reporting it. They never mentioned any of that in the NBC article. Never mentioned any of that in the article. They make it sound like he was doing insider trading and that's why they got him. Isn't that what Putin was doing to people? I thought that was this big thing of somebody would say something or reveal something in their eyes only bad. So here is I had to go to this website, Quest CEO, NSA punished Quest for refusing to participate in illegal surveillance pre 9 11. So there you go. So that's the story. You would never know that if you heard about it. So I'm just letting people know this is how they come for you. So they're coming for Joe Rogan. This is a coordinated hit funded by people are super packed for the Democratic Party. I hope Joe Rogan, I'm sure will stand strong and not bend to this or buckle to this. Spotify might buckle and then Joe Rogan gets to get his 100 million over at rumble. That'd be great. You know, by the way, I'll say this for the nightmare Chinese social credit system. When I was there, you knew at least exactly what all the rules were to not have the state do that to you. Here we have freelance right bounty hunter Lynch mobs online who were auditioning and then the rules first of all, nobody has to tell you what any of the rules are until you break them and then they're retroactive. So you saying like in no part was he saying the N word as an insult to anyone. He was using it the exact same way every one of these media people were using it to talk about it, which at a certain time before, you know, context was the higher dimension we can no longer peer into was not a crime. And now retroactively to crime when it suits me. Let me see what else I have been here. I don't want to play that. Everyone knows that if Spotify removes Rogan, he will move to a new platform with his millions of listeners. The point of the points of this deny him the credibility of a major corporate platform and vilify and ostracize him to prevent further growth to create an example for others. So that's what this that's what the establishment is getting out of this. They're trying to deny him credibility of a major platform. They're trying to vilify and ostracize and to stop his growth. And they're giving an example for other people like me and you Kurt to make sure we don't step out of line. I've been made an example of quite a few times already. Yeah, I'm with you. You and I have both been made an example of. I didn't it didn't like take very well. We should call ourselves the example brothers. Let's start a let's start a Metzger touch. Super pack a Metz Gore touch. I like the example brothers. We should get t-shirts example brothers. Super pack the example brothers. What does that mean? We've been made an example of that's what I'm going to. Yeah. All right. It is for 20. Hey, you know, here's another great way. You can help support the show is you become a premium member.

This is from the Wall Street Journal and it says, uh, the message of Canada's trucker protest. What is the message? The lesson for the COVID-19 police is that when you've lost even the Canadians, arguably the most law-abiding people on the planet, you've lost the political plot. That's from the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. And now there was a gentleman being interviewed. He's from Rebel News in Canada, eh? And I guess they're a conservative news organization. And so this is a young guy. I think he's just out of college and he's out there in seven degree below zero, seven degrees below zero. And he's, uh, no, I think that's that might be, uh, that might be what do they call it? The Celsius. So that I don't know if that's fair. I might be. Yeah. So that's still below freezing because there zero is 32, right? And that what it is. That's anyway, we do anything. I refuse to learn. That's just everything. I refuse to learn the metric system myself. I rejected it. So he's going to be interviewed. He's getting interviewed on the Hill. And now the guy that interviews him is friend of the show, Ryan Grimm, who's the DC bureau chief. He's the DC bureau chief of the intercept. And why do I bring this up? Because Ryan Grimm smeared people whenever people get together to fight against the old Ligarkey, Ryan Grimm, the DC bureau chief of the intercept is there to smear them and discredit them. He did it with people who were forced to vote. He did it to those people. He did it to people who were doing the Medicare for all barches. He did it to those people. And now watch what he's going to do to these people. Watch this. The trucker protests have linked it to kind of far right fringe movements. So what have you. So he's cut off. So I have the speed sped up because he's so boring. So I had it sped up because otherwise you'll fall asleep in the middle of this clip. So and that's why he wears the bright yellow tie to keep you awake. It's like, well, whoa, she's like trying to brighten you colors. Excited. Yes. So he's going to try and smear the truckers and not talk about the issue. What at all all he's going to do is say, you guys are right wingers. Why should we listen to you? That's what he's going to do. Watch this. And he brings up Charlotte, Bill. Watch this. The trucker protests have linked it to kind of far right fringe movements. And your own network has been has been linked to far right fringe networks as well. I think you guys took a lot of criticism for very favorable coverage of the United Right Rally down in Charlottesville, which wasn't explicitly in a grotesque white supremacist event. Why, why, why doesn't that give people a real sense of foreboding about where this where this movement does come from? So he said that his news network covered the Charlottesville. And so why shouldn't people have a foreboding feeling about these trucker protests? I don't know what a news network covering an event has to do with the people at the event. I have any idea. But so now he's saying that these truckers are smeared. They are now also white supremacists because this news agency covered Charlottesville in a positive way so that now they're covering the trucker. So they're all what Ryan doesn't that make you a white supremacist and a right winger if you're interviewing this guy on your show? Platforming him. You're platforming him. Why are you platforming white races? So let's listen to it all again. And so so and by the way, I'll answer. Let's just do it. Let me play it. I think the trucker protests have linked it to far right fringe movements. And your own network has been has been linked to far right fringe networks as well. I think you guys took a lot of criticism for very favorable coverage of the Unite the right rally down in Charlottesville, which wasn't explicitly in a protest white supremacist event. Why doesn't that give people a real sense of foreboding about where this where this movement does come from? Okay, I'm going to answer Ryan's question. I wrote down the answer. The reason why it doesn't give people a sense of foreboding about where this movement is coming from, Ryan, is because it's very clear where it's coming from. And the corporate media has been able to suppress where it's coming from. And that's why you're now going to do your best to imply that it's just a bunch of secret Nazis. Oh, it's probably not the neoliberal authoritarianism hurts working people. No, they're probably just secret Nazis. Sure they say it's about mandates, but I bet it's about racism. Right, Ryan? I better ask the dumbest question in the world and then go home and cut my hair myself because I'm Ryan Graham. Hey, Ryan, your haircut has been linked to Hitler by anyone who hasn't seen pictures of both of you. I'm sorry. Anyone who has seen pictures of both of you. Why is it there more of a sense of foreboding when you pretend to be progressive and then shield for the establishment whenever something progressive might actually happen? Why is it there a bigger sense of foreboding around that? This guy takes a check from not one billionaire, not two billionaires. He takes a check from three different billionaires. He gets paid by Piero Medaro over at the intercept. He gets paid by the billionaire who owns the right wing hill. He's not a right wing fucking station himself. And he also gets paid by Jeffrey Katzenberg who funds the young Turks. So that's three different billionaire, neoliberal class crushers that he's taking a check from. And now he's here to let you know that the farmers and the truckers in Canada, did you know the farmers join the truckers? You probably don't because the fucking news will never report that the farmers join the truckers and he's there to tell you that those workers because he's being paid by three different billionaires, those workers are somehow nefarious racists that can't be trusted. They're not the real working class. Who knows better about the real working class than a guy who wears a piss colored tie while taking three different checks from three different fucking billionaires? This guy is so transparently a tool of the establishment. I hate that I have to, that I can't believe I have to point it out to people. Well, Jimmy, I would, he's a tricky little guy because when I woke up and saw that story, I mean, it stuck out so bizarrely, but you know, we'll see as it goes on. But if he was like, well, you guys are right wing who supported Charlottesville. Why should we trust you? That's one thing. But what he did was directly try to link whatever the hell about rebel news, which was very vague, by the way, I don't know what it is they did that was favorable to it. He's like, the same people are called you Nazis are calling them Nazis. So why aren't people worried that they're Nazis? Like, that's the question. That's it. That's right. So here's the answer. So now this guy's going to answer the question. I can't, I can't comment on any of that. What I can tell you is that from me being on the ground, you're actually talking to the people here, actually being in the thick of it every single day. I've seen that it's nothing but peace here. It's peaceful people, peaceful Canadians from all walks of life, literally from all walks of life, you know, and it's been really hard to be a Canadian over the past two years. We've been consistently in and out of lockdowns and the truckers are here and the truckers are giving hope to a lot of Canadians that we might actually see these mandates lifted. So as far as Justin Trudeau's called the, the protesters here, the demonstrators, a fringe minority, but I'd have to disagree with that. I've seen nothing but the opposite. And it's, like I said, it's people from all walks of life left, right? It doesn't matter. Well, hey, let me try this bullshit line of fucking questioning again. Okay. If I didn't smear you, you guys, you were ready for that question, but here comes another smear and let's see you try to dodge it. Here comes some more guilt by association from, from a guy taking a check from three billionaires as he's shitting on the workers. This is guy taking quibi money. Yeah. Right. But I mean, the Charlottesville protest was indeed a fringe, racist minority. So why should we be able to trust the judgment of the far right media that this one is different? What the fuck? I have no idea. What is he doing? You tell me what I'll tell you what he's doing. He's doing the bidding of the oligarchy in the establishment, which pays his six figure salary. That's exactly what's happening. Ryan Grimm is revealing that he is a bought tool and he doesn't care if you see it because his friends aren't going to give a shit because they're all taking corporate money to. Like I said, I can't comment on any of that, any of those incidences. All I can tell you is that from you've seen from my footage on Twitter, we have a website called conglarereports.com on that website. You can see for yourself that it is not, it is people from all walks of life, literally every type of person, every type of Canadian candidate, Canada is such a diverse country and it really shows in this demonstration. And that's my job here is to show what's really happening, whatever the, wherever the story leads and that's what I picked up from being here. Right. And there's, and there's been a lot more coverage on this than just rebel news. I mean, we can't just say, well, it's because of a right wing organization was covering it. It must be right wing Lincoln. Let me ask you what sort of disruption. So there's Kim Iverson on the show, just swatting Ryan Grimm's bullshit away. Now if you still platform Ryan Grimm uncritically after this, you're also a piece of shit. How about that? If you, if you don't, if you fucking plat, if you have a platform and you platform, Ryan Grimm was taking a check from three different billionaires. You don't mention he's taking a check from three different billionaires. And you don't mention that he kneecapped forced to vote Medicare for all. And now he's calling workers white supremacists at the behest of the fucking establishment. You are also a piece of shit. So let's watch who platforms Ryan Grimm next that believe me, they're going to line up because everybody wants to get in the graces of the guy who's the DC bureau chief of the intercept and now the host of some bullshit show on the on fucking YouTube that wouldn't that no one would watch if Kim Iverson was not on there. Are you going to show the end of this? Here it comes. So here it comes. And so then so then they leave and Kim Iverson starts asking questions and now they come back to Ryan Grimm. I've heard that the trucks are still getting fueled down here. They're still running and quite frankly the truck is going to be able to be out here without the fuel because it is so full. Yeah. All right. Sounds like it. You say warm. Just curious why not comment on charlotte's but were you not there at the time or you don't want to weigh in on the organization's role in covering charlotte's but that's something that's still a little causing a little discomfort here. I mean we're talking about the trucker protest. I mean it just seems like an odd thing to ask them was even there. So his co-host has to correct him. This seems like an odd thing to ask him about the charlotte protest. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the protests of the truckers right now and you want to talk was this guy even there? Well that's an interesting question Kim because dummy didn't ask that question but you did. So and guess what it's very it's very efficacious because what's what he says. I was at college student at the time. I have no comments on that situation. I don't even know anything about it to be honest. Well Lincoln thank you for joining us we appreciate it. I like the blood guy. And so Ryan Grimkin even go oh sorry I was an asshole because he that that's what his job is. Well do you think he does because I'll see him talk about you know progressive stuff and then when it comes like the first. In fact I don't even fully understand what you tell me. I even kind of like. Dattered a little till I watched a little whammy tricks he does and he so that means he's he probably does like this comedy reviewer I knew who trashed Theo Vaughn because he was nice to everybody's thing and he had to pick somebody. So Brian Grim probably has to pay his tribute by picking one story that he knows. The guards are going to be cool with him. Yeah to make up for any other progressive things he might say. Yeah this is the most well whenever if he ever does say anything that's considered progressive that is a good that again is a head fake to get him fake credibility so he does the real duty of when workers actually come together and they might force a change Ryan Grim is there to pour water on it like he did with force the vote Medicare for all marches and like he's doing here now and he's doing that and it's doing do I think he thinks that Kurt is that why ask this why I think you think wait a minute Kurt you think he's just fucking stupid you think he's just dumb he doesn't know what he's doing is here that's not a real question right Kurt. I well I am basing it on his haircut because I'm saying haircut because he's five and nobody you know if you're like hey this is how I should have my every time like maybe you tell yourself a lot of things you know yeah well he tells himself he's not a piece of shit I bet but he is he definitely is a corrupt and it's transparent and there's no hiding it again a lot of people who were my friends some of them still my friends love that guy for just because they want to advance their careers that's all that is what I'm saying what what the reason why you're going to be friends with fucking Ryan Grimm is it because you enjoy a good time it's because you think he's going to help you advance your career yeah that's the way you do it you go well my careers most I do the most good here you know that's fucking alright that is that is crazy what he just did what what I that is the most and now you know why people don't trust the fucking as that corporate media and by the way there that's the hill there on the corporate algorithm they get favorable treat that's what gets favorable treatment from YouTube that's the kind of garbage that gets favorable treatment from YouTube that is that's a guy again another piece of shit transparent enemy of the people Brian Grimm and what how do I know well here's here's a quote from Ryan Glimb what he just did he told you what he just did because once he said the mosquitoes that carry the rumor in his book we've got people Ryan Grimm describes how reporters themselves help to create the story they then reported on huh well oftentimes reporters are the mosquitoes that carry the rumor from office to office in attempts to confirm it who said that Ryan enemy of the people Grimm and that's exactly what he was just doing you've been linked to fringe rights apprentices by me just now and I would like to do you want to comment on that why not comment on Charlottesville is what Ryan Grimm's question was well I guess because it has nothing to do with the protest a better question is why the fuck are you bringing up Charlottesville Ryan do you think that 20% of the Canadian truckers are secret Nazis and these Nazis are fighting against authoritarianism and as Kim Iverson just explained why Ryan is a worm that's why this is the best part of the hill now watching Ryan get slapped down by Kim Iverson and it happens all the time I hate to say that because it's going to make people tune into their show but who gives a fuck and by the way Ryan I just want to read you from the Wall Street Journal another billionaire own thing I'm sure you're going to take a check from soon the message of the Canada's trucker protest the lessons for COVID-19 police is that when you've lost that even the Canadians arguably the most law-abiding people on the planet you've lost the political plot and Ryan Grimm is not losing anything he's being paid to do exactly what he's doing shit on popular movements that are grassroots and at the beginning at the at the behest of the oligarchs and so go watch that show if you want and go ahead read the bullshit enter by the intercept by the way that sensor Joe Biden's kids fucking laptop just got revealed that there was more corruption involved at that laptop and the intercept fired clang green weld over that while suppressing that story and censoring it as fake news and brought Russian propaganda when it's the intercept that sprout spreading propaganda of course and now Ryan Grimm the DC bureau chief of the intercept the biggest propaganda spewer on the fucking internet right now it happens to be Ryan Grimm you know cutter of his own hair I read a thing where they asked him about Glenn Greenwald being outed from the intercept and what million miles shit did he say he said well the younger generation of reporters coming in you know they're like woken out basically like they're like woken it clashed which obviously it's the people that own it are like we want Biden yes and you're not gonna harm Biden's chances with this very real story about his garage yeah that's exactly right so Ryan found a reason why it was okay yeah yeah that's his that's his job that's his job I wouldn't even believe that until I but I'm the hell out this is not the first time I seen this with Kim I was in him there's one where I don't know she got sick from covid and had that kit you know yeah yes yeah and he said that say horse horse dewormer horse dewormer and he smeared it as being a hydrochloroquine yes he smeared it as again being some kind of crazy conspiracy theory I know yeah you know how they they say you can't watch Tucker Carlson and the reason why they say that by the way is because he's effective in joining populist left and populist right together to fight against the imperialist wars and so that's horrible they can't ever do that and so that's that's why it's extra bad to watch Tucker Carlson except what's weird as if the rest of Fox News is okay as if CNN and MSNBC are complete garbage right doing the biddings of the oligarchs that are suppressing poor black and brown people of course they are they're denying them health care and MSNBC and CNN prop those people up so why do I bring all this up because this is going to be interesting surprise Tucker Carlson draws the most democratic viewers in key demo even topping Rachel Maddow so there are more Democrats watching Tucker Carlson than watching Rachel Maddow more Democrats in the key demo in the key demo wow and all I'm saying there's that many Democrats watching Tucker Carlson are there really that many Democrats working for the NSA really well here we go there is an entire cottage industry within media dedicated to disseminating Tucker Carlson's nightly Fox News musings to presumably liberal audiences who may not be tuning in to hear what the leading conservative voice is telling his large following yes it's a cottage industry and that's why we have to the media watch blob the Brian Stelter that's why he has a job okay but recent data from Nielsen MRI fusion I never heard that before suggest those nightly dispatches may not be necessary why because you know if you go you want to go to watch the young Turks and people with MSNBC contracts their whole playlist is about how much you should hate Trump and Tucker Carlson that's all they have they're appealing to them brain dead and well turns out in October the most recent month for which data is available Carlson's 9 p.m. Eastern time program was the top cable new show among Democrats in the advertiser coveted age range of two so there are more people that isn't that something I find that interesting that's a by the way that's a big advertising graphic demographic so maybe some advertisers are realizing we should be ever we should be going after Democrats on Tucker Carlson show instead of Rachel Meadows we'll get more because right now Tucker Carlson gets zero almost zero advertising and will accept it's for catheters or the Mike the pillow guy Mike pillow advertises with you know the pillow guy whatever that I call and Mike pillow so that's kind of it here we go keeps going the Nielsen numbers reveal that in October Fox News unsurprisingly got the majority of the audience of self-proclaimed Republicans with 69% of them overall tuning into total day programming and 73% of them in the demo tuning into prime time programming boy this is just terrible I mean you're not supposed to watch these dangerous shows yourself you're supposed to let people like Brian Stelter tell you what they said boy 39% Democrats watch him that's more like 39% Putin cracks am I right come on get the F on here see an N and MS NBC split the remaining conservatives with totals in the low double digit percentages Fox News also commanded the largest number of independence in the key news demo during prime time and total day hours 55% of those 25 between 25 and 54 watched Fox News in prime time compared with CNN's 23% and MSNBC's 20 Wow that is come on that's something no joke during total day hours 58% of independence in the demo watched Fox News 18 Wow these are big numbers folks this is a unbook this is kind of unbelievable more surprising are the stats about Carlson and Fox News pull with self-proclaimed Democrats of those them Dem demo aged viewers okay of those demo aged viewers surveyed who identified as Democrats 39% of them chose Fox News that's that's really stunning 31% chose MSNBC and 30% chose CNN from programming from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Wow if you're upset that people trust Joe Rogan more than they trust CNN well now you can also be upset that they trust Fox News more than they trust CNN Wow Democrats turning to Fox News more than they're turning to CNN and MSNBC this is quite a story which is why you haven't heard it because it's actually important and shows you that they're losing the narrative and so what is their response to losing the narrative double doubt on calling their enemies liars and white supremacists doubling down on turning against workers and ignoring the story that's how they handled it in total day viewership Fox News grabbed 42% of Democrats aged 425 to 54 CNN nabbed 33 and MSNBC got 25 Geez I'm with you Kurt Carlson was top among Democrats in the demo across all of cable news that month and ranked third place among Democrats in total viewership too oh my god on the top four programs among Democrats in total viewers Fox News had three the five Tucker Carlson tonight and Hannity Hannity that's crazy the top spot in total viewers went to MSNBC's the Rachel Maddow show I watch Rachel and I watch Hannity and then if there's time I do it to Tucker that's crazy and now Rachel's leaving to start a conspiracy podcast who's going to fill that space Neil Young Howard Stern I'm just spitball in here I think Howard Stern's a good choice I think he's a good choice these numbers only account for October but reveal that Fox News's and Carlson's sizable audiences are not that easy to define oh you don't think they are because someone just didn't define them they said look there's all the people on the left and the people on the right and you know Russell Brand is one of the guys on the right so you can it's easily defined I like to say it's like a auditioning for a high school play like you don't pick what you are we'll tell you and then you yeah that's right you'll see if you made the cuts on our list uh consider Carlson's ratings that month in October Carlson's show was the top rated program in the demo across all cable news and was the second highest rated show overall coming in only behind Fox News late afternoon panel show the five in total average viewers he netted 3.081 million viewers so 3 million viewers in the demo he secured 483 000 what that's a weird sentence in total average viewers oh in total average viewers he netted 3 million and in the demo he secured 483 000 okay I got it for the entire year of 2021 Tucker Carlson tonight was the highest rated program in cable news overall isn't that something bringing in an average of 3.2 million total viewers with 535 000 in the demo so uh boy all their demonizing and boy and for sure there's Tucker Carlson has some views I find odious I totally disagree with how he frames things around immigration and I'm sure there's a few other things I have a probably homelessness and I would love to debate him on that stuff oh yeah the homeless white himself yes so but there's lots of people with lots of egregious views and odious views that are called themselves democrats also right now there's lots of people who call themselves progressives calling smearing workers as white racist supremacists workers who are active who are effectively protesting so there's lots of people who have lots of odious views and most people are not one right so that's the thing about Tucker Carlson is he stands up against imperialism in the war and that's a big deal they don't do that at CNN they don't do that at MSNBC they don't do that at ABC or CBS they don't do that anywhere else on Fox even they only do it at the Tucker Carlson which is why it's such a big deal and now you know uh that their campaign to demonize every one of their political adversaries as a deplorable or as a white supremacist or as a racist is failing it's only winning with the people that they that already think that way uh and they're but they're successfully dividing the country that is happening but people like Tucker Carlson are bringing people together on the left and right populist against war uh we all always reach out to people who are on the populist right because they're for the same things we are they're for ending the wars there's for universal health care they're for education they're for living wage and free speech so that would be there's a lot that's a lot in common right there right i'll probably disagree with them on guns i'll disagree with them on i don't know social security i don't know what else i disagree with them on taxes uh maybe certain regulations who knows climate change i'd probably disagree with them so uh it's a mixed bag kurt go ahead um the most shocking thing to me because the tucker thing doesn't shock because i figured there's got to be at least a portion of democrats who are still anti-war and not it's like a lifestyle brand where you just go along with whatever the party wants but Hannity that's wild like uh do you remember years ago this is last time i like watched Hannity ever but it was during uh you know we were in Iraq and that reporter from the Christian science monitor had been kidnapped a female reporter and she and and Hannity he you know he makes that eagle from the muppet show face of like he goes yes let me tell you anyone that would kidnap a woman that's not a good person and he makes it anyway i feel like wow Hannity standing up what about if you bomb them how about that is it okay to bomb women because we do that all the time i mean just so it was just such a stupid light yes i know hey this is jimmy who's this jimmy this president joe bight oh mr president thanks for calling what's on your mind buddy jimmy right now the white house is working furiously using diplomatic and other channels to de-escalate the situation of Ukraine nobody wants a war least of all the united states really nobody wants a war that's that's what i'm saying i don't know i'm hearing a lot of saber rattling buddy why it's because mr poo is not making this process any easier that's for sure oh really how is that his language the language he's dead he's using utterly unacceptable what are you talking about jimmy didn't you hear the extremely coarse language he used against the president of Ukraine oh no what did he say i'm believable i'll tell you what he said as they quiver with anger and disbelief so in a press conference he was talking about our president salinsky doesn't like aspects of the 2015 mensk agreement and poutin get a load of this goes his voice yes his voice says to me like it or don't like it it's your duty my beauty call him my beauty i got a sit-hand man wait he called zalinsky my beauty that's it jimmy calling another world leader my beauty is the single most aggressive pre-war move since the annexation of us to date and lay in a 1938 by a off-hiller don't you think people are overreacting i mean basically he said i get that you don't like this treaty but sorry sweetie your predecessor signed it is this this distracting from the fact that poutin may have a point is that what this is jimmy i'm gonna agree with cia denier who also does not want war and would do anything to prevent it hey you know there's a lot more to that phone call but we don't have
