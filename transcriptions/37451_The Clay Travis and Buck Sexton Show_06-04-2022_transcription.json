    "text": " you're listening to the fuck Sexton show podcast make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeart Radio app or wherever you get your podcasts team welcome to the freedom hot wednesday april 6th edition of the program we have the left getting very upset over the term grooming being used for those who wish to tell small children about sexual gender identity issues and and all the rest of it this is around the floor to bill what's upsetting left so much about this why does that create so much angst for the democrat party and its partisans the media will discuss that plus we've got everyone ignoring biden when obama shows up at the white house not a surprise the left in a panic over free speech there's a reason for this now that elan mosca said he is not a passive investor of course in twitter and a chinese drone in the sky is telling residents of shanghai to please control their desires for freedom no singing out the window during lockdown i'm sure fauci would be quite proud of what they're accomplishing in china fauci probably sees this and says i wish we had these drones here to prevent the droplet spread in america where no one's really listening as much

slippers do they're fantastic so this media narrative has emerged where it's completely beyond the pale were being told completely unacceptable uh... that there are some in the conservative media who are saying that it seems there's a defense of grooming going on here when it comes to the florida parental rights and education bill which the activists have now dubbed and continue to pretend the name of it is the don't say gay bill it does not mention gay anywhere in the bill there is no a singling out of any sexual identity or uh... or gender identity or any of that any group that you can think of in this context there's no singling out it's just gender identity uh... sexual politics sex talk for small children and i can tell you that this is a remarkable because people that still have some degree of common sense say themselves or hold on i i wasn't taught about transgender ideology that's really what this is about just a world this is about making sure the kids who are kindergarteners think you can be a boy you can be a girl you get to choose that's why this is so upsetting to the left because they've gotten away with this stuff for quite some time now ever since it's been the agenda they go after the most vulnerable the most malleable to suggestion from adults and those in power and this is why there was such a freak out some of you will recall when there was uh... a story i should say a uh... study out of bran university talked about rapid onset gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the term it used to be used for i think i'm a different gender than i am now it's they call a gender affirmation as though just the thought is clear evidence that you are a different gender and can become the different gender remember remember that too it's not just oh this person thinks that they are male when they're actually female or thinks they're female when they're actually male it's they become that and we must treat them as such or else you're a bigot that's the actual ideology of the left including for small children in the by administration recently put out a gender transition guidance uh... document from the white house on how they advocate for children to have uh... chemical castration and and other uh... changes or whatever changes to hormones for kids as if this is uh... anything other than recklessness but people who just look at this with common sense i i didn't have any teachers talking to me about gender identity or transgender issues in kindergarten first grade second grade third grade i think they officially explained in health class and either six or seventh grade some basics of human sexuality as really part of an overall biology lesson that that was just considered normal right so was i missing out was my kindergarten experience lacking somehow because i didn't have employees of the state in the public school system telling me about transgenderism i don't think so of course there was no talk of transgenderism when i was a kid going on anywhere really but here we are uh... this is just a this is from uh... christina poussaint who is ronda santis's press secretary she pulled this together the national interest why republicans are smearing everyone has pedophiles now msnbc gop smears political opponents as pro pedophile the washing post teachers who mention sexuality are quote grooming kids conservatives say uh... vice news conservatives are smearing don't say gay opponents as pedophile groomers uh... against the groomer smir that's from david french of course david french exists for the amusement of the left and the irritation of the right i'm a conservative sure you are buddy uh... here we are see that that's all in the last twenty four hours she shared this that's pretty remarkable to see it and here is actually uh... chris hayes over at msnbc i suppose he has the biggest show over there now that rachel mato doesn't really she's paid thirty million dollars a year to not really do her show so much anymore but here he is republican governor ronda sence's spokesperson gave away the whole game she said the bill that liberals and acryly called don't say gay would be more accurately described as the anti grooming bill quote if you're against the anti grooming bill you're probably a groomer or at least you don't announce the grooming of forty eight year old children's silence is complicit there it is she said the quiet part loud if you don't agree with the bill you are actively cultivating young children to sexually abuse them if you're a democrat you either pedophile or pedophile sympathizer and this rhetoric it's not fringe that the spokesperson ronda santis become omnipresent in right wing media justice past week fox news had a collective meltdown accusing disney of all companies of grooming children okay so let's let's unpack this for a moment first of all notice how he brings in all democrats to this and most of them won't know the difference they'll say oh my gosh i'm being called a pedophile because i'm a democrat that's that's correct which by the way that is crazy of course but that's not what's happening that's actually not what's being said 52 percent of democrats half of democrats in florida support the parental rights and education bill so it's it's not a smear against all democrats that's just not true because she's saying people that have a huge problem with this bill are in favor of certainly a degree of indoctrination of children i mean grooming as in preparation for uh future sexual abuse that is obviously a very very serious charge and she's saying it because somehow it antagonizes the left so very much in this case now perhaps grooming in this context isn't grooming in the way that we come to know it uh generally in the usage of the term it may be more about grooming for future transgender transition so you're preparing you know ideologically you're preparing children for uh for the transition that will occur at a very young age to another gender as part of what is a clear left-wing movement i mean you can see gen z is far and away the most likely to identify uh as as transgender gen z is far and away the most likely to identify as lgbtq plus i i saw some statistics yesterday it said uh i mean i i don't you know what i'm not even going to say with the numbers were because they were so high that i want to check out at some more but uh by polling we do know that gen z much more so than millennials and millennials much more so than the generations preceding them are identifying in this way so maybe i i could see people saying that indoctrination is a more a more clear term or a more precise term in this context than the usage of the term grooming but then i would want to ask why does that that term upset the left so much they call republicans nazis white supremacists fascist they use the worst terms imaginable they call donald trump a traitor they they they said they believed that he was a rapist even so the most horrible things they said that uh that bret kavanagh was now supreme court justice kavanagh was a gang rapist i mean they'll say anything and now they want us to be more delicate in our language on the right that's that's an interesting ask i mean i'll i'll do honest analysis of the terminology here for you but i have to one as as i have i have to wonder why does it upset them so much uh why is it that when people on the right say hey just don't talk to kids about sex until the third grade in public school as a state employee people on the left are coming out and saying why are you so anti-gay that no one said anything about gay so why is the left bringing that into the conversation now in part it could just be because they know how to mobilize the gay and lesbian activist community and so they just want to bring them into this but conservatives the right ronda santis the republican state legislature in florida does in fact not say gay in the bill it's not that they won't allow people to say gay they don't even mention gay in the bill and yet that's become such a huge part of the conversation could be just dishonesty from the left about this and in terms of a political mobilization but you also wonder that that seems uh like quite an odd move quite an odd decision for the left to say well if you're objecting to the teaching of gender identity to small children five six-year-olds five and six-year-olds folks by state employees this is not about you know the free speech of parents or how they're going to speak to their own children you know about the the birds and the bees and such at home uh why is the left bringing the gay and lesbian community into this i think that's a a question that's at least worth asking and why did it why does the democrat apparatus get so upset about the usage of this term grooming if it was a baseless smear then what what's so upsetting they baselessly smear the right all the time they say things about how we're racist we're white supremacists we're white nationalists we're you know by the way even if you're black or Hispanic you're still part of the white nationalist or white supremacist GOP if you're a republican right you've just internalized those that this is what the left actually says that that is a constant and if you want an example of them saying this i remember there was that article about uh my friend Larry Elder out in california where i believe it was a san francisco chronicle published a piece saying that he was the blackface of white supremacy so i'm not exaggerating their point of view that is actually what the left says it doesn't matter actually what your race is if you are a conservative if you oppose the left if you oppose the progressive authoritarianism that has been running a muck in this country for a long time uh you are a part of a white supremacist movement and in the GOP or you know or white nationalist whatever so they say this stuff all the time and now we're all supposed to be so worried about the specificity of language and whether it offends them hmm maybe some of the writers using the language specifically because they wanted to why it is so offensive if it was so absurd why does it offend people on the left so much i do think there's ideological and i know there's ideological indoctrination that is very important to left-wing activist groups and they want to make this for children i a close i'll even say a close friend of mine just sent me yesterday in the library near her home mere blocks from where i live there was a there was a thing for drag queen drag queen story hour for kindergartners this just happened she sent me the photo i have it on my phone drag queen story hour for kindergartners really uh what's that all about oh what's what's the purpose of having that exactly and this is this is real this is out there we see it Disney has top executive saying oh we have to be having uh we have to have more trans characters and non-gender binary characters in cartoons for kids you see the left has been exposed here and that's why there's a fury they're they're they're fighting this with all that with all they've got but what's really going on what they're really saying let's talk about free speech here elon moss taking a big stake in in twitcher i keep wanting to say tesla but obviously he's the founder of tesla big stake in twitter and the left is so upset we'll get into this in a second four deputy us marshals who deployed under president trump to protect and defend at federal courthouse in portland during the riots of 2020 are being sued by the aclu the department of justice under the by administration will not agree to provide an attorney to defend them from these outrageous allegations these brave officers with stood-harmed repelling rioters you remember the images salt's fires flying objects noxious chemicals and explosive devices with a liberal media on the offensive against the police learn about these family men with stellar service to country at police defense dot org the law enforcement legal defense fund at police defense dot org educates the public on the risks and threats associated with being an officer today and raises funds to alleviate financial burdens in this case hundreds of thousands in mounting legal fees and at risk of losing their homes help these officers today donate at police defense dot org that's police defense dot org so why is the left i mean this is just some quick thoughts on this why is the left so upset about elan must taking a stake in twitter well what's the big problem here right i mean elan musk is a visionary very smart guy it's a private company twitter can do what it wants well let's see what it wants to do now now that he's spent billions of dollars to buy in and could spend billions more with the snap of his fingers there's only one reason the left is in a panic over all this and it's because uh the left has ideas that are indefensible and in public when exposed to public view we were just talking about transgender ideology for children and the uh the white house supporting we're talking about 12 year olds now let's let's have the removal of of of the you know male body parts to transition to female at 12 years old the white house supports this let's have the uh the usage of of chemicals to try to change one's hormonal balance to make one more female or more male and age 13 white house supports this joe biden's white house supports this should be very clear now when people find out about this they do not actually supported by majority the american people say what the heck is going on here and the left is so upset about twitter because they've gotten used to having their hand on the scale of free speech in the marketplace of ideas of suppression of shadow banning of all of these things they have gotten used to it because their ideas are crappy in a lot of cases indefensible and absurd i mean you take the the idea of and there's so many things by the way that we could go into but when the american people see lea thomas competing in the nc double a championships for example just to stay on this topic there are many others we could point to they see a six foot three male with male genitalia being uh awarded a gold medal as the best nc double a 500 meter freestyle swimmer they know that's crazy they know that's not right they know that is unjust so twitter wants to shut it down that's why you can't call rachel lavin a man twitter says you can't do that but it's true but you can't do it that's the only way they can continue some of the propaganda that's the only way some of these arguments can be sustained shutting down opposing voices and they know it but they should be excited about this prospect oh yeah they they want to take more of a public shot at the right on twitter no they they don't want to actually tangle with us in a public forum where their ideas where their words get exposed to the to a full and fair hearing where people can actually share and comment freely without suppression which happens all the time i i mentioned i lost 150 000 twitter followers after the 2020 election just gone booted for a whole variety people say oh they're bots uh they weren't actually bots there are people who were booted off of twitter for saying stuff they weren't allowed to say so and i wasn't the only one i have other friends who lost you know 100 000 200 000 that's how twitter plays the game this is what goes on and when you make an argument that they don't like they shut you down you'll still get dragged as a conservator you have people making death threats to you all kinds of stuff as a conservative twitter won't do a damn thing you say rachel lavin is a man which rachel lavin is unacceptable lock your account bend the knee or else there are arguments are indefensible which is why they're so worried that they actually may have to try to defend them now which is why the twitter issue upsets them uh so very much look the world is unstable these days crazy place there are more and more examples of governments worldwide reaching for the income and savings of private citizens you know they always talk about this at some of these financial conferences i go to they'll say you know if government gets really desperate you know what they go for whatever 401k you got in the bank right that that's one thing they could do they could seize or tax 401ks before you actually even have access to them so how can you prepare for this uncertain future real gold and silver real gold and silver you can actually hold in your possession you can purchase it and have it at home look this is the way to do it real gold and silver you can also have it in your retirement accounts as a way of preserving your wealth even when the dollar is under all the pressure that we've seen call the oxford gold group today request your free precious metals investment guide all you have to do to get real gold you can hold in your ira or in your hands is call the oxford gold group you just take your cell phone out you dial pound 250 on your cell phone and say the keywords gold ira you'll receive your precious metals investment guide directly to your phone and get all your questions answered with one call to oxford gold simply dial pound 250 that's pound 250 say the keywords gold ira pound 250 say the keywords gold ira so there there's i mean this was just remarkable to me i wanted by the way you probably saw yesterday joe biden wandering around the white house and everyone all the democrats just flocking to obama oh my gosh obama's here you know it was like well i mean obama is a celebrity and they get excited they all know joe biden is doddering around the whole thing is a joke they still love obama so much the most powerful brand of the democrat party but it was it was a it was it was kind of funny it was also kind of sad though to watch joe biden kind of shifting around and looking confused and the whole thing you know it's like this guy come on man why why the come on man yeah no it's not it's not time for joe to be running the country man it's time for him no joke maybe take a nap you know long long nap in the afternoon every day go feed the ducks man no joke take some crumbs the crumbs feed the ducks that's what joe should be up to instead he's running the country it's just not right it's just not right but that's what the democrats are pulling through just one more thing here there's a video of it i actually don't think we don't have the drone video in china do it's it's it's in chinese so you can imagine what you know it doesn't it doesn't but it's a it's a a drone in the sky flying around shouting at chinese people in shanghai who are singing out their windows and also chanting out their windows that they want to be able to leave there they're on full on lockdown in china doesn't work folks by the way virus is still there when the lockdown doesn't work we've learned this china doesn't care they love this control the chinese communist party i think this is great they have drones flying through the sky telling people to please curb your desire for freedom i mean that's actually the translations curb your desire for for freedom control your i'm sorry control your soul's desire for freedom please comply with covid restrictions and as these drones are flying around the sky in shanghai two years into this all i can tell you is the fauci is sitting at home watching this video saying i wish we could do that it'd be so much better but not yet in america friends not yet that's it for the bucks x and show thanks for hanging please give a review on apple podcast of the podcast it's a good way to get things moving there talk to you tomorrow shields high"
