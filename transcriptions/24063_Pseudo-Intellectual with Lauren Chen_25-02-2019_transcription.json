    "text": " Tonight, the latest way the far left has given the middle finger to science in the name of ideology. I'm roaming millennial and you're watching Uncensored. Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Did you know that there is apparently such a thing as a biologically female penis? And now I'm not saying a penis that happens to identify as female. I mean a full-on, biological, anatomically correct female penis. Yep, that is a thing and you are a bigot if you disagree, at least according to trans actress India Moore. In a series of tweets, the actress who stars in the series Pose wrote that, trans women are biological women. Gender slash sex cannot be biologically defined in absolutes because gender is biologically spectral. And a few days later she followed up with another tweet that said, if trans women are biological women, by definition a trans woman's penis is a biologically female penis. That's a radical point missing in mainstream discussions on trans bodies as trans women are often made to feel ashamed of their genitals if they don't have a vagina. You can argue that gender is an infinite spectrum with a billion and one plus different genders and people can choose whatever gender they are based on what they feel and they can go back and forth and make me choose multiple genders. You, that's fine, you'd be wrong but you can argue that. But when it comes to biology and sex, and I don't mean gender, I mean sex, that's an area that's really not up for your personal opinion and interpretation. These are the male sex organ vaginas are the female sex organ. That's just how it is. Sometimes genetic abnormalities might occur in intersex conditions where you get something like hermaphrodites or a micro penis. That's actually by the way, like a legitimate condition. It's called micro penis. I'm not just, I'm not just being mean. Yes, those conditions occur. They are real, but overall people are either male or female and to anybody who might be thinking, well, if you just admitted that there are exceptions to the male female thing, how can you say that biological sex is a binary, me, me, me, me, me, me. Look, physical deformities to genitalia or chromosomes existing doesn't mean that there really has ever been a person who is neither male or female. Someone with a micro penis still has a penis, okay, they're male. And in the very rare case of true hermaphrodites that someone who is born with sets of both complete ovaries and testes, there are still other sex characteristics besides genitalia that allow them to be identified as either male or female. Next story, sure, what I'm trying to say is that biologically female and penis, just the tooth, no, no. And although we might be tempted to dismiss these tweets as just the crazy ramblings of some celebrity, the idea that biological sex doesn't exist, or at least is not a binary or is perhaps fluid, that's something that the progressive left has been trying to push for a while now. In fact, the first time I ever heard of it was during a debate on one of Jordan Peterson's first ever televised appearances. It's not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex and I'm a historian of medicine, I can unpack that for you at great length if you want, but in the interest of time I won't. So that's a very popular misconception. So essentially when in my transgender studies classes, what we're doing is looking at actual research and identifying ways that current social issues related to trans people or things that are associated with trans such as free speech arguments and claims, how that connects to the way that people are thinking, the way that research has been framed, the history of the society. Give us some of the other pronouns that one would hear, typically. I don't focus on pronouns because pronouns are actually part of a cis-normative culture. So what we do is learn about... I'm going to stop you right there. Yeah, I was just about to explain. So we don't start from a cis-normative perspective because that can't actually go very far. What does cis-normative mean? So I'm going to start us there. Cis-normative is basically the very popular idea and assumption that most people probably have and definitely that our structures convey that there is such a thing as male and female, that they connect to being a girl or a boy or a man or a woman. And then sometimes that will also recognize intersex or trans people or transsexual people as you mentioned because that's sometimes also referred to as a gender binary. So anything that fits within a gender binary can work within cis-normativity. But cis-normativity is basically that everyone assumes that there is male and female and so very little is actually looked at to understand what's actually the case. The person that Dr. Peterson was debating had some ideas that at the time were very foreign to me. And since I saw that piece a few years ago, I feel like that attack on biological sex has just gotten more and more ramped up. So regarding India Moore's tweets, no, she's not the only person that believes this. And actually when she said those things, a lot of left-wing publications came out in support of her. Writing on her tweets, the site Pink News wrote that quote, India Moore destroys anti-trans haters. And that during her pro-trans crusade Moore also took the time to lash out at haters who tried to argue with her. The star compared those who looked down on gender non-conforming people to racists. She tweeted, cis people characterizing gender variant traits as abnormal is synonymous to white people saying melanin is abnormal or melanated people saying that the absence of melanin is abnormal. Moore effort to delegitimize the biology of trans people is inherently narcissistic. Moore also said that cisgender people quote stole and appropriated the word biological. A couple of things to unpack their number one, it is completely incorrect and biologically nonsense to try and compare the issue of race to transgenderism. There is no normal or correct race. Race is simply a collection of genetic traits that are passed down to us from our parents. There is no default race. Women being born black instead of Hispanic is not a genetic abnormality, it just means that their parents were black instead of Hispanic. But when it comes to transgenderism, look, I do not hate trans people, but at the same time it is an abnormality and I say that with absolutely no moral judgment just like depression or anxiety or down syndrome are also abnormalities. And even if we are to accept the idea that the brains of trans people really are different than the brains of cisgendered people. But for example, if you are a trans woman, your brain is more similar to a cisgendered females brain than a cisgendered males brain. That body brain dissonance is what some people argue is the neurological cause for transgenderism. From what I've seen though, the results on that are mixed and I do think we need more research, but whatever, even if we do accept that premise, a trans woman's penis is still not biologically female. In fact, what makes a trans woman trans specifically is that she is biologically male and has a male penis. And the only type of penis that exists. And look, I get it for a lot of people when it comes to the trans community and maybe trans women specifically, they want to do whatever they can to assure them that no, no, you are a real woman in every way that matters. You want to be tolerant, you don't want to alienate anyone, you want to be empathetic. Those are all good traits, but they still don't erase the existence of basic biology. And I think the reason why this push against biology is happening is that no matter how you slice it, if biological sex is a reality, which it is, then trans women will always be different than cis-chended women. They just will and I'm not saying that trans women are evil or anything like that, but they are not biological women. They cannot have periods, they cannot have babies, they don't have uteruses. And I actually tweeted about the story on my account the other day and I was really surprised by the replies that I got. What I said in response to this story was the rhetorical question and they say the right is the side that's anti-science and not only were there a lot of people insisting that no, no, the statement on women's penises was correct. Seriously, that opinion is just not as fringe as you would hope. But there are also a lot of people who are insisting no, no, even with the biologically female penises, the right is still the side against science. Look, I'm not going to say that there aren't some people on the right who do hold ideas that conflict with science because they're absolutely are. But as long as left-wing publications want to talk about things like biologically female penises, then no, you do not get to call the right the side that is against science. If anything, we're all a little bit against science. And with that in mind, here are some other stories where the progressive left has absolutely spat in the face of science. Last year from The Washington Post, we have the article, the Trump administration says it wants to define sex, quote, on a biological basis. It gets the science wrong. As Molly Woodstock, who, of course, is a journalist and gender educator writes, A little over a week ago, the news broke that the Trump administration may attempt to redefine gender. A recent Department of Health and Human Services memo proposed that the federal government legally define both gender and sex as, quote, either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with. Anyone who wished to dispute the sex marked on their birth certificate would need to provide genetic proof of their claims. This development was terrifying and bizarre. Such a policy would go against everything we have come to understand about gender and how it is defined by social and cultural factors rather than biological traits. And in a country where thousands of transgender individuals have undergone surgeries such as vaginal plastic and falloplasty, it makes no sense to declare even biological sex, let alone gender identity, to be immutable and based on genitalia at birth. So to start off, what's factually incorrect about that piece is that the Trump administration wasn't trying to define gender, they really were trying to address the issue of sex. And as these people for so long tried to insist, gender is in fact different than sex. Transgender people may try to change their gender, but they will never be able to change their sex. Our sex is hardwired into us, in our chromosomes, our DNA. You can try to go against that, but you'd be going against science. And in another middle finger to basic biology, earlier this month, Fox News reported that Representative Elon Omar asks Minnesota Attorney General to investigate USA powerlifting for barring trans athletes. According to the article, quote, \"...USA powerlifting said the organization is not a fit for every athlete and for every medical condition or situation,\" and added that following the medical policies adopted by the International Powerlifting Federation, it does not permit the use of testosterone or other androgens commonly used to assist in transition from female to male. USA powerlifting said the decision was made in part due to the potential advantage in strength sports that men generally have over women. If you're not familiar with the story, all of that is basically talking about how USA powerlifting essentially banned trans athletes from competing in their events. And that decision came after months of male to female athletes just dominating cis-gendered women in sports competitions. When that decision was announced, a lot of progressive activists took issue with it because it once again reminded people that trans women are indeed biologically different from cis-gendered women. And like the headline mentioned, Representative Omar from Minnesota was especially infuriated by the decision and decided to write the organization about it. In her letter, she wrote, \"...I urge you to reconsider this discriminatory unscientific policy and follow the example of the International Olympic Committee. The myth that trans women have a direct competitive advantage is not supported by medical sciences and it continues to stoke fear and violence against one of the most at-risk communities in the world.\" Nope. Just because it would satisfy your ideology for medicine to say that trans women are exactly the same as cis-gendered women, that doesn't mean it's the case. If you are a trans woman who is going to the doctor for whatever reason, you should very much let them know that you are in fact trans. And to anyone who might say, yeah, trans women are biologically male, but why make such a big deal out of it, well, this is why. We now have stories like a poor esthetician being sued because she did not want to wax the male genitalia of a trans woman. And on a much more serious note, trans prisoners being sent to female prisons, then sexually assaulting fellow inmates. And of course, there is the good old pumping children full of hormones because they identify as trans since to hell with biology anyway. So yeah, I really don't know what else there is to say about that and sure, the left can complain that a select few people on the right don't believe in evolution or whatever it is, but hey, at least we're not the one sterilizing children. But that's it for now, thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time."
