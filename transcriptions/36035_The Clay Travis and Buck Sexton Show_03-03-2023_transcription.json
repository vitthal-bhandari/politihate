I know again a lot of you are gonna be going maybe places for spring break next week buck I'm out of here first time ever to Italy. I'm taking the whole family Everybody's got the kids have all got the same spring break. We are taking off a week from today. I cannot wait Florence Rome and Naples never been to Italy at all And I can't wait, but I know a lot of people are gonna be on the road I might listen to you a little bit if I'm on a long train ride or something see what's going on I'm gonna try to dial out a little bit not like you on the honeymoon But but I'm gonna try not to not to be as active clay has told me no keg parties guys while he's gone That we are we are not to he's left me some he left me a $20 bill for for pizza And I'm supposed to take the cats out so no no That's how we treat the boys by the way now You know I don't know what the appropriate age is where you can rely on your kids to kind of watch the other kids But we've got a 15 year old now say hey, we're gonna order some pizza Mom and dad are gonna go just a couple miles down the road go out for dinner. Don't burn the place down Call us From your iPads if brother fights begin and we need to you know sort of figure out who's still in charge But but yeah, I can't wait. I'm super excited for this trip to it all we're all looking forward to seeing photos of you unlike you know a turquoise Vespa drinking it has to be a tiny little espresso like and like the little The little cup that it's in must be so small you can barely fit it between your thumb and your pinky finger Yes, you have to say chow when you drink it by the way, that's how you are on Now white lotus season two which is immediately what that makes me think of for anybody out there who has watched that White lotus season one or season two season two is set in Sicily Which is it's a really fun show for couples out there in particular Would you agree like if you got a girlfriend situation? I saw white lotus season one which is the at the four seasons in Hawaii? Right after we got back from being in I stayed in the st. Regis in Bora Bora if anyone's well big timer Yeah, it was not well, you know, I mean it was nice So I've just it was a honeymoon So if anybody ever wants to head over to that part of world is very very nice highly highly recommend But the four seasons in Hawaii is now incredibly booked up I can't get in understand and the same thing for the four seasons now in in Sicily So highly highly, you know, I want to go check it. I've never been to Sicily I've been to Italy and I will say you're gonna have a fantastic time it is generally in surveys they do of Americans for Favorite food and favorite European country to visit it's number one globally for food Outside of the US and it's the number one European country France is amazing, but you know French people that's the problem alright speaking of Being amazing California geographically is amazing California under Gavin Newsom is awful and I can't believe so for people out there who haven't been paying attention And there might be a lot of them California right now is facing at least a $20 billion budget deficit for their state Maybe as high as 30 billion depending on the estimates that you hear out there yet every time I see Gavin Newsom He is going after Ron DeSantis. He's going after Greg Abbott in Texas and he came after my state On something and I looked at it and I thought to myself This is something that I'm glad the state of Tennessee is doing so Gavin Newsom I think early this morning or late last night sent out a tweet and said so Tennessee has signed a law Governor Billy right here in my home state of Tennessee Signed a law saying basically kids can't attend drag shows Buck this this does not seem like a very difficult decision to make if you are familiar at all with these drag show Outfits these basically are stripper outfits people are parading around there in thongs. They're in high heels They are in you know All sorts of crazy outfits and if you take it outside of the drag show scenario and you took a six or seven year Old or even younger a little bit older or whatever it is if I took my eight year old to a heterosexual Show that is the same as this drag show I I feel like the state would potentially come and take my kids away from me So if you want to go to a drag show and you are 18 years old and you think it's fun Go for it, right? But the idea of minors attending these drag shows is crazy So Tennessee basically just passed a law and said minors can't have drag shows right? We're not gonna have drag shows in elementary schools. We're not gonna have drag shows at breakfast spots It's not allowed under state law Gavin Newsom fired back. I agree with that state law It doesn't seem remotely controversial to me Gavin Newsom fired back and said Tennessee has the eight highest murder rate in the nation It ranks 44th among states for health outcomes and this is what the governor is focused on And I have to be honest What is Gavin Newsom focused on because I actually agree with what my governor is focused on and I would also add on top of that buck We we've had this conversation, but I just think it bears repeating people are moving to Tennessee, Texas and Florida Many other states in the southeast but those three in particular because there's a zero percent state income tax Californians are looking around and those that are flexible and able to move are saying why would I be paying 13% state income tax? Having to deal with this nincompoop is my governor who consistently is attacking states where people are leaving California to move to Whenever I'm I mean I stayed overnight in California on the way back from honeymoon and I saw some friends some California based friends there and in the last Certainly last six or seven years in LA I mean I I used to think going out to LA was awesome You know and we've talked this before you and I both grew up and for the people listening to this anybody aged I'd say you know call it roughly 30 to 15 80 30 to 60 The things that California when when we were young It was the the promised land of America and you promise and specifically Los Angeles Yes, like there was nothing cooler than LA and you know All the movies were based out there and all the studios and the celebrities and everything else and now I speak to California And you know what they're saying I got to get out of here I just got to find a way to sell my house I got to get out of here I've just got to find a way to move my job or to get another job and this is why these processes take time There is no end in sight to the flight from California specifically for a lot of people Because unless you're already so wealthy that you don't care what the tax rate is or you're so dependent on the large S of the state that taxes aren't even really something you think about you want to get out of there Because it's not only at high tax rate But as I said about the Nordic countries versus what you're seeing in in some of the US states You're not getting any value for this things are getting worse from a public services perspective things are getting worse from a government administration perspective and You know, I just think that increasingly it's remember how we discussed the the the level required to get change for Democrats It's more pain than what you would think a normal person would would would need California's gonna get there. It's gonna get there. I mean financially It's certainly gonna get there with the current trajectory and you know, this is all part of the process This is what happens and I want to mention again what he's attacking Tennessee for buck this drag show thing I would even say it's Friday 800-282-2882 If you're a parent like I'm a parent buck you're not a parent yet, but I I don't Understand how any parent thinks it's normal for a person who is dressed scandalously right like basically dress like a stripper to be grinding around on sometimes a Pole other times just walking around on a stage basically doing a stripper like performance I don't understand remotely how this makes sense for anyone to be doing right? I would wonder it's crazy, you know, if any of your any of your you know male friends Told you hey, I'm gonna take my Three-year-old to a strip club, but don't worry. They're gonna be wearing pasties. Yeah, right? Which is basically the same level of dress that we're talking about here I mean when you see these videos lives of tiktok Hia is doing incredible work. It's actually so gross that I would feel weird Sharing the lives of tiktok video with some of my family members. You know, I mean like yeah It's like it's so it's so over the line. You're like I don't even want to be saying hey Did you see this this is the gross stuff that they're doing? Nobody would nobody you know or I know would would justify no, you know normal American male dad or dad Would say yeah, I'm taking my three-year-old to a strip club. That seems cool, right? You would say you need help there's something wrong with you. Yes, and they'll probably be criminal You what's crazy rested what's crazy is? The parents that are at these events that are cheering yay Yeah, some 40 year old man with the hairy behind is shaking it in my child's face They think that's okay. It's crazy. I don't I don't there are some things where I look at it And I think okay, you know, I might not do that as a parent, but I can understand why another parent would do it This is one that I see and I just I don't understand how anyone with a minor child Your point is a good one if you took a and I don't think it's three-year-old I mean let's say I took my 12 year old to a To a strip club, but the women kept pasties on They wouldn't let him in right or I mean like that They would you have to show an ID to get in and if I did get him in and somebody somehow found out that I did it I would probably get charged with a crime like that would be child endangerment on some level I mean I really if you really break this down into its component parts and look this is uncomfortable But as you all know they double down and triple down on this I mean gab the governor of the biggest state in the country is is effectively coming out in favor of drag shows for small children He's attacking my home state of Tennessee for saying we can't do this you can't do that so Gavin Newsom who thinks maybe he's gonna be president one day and Is the governor of the state that's actually the fifth largest economy by itself in the world if it were a country and Is the most prominent Democrat really in the country right now? I think after you know the president if You know if you break this down into its component parts what he's telling you is that a Man dressed up as a woman and overwhelmingly the men who do this are you know LGBTQ plus in some capacity a Man doing that in front of a small child There's a different standard of sexual deviancy than if an adult female Stripper or you know exotic dancer or whatever did this in front of a small child base, you know based on what yeah What are these different? It's a fabulous question. That's why I don't see it even as remotely complicated For a parent to be making this decision. I mean so let's be out You know when you talk about abuse that occurs of children it is you know abuse of a sexual nature it is overwhelmingly Male yes men who do this it's not women. I mean it does occasionally you'll see some of these stories But generally speaking it's men who do this but the standard for men is a much more lax standard in front of these children Because the men are wearing thongs and fishnet stockings yeah Have I told you buck maybe bring it up when I came back about one of the fights wife and I got into we were at a Resort and we had babysitter a babysitter kind of watch I've already learned play she was right now I say this is this is why she's right. That's how it goes when we come back buck I'm going to tell you the one thing I've been right about in nearly 20 years of marriage There's a hell of a tease for you, you know all about how woke activist sees control of America's schools now a group of investment firms That Americans in trust with our pensions and retirements are playing woke politics with your money without our knowledge or consent a few Large investment firms names you know that control trillions of dollars of your money are using those dollars to advance their Wokey ideology through a progressive social scoring program called ESG they claim it promotes corporate Responsibility what they're really doing is using Americans hard-earned money to finance their political agenda forcing businesses to comply or else Some state leaders are fighting back and more are joining letting those investment firms know they can't play politics with our pensions They can't either do their jobs maximize returns for shareholders or get lost to learn more go to consumers research Dot org they've been defending consumers against fraud and abuse for decades still are go to consumers research Dot org to learn more about their mission to protect consumers from woke investment firms.

That's t the number two t org Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us Only guests this Friday Congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin chairman of the select committee on the Chinese Communist Party also Member of the house armed services and intelligence committees he served for seven years on active duty in the United States Marine Corps Including two deployments in Iraq all of that is impressive You represent Green Bay, Wisconsin biggest question for you. What in the world is Aaron Rodgers gonna do? I'm envious of this darkness or treat I can use that after a week a week in Congress to be nice to tune out all of the the light and just go into the Dark but I don't know I mean if you want to come back as respect is coming back But you hear all sorts of rumors online. You probably have more intel on this than I do, Clay Okay, so and I ran into you by the way in the Fox News lobby and we were talking about the the Aaron Rodgers situation I think he was in the middle of the darkness or treat I don't even know if Buck even knows Aaron Rodgers went buck for three days I think it was to a place of total darkness You could not see anything in an effort to try to get in touch with his inner thoughts and make decisions about his life He's an interesting dude But congressman you guys are finally putting the screws to China and thank you for the work that you're doing one of the things that's most impressive I would say is It does feel like there's suddenly some bipartisan momentum to try to stand up to China What's the goal of your committee hearings and do you feel that momentum in terms of? Finally standing up to China. Maybe they're starting to be some momentum there You know I do feel like one of the most remarkable and underreported stories of the last six years has been that even The biggest critics of the Trump administration on the left Haven't dismantled or disagreed with the core tenants of the massive shift we've made on China during the Trump administration I mean this was the biggest shift in US war policy since the end of the Cold War and though Republicans and Democrats have some meaningful disagreements We're just not going back to the status quo before that now a lot of that is because of the threatening behavior We've seen out of General Secretary Xi Jinping himself It's as if for the people on Wall Street or K Street or in the Sea Suite of major fortune 500 companies in America We definitely want to go back to the old world in which we just seek profit from China and ignore the threatening behavior Xi Jinping won't let them do that so I do think that's important now The goal of our committee is to build off that bipartisan foundation and advanced meaningful Policy and legislation in this Congress that helps us better defend our sovereignty From CCP aggression which gets to the second goal is to communicate to our colleagues and the American people Why this matters? Why should anybody care about the threat posed by the CCP? And I would argue this isn't a distant over their threat It's not about some obscure territorial claim in the South and East China Seas It is a right here at home threat and I'm not just talking about a Chinese Bible wound after I bumped into you in New York We went to the site of an illegal CCP police station in the heart of Manhattan in Chinatown It was being used to harass and surveil Chinese dissidents on American soil Chinese students we went up to a group of with to meet with a group of students at Columbia They've been harassed and physically assaulted by CCP sympathizers So this is a global competition and it's a matter of defending our sovereignty from a hostile genocidal Communist regime speaking to Congress in my Gallagher of Wisconsin Congressmen what We it seems like we've gotten to a place where the understanding of the threat China poses is certainly much more widespread than it was before Trump for example and you rightly point out that a lot of What Trump tried to do in reorienting? US policy vis-a-vis China has been continued by the Biden administration in some ways at least on trade What does doing the right things to deal with the threat of China look like? What are the things we're supposed to do it's one thing to understand the problem. What do we do about the problem? I? Think the most important thing if we want to prevent World War three if we want to deter aggression is to put hard power in Xi Jinping's path before he is tempted to try and invade Taiwan by force I think that's the biggest lesson of the failure of deterrence in Ukraine where we signaled weakness repeatedly and of course We signal weakness in Afghanistan and Vladimir Putin thought he could take advantage of us and invaded the country and the cost has been Enormous in terms of blood and treasure. We don't want to see a similar collapse of deterrence in East Asia Therefore, we must arm Taiwan to the teeth before it's too late. That's sort of the hard power line of effort There's other things we need to do to modernize and dewoke our own military so that our enemies fear us And they don't think they can take advantage of us, but I'll leave that that for now But secondly in terms of economic competition We are going to have to wean ourselves off of our dependence on China in key areas Think advanced pharmaceutical ingredients think rare earths think microelectronics We just can't allow them to hold us hostage economically because that completely undermines our military deterrent But part of that is we need to reverse our disastrous energy policy Which is really a gift to Xi Jinping and that's really a fault line between the parties by the bipartisanship our friends on the left Simply have a nonsensical energy policy Finally when it comes to ideological competition, we have to look internally at the way in which they've used their economic Leverage in order to infiltrate American universities in order to infiltrate nonprofits in order to Silence certain major companies in America into you know taking a knee for Xi Jinping We've seen it happen in the sports world as Clay knows well particularly pronounced in the NBA We want American companies to start standing up for American values That means we need to understand the nature of something called CCP united front work, which is their magic weapon It's a combination of espionage and influence operations that they use to divide us and convince us to destroy ourselves We're talking to we're talking to congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin What do you think we would do if China invades Taiwan and what do you think we should do? I? Think it depends on whether American lives were lost in the initial salvo certainly every war game I've played and I played about 10 involved enormous destruction to our Infrastructure domestically as well as lost of American life And I think even a reluctant president would have to respond in that case if they pursue something more Grey zone like a blockade an economic blockade or if they just confined conflict directly to Taiwan and try and avoid Attacking us or Japan it might be the case and particularly if they weaponize supply chain that This president decides not to do anything because here's the thing imagine or look back to the early stage of the pandemic The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off the export of pharmaceutical ingredients to plunge us into a sea of coronavirus With the phrase that they use imagine we get into a conflict over Taiwan and all of a sudden Americans act that the life-saving drugs Was compromised. I just don't know how the American people respond in that case all the more reason why we should be putting all of our energy and effort Into deterring a conflict in the first place. We want Xi Jinping to wake up every single day look across the strait and conclude I just can't do it. It's not possible today is not the day because a conflict would be very costly we would quickly accumulate casualties well beyond we accumulated in 20 years of a global war on terrorism and Right now our military is going through a readiness crisis And so we're simply not moving with the requisite sense of urgency not only to arms I want to the teeth but modernize our own weapon systems and prioritize war fighting over more bureaucratic or woke initiatives Congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin. Thank you so much for all the work you're doing on China. We'll get you on again and Keep the pressure up Thank you guys.

We're gonna be talking about Hershey's Chocolate company or Hershey's corporation best known for making chocolate.

So I want you to stick around with us because you're gonna it's it's pretty amazing her She is the name of the campaign, but the person who is the her she is a man So we will discuss this in greater detail coming up a trans Woman is the the designation that I think the media would like us to use we have a bunch of calls though and oh oh Okay, here we go people I knew clay people I said I said I knew that a lot of people don't away in we are being deloosed with the reaction This is years ago when my two young two oldest were about four and two years old I said absolutely not to a male babysitter sent him out and had them send me back a female babysitter college age Didn't regret it for one instant a lot of people are weighing in We have let's start with Carolyn in Arizona. What's going on Carolyn? Hey, we had a lot of snow here yesterday, but it's all gone now except in the mountains That's crazy weather lots of places for the last several days. Yeah, Hollywood sign has gotten snow twice which has not happened I think ever before yeah Yes, it's beautiful and sunny here today about 50 some some degrees, but it's beautiful. We love it here All right, Carolyn what else because I would not let a male babysitter take care of my little boys. There's no way You're with me like you if you I thought I was being pranked. Thank you for the call Carolyn love Arizona I thought I was being pranked Buck. I mean I legitimately thought that when when the guy walked in I thought I was like looking around like okay, what else is going on here and I thought it was like not even remotely difficult Mike in upstate New York. What do you think? Mike How's it going? We're great. You called us fire away Okay long time listener Start with the Russell and boss show and I listen you guys every week. We appreciate that I When I was younger watch some relatives kids Watch some friends kids when I was younger. I'm 66 and right now I can tell you if a guy came in to watch my kids. I would not let them do it. Yeah, I do think I think we're establishing There's a there's a different rule here. Thank you for calling in Mike a different rule for family member First of all obviously like older brother little brother things like that. That's that's different right? That's family trust your family with your life But and maybe if you already know the person, you know So like for example clay in that situation if from your neighborhood Let's say there was a you know an 18 You're like a senior in high school again But you know you knew him he was on the lacrosse team He had a pretty girlfriend that you knew as well Would you feel you know comfortable with him being the babysitter? More so I would still always prefer a girl gotcha I want his girlfriend to think I'd rather have his girlfriend watch the kids than him I just I think first of all teenage boys are a mess anyway Doesn't mean that some of them can't be great babysitters But if I knew them I would feel way more comfortable with it But yeah strange again I'm saying like instantaneously Guy walks in I'm like you're out. I want college girl watching these guys Robert in Haggers town Maryland what you got for us? Hey guys appreciate you. Yes. I'm an agreement 100% no way I'm a father of two of a boy and a girl and it would be a girl babysitter only Just only the odds are in your favor. There's no Right watch my kids. Thank you Robert producer Ali has anyone has anyone called in who? Disagrees vehemently with clay on this one and I'm feeling like not one Wow everyone's with you clay Everyone's with you get a hundred percent agreement on anything like not one person has emailed tweeted DM'd or called the show Disagreeing with this call I said to the one thing I'm very confident about that my wife wouldn't have done in 19 years Boom. I'm out. I should also mention this was around the time even I think I would have done it anyway This was also around the time that all the Jerry Sandusky Penn State like Awful sexual assault stories were in the news there So I was even more probably conscious about the risk factors of men and young boys and young kids in general Then I would have been otherwise but again, I think the safest give me a college age 16, you know, junior senior in high school 16 to 22 Girl, I'm 100% away this this this young man Did you send him away with like a 20 and a sorry? It's not gonna give him any money I said no, I want you to leave and bring back a girl Wow, I Mean it was it was very decisive and I don't know if my wife is where she's running around right now But she was and like her jaw dropped he left immediately Do you think that if we could get the second gentleman Doug Emhoff on right now? Would he say that you were engaging in toxic masculinity? He might this might have been toxic masculinity on my on my behalf But I will I will sign up for toxic masculinity if it means that my kids are a little bit safer than they would be if I were Embracing this this beta male status of our first gentleman or second gentleman Yeah, no, it's it's very very I'm I gotta say you got everybody Everybody lined up on to so apparently look when you get the key master and of gozer together with the gatekeeper You got across the streams man, you know, so there you go occasionally the wife Could possibly be maybe theoretically one's wife could be wrong once in at once over the course of America I think she probably it's an interesting point. I bet men are Less comfortable with men watching their young kids than women are I This is one of those situations where I bet men everybody out there listening to us women may be more trusting of men as babysitters than men or Interesting and I because there's wildly different. I've had wildly different responses You know, obviously a lot of athletes or just people for fun whatever people like to get a massage, right? Yeah, and I think it's just that you ask it you ask, you know, if you ask a straight man Yeah, are you okay with I know guys who say that you know, it's a massage is totally professional They're totally fine with it. They have no issue with it But if you talk to people who work at spa sometimes They'll say there are guys who will only get a massage from a woman that the preference is very In a spa my entire life never but I think I would want a female masseuse as opposed to a man It's like that. Remember the Kestanza episode where he's getting a massage and he says it moved It's one of the funniest you don't remember that episode. Oh, we even get the audio of that So you know if you watch the godfather movie for example, you know the godfather one of them's in there He's getting a back rub. He's getting a back rub from a guy named Tony who's got a big muscle You know this is like totally standard Judy was boring.
