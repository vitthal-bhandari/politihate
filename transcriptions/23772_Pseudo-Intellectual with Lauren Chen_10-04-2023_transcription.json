Something needs to be done to stop them right now to show these people that this type of behavior is not acceptable. Otherwise, things are only going to get worse and more people are going to get hurt. Because you see that footage that you just saw, that is apparently what happens nowadays. When someone who believes that biological sex is real, whoo scary, tries to give a talk at a college campus. That's right, that's all that was happening, that's all that provoked this display of insanity. You see, Riley Gaines is a collegiate swimmer at the center of this story. Now as a female athlete, someone who is breaking barriers, being strong and independent, you would think that the left would absolutely love Riley. But here's the thing, Riley happens to believe that she shouldn't need to compete as an athlete against biological males, and for that, the left is absolutely attempting to crucify her. As a Daily Mail online has written, The former University of Kentucky swimmer is one of the most decorated swimmers in program history, and became a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer and a 5-time SEC champion before her college career ended in 2022. She became a fierce advocate for sex-separated categories in sport, after competing against trans University of Pennsylvania swimmer, Leah Thomas in March last year. Gaines described the experience as like, going into the race with my hands tied behind my back. And more recently, Gaines also criticized Nike for choosing to use Dylan Mulvaney, again, a biological male to model women's sportswear. And here's the thing the left loves to talk about lifting up women's voices and listening to women. But here you have Riley Gaines, a woman who was very accomplished in her field, saying, hey, I don't like what's happening. I feel excluded. This is not fair to me. And what does the left do? They don't listen to her. They don't validate her experience. No, they actually try to attack her. If you follow Riley Gaines on social media, you'll have seen that a recent talk she was supposed to give at a college in association with Turning Point USA did not go as planned when left is active as essentially did everything they could to shut it down. And yes, Riley was even assaulted at this event as the post-millennial explains, on Thursday night, swimmer and women's sports advocate, Riley Gaines, was assaulted by radical trans activists during a Turning Point USA event at San Francisco State University. After allegedly being physically assaulted by a protester while she was escorted to a safe room, protesters followed Gaines and continued to harass her. Ah, harassment and intimidation of women. What a wonderful way to try to further your women's rights movement. Am I right, progressives? We're going to get into more of what Riley faced at this college campus, as well as what she said about the event after it was over. But first, I want to say thank you to today's sponsor, Nefarious. So there is a new movie coming out, and I'm pretty sure you're going to want to see it is by the same people who made God's not dead and unplanned. It's called Nefarious. If you've seen the posters or the trailer, you'll see that it looks kind of scary, almost like a horror movie, but don't worry, it's not. It's actually more like the CS Lewis book, the Screwtape Letters, and the best part of it all is that it's actually based off a book by the Blazer's Own Steve Days, which is so exciting and a huge congratulations to Steve Days for this movie coming out and looking amazing. Now, personally, I like to call this interview with a demon. It's about a psychiatrist who gets called into a prison to meet with a convicted killer who's about to be executed. The killer says he is a demon named Nefarious and the psychiatrist who doesn't believe in gods or demons. He has to decide if the man is insane, pretending to be insane, or I'm not going to give it away, but let's just say that the psychiatrist is a little bit out of his depth and it's a supernatural thriller. It's perfect for your friends who love scary films or even more than that love going to church. You're going to have some great conversations afterwards. Nefarious opens nationwide this weekend, April 14th. The market that they get your tickets now at whoisnefarious.com. Again, that is whoisnefarious.com, you guys. On the show, we trash Hollywood all the time, so why not for one's actually supportive movie that has some good values and who's made by people who don't absolutely hate your guts. Now, to further illustrate how tolerant and loving the left currently is here is more footage of Riley Gaines being chased out of her own speaking event by rabid protesters. Now, along with that video, Riley also posted to her Twitter the caption, the prisoners are running the asylum at SFSU. I was ambushed and physically hit twice by a man. This is proof that women need sex protected spaces. Still, only further assures me I'm doing something right when they want you silent, speak louder. And as bad as that footage looks, here's the thing, it gets even worse. I've said it before when talking about issues similar to this, but I just really want to drive home the point here that this isn't about Riley Gaines as a person. If you're someone who's watching this and you believe like Riley does, that men and women are different, that identifying as a woman doesn't make you a woman, and that males shouldn't be allowed in female spaces or to be able to compete in female sports, guess what? These college students, they would give you the exact same treatment and that should terrify you. The idea that this is happening on a college campus, that these aren't just strangely overgrown toddlers throwing a tantrum, that's absolutely, I think, a condemnation of the state of the American education system. And once more, I have the displeasure of informing you all that the situation still gets worse as this user on Twitter explained, transgender activists holding Riley Gaines hostage actually demanded money in exchange for her safe passage off of the San Francisco State University. College campuses are just flat out no longer safe, not just if you're a conservative, but if you're someone who doesn't completely agree with the progressive left, this is what's going to happen to you. You're going to be chased, you're going to be harassed, perhaps even physically assaulted and maybe held hostage for ransom. I mean, there's no laws on these college campuses anymore, it seems like I hope and I know many others do, that Riley Gaines presses charges, not only against maybe individual students, especially the one who was hitting her, but also against the university administration as a whole for even letting this clown show happen. But here's the thing, if you've been paying attention, this will not surprise you. I mean, not only were trans activists on this campus already harassing and threatening people even before Riley showed up. They're going to give the opportunities to women, to real women. I just say, get out of here. Get out of here. Disgusting, but not surprising because really, should we expect any better from leftist activists, if in the wake of a trans shooter, this is how the Biden administration discusses the trans community. LGBTQI plus kids are resilient. They are fierce, they fight back, they're not going anywhere. We've had at this point several trans shooters in addition to all of the hysterical and violent leftist protesters out there. And what does the Biden administration do? Oh, he assures everybody that trans kids are resilient and they will fight back. Well, we can see that. We can see that perfectly clear. That's actually, I think, the problem here. And for anyone wondering how Riley is doing after having been treated so, so terribly, as the Post Millennial reports later the night of the speaking event, she said, I'm okay currently, but an hour and a half later, I'm still barricaded in a room with ambushes on the outside yelling and threatening violence. As police escorted me out of the event space to my current location, I was hit physically twice by what I presume was a male individual. And again, she repeated, this only assures me I'm doing the right thing. And now what happened to Riley on this campus has gone viral, I think rightfully show, but I think the reaction to it on social media just further shows how divided the country is because, you know, on the one hand, you have same people who look at this and are absolutely horrified that something so trivial as believing biological sex is real could get someone in such hot water with college students. And on the other side, you have insane people who think that this treatment was completely, completely justified because Riley is supposedly like every one of us is nowadays, I guess, a bigot. One person on Twitter said, seems you are quite popular as a turf. Keep thinking you're saying something right, people are fed up with radical whiners like you because apparently you're whining when you want to be able to compete against other women as a female athlete. Similarly, in a gross virtue signal, Tom Tomprano said, so proud of the students at my all matter, SFSU. I'm disgusted that a virulently transphobic person like Riley Gaines would be welcomed by anyone at state, but I'm sure her crowd is nothing compared to the actual crowd of students who support trans athletes go gators. This user also said if Riley Gaines had just been a little bit better at swimming, maybe she doesn't turn into a transphobic grifter. And predictably compassionate, someone calling himself Eric LGBTQ Christian said, Riley Gaines learned an important lesson, don't be a transphobic bigot and expect people to let you stay on campus. So, according to all these people who I'm sure would describe themselves as good feminists, this woman Riley Gaines, she actually deserved to be chased, threatened, assaulted and intimidated for having the wrong opinions. And if that doesn't go to show just how crazed the leftist movement is nowadays, and I don't know what it does, I hope that the students who participated in this disgusting mob behavior are held accountable. I doubt that's going to happen though. So, I guess if there's one takeaway here, it's just that if you're a conservative, a Christian, someone on the right, or heck even a centrist watching this know that the progressive left hates you, and they want to hurt you. And unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's much stopping them nowadays, at least not on places like college campuses. That's all I have to say for now.
