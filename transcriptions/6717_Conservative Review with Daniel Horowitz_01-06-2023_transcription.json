    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. It is Thursday, the first month, first day of June, which has been hijacked for the rainbow Ramadan, where we have a national religion promoting sin, licentiousness, disgustingness. But here we always have family pride, patriot pride, fidelity pride. Here's where we're at. Okay, it's been a busy week, but here's where we're at. On the one hand, we have never faced so many existential crises to our way of life, our economy, our bodies, our religion, our minds, our souls, our children. And we're going to talk about some of these things with the nexus between mental illness, autism and transgenderism and vaccines, all kind of loosely tying together. We're going to have on Dr. Peter McCullough coming up soon. But to tie into the whole debt ceiling adultery betrayal, Trump actually saying he doesn't care about it, like every other important issue. And everything we're at on the one hand, we face this onslaught. On the other hand, there is this budding bottom up movement. I think we are seeing some degree of backlash. People did call their congressman. We are seeing the boycotts against the rainbow jihad be more successful than they've ever been. But here's where the rubber meets the road. We do not have at a leadership level, a movement at a leadership level to connect the dots, to connect the fire and put that led down radiance to where the target needs to be. See, ultimately, we face a crisis of truth that no matter what comes out and more information is coming out, exposing the debt ceiling thing was a fraud. The COVID stuff was a fraud. The vaccines were dangerous as hell. But the policies don't change. It's like, there's no way we're all looking at this debt deal and it got worse every day. The more we found out about it, there's no way. I mean, there's going to be a wholesale rebellion, but less than a third of the Republicans voted against it. They got what they wanted, even though more Democrats actually supported it than Republicans, which is all we need to know. But nothing changes. And this is what I saw yesterday when I saw the headline, it was kind of washed away in the news cycle that the FDA gave full approval to Pfizer's RSV shot. And I'm thinking, after everything we know about what Pfizer did, never has a private company been so empowered by government to commit such an atrocity against life and liberty in its most literal sense. And yet they could come along with a new trial. Oh, it's 67 to 85% effective against RSV. Here's another shot for you. Knowing that there's nothing we can do to stop it, just like the debt ceiling betrayals like, come on, Kevin McCarthy cannot get away with that. Yeah, you can. Because we don't have a serious movement with a serious leader as we see we have this guy writing these psychotic screeds about DeSantis's name every day. He sounds like a retard. So we don't have a critical mass. We don't have the sons of liberty. We don't have a Sam Adams. We have a bunch of vaccine injured retards running the show on the fake right. That's too busy embracing Rainbow Ramadan month. And we're left with this onslaught against our society of this most disgusting agenda. The assault on our bodies with every senior is now going to be convinced to get this death shot. Wherever you turn, we don't have a team on the field, which is why no matter how compelling our case is for or against something, the policies won't change until we get some sort of political leadership to lead that fight. And I don't, I don't have easy answers to this. I really don't. Not sure what to do with it, but it's amazing how Pfizer could come out right in the open right in the open in their own data. Their own data shows that it would take 16,000 doses to prevent 22 RSV cases. And seniors remember seniors already got it. So it's going to be mild. Doesn't know evidence even in their data that it prevents death that there is death because there is no RSV death among seniors. Meanwhile, the vaccine group had 22 more serious adverse events than the placebo. It had 14 more severe adverse events and three more deaths. So there's no evidence it prevented an RSV death, but in their own lying data, imagine a company that literally lied about everything from my or corditis to strokes to fetal maternal problems, and menstrual bleeding, everything from A to Z, they could put out another more lying data, but even their lying trial. And by the way, Vintavia, that same company that that fabricated the entire clinical trial for them coordinated it. They also did this one. And they could show more all cause mortality in the vaccine group. And I forget the amount of time, but it was a short follow up time. One month, one month, it was, I'm looking at it now, table eight, one month follow up. Okay. So that's, that's a big deal. And one month to have three more deaths. You can imagine it gets worse over time. And also the negative efficacy kicks in over time, like we've learned with these respiratory viral vaccines. And it's like, it doesn't matter. I mean, this is a big deal. This will be given to every senior at a doctor's office at a pharmacy. And then in short order, we'll go down the totem pole of the age stratified approvals and eventually be placed on the child vaccination schedule. So we're going to talk about that with Dr. McCullough as well. We are nowhere closer to having Republicans focus on that. So let me just say the good news. Let me read to you a quote. This is from Olivia Beaver. She's the political white, uh, not White House Capitol Hill correspondent, Randy Weber, who's supposedly a freedom caucus member, but never sides with a freedom caucus. He said he thought the debt deal was good, but that he and his wife were inundated back in their district. Well, I would like to think that people don't understand that this bill does actually move the ball forward. They're not getting it. And so they're saying, don't vote for it. So if I listen to my constituency, I'll be voting no. So I always tell you guys, calling your congressman and organizing other people to do it and certainly a state legislature, because you'll have more of a outside share impact. You'll be more impactful than, than even voting. So this along with the boycotts is starting, but imagine if we had the top 50 shows and voices doing what I do. So I would encourage you to still call your members. Look at the ones who voted for it. There are 71, um, really would have been 72. Lauren Bobert couldn't make it or something. Um, so on the one hand, there were 72 Republicans would have voted no, only 46 Democrats voted no. You saw how Kim Jeffries, the minority leader of the Democrats, working hand in glove with McCarthy, the uni party was on full display, full display before our eyes. And by the way, 29 Republicans voted against the rule. So that forced him to come to a Kim and get Democrats to vote for the rule. And Axias is reporting that he promised them earmarks. He promised them favors to do it. So he sold us down the river to get Democrats to support such a horrible thing. There will only be a handful of Democrats voting against it in the Senate. And by the way, even the ones voting no, it's just kind of like, because there are so many provisions in it. So it's always easier to vote no. You don't want to be hit by your base for even cosmetically voting against something that could be portrayed as cutting welfare benefits. But it's not like even the AOC and Bernie Sanders types are hopping mad at it. It's on full display in front of your eyes, whether it's vaccines, whether it's the transgender jihad, whether it's obviously the debt ceiling and the spending and the weaponization of government. And this entire conservative movement and Republican Party is fake. What do we do about it? That is what I would challenge my colleagues with. What do we do about it? It's just unreal. Here is a clip of Donald Trump. He was finally asked on a Iowa radio show. What do you think about the debt ceiling deal? Take a listen here. Going on in our country and there's a lot of things we need to discuss. The debt ceiling has just passed. I think it's a horrible deal. What do you think? Well, it is what it is. It was going to pass and then money or votes and then we'll get it done permanently and properly. So here it is what it is. It was going to pass. They had the votes. He sounded. He wasn't too interested in it. But if you look at his facial expressions in the video because there's a video of it, this is how he governed. This is what he did when he was present. It's like, yeah, you know, that's the votes. Let them do what they do. Yeah. Okay. I'll sign whatever you give to me. The notion that this man has somehow changed and learned his lesson. If anything has gotten worse. Again, it is indefensible from any MAGA America first, populist, conservative, any perspective to support this guy. It is indefensible. I'm sick of my colleagues. Like, I like them both. This like fake gay neutrality that they're putting on. You know what I mean? Give me a break. Take a freaking stand for once. No one's perfect, but between the two, it's night and day on every issue that matters. Give me a break. But that's where we are. Now, anyway, obviously following this debt ceiling deal, I will tell you, we're going to have major problems with the dollar with we're going to have a repo crisis from this. Like we did last time they raised the debt ceiling. Now is the time to diversify with gold. As they talk about fake diversity this month, talk about financial diversity. Birch gold makes it easy to convert an IRA or 401k into an IRA in precious metals. Here's what you need to do. Text Daniel to 9898 to get a free info kit on gold. You'll see their array of different silver and gold precious metals, bullions. They'll deposit having a safety deposit for you a real nest egg of value. And this way you could either start a new IRA or convert your existing one. That's what Birch specializes in rather than putting it in the stock market, which is going to go to hell in a hand basket. So with an A plus rating from the Better Business Bureau, thousands of happy customers and countless five star reviews, Birch gold is what you can trust to protect your future, especially in times of the uni party debt betrayal. Text Daniel to 9898 today. So I want to get to our special guest today a lot more on the table going on with the rainbow jihad with debt ceiling stuff. I want to get to if not today tomorrow, but I want to kind of zoom out for a little bit more of a generic discussion, but it's just as important as the other things we've been talking about. So Dr. Peter McCullough doesn't need much of an introduction to this audience. He's obviously been a fixture in the medical freedom movement notorious for fighting for early treatment, fighting for truth about the vaccines, fighting for informed consent. But one of the things I think we've all discovered throughout this fight is that COVID likely wasn't the first go around of this mass psychosis among the medical profession where they will literally do what's antithetical to the Hippocratic oath. And it certainly is not the last time as we're seeing with RSV shots, with the monkeypox shots, all of these rushed vaccines that are prima facia, problematic, have a negative cost benefit matrix, and they just get approved. But then there's other aspects of this. So we have a lot of these trends in civilization. And typically you'll have trends with physical health, mental health, over time people become sicker with certain illnesses, and there's often a reason for it. But then you have a scenario where according to CDC over a period of two years, the number of high schoolers who identify as transgender has tripled. Then you have every every major hospital medical association promoting castration, mutilation, hormone this, cutting off breasts there. And you're thinking what this can't this can't be true. And then we have all these trends with autism. We have all these trends with mental illness. Now you have to see what's connected, what's not. But Dr. McCullough has actually been working on a theory of medical malfeasance that runs much deeper than what we saw with COVID. And clearly it's deeper than just the code vaccine. There's problems with other vaccines that we've been lied to. But also their mentality with this transgenderism and what they're doing and not doing and how much does that tie into mental illness? How much does that even tie into this mass violence? We talked about this school shootings. Certainly they're not exclusively transgender, but we've seen a lot of it that's been covered up by the media. So Dr. McCullough has really branched out in terms of his research, his thoughts. He has a terrific subset courageous discourse. It's really a must read every day in your inbox. You could follow him at p underscore McCullough MD on Twitter. Dr. McCullough, it's been way too long. Welcome back to Blaze Media. Well, thanks for having me. And thanks for all your courage out there. I tell you what, you've been a crusader for truth. And so many of us feel connected in this battle. I can tell you as a practicing internist and cardiologist, like any doctor now, we are becoming very familiar with LGBT and with the T being transgender. Since the rise of transgenderism, it's actually in our medical practices now. So it's ubiquitous. So here's the thing. I thought in my mind, I never looked for any medical physical explanation. To me, it was very simple. We never had social media before this generation. And now you have the ability to make something ubiquitous. You can make a fat ubiquitous, for example, in three seconds, everyone could do something so unnatural as covering their breathing holes with masks, you know, in the most absurd situations, you could have people obsessing about Ukraine that they couldn't even find on a map in three seconds. So you could have people you could have a fad now with kids with rising mental illness. Here's here's a thing. You're really, you know, you might not be a man after all, maybe you're a woman, maybe you're this. If you tell people that it's cool to dress up like a cat and a dog on TikTok, there's no question you'd be able to gain a lot of traction with that over time. So to me, that explains a lot of it. But you have a working theory that I wanted you to share with the audience, a pandemic of mental contagion, autism, and the rise of transgenderism. Take it from there. You know, I asked the question as an epidemiologist, are two exploding epidemics, are they related? And the two epidemics are the explosion of autism. When I was a kid, the rate of autism was one in 10,000. The CDC now says it's one in 36. There is no childhood illness that is more rapidly epidemic than autism, which is a severe disorder. It's a neuropsychiatric disorder to forever influences that child the rest of their lives, family members. There's quite a spectrum of autism from being severely disabled, unable to leave the house, you know, needing full time 24 by seven care to, to being mainstreamed, but with what's called autism spectrum disorder, where there's some features of it, but child is able to go to school and then ultimately enter society independently. And the other epidemic, as you mentioned, is transgenderism. And while there have always been homosexual males who want to dress as a woman, that was relatively rare among homosexual males. And there were always women who may have tendencies towards men. What has really evolved almost, it seems like in the last, you know, year or so is an absolute explosion of transgenderism to the point of it influencing marketing, various brand trends, etc. So I asked the question, could autism be related to transgenderism? And sure enough, Vander Miesen and colleagues published about 10 years ago from the Netherlands, an observation that 20% of young people in Dutch transgender clinics had a clinical diagnosis of autism, 20%. And so there's a giant spectrum beyond those with clinical autism called autism spectrum disorder. And so it, I said, Oh my Lord, this is an incredible overlap. And then studies started to hit one after another one. This paper by warrior and colleagues, I thought was very important. And what they demonstrated was that, and let me get the exact citation for you, warrior and colleagues, which was published in Nature Communications, a really high level journal, analyzed 641,860 individuals with gender dysphoria. So gender dysphoria is the clinical diagnosis for which transgender hormones and surgeries are prescribed. And they assess people of gender disorder for autistic tendencies with some standardized scores. And there was about four different, I'm sorry, about five different transgender scores used. And guess what, those with gender dysphoria are off the Richter scale testing out for autism. Wow. So it's not that everyone who has this gender dysphoria is necessarily autistic, but a good number of them are a good number then seem to be. Right. Very large overlap. And then more data started to come in, which was, I think, very, very disturbing. So a paper was published by, by Mendez and colleagues, and it was a literature review describing 2,921 murders, murders where an LGBT person was the victim. This is in the peer reviewed literature. This is absolutely stunning 16 papers in total. And in general, the perpetrator is generally a male, the victim is generally a male, and about 40% of the time they knew each other. And so that paper was out there. And then to really bring it home was a paper of mortality. And this just hit the mainstream mainstream. This was in JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association, first author is Sarah Jackson, titled the paper is analysis of mortality among transgender and gender diverse adults in England. And this is alarming. Suicide, homicide, death from accidental poisoning. Many fold higher in transgender compared to normal men or normal women. So mortality is higher. And again, that was published in a very high level journal. And the burden of psychiatric care is much higher after the transgender procedure. So this paper was published by Heisel Gorman and colleagues from the Uniform Services University in Bethesda, titled the paper mental health care utilization of transgender youth before and after gender affirming treatment. So to actually take the hormones and surgery worsens the psychiatric problem. And so finally, I think the coup de gras on this, Daniel, you're going to be astounded by this, because states are moving forward with legislation to ban hormones and surgery in the youth to show to ban this, nobody has a problem in adulthood, if someone wants to whatever they want to do in adulthood. But during childhood, to ban this with this idea that autistic children, in a sense, are being preyed upon by this transgender industry. But so because this legislation came out, I was astounded to realize this. And I posted this on May 4th, that the the autism self advocacy network, as an condemns restrictions on gender affirming care that they came out with a statement on this. So this is an advocacy network. These are largely adults with autism, or other concerned individuals. And so it's basically saying the autistic people want gender change. So, you know, this brings it full circle here. I think it's conclusive that transgenderism is driven by the epidemic of autism. The autistic people want this. And the question on the table is, should it continue? Because it increases the burden of psychiatric disease and increases mortality. So obviously increasing mortality, you know, when someone is this severely mentally ill, they're going to be prone to suicide and things like that. And certainly when you start screwing with the hormones, obviously you have the concurrent rise in general mental illness depression. To me, it's not a surprise that the same hockey stick that you're seeing the last few years with the rise of people saying I'm the opposite gender suddenly, you also have the just the explosion of, you know, 25, 30% rates of clinical depression among teenagers. Just just a perfect storm, obviously the lockdowns, you know, certainly aggravated that all going on. But you referenced another extra point there that you brought up in the wake of that, you know, shooting in Nashville, that Christian school by this female who said she was really a male. And you have this theory about hormones, this hormone treatment creating this undercurrent of violence that has not been noted. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? Well, you know, as I pointed out, the MENDA study shows that LGBT are the victims of homicides in a large number, but the Jackson analysis that was in JAMA points out that both suicide and homicide are causes of death in these individuals. And some of these suicides occur in the context of mass murders. And we just need the case example now. And I think we're close to half a dozen or more of transgender individuals, young ones actually becoming the perpetrator in a mass murder in the case you pointed out. And so there, remember autism is a neuropsychiatric illness, meaning there's neurological and psychiatric aspects to it. And there are certainly outbursts of anger or inability to control various, you know, emotional states. Now add into this hormones, particularly the post-puberar hormones, which are straight antigens or estrogens, you know, that makes even normal people irritable. So you can imagine having the neuropsychiatric disorder or some other related disorder, and then hormonal manipulation, creating this situation where, you know, it's sad for everyone because in these mass murders, many times the perpetrator loses their life as well. And this, I think the Jackson analysis is so disturbing that, you know, it increases mortality all the way around. It honestly, if there was another surgery or hormones that were increasing mortality, they'd be taken off the market. So you're saying we have an autism bubble that no one denies. You have a broad mental illness skyrocketing across the spectrum. And then we have this rise in violence. Okay, we have this rise in, you know, these mass shootings. Now, obviously, you know, you take this whole gender dysphoria out of it, you still have there's clearly this culture of violence. We could just talk about the way our youth are raised and just this lack of wholesome life. There's so much to say on that. But, but you rightly noted it is covered up by the media. There is a growing percentage of these cases that actually are from from an gender dysphoric individual. And more than we think, so you're saying you take a 15 year old girl, a 17 year old girl, and you, and especially if they're already autistic. I don't know if that was the case in Tennessee. And then you juice them up with hormones. Well, what happens? Yeah, it's not. It's certainly not good. The Jackson analysis again, JAMA Open Network, January 30th of 2023. So it's pretty recent data. Let's just take compared to normal women. Just use the example of the, I believe it was Nashville, where it was a transgender woman, a girl who wanted to be a man. You know, the risk there is the relative risk was 5.62 greater risk of suicide or homicide. And the confidence intervals were 2.65 to 11.91. That's highly statistically significant. It's very hard in the psychiatric literature to ever achieve statistical significance. So these are striking results. And the fact that they're coming out in the peer reviewed scientific literature, where, you know, in general, medicine doesn't have an opinion on people's choice. Medicine is a very diverse, you know, always have had equity, inclusion. People make their own choices. As a doctor, you know, I take care of drug abusers. Well, I don't care of if you didn't get the shot. Yeah, no, I take it. And they weren't so diverse. I know. Listen, listen, I take care of drug abusers. I take care of prisoners. I take care of people of all walks of life, homosexuals, heterosexuals, bisexuals. I mean, that's just medicine. We see people of all walks of life. And I don't think anybody has any problem with someone's choice. However, when when physicians are prescribing the hormones and doing the surgery and the result is a transgendered person, and the result shows that there is harm, it has to be stopped. It just has to be, you know, it took with it from the time we knew smoking caused lung cancer, it took doctors 40 years to ultimately come around to doctors used to smoke. They smoked in the operating room. From the time we knew the opioids were addictive and could be life threatening, it's taken over 20 years to get this opioid pandemic under control. It's largely prescription opioids that doctors prescribe. Doctors are not quick to recognize systematic errors and delivery of care. And this one, this one, I think is going to be shut down honestly, before the doctors shut it down themselves. There was a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, highlighting the fact that there will be severe penalties for programs that continues. Paper is published by Mallory and colleagues, and it was in JAMA May 18th, 2023. And they indicated that boy states have legislation all over the place moving forward. There is going to be a bans on care with clear legislative attraction. In it highlights everything that's going to happen. The states include Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, and Texas. 118 bills across 31 states total. They're all going to move forward. 11 bills have been passed into law. Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia. And probably a little old. Yeah, and listen to this. Yeah, Daniel, listen to this. 15 states have laws and policies that ban gender affirming care for minors with the stipulations the state bans. Physicians who continue to face four major direct penalties. One, medical license disciplinary action. Two, private, right of legal action against physicians, which can include extensions on malpractice and statutes and limitations. Three, civil actions against the states can take against physicians, and four, felonies, felony provisions. This was in the wing internal medicine. Wow. No, I mean, that is definitely something I think because it's just so jarring cutting someone's genitalia off. It doesn't take a doctor to understand how systemically damaging that is. But I think this is a good way to transition into the second half. And really, we need a whole show just for this. But you mentioned something very profound that it takes generations for the medical profession to correct an error. And let's talk about what could be the greatest lie of the century. I think you and I are in the same boat. You as a famed cardiologist published in so much, so much medical literature and me as a layman. We're, you know, kind of never questioned it. We vac we were born with with the notion that there's vaccines and this vaccine, that vaccine, all right, you know, you just kind of put in the body and it stimulates an antibody response. And okay, you know, everyone's happy, you're now immune and never really thought about it. And then, you know, I heard people over the years saying, well, you know, vaccines is caught on cause autism, like that's crazy. Of course, it's debunked. It's debunked. And I thought that really up until COVID. And then even when the vaccine, the COVID shot started coming out and we're like, oh, my gosh, this is poison. I had this cognitive distance. Yeah, this thing is really, I mean, this is like a bio weapon, but everything else is amazing. But then as 2021 went on and I had people like you and Dr. Cole and all these other people on, and we started learning immunology and epidemiology in real time. So we're able to really learn these things. I was like, wait a minute. I'm learning a lot about antibodies. They're not all good. There's God made the right type in the right amount in the right classification and the right location. Like, well, wait a minute, this stuff we're seeing about the IGG four and the tolerating rather than neutralizing and the auto antibodies. And all these syndrome, autoimmune syndromes we see in theirs. I'm thinking, wait a minute. What's with all these other respiratory viral vaccines and even other vaccines that are ever increasing? And then to bring this show kind of full circle, we have this explosion of autism, which could come from neurological inflammation, which we certainly see this crosses the blood brain barrier. We see the explosion of the allergies. I'm a lot younger than you, Dr. Mikala. But still, we never had peanut allergy issues when I was in school. It started like abruptly shortly after my time as a school age kid. You have all these allergies, all these autoimmune that the colitis and the, the, um, all these stomach auto autoimmune stuff exploding. And there's no good explanation. Here's the question for you. Is it, does it take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that taking a kid and just shoving an ever increasing amount of uncontrolled antibody spikes might be problematic for some people? You know, when I was a kid, we had the oral polio. And we had a dip theory at tetanus pertussis and smallpox. So basically vaccinated against five things. Now it turns out that detharia and pertussis are easily treated with a Z pack. If we would have had a zithermize back then, we wouldn't have needed that. And then tetanus is largely managed with wound care. There is neonatal tetanus, but that occurs before that, you know, the baby has a chance to defend against it. So a maternal vaccination is thought to handle that. And then of course, polio, which could could be devastating. That's pretty much what we had. And as I mentioned, the rate of autism one in 10,000 now today, a child today receives 72 shots, 72 different shots. That's before SARS-CoV-2, the COVID shots, which add a lot more because they're every six months. I think it's up over 100 and about 16 different diseases with new ones being added all the time, including recently the rest choice and social virus. So it's causing all of us to re review the data. So here's just one paper, just one paper, Gire and Gire published from an early paper from the VAERS system. This is long before COVID. It's published in 2002. The title of the paper is an analysis of the occurrence of convulsions and death after childhood vaccination. So convulsions and deaths. So we, you know, we're not even talking about autism. We're just talking about something that occurs immediately with these shots. And what they found is that the more shots that are given together, so diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus together, as opposed to separate shots, markedly increases the risk. And then the time at which these occur is strongly related to the outcome. So if they happen closer and closer to the time of vaccination, the relative risks become even higher in terms of association, like a relative risk of 62, which is through the roof. And what the Gire and Gire is saying is basically, listen, this is real. There are kids who die. And in this analysis, sadly, there were, as I recall, I believe there was over a thousand deaths. So this occurred over a long period of time. But, you know, we have a situation where papers like this have been published in the literature. There's about 80 papers or so publishing in the literature, suggesting vaccines could be related to autism. What's most convincing are the vignette papers. So the vignette is, there's a normal child, comes in, gets six different vaccines at one, six different antigens at once, has a febrile seizure, doesn't die. But then from that point forward, the child is autistic. And there are many of those vignettes published, you go on social media and mothers will tell you that all the time. And I think what's convincing about those, because usually talking about a kid a few months old. So you don't have much of a baseline to go off of. But the mothers do, the eye tracking is different. The breastfeeding becomes different, suckling response to the environment. And the mothers believe they can tell that they can tell a difference. And then on top of that, we have a growing literature, which is very interesting about going natural, going natural, meaning that there are parents who say, listen, we're not going to take any shots. Now, interestingly, the parents who decide to go natural tend to be older. And they tend to have another child with autism. So when the next one comes, they're a bit worried, it turns out those are the two risk factors for autism, older adults and siblings with autism. So here we have a child that who's already predisposed autism. And I can tell you, in all the studies done so far, going natural, that is getting no vaccines has a much lower rate of autism and neuropsychiatric disorders, asthma, allergic dermatitis, need for tympanostomy tubes, pharyngitis. It's clear that natural is better. There's multiple studies. Paul Thomas published one hooker and Miller published another multiple pediatric practices, and looking at this concept. So in my analysis so far, you'll see a bunch of these come out of my subject. I don't think it's any particular vaccine that is the smoking gun for autism, but it looks like the process of hyper vaccination. That is, it's the multiplicity. And it's the multiplicity of antigenic exposures with the right susceptibility, the cytokines are the inflammatory mediators that, you know, quickly rise. They penetrate the blood bane barrier quickly. Some of them are neurotoxic. And they look like they forever change some of these kids to becoming autistic. And it's cold. Where it was all at once, like Aaron Siri always says that, you know, with the kids, it's gray, it's gradual and be generally they're given to babies. And you have so many people that either the person themselves say, you know, I just don't feel right. I just haven't felt right since I got the shots or their relatives are like, is that guy okay? Either physically. And I know you've written a lot about this. There's our friend Aaron has put togethers like 29 case studies on psychosis from the COVID shots. But with the traditional kind of childhood schedule shots, you can't really the kid can't articulate that. And it's not as apparent. But now that we understand the mechanism, I'm thinking like, yeah, I mean, you got all that inflammation from the overstimulation of the immune system. And now that I understand the relationship between that and pathogens, but also cancers, autoimmune allergy response. And then, yes, the neurological, which we see all over theirs, and all over the case studies. So, here's my concern. I don't Dr. McCullough, I don't understand how this is not the biggest public policy issue. This affects every human being. I got four kids. Unfortunately, we're already over most of the hump, but we're running around from one pediatrician to another. And when we think we found a good one, they harass the heck out of you, make you feel like you're a dirtbag for questioning it. You're stupid. It's all good. We'll any make any manufacturer any amount. But the more I study, I look back even to things that I thought were like gospel. I mean, like the pertussis one. And by the way, now they're they're loading it on pregnant women more than ever because in 2016, they expanded the indemnification to shots used during pregnancy. So there's a torrent of them, and they even pressure the husband to often get another DPT for pertussis. And I look at the data, and I see more negative efficacy like we saw with COVID. I see immune suppression. We see with a lot of the flu shots, the T cells tamping down has been tons of studies over the last 15 years on that that we never noticed, which make a lot of sense. We see a lack of rationale. We see a lack of all cause mortality benefit. And you know, to be fair, I was always saying, oh, the COVID shots, we never did anything like that. It's rushed. And the manufacturers were like, we've never had bigger trials than ever. And they were actually right. They're fraudulent, but they were bigger. I look at like, hid and some of this stuff that are happy. I mean, they had like a few day follow-up with this stuff. Well, yeah, I mean, hepatitis B is the, is I think the most egregious, giving it on the first day of life. The registration trials were just a few hundred children. And there was only five days of follow-up. And the only clinical indication where as a doctor, I would say a child needs a newborn child needs it is with a mother who has active hepatitis B, who has active IV drug abusing, which is very rare. But for every baby born to be blasted with a hepatitis B shot on the day of birth is simply overkill. You know, a paper is going to come out of my sub-stack regarding homophilus influenza B, which by the way, there's almost no disease that's had a greater reduction co-incident with the introduction of vaccines as homophilus influenza B. It's a bacteria, a encapsulated bacteria introduced in 1985 and the rates of invasive disease plummeted. But I asked the question, do people still get the illness and does the vaccine really protect them? And a paper by suitors and colleagues from the CDC published in 2018 summarized it. Now, remember the vaccine only stops homophilus influenza serotype B. It doesn't stop any of the other serotypes. It turns out that only 1.8% of all homophilus is serotype B. And of those, there were 77 cases reported, it turns out that 73.9% of people who got them were either fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated. They were following the vaccine schedule. So, you know, while it may have had a broad public health impact, you know, we can't look at somebody in the eye and tell them they're protected here when the majority of people who get the disease, you know, are vaccinated. I used to think this stuff was like a coat of iron. I, you know, vaccine was synonymous with a cure. And the more we look at things, you know, this concept of a leaky waning efficacy, it's pretty ubiquitous. It might have been really egregious with this one and particularly respiratory viral ones are never really successful. But you look at a lot of these mumps and measles outbreaks. We've seen it. We've seen it. Obviously, the monkey pox is a joke that recent cluster in Chicago, I believe was it nine out of 12 or something like that, were, you know, just got the two doses of Johnios. This whole thing we've been lied to. And then also just the rationale. A lot of people say, are you anti-vax or pro-vax? And to me, it's like saying, are you pro surgery? Are you pro chemotherapy? Well, you know, I mean, rarely is something good for all people at all times. I think of something like German measles. I never even realized this that German measles really aside from pregnant women, you know, giving birth to a fetus and potentially being problematic to a fetus, no man should ever get this. I mean, before you even look at safety and efficacy, just the rationale for it. Isn't isn't that true that a lot of this stuff is not necessary for everyone? It's true that I remember as a kid, German measles also known as rubella. They had a big push for rubella vaccination. Well, it's compelling for women as they enter the child bearing years. We used to have 20,000 cases of congenital rubella. Now we're done like two cases a year. So the vaccine is very effective. But it should only be restricted for women as they enter the child bearing in years. There's no reason for a boy to even take the rubella. So that's MMR. That's actually the R in MMR. Measles is a non-threatening illness. You know, mumps is worth a discussion. There is mumps, orchitis, and sterilization that can happen in boys, but doesn't happen in girls. You know, we have to look at each one. I think what's going to happen is, you know, 72 vaccine shots plus COVID. They're just getting started. It's too much. They're just getting started. I mean, you got Nipa and Zika. I mean, they have everything in the pipeline. And obviously the RSV thing really scares me because that was the original ADE shot with negative efficacy. And even Fauci just published a couple months ago admitting that the respiratory viral vaccines are all leaky that they just don't don't address the mucosal. And they're just there's no backstop. Well, Daniel, let me say that I can tell you as a doctor, we're going to need to do risk stratification. So respiratory syncytial virus in you, me, our kids, and our grandparents is nothing. It's honestly like a cold at most we have to do a nebulizer, but RSV and a kid with cystic fibrosis could be severe. So we're going to need to do risk stratification. Some people need vaccines, but not everybody needs a routine schedule. I think what needs to go away is the routine schedule and vaccines need to be given according to risk stratification. There needs to be a medical necessity and a clinical indication. But this idea that you either you're either in or you're out and parents being made to feel uncomfortable by pediatricians, that needs to go away because right now it's too much and we need to do risk stratification. Yeah, this is what I fear. But you know, getting back to the beginning of our discussion with the with the castration stuff, it just so I guess evident the draconian nature of it. So it has drawn sharp backlash that has spread not just from the people, but actually to the political representatives, at least in the so-called red states. But I look at what the second half of our discussion here and forget about the other shots. I mean, those are sacred whenever we try to address them in legislation. And when I'm talking about just the mandates mandating them, it was a non starter in every state. But even the COVID shots, despite everything that has come out about it, itself evident negative efficacy attacks every organ system, every corner of the body, potentially. There's only to my knowledge, one state where the health department is putting out informed consent, you know, Dr. Joe Latipo in Florida, putting out information warning about the risks. And while most people still aren't getting it, at this point, they're onto it, but if a woman becomes pregnant, that's kind of a status change, the OBGs are pressuring them. And I'm thinking here's the thing, certain things are, like you said, a concern for newborns, RSV is a concern, Rabel is a concern. But what's going to happen now that you take a pregnant woman, we all know the European Medicines Agency documents seem to show that Pfizer knew about the intervention spreading through the placenta. You take a woman and now you give them flu RSV, COVID, another MMR, another DPT. And who knows, who knows what else? What does that portend for the fetus? No one can know. I mean, any injection that a mother takes is risky. I would say this, that anything that can cause a fever in a mother that just put that alone, a fever, a fever in a mother can cause precipitous delivery of the baby. It can actually cause a miscarriage or a stillbirth. It's too risky. So the benefit of any of these shots in women is far outweighed by the risk of losing the baby. And so many mothers are going to decide to go natural in pregnancy because it just makes a lot of sense. And a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggests parents are in a much higher proportion going to go natural on the childhood vaccine schedule. And decide later on, you know, they may be compelling to kids go to college to get the meningococcal vaccine. It may be compelling if they go into healthcare to get hepatitis B vaccine. And they're going to basically opt to go natural because they've lost trust in the CDC ASAP group because of this hyper vaccination, adding COVID. And they don't seem to show any concern over safety. Now, that's what scares me because you want to tell me, Hey, there's some risk, whatever, that's believable. But when you start saying everything is good for everyone and needed at all times, there's just something funny there. Final question here, if I make you king for a day, what is the one policy change that you feel could bring out the truth and up end this entire racket? But I think the big policy change that would happen immediately is we would outlaw any mandates associated with vaccines, any. So any at the school level, K through 12 college, for any vaccine, routine vaccines, COVID-19. And so if vaccines became completely elective, then we can let them, you know, stand on their own merits and the evolving data. What makes everybody uncomfortable is a mandate. And also the the indemnification, I think is the big one. Every day you see Honda, you know, recalling different airbags because they're on the hook for liability. And often you wonder how dubious those recalls are. Whereas with with this, I mean, it's an all you could eat buffet. And there is no incentive for them to make this stuff safer. I mean, I'm just looking with my mouth open, watching these a sip and verbac hearings. And they'll openly admit that, yeah, we don't know if there's all cause mortality benefit. We don't really see seniors getting sick from RSV. So we can't tell. Yeah, there's a signal for Guillen Barre. Yeah, someone died in the, you know, GSK Pfizer trial or GSK RSV trial. And the Pfizer shot is pretty similar, but we'll approve that anyway. And it's like nothing seems to ever matter. What is it going to take? Is it does it have to start from the medical profession? Does it have to start from the political realm? Does it have to start from parenting? I just I feel like there is more than a way to because I'm an example of that. Well, let me let me respond to what you said. What makes people uncomfortable is a mandate. They feel like they have to take it for some reason to go to school, go to work. And then if they take it, if they're harmed, there's no recourse. There's no liability. There's, you know, there's there's indemnification in the manufacturer. So I say if the mandates go first, if, you know, we can't mandate that you swallow a pill or mandate you have a surgery, we certainly can't mandate that someone takes a vaccine. If the mandates drop and even if the liability protection is still there, then people can make a choice. And people can say, listen, if if there's there's no liability, you know, if there's no recourse, if something happens, I'm probably not going to take it. It'd be similar to renting a pair of skis. You may say, listen, you know, you rent the ski, rental, you know, there's no there's no liability for the guy who makes the skis that, you know, you may not ski. So people can make their own choices. Now, the 1986 liability legislation said the vaccines have unavoidable harm. And that's the reason why they have to have liability protection for the manufacturers, because no one would take them. And the vaccine manufacturers wouldn't take provide them because they have unavoidable harms. But we have to address that. That's really the the elephant in the room is the harms. And one of the ways to make large numbers of people harmed go away is to have fewer number of people take the product. There has to be targeted protection for people at risk. No, absolutely. And there has to be an honest discussion of what those risks are of the shots themselves. Boy, we've come full of circles. It's been very enlightening. Folks, you could still get the courage to face COVID-19. Dr. McCullough's book with John Lee courageous discourse and sub stack. And again, could follow him at p underscore McCullough MD on Twitter. Let's do this more often very enlightening. And thanks so much for joining us today. Good review. Thanks for having me. Oh boy, was there a lot to digest their mental illness, autism, transgenderism, leading to violence, and then what causes autism, or at least turbo charge is it. When you look at the depth of what these bastards have done to us, I mean, we used to think evil was Iran al Qaeda North Korea, even China, what the Western cabal has done to us. And for longer than we probably are willing to recognize it is truly unconscionable. And it really is the legacy of the Third Reich is the fourth Reich. Again, they were very sciency and, you know, medicine and science and cultured and advanced. Beware of evil embodied through a suit rather than a primitive uniform. Because those are the worst people imaginable. We need a full commission auditing everything we're doing. It's funny. Like, you know, Kevin McCarthy said he wants to have a debt commission. It's like, we don't need a commission on that. You see prima facia, what government does is wrong and right. This stuff is more complicated. We need a commission auditing vaccination mass vaccination, each one individually, the rationale, the safety, the efficacy, the confluence of multiple shots together. We need to start from scratch on this. We need an honest discussion. The trendy stuff is pretty, pretty obvious to cut someone's balls off ain't healthy. So I don't think we need to convince people on that. But we do need to fight it in the culture. And we will do as this rainbow Ramadan month proceeds.

God bless y'all. And thank you for listening. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come. But it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. Own The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind."
