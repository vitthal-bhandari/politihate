    "text": " Welcome to the show where we say better safe than sorry better to use the hazmat suit and not need it Then to not use it and need it. That's that's my motto. I say it all the time. It sounded like a broken record Let me just say about the coronavirus. There's a lot of unnecessary panic You don't need to panic. I want to be very clear about that You know the last thing that I would want to do is take part in that panic or drive that panic You know I for one and really about taking the whole thing and stride Now I do believe though in basic precautions, but nothing extraordinary nothing nothing Extreme okay, you wash your hands you practice good hygiene you wear a surgical mask 24 hours a day You kill anybody in your house who has a cold and burn their bodies in the backyard really basic stuff and frankly I'm talking about things that you should be doing anyway. So this is this is this is nothing out of the ordinary at all now Today on the show we have a lot to cover both literally and figuratively figuratively We're gonna start with the continued collapse of Western civilization Which is not just being brought about by the coronavirus But by you know I mean also in a cultural way and as far as culture goes I have two different videos that have gone viral over the past few days that I think evidence Are evidence of the cultural collapse of Western civilization always a fun topic We'll talk about that and we'll go through five headlines, which include of course election news coronavirus news and one story about California You know California really focusing on the important things in this case. They're passing a law requiring retailers to have gender neutral Space in their toys in their toy sections. So very very important also in our daily cancellation I'll be canceling a prestigious academic institution and in our email segment an emailer has Written to me to tell me why I'm wrong about something those are always my favorite emails. So we'll listen to that. Okay So let's get going and actually I guess I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do the whole show in the mask mainly because it's making my glasses fog up which I hadn't which I hadn't Factored in so I'm risking my life for you people right now. That's what I that's what I'm that's that's the kind of dedication. I have to you by the way I'm not sure if I mention this yet, but Stop me if you've heard this one before but I do have a new book out called church of cowards Which is right here behind my hand sanitizer, which I have with me handy at all times And you know the feedback on this book has been Really encouraging it's it's it's kind of a nerve-racking thing to write a book in general because you're putting yourself out there It's a very personal Sort of thing and if people don't like it then it might make you cry But in this case the feedback has been great and I do appreciate that especially because the book confronts The reader it is a confrontational book in some ways and so you never sure how people are gonna react to that but As I said the feedbacks be great. So please give it a read church of cowards if you haven't yet now on to the collapse of the West A video was posted to the social media site tiktok Few days ago and that video shows a woman laughing and smiling as she goes into have her child murdered at Planned Parenthood It's it's implied that In the video is implied. This is her second abortion. So this is her second go around But this is pretty infuriating. I'm warning you if you haven't seen it yet, but take a look at this How do you feel actually Don't be scared Okay, and yeah, I had to take off the whole suit because it was getting kind of hot I decided that I'd rather I'd rather get coronavirus than than be uncomfortable. That's a decision that I made now You saw the video there the first thing to realize though with a video like that is that it's it's not an isolated thing This is part of a trend on the left You may recall shout your abortion the shout your abortion campaign a few years ago Which is ongoing and the goal is to is to get women to be happy about their abortions to brag about them to treat them as as either completely frivolous and meaningless or as an actual joyful act something to be happy about and the media in Hollywood are in on the act and they're constantly trying to promote this Idea this version of abortion maybe you remember that episode of the show scandal on ABC Few years ago that showed a woman getting an abortion while silent night played in the background This was a Christmas episode. I believe so it was supposed to be this Inspirational and heroic moment and that's how the pro-abortion side wants us to see abortion heroic happy or as I said at a minimum Meaningless and frivolous they'll take that too that that also works now You'll notice something back 20 years ago Pro-abortion used to say that their goal was to make abortion safe legal and rare right Well, that's out the window now and has been for years Yeah, they wanted to be legal still obviously through all stages of pregnancy and they want they say they wanted to be safe Although the idea of the safe abortion is a contradiction in terms because every single abortion kills at least one person Unless it unless it fails every successful abortion kills at least one person then unless it fails and the baby survives But we know of course that in that case The baby can be put to the side of the room and left to die and that's what Democrats want to happen Which is why they voted down a bill that would have stopped that from happening last week So contradiction terms of for safe abortion, but Pro-abortion will still go around talking about the safe abortion what they don't talk about is a rare They don't say they want rare rare is out the window You're not allowed to call for rare abortions anymore. That's a that's a good way to get evicted expelled Exiled from the left if you do that in a similar way we used to be told that abortion is a sad and somber Affair it's it's something that they we used to be told Nobody wants to get abortion. It's it's a very sad thing and so we should we should be sad about it But it's it may be necessary and this is a choice that a woman has to make that used to be the the way that Abortion was presented but now Not so much now that's been exchanged for Champagne and confetti and giggling girls walking into a Planned Parenthood filming whimsical viral videos about it the reason for this change is obvious and Even though it's hideously evil it actually makes a lot of sense in terms of strategy Because the pro-abortion side realized that wait a second if we admit that abortion is sad and We say that we want it to happen less often Then the obvious question is raised next why you know why is it sad? Why do you want it to happen less often? What is it about abortion that makes even you as a pro-abortion person say that it's sad and it shouldn't happen very often Well, the answer is because you're killing a person If it's not killing a person if it really is just a clump of cells a parasitic Organism that a woman is expelling from her body then there's nothing sad about it And there's no reason to say we should it should be rare If anything that should happen more often right and that's what the pro-abortion side realizes and so they said forget all that sad stuff Forget all that rare stuff abortion is actually awesome That's what we're being told now now another point to be made here as we continue but first a word from our friends over at noon, you know The thing about about getting healthy is it's it's it's not an either-or thing. It's not it's not just about losing weight or just about gaining muscle. It's really mind and body health is a is a Is a total sort of experience where you want to be a healthy person overall and that's what noon is focused on They're focused on helping you be a healthy person Across the board not just in one facet of health and because everyone is different what noon is going to do is they're going to adjust their service to your lifestyle and to who you are which is what you need there can't be a cookie cutter approach to this It's really just about changing habits You know we all have bad habits and that's what leads us to being unhealthy I know that's the case for me and so how do you get rid of those bad habits and replace them with good habits? That's what the goal of of of noon is and that's what they're going to do Nume is not a diet. It's a healthy and easy to stick to way of life No food is good or bad or off limits. It's not like that. Nume just teaches moderation and all things Which is a which is a good skill to learn in general in life You don't have to change it all in one day small steps make big progress sign up for your trial today at nume.com slash walls That's n o o m Dot com slash walls What do you have to lose visit nume.com slash walls to start your trial today? That's nume.com slash walls n o o m Dot com slash walls Okay talking about uh that vile TikTok video I've always said that many women who get abortions are themselves victims I think that's an important point because They are exploited and lied to by the abortion industry um In so many cases you're talking about young poor girls Who go into these clinics? Um, they don't have any parents at home or or their parents are pressuring them into getting the abortion There's no man in the picture the father's not in the picture or else he's also pressuring And uh, they don't know what their options are Um, there's a lot of confusion and fear and everything they walk into the Into the clinic many times because they've been told that you know plan parenthood cares about women And if if you're a woman in a in a difficult situation go to plan parenthood and they care about you they're going to try to help you And so they walk in thinking that that's what's going to happen And then plan parenthood or the abortion clinic whatever clinic it is They descend like vultures And they they feast on the confusion and fear of this girl To try to convince her to kill her child Knowing that she's going to live a life of regret and guilt because of it But they don't care because they get the money and that's all they that's all that they are really worried about Uh, so That's why I say In that case The woman is also a victim. I'm not saying she has zero moral culpability for the choice she's making But she's also a victim and I think we need to turn our attention to the abortion clinic as the primary villain here But in other cases women who get abortions are simply murderous psychopaths and This is one of those cases Either that or this is a desperate attempt on her part to convince herself That she doesn't need to feel guilty. This is a rationalization Which so much of this shout your abortion stuff. That's exactly what it is They're not talking to you You know, the woman's not really talking to you. She's not really trying to convince you. She's trying to convince herself Um, so it could be that But the fact that this is her second abortion Apparently and the approach she's taking to it makes me think that this is the case This is the case of a psychopath killing her child and feeling nothing about it And there are many psychopaths on the pro-abortion side the abortion doctors for example Many of them I believe are clinical psychopaths. Now. I want to show you this. Um, here's a quote-unquote doctor Joe nelson on twitter a few days ago. He's an abortionist That is a medical serial killer And um here he is responding to another abortionist who is expressing similar views And nelson says This captures beautifully the reality that I see every day abortion is so often an act of selflessness and love Of going through a difficult process and braving others and even self-judgment in order to help somebody Uh, even if that somebody is your future self hashtag abortion is love These are the words of a psychopath abortion is love That's This is someone who doesn't even understand the concept of being selfless Because even putting aside the fact that abortion is evil and killing someone By definition if you're doing something to help yourself, it is not selfless even if it's a good thing It's not selfless eating a healthy diet is a good thing. Is it a selfless act? Of course not you're doing it for yourself Now when you consider that in this case, we're talking about killing somebody your own child Um for your sake in order to have to live a more comfortable life. That is the diametric opposite of selflessness That is exactly opposed to selflessness But uh, this is something that this guy doesn't understand because he's a psychopath And he has to be I think you have to be a psychopath to do this for a living imagine going to your job every day Going to work clocking in you know at at seven o'clock in the morning And then just setting about on the task of killing children all day I There's no way to not be a psychopath and do that job you wouldn't be able to survive Uh, okay Now I also wanted to play this for you while we're on the subject like I said of videos that illustrate the collapse of western society Here's a video. Uh, maybe you saw on on friday. I wrote a thing about it It's a video from a drag brunch And a drag brunch is a thing that white liberals go to where they eat brunch and they watch a man Dress like a woman dance badly Um, and this is something they you know, they enjoy going to for some reason Only at this brunch somebody brought their kid and the kid was was brought to the front of the of the festivities put on a chair And the drag queen dance suggestively For the child And the whole scene looks exactly like It would at a at a bachelor party where you've got the you know, the the the guy um sitting there in a in a Chair while the stripper is dancing r so it's exact same kind of thing Except in this case, it's a drag queen and what looks to be maybe a six or seven year old girl Uh, watch You're Revolting vile evil infuriating All those words and many others come to mind. We're going to talk about this in just a second But before we do Um, I want to check in with our good friends over at rock auto You know, the thing about cars today is that they're way more complicated today than then Then they have been in the past even even you know growing up Uh cars are just getting more and more complicated part of that is because of all the computers that are now in cars Uh everything, you know, it's like our phones are also getting way more complicated And in so many cases It's because the phone wants to do a million things that have nothing to do with actually making phone calls Well, it's the same thing with cars And that's what makes it so difficult if you need auto parts to go to a chain store and find what you're looking for Because there are so many different things Uh, it can be just a difficult way of fighting what you want Chain stores also have different price tiers depending on who you are if you're a professional or you're a do it yourself for Rock auto dot com mix it all easier and they're not they're not doing that. It's not about uh, they're not they're not going to try to Build you if you're if you're not a professional. They've got everything you could possibly need Very easy to navigate Remarkably low prices and it's all right there for you rock auto dot com Has everything from engine control modules and brake parts to tail lamps motor oil new carpet everything you want Go to rock auto dot com right now See all the parts available for your car truck Right walsh in there. How did you hear about us box so that they know that i sent you Okay, so the video of the um Drag queen dancing for the For the little girl First thing obviously you know what i'm going to say this is a child abuse And everybody all the adults in that room in that video should be go should should be going to prison In a sane and just society what you would see in that video at the end are a bunch of police officers breaking the door down And uh, cuffing those people and and throwing them in the patty wagon or bringing them into jail. That's what should happen and if you Somehow don't agree or you or you don't see how this is child abuse then keep in mind that Drag shows are burlesque. It's a it's burlesque except that the only difference is that it's men pretending to be women Well, let me ask you Do you think it'd be appropriate To bring a six-year-old to a burlesque show in in vegas with women I mean would anybody do that? If someone did do that would would anyone else you know defend it No We would all agree that it you know of course if you're an adult you want to go to burlesque show You're you're free to do that. That's that's that's you you can do that But uh to bring your child is completely crazy now But okay now we we we replace those women with men and all of a sudden it's family friendly. Does that make any sense? It's the same thing with child drag queens We would all agree. I hope I assume that to have a seven-year-old recruited by a burlesque troop would be exploitation and and and and pedophilic and and just Horrible nobody would agree with that Yet it's okay if it's a boy So it would be we would all agree wrong for a seven-year-old girl to perform burlesque, but a boy can do it Makes absolutely no sense So clearly this is child abuse, but there's another thing I wanted I wanted to focus on in that video And that uh, that's the the men in the background You saw that whole line of men sitting at tables with big stupid grins on their face watching while this happens and I really believe that the story of child exploitation in our culture and the proliferation of child sexual abuse the normalization of it the mainstreaming of it is largely a story of men of fathers and of husbands failing to do their job as men These are these are moral unics. These are emasculated pathetic Spinalous jellyfish Who are just sitting there? Not only tolerating Um, this abuse of a child, but actually cheering it on Now if those were real men And what I mean by real men, I mean men not just in the biological sense, but also men who who are interested in and capable of Fulfilling their duty as men in the culture Um, then what they would be doing is they'd be grab grabbing that drag queen by the collar if he has a collar and uh Dragging him out of the room And kicking him out on his ass out of the room and then calling the police That would be the appropriate response of a man instead those people Just sit there Applauding You know, if you're if you're a real man a real father and a real husband and your wife comes to you And says hey, there's a drag brunch You know, why don't we go to that and bring and bring and bring Sally with us bring seven-year-old Sally with us to the drag brunch The response from a man should be um words to the effect of though may be stronger than hell. No, are you crazy? We're not going. She's not going and you're not going. That's not gonna happen Instead what these men apparently said is yeah, well gee, honey. That sounds great. That sounds like a splendid afternoon Let's go. Let's go to the drag brunch I mean, even if you're not bringing a child let's take the child out of it What kind of man goes to a drag brunch in the first place? Child or not and then you throw the child into it and Just makes the whole thing even more grotesque All right, um, let's uh, let's move I can't dwell on that too much without my my head actually exploding Which I don't want that to happen on on camera. Um So let's move on. Let's go to headlines here are five headlines, uh, worth knowing about number one Joe Biden of course won the democratic primary in south carolina on saturday giving him his first I think it's his first primary win ever in three presidential contests So big moment for him and this will maybe give him some momentum heading into uh tomorrow That's what i'm told anyway by all the pundits. It's momentum for super tuesday It'll come down either to biden or mernie of course the top two candidates top two candidates with a combined age of 155 So if you put them together, they add up to somebody who Um would have been born around the time when lee surrendered to grant at apomatics That's that's how old these two people are. This is what the democrats have come up with. This is the best they can do Two guys who are unlikely to survive their first terms in office and quite likely to go senile in the process One in six people over the age of 80 are senile that's almost 20 And the life expectancy for a 75 year old man in the us is 10 years So he's he's likely on average to live in other 10 years um now so Which means that both of them um In their second term they're they're they're in the red zone so to speak if they if they if they have but even in their first term The likelihood based on that average the likelihood that they die During their first summer in office is really substantial And that's when you factor in that you know things like the the average of of people who go senile at 80 and uh life expectancy You know this is factoring in for the most part These are normal older people who are retired for the most part and are just living basically stress-free lives Now think you've got a We're talking about an old man an elderly man who's not only employed full-time But has one of the most stressful jobs in the world Is that going to help or hurt his chances of beating the odds and surviving And staving off dementia Meanwhile bernie's got a bad heart's already had a heart attack Biden is visibly confused and flustered and I don't say that as a joke. I mean he really is losing it And this is what we this is the best we've got meanwhile as as people have pointed out online um This makes This makes donald trump The youngest male in the field at 73 years old. He's the youngest man Which now i'm anticipating a future cnn headline of you know something like As as the youngest male candidate in the field does donald trump have the experience to be president Something like you think i'm joking. I am sort of joking But that something like that is going to be That headline i guarantee from from one of these outlets. We're gonna see something like that Meanwhile, of course, we mourn the death of a peat buddajid's campaign. He dropped out on sunday night Realizing that all you could do at this point was siphon votes from from biden And so he figures better to have a comparatively You know to have a crazy old but comparatively moderate democrat rather than a crazy old socialist and that's the calculation he's making Here's what i'll say about buddajid to his credit The man was a cheap imitation of obama. He was a derivative hack Uh a heretic who bastardized scripture for his own ends as well as a moral coward Maybe i'm confused about what the phrase to his credit means. I don't know Number two the state of california faces a number of crises all at once um drug addiction homelessness Now it even has the coronavirus to contend with but thank god the lawmakers in that state are really focused on the important issues Uh because you know staving off a pandemic rescuing people from the throes of drug addiction dealing with homelessness These all pale in comparison to the scourge of gender segregated toy stores and that's what california is trying to fix They they worked out a bill. It's being it's proposed working its way through the state legislator Um that would require large retail apartment stores to have gender neutral space for Clothing toys any anything for kids Um, which means that basically the goal is to make it harder for shoppers to find what they're looking for because that's all it's going to do Because no matter what you do No matter what kind of engineering you try socially No matter how much you insist otherwise Girls generally want girly stuff and boys generally want boy stuff There's no law requiring You know girls to play with dolls and boys to play with trucks. There's no law I don't I don't think society is super focused on forcing boys to play with trucks That's just how it works out. I've seen this play out in my own family and I've had a somewhat unique view as as um Someone who you know our first kids were boy girl twins So they were raised in the same home same environment They were in the same room. They had access to the same play room. All the toys were right there You know I we never said to our son here are the boy toys. You must play with those You understand me son? We never said that to our one-year-old son never said We would just let them lose into the playroom play with whatever toys you want And what do you know nine times out of ten? The boy goes for the truck. He goes for the action figures. He goes for the ball He goes for that kind of stuff and the girl goes for the pink frilly stuff for the dolls for all that You know the kitchen the toy kitchen set the the hairbrush That's how let's what they do We didn't force it on them. We didn't brainwash them into it. They just do that And so when you when you when you uh and that's why these items are typically segregated in stores because it's just easier for the shoppers Because that's what their kids want anyway Uh, and now you're just making it more difficult you look at target Target a few years ago made a big deal about they were gonna go gender neutral They're not gonna have a girl section in a boy section anymore But yet if you go to target they still do have a girl section in a boy section They just don't label it girl and boy But they have the girl stuff here in the boy stuff there And the reason they do that is because that's what the shoppers want because that's what the kids want because that's just natural Number three according to new data just released almost half of americans 42 are obese So this is like a ritual now every three months we get a story updating us on the number of fat people and that number is going up Now I agree of course that there are a lot of fat people walking around out there Or maybe not walking. Maybe that's part of the problem But I do also think that this This epidemic of obesity might be slightly exaggerated And I only say that because if you if you go look at a chart online Of what they consider overweight and obese to be Depending on height You're gonna find they they you know, they don't give you a lot of room so to speak pun intended They don't they don't give you there's there's there's not a lot of room in the healthy range It's a very strict very small range that's healthy and then and then beyond that you're overweight. So for example for me I'm about six foot one And well, you know, I'm like six and a half. I call myself six one and I I was just looking at one of these charts The claim is that the optimal weight for me is 140 pounds to 180 pounds 140 pounds for a six foot one inch man is considered optimal according to Doctors Now I haven't been 140 pounds since like 10th grade If I was 140 pounds, I would be skin and bones. I would look like Skeletor I would look like uh, tom hanks and castaway after three years on the island That I I can't even imagine being that there's no way that's healthy And you know, I I tend to be of the belief that I managed to have a little bit of meat on the bones He's supposed to be protector and provider If i'm just this this this this skeletal figure Wandering around the house You know, I stub my toe and break my entire foot kind of thing. I'm not gonna be a lot of use to my family so um You know, that's what they consider according to that Range, I'm actually I'm overweight. I might be obese. I don't feel overweight. I don't think I necessarily look overweight But that's what they say. So I keep that in mind when they talk about the obese Obesity epidemic. I think I'm I guess I'm getting lumped in with that Who knows? Maybe I deserve it. I do enjoy cinnabon. I admit Number four and the list of countries who have been hit by the coronavirus is now at 60 60 countries have been reported cases as Belarus, Lithuanian, New Zealand, Nigeria Azerbaijan The Netherlands all joined in the fray in the past 48 hours or so. Meanwhile, the total cases in the us has risen to above 70 I do think we should keep something in mind even though I was wearing a hazmat suit to start the show A couple of things first of all Most of the deaths are older people who are already in poor health with with compromised immune systems um So You know in other words These are not Young Healthy people who are dying of this illness The people that's especially at risk of dying from coronavirus are the same people who are at risk from dying from the flu and many other illnesses For most people who have had it the experience is like having a bad cold you have a fever you have a cough In fact the washington post over the weekend ran in an op-ed from someone who has the coronavirus and is now Quarantine has been quarantined for many days And uh, he said it's not that bad. He just you know, he's had a fever. He's had a cough. He's you know The biggest challenge is just being bored being Quarantined all this time. So um That's that's an important fact here and that's not to say that it isn't so bad for everybody It's just that if you're relatively young and healthy It probably wouldn't be so bad for you The death rate according to the information that I saw the death rate is 10 times higher among the elderly So that just gives you an idea also something else to remember second thing The death rate the mortality rate of two or three percent That's based on recorded cases And the thing about recorded cases is that for one thing most of them are in china where the health care system is in shambles That's going to inflate the mortality rate. Also more to the point There are almost certainly it is reasonable to assume Thousands and thousands and thousands of people who've who've had the coronavirus, especially before it was all over the headlines You know had symptoms of a cough and a fever Never went to the doctor or did go to the doctor and weren't tested for the coronavirus because it didn't seem like a serious illness and recovered And are out living their lives and they don't count as an official case The point is if we actually knew the exact number of everyone who's had the coronavirus And then we were to compare that to the number of people who've died from it I think the mortality rate would be much much lower People who are dying now you might say well, maybe there are people who have died from it and don't count as recorded cases Yeah, there probably are some But if you're dying from an illness if you're that Ill You're much more likely to go to the doctor and they're much more likely to run all kinds of tests to find out what's wrong with you So there's a much greater likelihood that those people in that category The people that are going to end up as unfortunately in the in the in the death statistic They're much more likely to go to the doctor The ones who are not going to end up in that statistic are much less likely to go and so you see how that affects it um The number that I saw is uh is researchers now are saying taking all this into account They're saying that maybe the death rate is around 1% Maybe but even that is highly speculative and we don't have enough of a sample size yet to know So i'm just and I don't know either So I don't know that there are thousands of cases that are unreported It just seems logical to assume that When you consider what the symptoms are Now um five Finally, uh, you know the entire country has caught up in a fiery debate It's a debate that uh is is is deeply philosophical But also it seems quite personal to a lot of people And it stems from this question that somebody posted online take a look at this it says Is the jar the kool-aid man or the liquid? So when when we think of the kool-aid man What is he? What is his essence? Is he a jar that happens to have kool-aid in it or is he kool-aid that rides around in a jar? And you may think that the answer is obvious at first But stop to think about this for a second because we call him the kool-aid man, not the jar man But then again he has a mouth eyes nose could could could liquid have any of those things So this is quite the metaphysical dilemma. Let me tell you how I sort through this and i've i've thought about this a lot I might write my right my next book about it Um When I think of the kool-aid man, I'm not focused on kool-aid. I'm focused on man He's a man. We're told What is a man? What is a man's essence? Well, we are a harmony. We are a unity of body and soul And You know, am I my soul or am I my body? That's the question. Well, the answer is on both I am my body. I am my soul the fundamental reality of the kool-aid man um is That you know, he is a jar And he is also liquid Can the liquid live on without the jar? That's a different question entirely it brings us into a debate about the afterlife and whether beverages are included in the divine promise of salvation I tend to think that conscious beverages probably are but you know, that's a different discussion for a different day um But this is where that's how I sort through the kool-aid question. All right now Moving on finally to our daily cancellation Today on the chopping block the university of liver pool a twitter account called liver pool resistors posted this picture a few days ago And uh, what we see here as someone on the campus Has allegedly posted this sign with a rainbow flag that says genital preferences are transphobic What they're saying is that if you're a straight man who's attracted to people with female genitalia then you're transphobic Or you're a straight woman attracted to people with male genitalia you're transphobic Or if you're a gay person attracted to the same genitalia, you're also transphobic You must have no preferences whatsoever when it comes to sex if you do then you're transphobic Now in fairness, I say i'm canceling the university. I don't think that university put this sign up I don't think they had anything to do with it But i'm still canceling university because they're part of the problem culturally In helping to create a society where this kind of madness um proliferates Now, I don't think i have to explain why It is not in fact transphobic to be attracted to a particular sex To have a sexual orientation And I don't think I have to mention that this kind of thinking the thinking displayed in this poster Shows how trans ideology is cannibalizing the other constituencies of of the left We already know what it's doing to feminism How how trans ideology is destroying everything that feminists have gained But here we see now that by this logic a gay man is actually morally flawed He's committing a sin By being attracted to other men. That's what this sign is saying Because by this logic what what the trans ideology is is is claiming is that a gay man Must also be attracted to women or else he's committed a a moral evil of some kind So the very tiny trans minority is just running roughshod Over the rest of the left destroying everything they've worked for But I don't need to explain it that here's what I do want to mention According to the me to movement To extort sex out of somebody through emotional manipulation or guilt is rape That's what the me to movement says Now, I don't think it's rape necessarily. You know, it's wrong. It's evil. It's perverse to do it It's degrading and exploitative and many other things But I'm crazy enough to think that that rape is a particular thing rape is the use of violence or the threat of violence To force somebody to have sex. That's what that's what rape is Um, there are other forms of immoral sex other forms of sex that do not honor or respect the dignity of of the human person You know, there are many other forms that aren't necessarily rape rape is a particular thing And that's what rape is in my view, but we're not talking about my view I'm saying according to the me to movement and the sort of mainstream Perspective on these things now. It is rape. It is actual rape to use emotional manipulation to get sex out of somebody Well, what do you call it? When you tell someone they're transphobic for not being attracted to you When someone doesn't want to have sex with you and you scream at them and call them a bigot And tell them the only way to prove they're not a big it is to have sex with you Well, what is that? According to the new rules, that's rape So this sign is an advertisement for rape. It is an apology for rape It is the promotion the advocacy of rape. That's what that sign is And that's why the university of liver pools canceled All right, we're going to um wrap things up here but first I wanted to mention one thing We ran out of time for the for the email segment I'm I'm changing the way that I do the email segment a little bit. Some people have asked Asked me about it. Why am I not doing it as much? Well, I've decided I want to change it a little bit Here's what I like about the well, look, if you if you want to Send feedback about the show Getting touched with me for any reason especially said me compliments I'm always a big fan of that so matt wall show at gmail.com. You can still do that But as far as the show goes What I want that segment to be is um a time for To focus on arguments against What I have said on the show So we might even call the segment, you know why i'm wrong Maybe i'll call it that And i'm going to reserve it for one or two. Maybe just one if it's a really good argument Um email from someone who's arguing against something that i've said On the show or in one of the articles i've written So i'm so you know, it's i don't want this show to just be an echo chamber Where i pontificate unopposed as fun as that is i don't want it to just be that So, when you watch any show if i make an argument you disagree with Email me and uh and then maybe i'll read it on the show I'm not going to give you the last word i'll admit because i am going to respond So you won't get the last word, but you will get a word at least and before we wrap up Um and that's again the emails matt wall show at gmail.com Before we wrap up You know, we want to hear from you about this tell us who do you think will win the democratic nomination?
