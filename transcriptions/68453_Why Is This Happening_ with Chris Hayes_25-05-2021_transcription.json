    "text": " These kids are 15, 16, 17, and their state is saying that they're wrong. Their existence is wrong. And I don't know what that does to the psyche of a 16 year old to have to have your state basically say that who you are and what you're doing is illegal. Hello and welcome to Why Is This Happening with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Well, as we've been covering on the show and a bit here on the podcast, it's been fascinating not to mention kind of disturbing, even horrifying to watch the priorities of the Republican Party post, post January 6 and post the election because obviously they can't set the agenda at the national level because they don't control either houses of Congress or the White House, but they do control a lot of state legislatures. There's two dozen states or maybe a little fewer than that, where they have both houses, the state legislature and the governorship. And so they can set the agenda. And basically like the two big agenda items for Republican state governments are changing voting laws by and large, making it harder to vote, knocking people off voter rolls, reducing the amount of hours the polls are open as they did in Iowa, the infamous Georgia bill, which made it a criminal infraction to give water to people online to vote, et cetera, et cetera. So that's one bucket of things. And the other are legislating and regulating trans children in two specific ways. One, a real obsession with trans sports, barring trans students from participating in sports and trans health care, health care, basically barring making either more difficult or in some cases, just explicitly criminalizing what's kind of be known as gender for bring care for trans youth. You've seen this in a number of states. In some states, you've had a situation, for instance, an Arkansas in which people were successfully able to lobby the Republican governor into vetoing legislation like this, but then that veto was overridden by super majorities in the state legislature. There's been several states in which Republican governors themselves have at the last minute veto this legislation regarding trans health care because it is so destructive, it can have such calamitous on intended consequences. But one thing that I've found in talking about this issue on air and in reading about it is, you know, the particulars of what this actually means, like on the ground or a little obscure, I think there's these sort of twin balances. I think one is that folks understand that there's this sort of long and gross obsession in mainstream culture and among folks who are not trans with like, you know, the specifics of the biology of trans folks, you know, like, what exactly is happening physically with trans folks? And there's this kind of like fetishistic and gross and dehumanizing aspect to that. So people are wary of engaging in that rightly so, but there is also this sort of real question about like, what does this health care mean and what does it look like? And what do you say to people who raise objections to it? Sometimes who don't sound like bigoted monsters, they sound like people with maybe good faith objections or worries about the hands that children will be in in terms of making decisions about their bodies. And so I thought it would be great just to talk to someone who just on the ground does this health care. Like, what are we talking about when we are talking about gender affirming care? What does it mean? How does the process work? How are decisions made? What do children say and do and what is and isn't reversible? And then how this legislation would affect trans kids and their families across the country. And Dr. Izzy Lowell is just such a person. Dr. Lowell is a family medicine physician at a place called Queer Med. The Dr. Lowell founded, which specializes in transgender medicine and treats trans patients in Alabama and across the southeast and in a lot of places where their health care is now under assault. And Dr. Lowell, it's great to having the program. Chris, thanks so much. It's really an honor to be here. Yeah. I'm Dr. Izzy Lowell. My pronouns are she and her. And before I jump, we get started. What pronouns do you use? I use he and him. And thank you. I was I was I was repeating Dr. Lowell because I was actually not sure. So thank you. Absolutely. And you can call me Izzy. I'll call you Chris. You can call me Izzy. Great. I'll call you Izzy. Yeah. So so maybe let's start with your just your a little bit of your personal story where you grew up and how you how you got in a medicine and you became a doctor. Well, I grew up outside of Boston in Massachusetts. And originally wanted to be a math teacher. I thought I'd be a math teacher. So I do want you to do that podcast on the on Godals incompleteness theorem when you get a chance. You really are a fan. That's that's a deep cut. And I will try to do that, although I will embarrass myself because that's like lost forbidden knowledge of a 20 year old version of myself that I can't reclaim. But then, you know, after college, I sort of search around for the thing that fit and came up with medicine as a way to really help people in the sort of most fundamental way. And so a couple of years after college, I went back to school and, you know, became a family physician. And after my training, after my residency training, I moved down here to Atlanta to be closer to my partner's family and joined the Emory family medicine program. I was a faculty member there. And while I was there, realized that there was an unmet need for transgender people in the Southeast. So I started a gender clinic at Emory in about 2015. And at first it was there weren't very many people there. And then word sort of spread and became very popular and people were traveling from all over the Southeast to see me. I was just a family doctor providing this clinic once or twice a month. And so I said, this, this, there's got to be a better way. So I eventually left Emory in 2017 to found queer med where we provide telemedicine services now across 10 states in the Southeast to just get people better access to this care. Well, that's fascinating. You know, I know this is not at all the point of this podcast, but it is interesting. You mentioned telemedicine because I do feel like one of the effects of this pandemic is acclimating to it, people to it and getting more comfortable with it. And I've actually found it really useful. Like in the kind of most banal circumstances, it's like there's a nagging thing that you would put off a doctor's appointment to, because it's a big commitment of time that I would do a telemedicine. But for what you're talking about, it must be kind of a game changer, I would imagine to have access to you and your consultations and your practice, you know, and not have to drive seven hours. Absolutely. The patient who sticks in my mind, who really inspired me to start this, I remember it was, they were the last patient right before lunch and I was hungry and cranky and, and they were a couple minutes late. They were like 15 minutes late and finally got him in the room and I, I went in, you know, grumpy and right away, he stood up and said, Dr. Law, I'm so sorry to be late. I've been driving for six hours from Western Tennessee, you know, I'm so sorry. And that really put things in perspective for me and kind of changed how I was thinking about it. And this was back, you know, 2015, 2016 before the pandemic and telemedicine was kind of an equalizer and, and such a game changer for access for people for all sorts of different things, but especially for sort of generally discriminated against or disregarded populations by, by the major medical field. You know, it strikes me as you talk about your patients and the kind of sacrifices they're making to come see you in person and, and the sort of degree to which there's an unmet demand and underserved patients that, you know, one of the things I think, one of the sort of stories that people, particularly on the right, but not exclusively on the right, have told about the development of trans rights and trans equality is that this is essentially a kind of like a fad or a sort of cultural fashion that's like seizing the minds of young people who like want to fit in. And I just wonder if you could talk about like what the circumstances of the lives of your patients are throughout the Southeast when they are coming to you and what their life world is like as the backdrop for what they're experiencing vis-a-vis their gender and their, and their selves. Well, to start with, that's a great question. To start with some of the statistics, over a third of patients have been discriminated against or refused to care or verbally or even physically abused by medical professionals according to large nationwide surveys done in 2014. That's just the data. Personally, my patients, I've had dozens and dozens of patients describe some of their experiences. For example, someone said she, she had a broken arm and she, she went to see her doctor for, for her hormone therapy. And the doctor said, you know, sure, I'll treat you for a broken arm, but I'm not going to treat you for that. And that was one of the most benign examples. Other patients have been kicked out of the doctor's office. I had a patient who reported that when, when they called our office, we were the 11th provider they had called that morning and nobody else would agree to treat them. And this is in the Atlanta area. For patients in rural locations, there are just zero options. People get told highly unpleasant things when they call and try to ask for an appointment. And so it's, it's real. And my patients have experienced being turned away by multiple practices in the areas that they live. So I want to talk about gender affirming care, both for adults and for children. And obviously children has been the emphasis of this kind of real, like political attack and legislative and regulatory attack. But I wonder if you can just talk us through like, what's that term mean in real terms? What's the sort of portfolio of care that, that, that you're providing and that patients are seeking from you? Well, it depends a lot on the patient's age. So gender affirming care for a child who hasn't entered puberty yet really is all about the social environment. And there's something called social transition. So that child can live in their desired gender where clothes like that gender adopt a name more consistent with that gender, be just for all intensive purposes, treated as a member of that gender. Things start to change once they start puberty. And that's when we would talk about starting a puberty blocker to either gain them a few years more of making sure that their gender identity is certain. And then at some point for a teenager or for an adult, we would start them on cross hormone therapy. So for someone assigned female at birth, that would be testosterone. And for someone assigned male at birth, that would be estrogen. And what are those consultations like? I mean, I think to the extent that people, again, I'm trying to sort of speak to an audience that I know is out there because they're in my inbox, who I think consider themselves enlightened and open-minded people, but have some anxiety or worries about the decision making of children, which I think is not crazy. But I just to talk through like what that actual conversation and consultation is like when you're talking about 10 year olds or 11 year olds and the choice to go on on puberty blockers or begin cross hormone therapy. It's a great question. And it's something that I take very seriously and have thought at length about in my career. It's a long consultation that initially we go through their whole medical history, their whole gender history. And in terms of making it the diagnosis, quote unquote, even though it's not a medical problem in medicine, we like to diagnose everything, even if it's normal. So we quote unquote, diagnose gender dysphoria is the medical term for that for the discomfort of being in the wrong gender. In brief, the components of that are some gender identity that's consistent, meaning that it's been consistent over time, persistent and insistent. So it's something that has been there for a long time for that person and causes distress, the insistence of it. If someone came to me and said, I'm in a male body, but I feel like I'm a woman, but it doesn't bother me. I'd say, great, we don't need to do anything, but it's that distress. It's that extreme discomfort of feeling like you're in the wrong body that we can do something about with hormone therapy. And it's a great question. It's the question that everyone wants to talk about is, is how can we let a 10 year old, 11 year old make a decision about this, something so momentous? And it's tough. But what I would say to people is, yeah, I didn't know a lot of things when I was 10 or 12 or 20. I didn't know my sexuality. I didn't know if I wanted to have kids or not. I didn't know some huge decisions about major life things, but I did know what gender I was. If you think back, you know, when did you first know that you were a boy? It's early on, it's beyond the extent of our memories. We just grow up always knowing that. You can't kind of identify it, right? I mean, I'm trying to, I'm actually thinking back now and it's like, right. It's so it's an invisible essence that is there before any conscious knowledge of it is in my own personal case. Right. You've always you've you like the vast majority of people have always known that. And no one ever asked you when you were 12 or 11 to say, you know, are you sure you want to continue on to become a man? No, is that really what you want to do? It's something that's so so given that that was your gender and that was your path through puberty and and developing into an adult. And I think the same is for a lot of these children, not all of them, but many children, parents bring them in and say, oh, we've known that that she's a girl since she was four. And the child knows that the parents know that many of the cases are absolutely straightforward. Everybody knows that this person is a girl. She just needs some medical assistance to to become a woman. Some cases are more complicated, but in a lot of cases, it's pretty simple. Can I this is a sort of devil's advocate question and it's also a question that I think about a lot because we're getting, I think, to some of the root here. And again, I think it's just important to distinguish. I think there's people who are just like a very kind of close-minded reactionary and bigoted views about this and and and are, you know, engaged in something fundamentally like kind of in bad faith and dangerous. I don't really want to engage with them. And then I think there's this sort of a category of people that don't that aren't that way and are still sort of confused or conflicted. So I'm sort of speaking to those group, but you know, there's this question right where we're talking about like what gender is and what its essences are. And we say a girl or a boy and like, I do sometimes wonder if like, there's almost a part of it that feels like reifying of certain specifics when you say, well, part of the way that we know this person is a girl is this person wants to wear girl clothing or play in certain ways with certain, you know, quote unquote, girl toys. And I guess part of me sort of feels like, well, that's are we like, reifying the boundaries of gender in so far as we're saying that that says something essential about what your this individual child's gender is? That's that's a really good distinction. I'm glad you brought that up because there are two different things we're talking about here. What you're talking about is gender nonconforming. So that could be like the way that someone dresses or the toys that they choose to play with or the career that they choose to go in or how they interact with people or any number of things could be gender nonconforming. Like a boy who likes to play with dolls and wear dresses. But that boy might say, yeah, I like to play with dolls and wear dresses, but I'm a boy. Right. The difference comes when that person says, I am a girl and I want to have a girl body and I want to grow up to be a woman, a woman. And not all transgender people are gender conforming toward their target gender. You know, I have a patient who told me, yeah, you know, I put on my, my pants and my boots and I go out and mow the lawn just like any other woman, you know, not all transgender people become extreme versions of their target gender either. They can be gender nonconforming as well. So, so the key difference is is gender nonconforming behavior, but still wanting to remain in their gender-side at birth versus someone who says, I am this or I am that. And that the adjective you use of it, uh, insistence that it's insistent. I think you talk a little bit about what the your patient subjective experience of that is like, particularly as as children or as or as teenagers. The typical trajectory is sort of as as children, especially people who are allowed to to socially transition. There's not a lot of issues until they hit puberty and that person's body starts going in a direction that is totally different from where they either thought they were headed or wanted to go. Um, some patients have described, you know, thinking that when they grew up, they were going to become the other gender because that's what they wanted and that's what they knew they were. And they thought, you know, when is when is this thing going to happen to me? And just assumed that it would. And many children don't even realize that they are transgender. Some, some children have supportive families and have socially transitioned since they were four, and that's lovely. Many don't quite realize that they are transgender until they start puberty. That way sort of felt something was different or uncomfortable in certain ways, but it wasn't that bad kind of. And then puberty starts and things really hit the fan at that point. That's when we see teenagers, you know, attempting suicide, doing really badly in school, developing behavioral problems, becoming severely depressed, having symptoms that mimic anxiety disorders and sort of a gouraphobic, even patients don't want to go outside. They don't want to interact with people. They have social anxiety. Um, and that's where I meet a lot of teenagers. Typically, unfortunately, when the parents realize my kid is at risk and if I don't bring them in, they, a lot of worse things could happen than they're being transgender. So maybe I should find out a little bit more information about this. And that's where I meet a lot of families is at that moment. And that's the opportunity to really not even hyperbolasin here, but to really save a life. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the, that's why the stakes here feel so high, right? I mean, it's, it's in this, like, it's essentially a moment of crisis you're describing. The crisis brought on by the biological processes of puberty, pushing a person whose self-conception is one way, pulling them away from that. And the availability of a medical intervention that can either forestall that or alter that trajectory and the inability of accessing it, creating this crisis. And I'm, I'm curious what the parents say. I mean, when we were talking about areas throughout the southeast, obviously it's politically heterodox, like all kinds of places, there's diversity, and there's liberals and there's conservatives and everything in between secular religious. But I do wonder like what those parents coming to you with teenagers who maybe didn't think this was real or they thought it was a fabrication of the libs or et cetera, like what those conversations are like when they're coming to you, recognizing the child they love and care for is in crisis. Those are complex conversations and difficult in some cases and often require many conversations, but a lot of parents, so that so a common way this goes is that the child's been thinking about it for a long time, for months or years, and then tells the parents and they have to catch up, they have to get, go through the whole process that the child has been going through for years to come to the same place. And they're a little, they can't get there quite right away. And so I mean, families where the parents have just found out about this and everybody's panicking. And often parents are saying, you know, I support my child, I love them, but I don't want to do something permanent to them. They're too young. They don't know what they're doing. And I can relate, I'm a parent, I wouldn't want to do something that's permanent to my child that I was skeptical about. So there's a lot of talk and most of the conversation at that point is around what's permanent, what's not, what the timeframe looks like, what the risks are, what the potential benefits are. And it takes some time and some processing to get to a point where one or both parents are willing to try a medicine for their child. And we don't always get there, but in most cases we do, particularly when the child speaks out at a visit, sometimes they haven't even told the parents exactly how strongly they feel about this. And parents get to see their child telling me how they feel. And then the most remarkable thing is when we do get a child on the proper medication, whether puberty blockers or hormone therapy, that next visit, the visit three months later to check labs and check in, is one of my favorites, to a person, the child or the teen who was secluded, didn't talk to anybody, had to look at the floor or mumble, you couldn't hear them, they wouldn't make eye contact. They come back just brighter, they'll speak loudly, they'll look at you, they sit up straight, they just, it's revolutionizes who they are. And they can, they get to become themselves. It's not even like they become someone different, they just get to get to be themselves. And parents see that. And that convinces them that this is the right track. Yeah, do you have parents that? I'm curious about parents trajectory. I mean, obviously they're coming to you in the first place, right? So they're already in a place where they're in the door. They're in the door. Do you have resistance throughout? Do you have resistance? I would imagine like resistance about reversibility. So the difference between puberty blockers and cross hormone therapy, I can imagine for some parents, it's like, okay, we're going to forestall and maybe he or she grows out of this, as opposed to we are now beginning a course of a biological trajectory that's more interventionist, essentially. Definitely. There's a big difference in terms of reversibility with puberty blockers, which are basically completely reversible with a few caveats in terms of if you're on them for a long time, but typically we don't put people on them for really long periods of time. But yeah, it's a big difference across hormone therapy versus puberty blockers, more so kind of emotionally and psychologically than in reality in a lot of cases because of the time it takes for hormones to act. I mean, if you think about puberty, cisgender person, i.e. someone assigned male at birth who grows up to be a man or vice versa, cis being on the same side of trans being opposite in Latin, transgender and cisgender. So a cisgender person going through puberty, it takes two or three years. It's a very slow process with imperceptible changes. It took me longer than two or three years, more. I would love to get through puberty. Everyone's different, but it's a slow process or a very slow process. And people think if I expose my child to testosterone, they're going to become a man overnight is kind of the emotional thinking about it. Everybody knows that's not really true, but it's sort of how people think about it. And that's not at all the case. We can start teens, especially younger teens, I start them on extremely low doses. And I say to the parents, not much is going to happen. Really, we're not doing anything that's going to cause permanent changes for the next three to six months. And I say to the teen, you're going to be frustrated. You might notice something, but you're not going to notice much with this dose. So don't get discouraged because I'm starting you on a teeny tiny dose to see how you feel and see if you like it. If you like it, great, we can give you more. Or you might say, you know what, this actually, this doesn't feel right. This wasn't for me. And we can stop it with no consequences. And so I sort of explain it to everybody what the plan is. And then invariably that person, the teen says, it's great. I want more and the parents see them improve in socially, emotionally, everything. They see things get better, whether it's even because of the medicine or because progress is being made towards something, it's hard to say. But we start them on almost homeopathic dose to begin with and then go from there. And so especially with younger teens, we don't, we're not incurring irreversible changes within the first six or even 12 months. And do you have people who decide, you know what, I don't want to do this? So far, I haven't really. I've had, you know, that's not true. I've had one teen who was on testosterone for a couple of years and then eventually decided to stop. But interestingly, during the time that they were on testosterone, they changed their name and gender marker to male. And when they stopped testosterone, they did not want to change their name or gender marker back to female. And I think that person ultimately had more of a non-binary identity. And we just, and the patient and me and family didn't recognize that early on. But also interestingly, that patient had no regret. They didn't say, I wish I'd never done it. This was all part of their journey. They weren't going back to female. They were going from assigned female at birth to someone who's more masculine to something else next. It wasn't seen as a like reversal of something. And they were happy to have been on testosterone. So, so that's the one example that comes to mind other than that person. I haven't had any teens say, actually, you know, I don't want to do this anymore. I want to talk about what the sort of state of the medical literature is in this area and the sort of degree to which the protocols are pretty well established right after we take this quick break. So I wonder if you could just sort of sketch out the history of this kind of care, you know, how long it's been offered and what the state of the medical literature in terms of peer review and consensus amongst doctors about the sort of protocols in providing this kind of care are. Well, it was originally, I think the Netherlands where it was the country in which this care was first provided decades ago. They were early on providing hormone therapy for for adults. And a lot of the research that we do have, there's there's chronically not enough data. I'll say that over and over. There's just not enough data for a lot of these things. But the data that we do have a lot of its early data is coming out of the Netherlands. And that's where some of the guidelines originated. Like, for example, many guidelines recommend not starting cross hormone therapy before the age of 16. And we get that number not because it makes physiologic sense. Most people, especially people sign female at birth start puberty way before 16, you know, age 10, 11, 12. But we get the number 16 because that's the age of majority in the Netherlands. So that's when people could make their own decisions. So that's how that number ended up in the guidelines, not because of any medical reason. And so that was in the guidelines for a long time. Now, and more recently in the past five to 10 years, many of the leading guideline creating societies have been decreasing that age gradually and sort of hedging. So some guidelines say start at 16 or in some cases, you might want to start earlier. UCSF is doing a lot of research on this particularly. They have an amazing pediatric transcendental adolescent medicine center. And they advocate starting much earlier as early as 13. And that's that's some of the protocols that I follow is having a more physiologic model where that that person can stay on course with their peers. You know, you don't want to puberty block someone until they're 18 and they can make their own decision. On the face of it, that makes sense. So, you know, we'll just wait until you're the age of majority and you can decide whatever you want to do. But then you're a prepubescent person starting college. Right. If you were different, if you were different before, now you're really, really off track with your peers. So the guidelines are evolving rapidly and for medicine where guidelines evolve extremely slowly. And now in this country, every major reputable American medical association, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the Endocrine Society, college of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, everybody recommends affirming care, including when appropriate puberty blockers and hormone therapy. So, it's become very clear in medicine that the medical guidelines for what to do that's best for the patient is to provide affirming care. And that includes puberty blockers and hormone therapy. What is the community of healthcare providers giving this kind of care like? I mean, particularly at this moment, right, where you're now finding yourselves. I mean, I'm sure it was always the case and in some ways you're sort of a political target, but now probably as much as ever recently. Yeah, I'm like the most introverted person you'll meet and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of a lot of things. I just like to go to work, work hard, do a good job, go home and that's not my current job. But I never quite anticipated that I would be in this position. But when I started queer med in 2017, I thought this will be a temporary solution to making sure that people have access until this becomes widespread. Because hormone therapy is not actually complicated medically. It's much simpler, for example, than diabetes. Managing diabetes is complicated. That's actually pretty difficult. But every primary care doctor you go to manages diabetes, that's assumed. But gender affirming care is not widespread. Even with all the medical society backing it, there's still lots of physicians who say, you know, I wasn't taught that in school. I don't feel comfortable doing that. I don't, you know, I'm not against people being trans. I just don't provide that care. That's a very common thing that I hear, which sounds like, yeah, you wouldn't want a doctor who doesn't have expertise in something providing care, which makes sense. But if you apply that to other things, like in the past 20 years, dozens of new medicines for diabetes have come out. You couldn't get away with saying, you know, I went to medical school 20 years ago, so I don't prescribe any medicines that came out since then. Or, you know, I'm not against diabetes. I think people who have diabetes are fine. I just don't, you know, choose to treat them. You couldn't, you couldn't say that. It's expected in the medical profession that we're constantly learning about new things and learning about new medicines that come out and new techniques and improvements and new data. We adjust how we manage things based on new data. So I naively thought in 2017, I'll start this clinic and, you know, fill a gap until everybody else starts doing it and I go out of business. And here we are four years later. When I thought, I thought the lifetime of queer med was going to be about five years and it's been four so far. That's a great, fascinating point about diabetes, which I guess I hadn't considered before, that that's a difficult and complex chronic disease to manage, but it's an expectation that all primary care physicians can manage that. Yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, type one diabetes, which it could be argued is the most complex form of diabetes. Type one diabetes is about as common as being transgender. Being transgender may even be more common than type one diabetes. That's fascinating too. I mean, we think of a diabetes like actually quite common, right? Right. And type two is more common, but type one is childhood, right? I mean, type one, I mean, I think everyone has had some, well, I don't know, everyone, but you know, you know, kids. So what would these laws mean for you? Obviously, these laws, meaning there's a bunch, it's a little hard to track because it's a kind of whack-a-mole and there's different iterations in different places. There are different points in their trajectory in different states, some they've been signed into law. I think in Arkansas, as I mentioned, over the veto of the governor in other states, they're making their way through. And just talk a little bit about what they would mean for the kind of care you provide. Yeah, well, it would be devastating for our patients. And for me as well, I mean, we cover 10 states, I think five of them, maybe four or five of those states have laws that are on the docket. And what that would mean if they're passed in those states is that it would become criminal for me to provide care to those patients. Now, that makes me incredibly angry and sad if that were to happen, to have to choose between going to jail for 10 years and continuing to care for my patients. But what's also interesting and what nobody's talking about, I think, is that it's also a physician's responsibility. There's a code of medical ethics where I'm responsible to take care of my patients. And if I can't, I have to find a good place for them to go. I have to notify them long enough in advance for them to find other care. And I'm supposed to find another physician for them to see. And so there's, I'm going against the core of my medical, you know, oath to patients that I will take care of you. I'm not going to, it's called abandon, which is a form of negligence. And I, that's understood in the patient physician relationship that I won't abandon them. Like, I'm sorry, you're, I know that you're, you know, you've now got this very bad chronic illness or you're managing diabetes or you've now been diagnosed with cancer, like, sorry, nothing I can do. Like that's not, that's just not acceptable for doctor. No, you if, if for abortion, for example, if I said I'm not comfortable providing an abortion, I, it's my responsibility to help that patient find another provider who is, or any other thing. Cancer, for example, I have to help them get to a place that could treat them for something if I don't treat that. So in this case, I'm, I'm stuck. All the other doctors would be doing something illegal too. So I'm not allowed to provide care to my patient who's in Alabama, say, but I also can't help them find care anywhere else. So I'm effectively, if this law goes into practice, I will have to perform my duties unethically. You will either have to commit a crime or violate your ethical oath. There's no, there's basically no choice between the two. And you can actually get sued for malpractice, for, for patient abandonment, it's a form of negligence. Have you talked to policymakers? Have you, have you had interactions with folks in the midst of this sort of raft of legislation? I haven't talked to policymakers. Like I said, I'm one of the most introverted people you'll meet. So I haven't gone out of my way to talk to anybody. I just keep my head down and, and try to, try to help my patients through this. But I have spoken with it with a legal team to, several legal teams actually who have, I'm working with to keep, you know, figuring out what my options are here and to, and to make sure I don't break the law. You know, I'm getting advice about what I can and can't do before they pass some of these laws. So I'm helping patients get set up as best I can within the legal bounds of medical practice to be prepared for this. I mean, you have ongoing patient relationships that are on the verge of being criminalized by the state. Many, many. And what are, what are those interactions with patients like? I mean, how much is this now a present, you know, thing in the room or on the call when you're talking about their care? It's the main thing. I mean, many of my patients, for example, in Alabama, I have, I have a handful of, of teens who I care for in Alabama. And for them, like, most of them are, are older teens and stable on hormones. It's not even like, we don't even talk about their hormone therapy anymore. They're just like, yeah, I'm great. You know, I say your labs look fine. Let's get you a refill. And that takes like two minutes. And then we spend the rest of the time talking about what is going to happen. And these kids are 15, 16, 17. And their state is saying that they're wrong. Their existence is wrong. And I don't know what that does to the psyche of a 16 year old to have to have your state basically say that who you are and what you're doing is illegal. But also like, I'm, I've been on, I've been on SSRIs. I'm on LexaPro. And I have been since, I don't know, 2007. And it's been, you know, I don't think I've ever talked about it publicly before, but it's been a really incredible thing for me. It really has helped me just reduce a certain amount of kind of like ambient and I think, you know, biologically driven anxiety that I used to experience. You know, and there are times when I'll forget refill and start to run out. And you know, if you start to go a few days without it, like you have really bad withdrawal. I mean, it's not withdrawal in the sense of like an addictive drug, but like you start to feel kind of cosy and confused. And it's unpleasant. It's the kind of thing that if you're going to go out fit, you have to titrate. And so like the specter of being cut off from it is like a little panic inducing. I can only imagine what it's like for your 16 year old patients. Like, what would it actually mean in terms of their course of therapy? Yeah. And well, thank you for sharing that exactly. It would be devastating. So if someone has been taking estrogen for several years, and then they stop it, they would go through like instantaneous menopause symptoms. Menopause takes a year or two to go through and they would go through menopause overnight, basically, as a teenager. So they would have hot flashes, irritability, night sweats, incredible mood swings. They would no longer continue developing breast tissue that that wouldn't regress exactly, but their estrogen level would drop and they would have basically no sex hormones in their body until their body started reproducing testosterone. So testosterone and estrogen both play a role in brain development and intellectual development and social development. So they would have no hormones in their body for a period of time until their body started reproducing testosterone. And at that point, they would start to transition into a man. They would start growing hair in all sorts of places they didn't want it. They would become more muscular. They might even grow taller at that point and basically go onward with male puberty, which they had never wanted in the first place. And for someone who's on testosterone, similarly, they would have symptoms of low testosterone. It'd be like an adult man who has a normal testosterone level one day and a level of zero a week later, the half-life of it is fairly long. So it would take about a week or two to get to a testosterone level of zero. And they would have brain fog. They wouldn't be able to focus. They wouldn't be able to concentrate on anything. They would be moody, have no energy. And later, they would start growing breast tissue once their body starts producing estrogen a month or two later. They would start having periods, start developing breasts, basically go back toward female puberty. And either of those outcomes is devastating. Basically, either way forward under these conditions would be sort of an awful trauma to experience. Absolutely. And not only that, but would incur, they would need more medical treatment in the future. Right. You can't just walk away and be like, okay, figure it out. Right. And if they started, so for example, someone who assigned female at birth who goes on puberty blockers when they hit puberty and then get started on testosterone and then grows up to be a teenage boy, they never grew breast tissue. In that whole process, we can prevent them from ever having breasts. Therefore, they don't need chest reconstruction surgery, which is major surgery at great expense when they're older. So if they have to go off hormone therapy for a year or two, they would develop breast tissue and then require surgery. Right. That's a huge, I mean, when you talk about the medical interventions here, like what I'm hearing from you is that medical interventions made at this crucial juncture reduce medical interventions that the patient may need later on in life. Absolutely. And chest reconstruction is just one of them. Very commonly, trans feminine people need facial reconstruction surgery, which is extraordinarily intensive and costly if they develop sort of the facial features of a man. Like the square jaw, hair in places sort of out of zapel nose structure. It's all if you, we don't gender people by their bodies and what parts they have. We gender them by their face. If you look at a face, you know, right away, whether that's a man or a woman without seeing the rest of their body. And so the face is a major source of dysphoria and of getting misgendered. It's dangerous, in fact. So if you have someone who's 6'4 and has a really masculine looking face, who is a woman and wants to use the women's room, they're going to get some looks. They might not even be safe. So if we can prevent them from being quite so tall, prevent them from having such hard facial features, get their body to not develop in such a broad way and develop so many muscles, they'll have a much more safe, not only successful transition kind of quote unquote aesthetically, but they'll be safer because they won't stand out as someone who's clearly transitioned later in their life. So what, I mean, this is such an obvious point, but it's just useful to hear it from the care provider perspective. Like literally what will happen to your patients? Like, well, they just get cut off. They'll be able to get, I mean, they're gonna be like a black market for hormones. Like, well, I'm just thinking about what what's going to happen? Well, I'll tell you my contingency plans. Just don't go to the authorities, but Oh, we've been thinking a lot about this. So, and I'll circle this all past my legal team, but it's all state based. So some of these laws are on the docket in Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, I think those, I may have gotten those states wrong, but I think those are the states that we cover where this is in play. So what a patient could do, then we're back to the old model. They could drive from Alabama into Georgia. And telemedicine is all about where the patient is located. So I have to have a license in every state where my patients are located. So if they drive into Georgia or into Mississippi, where I'm licensed, they could sit in a parking lot, have a telemedicine visit with me, and I can now provide care to them because they're not in the state of Alabama. Wow. And I could find a local pharmacy wherever they are in Georgia, border town, and send them a prescription. They could wait there and pick it up. They could travel back to Georgia or Mississippi or Tennessee to get their blood drawn so that we can monitor their levels appropriately so that I can provide responsible care. And then they just have to drive out of state every time they want to talk to me. Oh, Jesus. I mean, this recalls, I mean, obviously, these are precisely the workarounds that have been created over abortion, right? Yep, very similar. And I think the targeting is very similar, the sort of playbook. I mean, the difference being that, you know, abortion is a single procedure when you're talking about surgical abortion. There's obviously there's like follow up and aftercare, but it is not recurring chronic treatment that someone's been on for years and doing great. Like, these kids are thriving. And it's like, they're doing fine. They're doing, they're doing well. And then we have to do do all this to make it just harder for them to just crazy. I mean, again, this is the obvious point, but for the state to come in and just be like, all right, Alex, like we are going to fuck with your life. Like no one has ever fucked with your life before now, because we don't like you and we don't think you should exist. And now like it's just it's really horrifying. Well put. Yeah, that's that's exactly it. I wonder what the kind of emotional you said that you're an introverted person and you've been incredibly game in our conversation. It's like not usually like, I mean, I obviously enjoy this because I'm a very extroverted person, but I know that that's not everyone. But I do wonder what the emotional what your emotional experience of this is like. Just, you know, I imagine actually the work you do must be incredibly fulfilling in many ways. But this must be really upsetting and kind of fear inducing. Yeah, I mean, it's it's draining. Even even seeing patients I find draining because I put so much of myself into it that it can it can be draining. And there's so much emotion and vulnerability with patients and families that even that's draining. But this is on a new level. I mean, basically, and I have three nurse practitioners who are amazing who work with me now. And we sort of talk with each other about this and how we're all coping. But the bottom line is that I just I just keep my head down. You know, I never want it to be a celebrity or part of this or anything. I just throughout my career just kept making decisions that seemed obvious. Well, this care doesn't exist. So let me see if I can provide it. And it doesn't exist in that state either. So we'll add that state and just every decision just kind of seemed obvious. It wasn't like I set out to be the transgender crusader or anything. And so this is not this is new for me and not my sort of chosen role. But something that's obviously the right thing to do. And so yeah, I cope basically. I don't watch the news. I don't follow any of this stuff. And wait, really? No, no, I'm waiting for my lawyers to tell me that something has passed basically. No, it was great to find your podcast because I don't like anything too political to, you know, upsetting or like you're talking about Bitcoin. I was like, I don't know anything about Bitcoin. Great. This is awesome. Wikipedia. I'm fascinated. I want to get on Wikipedia so that we can have a better visibility for our practice. So I was like, oh, this is great. It's just the right level for me. So it's just just sort of protecting myself to be maybe it's head in the sand. But for me, it's kind of what I do to cope and show up and work every day and put my head down and do my job and hopefully help people and then go home. I mean, that makes total sense. I actually personally steer like completely clear of politics as much as I can on the weekends just because you have to for your so much. Sanity. Oh, I'm only so much. I'm going to buy. Do you keep in touch? How long do you keep in touch with patients? I mean, you started when what year do you first start providing this kind of care? 2014, probably when I was at Emory. Yeah. So you've had you've had patients go through high school and then go off to college. And I wonder if you keep in touch with them and what those what kind of things you hear? Oh, yeah. I mean, there's still our patients. So we see children, teens, everybody. So I've had patients for since since 2014, 2015 who've grown up who've grown into adults and now that they're grown up, so I only see them once a year, which is kind of sad, but they are just like it's and it's like a 15 minute visit once a year because they're like, I'm fine. And I'm like, your levels are fine. Great. Here's refill. You know, carry on. And they're just it's like regular. They're just that's the best way I can describe it. Just regular people. And it's great to see them go from someone who was really upset and unhappy with who they everything grow up to be someone who's regular. Regular. That's an interesting word. It's like we're all was that there's a great Freud quote about like, you know, he said something once about like the goal of analysis was to like turn abject misery into ordinary unhappiness. Right. Yeah, exactly. It's like, yeah, in the end, we're all going to be human beings like dealing with our stuff, right? Yeah, people are too happy. That's a different kind of disorder. But I try to get to that place. Yeah, no, I I'm intentionally not using the word normal because I think that it's so many different meetings and they're so weighted, but just just average in the best way. Yeah, a person who goes about their life totally regularly. Yeah, Dr. Izzy Lowell is a family medicine physician at Queer Med. They specialize in transgender medicine and treat trans patients in Alabama across the southeast, as you heard. That was so wonderful. And I learned so much from that conversation. So thank you so much for doing it. Thanks so much for having me. It's really an honor. Once again, my great thanks to Dr. Izzy Lowell, who very gamely soldered through her introversion, which you mentioned multiple times, which was just great. I really learned so much from that conversation. I hope you did too. And we'd love to hear what you thought. Tweet us with the hashtag with pod, email us at the address with pod at gmail.com.
