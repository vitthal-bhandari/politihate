    "text": " Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show Podcast. Third hour of Clay and Buck starts right now, everybody. Thanks for ruling with us. Appreciate you being here. If you want to chat with us in real time, 800-282-8882 on those phone lines. Also, don't forget you can email us directly by going to clayandbuck.com, become a VIP subscriber, and we'll be looking at some of those emails in the back half of this hour as well. We are still looking at next week the possibility of a Trump indictment looming. If this does not happen, and by the way, I didn't say this in the in the first hour, I meant to that, you know, because there are people like this who are left of center very clearly. I mean, I remember debating Alan Dershowitz on gun control on CNN. By the way, he doesn't want you to have guns like period. I mean, that's his. So he's a Democrat, everybody. He says, but obviously a very, very smart guy knows the law very well. He says, I'm not a Trump voter, but this is laughable. This looming indictment over a porn star payoff is the most ridiculously weak contorted case I've ever seen and D.A. Bragg has disgraced his office. Nearly the consideration of this has Dershowitz coming out and saying this is absolutely insane. By the way, Trump. Oh boy. Oh boy. Do you see this? Cheers, chilling picture. Now, okay, there's a there's a daily mail headline and I just want to be clear. This is their, this is their interpretation from the truth social post of Donald Trump of this. Have you seen this one, Clay? I saw. Yeah, I was looking through Trump's most recent comments and because I saw this, this story getting a lot of headlines and I was curious to, to see how much I thought there was some validity to it, but fire away. So here's where I mean, basically you got a photo of Alvin Bragg with just standing at a podium, pretty standard photo. You got a photo. You know what? Let's can we link to this guys up at clay and buck.com so everybody can go and check this one out just so you can see the photo for yourself. We can just put the truth social post out there. You know, it's interesting. The value of truth social is now, well, I mean, yeah, it's a no speech interruption and censorship. I mean, there's a bunch of things you could argue, but a big value across the media landscape is that if you want to see Trump statements, you got to, you got to be on this platform. That's the only he is not on Twitter. I think he's back on Facebook, but people are using truth social to see what the latest is from the president. Anyway, he's got this photo up where he's holding a baseball bat and kind of making a kind of a wise guy face. And this is how it is being this is how it is being interpreted by the Daily Mail Trump shares chilling picture threatening Manhattan D.A. with a baseball bat while warning death and destruction will come if degenerate psychopath charges him in stormy Daniels hush money case. Okay. Now I don't think I don't think all the pearl clutching over the photo of the bat. You know, I'll leave that to people, whether they really think this is a threat or, you know, Trump is trying to be funny in his account. People can argue about that. But I don't know. You know, it's he's so in the right on this issue in general on whether or not he should be into it. So obvious that I just I sit here and I want to say to myself, why why give anybody anything to fight back with at this stage when he's I feel like he's about to high step into the end zone on this issue one way or the other in diamond or no indictment because he's in the right here, you know, so this truth social post, I know we'll forget about it by Monday, but I look at this and I'm like, come on, Trump, you're gonna win this one. Yeah, look, the thing that I think is most interesting about the week that we've had since Saturday when Trump said he thought he was going to be indicted. First of all, I think it's given unbelievable amounts of firepower to Trump's 2024 campaign. And Trump is going to be on Sean Hannity's on with us after every day after our show ends. Trump's going to be on Hannity on Monday and they're doing an hour long. Trump Hannity special is my understanding. And I believe coming out of that Monday Fox News appearance, because but correct me if I'm wrong, Trump basically hasn't been on Fox News for months, six months, six months, six months, he hasn't appeared on Fox News, which is, I mean, if you compare that with Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis or Mike Pompeo, I mean, I don't know what the total number of times that those guys would have been on Fox News, but it's extraordinarily far more common. To me, next week is going to be the best week of Trump's 2024 campaign because this past week, he has garlanded to me a lot of support from people out there who are not particularly affiliated. We further, we told you this months ago, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswami, whoever else runs Mike, Mike Pence, I don't think any of them have a prayer. This is DeSantis versus Trump. And if you look at the polls, Trump has since November been elevating to a large extent. And the DeSantis campaign has made the decision that they're not going to announce until the Florida legislature session is over. And by the time that happens, he's going to be behind, meaning DeSantis fairly substantially. Now let me say this, national polls really don't matter that much. The question is, what's going to happen in Iowa and what's going to happen in New Hampshire and how much support is there going to be for Trump in those two states? Because the amount of attention that that will get in January and February of next year will in substantial measure change the trajectory of the election. And I just look at it and think if he gets indicted, this thing may be over before we ever really get into a campaign, because I don't think people are not going to support Trump once he gets indicted. He's going to skyrocket like he did after Mar-a-Lago. And then as DeSantis or anybody else for that matter, going to be able to measure a real attack, if he does, as I expect skyrocket in the event of his indictment, does that make sense to you? Like you start to look at the months ahead, DeSantis is going to have to come back. It's like he's down three touchdowns. Well, first of all, to start the start his campaign. You know, it's easy to forget a few things. One is the polls for Trump after 2022 were abysmal. Whether you think that it was Trump's fault or not, a lot of we're talking Republicans now, a lot of Republican registered voters were saying that Kerry Lake, Herschel Walker, Doug Mosdriano, you know, you go down this list, they were blaming Trump for that. People rightly or wrongly, please don't, you know, I'm just saying that was what the polls were, were reflecting at that time. People have moved on from that. Honestly, a lot of people I think have just largely forgotten about it. And now we're to phase where Trump is in, and Trump is is a candidate for president. And there's a governor that we all think is going to get him, but he's not in yet. Yeah. So there's all there's also that. I mean, it's very early, plus you have somebody who hasn't even announced yet. And so we're in this weird space. That all said, the good news with all of this is that the other side is it looks increasingly clear our assessment of the Democrat side of the house is accurate. Yeah. So you have, for example, the Reuters piece that just came out, which I mean, the headline is tethered together. Biden and Harris moved toward 2024 reelection run. What it should say, if there were honest headlines is Biden doesn't even want to do this again, but he knows Kamala has no shot. Yeah, no chance. Okay. Here's, here's where they get into. This is the gentle way that Reuters, okay. This is like all journalism. Reuters is explaining to the Democrat audience in this country that it has. Hey guys, it's got to be Biden again, because here's what they say. While the pair have a good working relationship, democratic sources say Biden has frustrations about some of her work. He's also convinced that neither Harris nor any other democratic hopefuls would be able to beat former president Donald Trump. If he is the Republican nominee, a factor that has influenced Biden's inclination to run again, according to a former White House official. If he did not think she was capable, he would not have picked her, they said next, but it is a question of consistently rising to the occasion. Try to clean this up. Okay. What have we been saying all along, folks? Their plan, I think quite clearly, was Biden for a term, steps down. Kamala gets to actually take over, run for reelection as the incumbent, because as we all know, your base of the taxpayers are funding the whole campaign on top of your campaign. You get to go everywhere. You're the president, you make whatever speeches you want, et cetera. This is them telling everybody, Hey guys, we know the woke left wing base of the Democrat party was all excited for Kamala to take over. But Joe has to be the guy because even Joe knows Kamala has no chance. That's right. And what I would say in general for everybody to keep in mind out here, what has changed this election, basically 44 states are off the board, in my opinion, right? You look at 2024. I think there are 44 states, maybe 43 that are completely off the board and you know who's going to win, right? Now maybe I'm wrong. Let's say Glenn Youngkin is the vice president and Glenn Youngkin delivers Virginia. Well, then we're going to have basically a landslide, right? States that we already know how they're going to turn out. They're going to be red or they're going to be blue. Seven states, like really when you want to get down to the nitty gritty 2024, even as we sit here, 18 months, whatever the heck it is out from the next election, tell me New Hampshire, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania. You tell me who wins those seven states. I'll tell you who the president is going to be. And my question for all of you to think about what has happened since 2020 that is going to change in the direction of Republicans, all seven of those states, which we lost. We need to win two or three of those states probably from a mathematical perspective. Maybe Georgia, because Brian Kemp has been so successful, although we just saw her show Walker lose to Warnock. So there's a little bit of nervousness there. But other than Georgia, maybe Nevada, because you just got a Republican governor in one bar, what makes you think that those seven states are going to move in a different direction in 2024 than they did in 2020? Well, one answer is Biden has been so bad that he's not going to be able to win these states like he did in 20. Back of your mind, 43 states are decided. Most of us do not live in states where our vote is really going to matter because we already know who's going to win. New Hampshire, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania. Republicans have to flip three of those states basically in order to be elected president. Do you feel like that is moving in the direction where it's going to happen? 800-282-8882. We do have some good news. I'm going to hit you with as we continue to roll buck. This is a result there that I think people are going to enjoy as we head into the weekend. We support worthy causes here on the program. One of them being the good work done by the women and men providing invaluable services at the preborn network clinics. In the course of their 17 year history, they've rescued over 200,000 babies lives by loving mothers with unplanned pregnancies and introducing them to the precious life growing inside of them through ultrasound. They'll tell you what occurs every day is a miracle. It's hard to argue with that. Once a mother hears that heartbeat, the majority of the time, she will choose life. But without the ultrasound, the odds are not in favor of life. The ultrasound itself, that process is a game changer. We've partnered with preborn to help rescue thousands of babies this year. And we do that by helping with donations. One ultrasound is just $28. Every tax deductible donation, big or small, helps to save the unborn. Preborn receives no government funding. They're completely dependent on us, members of the pro life community for just $28. You can help save a life to donate. Use your cell phone and dial pound two 50 and say the keyword baby. That's pound two 50. Say baby, or go to preborn.com slash buck. That's preborn.com slash B U C K sponsored by preborn. He's box. He's clay travels together.

Join me for the Carol Markowitz show new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back in clay Travis, Buck Sexton show. We got a lot of people who went away and variety of different topics. Um, let's hit a couple of these Chris and El Paso. You got marriage advice for Buck Buck. How many months is it now you've been married? You've made you last it. Happy month number. About to start three. You've almost outlasted Kim Kardashian's first marriage. So congratulations there. Uh, I think she got married. Well, I don't remember who her first husband was. She got married to Chris Humphreys at some point in the in the pantheon of husbands and not last very long. Chris, how long you've been married? I have been married now for 12 years, sir. And mega diddos to both of you from this 11 Bravo 20 years ago. We were up in Northern Iraq and, uh, Buck, thank you for what you've done because I know you have saved a lot of my brothers and sisters lives with stuff that you did. So thank you very much. Thank you, sir. I tried. All right, you got advice. Okay. So I got a little advice. I got a book for you. I am pits. That is a book about a soldier that almost died that you guys would both love. He also has a podcast. I am pits. It's a great book, fast read. You guys will love it. But also when it comes to marriage advice, so Clay, maybe you should my wife says you should hold off on giving a lot of advice. Maybe you should call me first before you give Buck any advice because our women should be the only people in our lives that are beautiful. Now there's pretty out there. I got it. But when it comes to discussing other women being gorgeous, hot, sexy, that's not good for our women when it comes to trying to build their confidence. So in the future, hey, Buck, next time you look at Carrie, you're going to be like, you know what, Chris was right? This is the only beautiful woman in the world. Of course, unless you get girls, then they will also be beautiful. I mean, I mean, this is the my wife. My wife is hot. Clay's wife is hot. Everything's okay here. I don't say what's the issue. I don't. There's this old. Thank you for the call. There's this old school idea that if you admit that another woman is attractive, that somehow it's devaluing your own wives attractiveness. Like, that seems really strange. If my wife says, Hey, Brad Pitt or Denzel Washington are good looking dudes, I don't take it as a personal upfront, right? And I don't even know who we've talked about that's good looking on the show. But every now and then I'll hear from people and they're usually old and they're like, Oh, you can never once you get married, you can never mention that somebody else is ever attractive. I don't think that's very common, common place perspective. Yeah, I mean, I look, we we we're open to all kinds of ideas that I certainly think that's I think that's a rough, I think that's a rough advice. I think that's right. Because if you're not acknowledging that somebody else attractive, it's like you're hiding the truth, right? Like your eyes don't stop working when you get married. Well, I would also I would also not just think, but I can say that, you know, the bond you have with the internal and external beauty of your wife and your soulmate so far exceeds like it's almost like you can refer to a beautiful sculpture, shall we say, David, maybe you could say the sculpture is beautiful. I could even say, wow, that David, he was a beautiful, a beautiful man. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You can't say that. I don't think you could call the David staff a beautiful man. You can't call Michelangelo is David beautiful. I don't think I don't I mean, the art may be as beautiful, but he's a naked man. I don't think you could call him beautiful. Like, I think you could say like he's really in good shape. So you could call the statue beautiful, but not the man. Beautiful. I don't think you can call my mind is my mind is trying to work through all this stuff. I just try to protect you here. I don't want you getting blown up by guys out there talking about how many beautiful and the next thing you know, Buck Sexton talks about naked man being beautiful. I was just going to say it's like you see a beautiful actor saw TV. It's like seeing a statue. You're just commenting on the aesthetics, not your connection. Yeah, right. Well, I get to I don't think that men can be beautiful. I think maybe it's just the use of the word beautiful associated with a man. Michelangelo's David is a handsome man. He's a handsome man. He's a handsome man. I would agree with that. Do you need emergency food during your lifetime? Buck might need emergency food because the way you just said on the radio show. No one wishes it. Then again, no one needs car insurance or home insurance. And then suddenly you have to have it. That's what happens with emergency food as well. Go to mypatriotsupply.com. Check out their popular three month emergency food kit. Right now, you'll save $200 per kit. Each kid will give you a wide variety of delicious breakfast lunch, dinner, drink snacks, 2000 calories a day, $200 to save mypatriotsupply.com. Free shipping, mypatriotsupply.com. Because I'll just put this out there. My my general assessment, my analysis on this is that the the left is going to lose. They're not going to admit it. They're not going to go down without screaming and shouting about it and everything else. But but politically, they're going to lose on this issue of transgender athletes in organized athletics. Yep. I don't see how they can win over the long term. This is going to keep going. We're probably 10 years away, maybe five years away from it. It's starting to really just be too much for them to continue to push this. But it just doesn't work. It doesn't make sense. And we have an example, a data point that you could put in that category here. This from CBS News track and fields governing body will exclude transgender women from female events. So world athletics overseas track and field internationally has said that trans women will not be competing in all female events. It says that the this applies to trans athletes who have gone through male puberty. So I just want to say, Clay, that this is this is actually a win for dare I say, science. Yes. Because anybody, any biologist who was not terrified of being canceled, being, you know, hounded out of their job and told there are horrible person will tell you that just the process of going through male puberty increases bone density, muscle density, physical structure is in the, you know, your size. And the notion that later on growing your hair long and taking some female hormones for a few months changes that is absurd. It is just factually untrue. And I think in track and field, what they realized was they were just one, can they were one, you know, contender. They were one person away from the South Park macho man Randy Savage thing looking all too real. I mean, if they true, we've seen this a little bit, like you've probably seen the photo of, well, first of all, the six foot three guy swimming at from you, Penn, we also have that next to the women who, you know, we're all like five, seven and look like women. There are, I think there's also photos, I don't know the specifics off hand, but of a guy who is like six, four, two, fifty, who's playing women's rugby. Yes. I've seen that was that photo. And they realize at some point that there was going to just be somebody who was a male track and field competitor at a pretty, at a pretty high level, obviously not, you know, a true champion, but at a pretty high level, who's going to grow his hair long stays, a woman and just win every event. Yep. And they've, they've thwarted that. Yeah. And look, this is where I think Megan Kelly was prescient with her tweet that she sent out yesterday that we talked about. First of all, this is a win for Sandy. And one reason that I've been, I've been fighting this battle for years now, is because initially, what did they always tell you? The same thing they always Oh, this is not a real issue. This is a culture war that's being manufactured. No, no, no, this was slowly becoming and is still becoming more and more prevalent. The Leah Thomas, NCAA swimming issue kind of put it on the forefront. But when you look at tennis soccer basketball, there's going to be a situation track and field was well, well aware of this too, that it was impossible to ignore a guy dominating. I'll give you an example book. The first sport that I saw that said we can't stand for this anymore, Frisbee golf. Now, I don't know about you, but if I were analyzing, Hey, where does biological sex matter, not as much, I would be like throwing a Frisbee walking around in the woods, trying to make, trying to make a, you know, I think win there to be totally fair. I think there are some sports slash games where you could argue that they're that really, you know, billiards. Yeah, I think you could argue that there doesn't need to be any, you know, sex segregation and billiards. I mean, I'm a pretty wicked ping pong player. I know people are going to be like, Oh, unless you literally have played at a like a high national level, I could probably smoke you and ping pong out there. Just letting you know, you ever see me near a ping pong table, I'll show you guys what's up. But I think it ping pong may, you know, male female would be pretty close. There's some other games I can't think I'm going to have to use physical strength and rapid movement of substantial distance. It matters more. But even to the point, Buck Frisbee golf is saying men have a innate advantage in this sport. And you think about it, it's a little bit like golf, right? Like you can drive the ball further. You can throw further, but they were one of the first sports I saw this. Chess theory would be, you know, I'm a chess, a chess elite or, you know, chess athlete, you know, I love a little chess, not separated by gender. Yeah. So if you want to grow your hair long, change your name and say you're a woman or whatever, no problem. It's only a problem. This isn't about being mean to people or being exclusive. It's about reality. And as you and I know, you know, we've already seen this play out. I mean, men are bigger, stronger and faster than women. This is just what we're dealing with. If you have to argue with anybody about this, just hit them with this question. How come women who decide to identify as men aren't making male sports teams and having success? Because this is only a one way street, right? Because that's one of the arguments they try to make. Well, they're like, Oh, it balances out. Okay. If you don't think there is a biological advantage, how come there hasn't been a woman who decides to take testosterone pills and then suddenly ends up being able to compete at a high level of men's athletics. It's because that's not a biological man. And even taking testosterone pills does not cancel out all of the advantages that are innate of becoming a man. And I just use as an example, because I coach little league sports. But do you, you may even remember this, because it was such a big story. And I bet our crew in New York will remember it. Do you remember when they had the little league world series team had a pitcher that was too old? Like he was like 14 years old and they were claiming he was 12. And he was dominant. If you guys can look up that story, um, the difference between for anybody out there who has ever coached little league, the difference between a kid who has hit puberty and a kid who has not is seismic, because the first kid to get the mustache and little league sports tends to dominate because he's becoming a man and he's competing against boys. And it was like considered to be an outrage. Now, I believe it was a New York area team that had a kid with a fake base, a birth certificate. And he was a pitcher and he was able to be bigger, stronger, faster than the other kids. And that was just two years of advantage. And people said this was totally unacceptable for notions of fair play. That's why we have age limits. Well, that's also why we have sex limits in terms of boys and girls competing. Well, I coach teams, buck, literally, when a girl's like it's nine, 10 year old baseball, I've had girls on my team. There's not much difference between the sex. In fact, one of the best players on our team was a girl. Some of you out there probably play little league where girls were really athletic and decide they want to play with the boys. That was fine. Here's the example. Once puberty gets here, here's an example, of just the bio bio physical or biological differences in male and female strength. If you look at and they do this by bodyweight, which is also, you know, it's you're gonna find far fewer 200 pound women than you will 200 pound men, for example, right? I mean, I think the average American man actually, I don't even know what the average American man weighs right now, but let's just do it by weight class untrained. And then all the way up to elite, if you are a 200 pound man, you can bench press about 135 140 pounds, walking into a gym, never having lifted a weight in your life. Okay. So you're, you're expected to be able to bench press about 130, 540. And if you're an elite lifter at 200 pounds, you're 350 to 360 pounds plus that you're benching, right? So 50% more than your bodyweight. You go to women. And this is, you know, based on all the data of strength and bodyweight, you can pull together. If you found a 200 pound woman, which is to be, you know, there's far fewer of them or it's less common than it is. And this is again, man, this is I think in the, you know, like 25 to 40, you know, age range, a 200 pound woman who is untrained is expected to deal with bench press 90 pounds. And the absolute elite range at that same weight class is about 200 pounds. I mean, it so whether you're working out a lot or not, it's couldn't be any more obvious here that there is a difference in the biological structures and physical musculature of men. I mean, I work out at a gym down here in Miami Clay, there are literal fit female fitness models in there. Okay. People that, you know, on there, some of them are very, very strong and they got a lot of muscles and stuff. And most 220 pound guys listening to this right now can probably bench double what they do. Yeah, maybe 50% more, but probably double what they bench just walking in, putting the sandwich down for a few minutes. Yep. This is biology. Biology is real despite what the party of science wants to tell us, which is why there's an irony there. Let me hit this. These details, by the way, because I do think it's instructive. First of all, ask the question, how come girls who decide to identify as men can never compete on men's teams. That really throws people for a loop. It will not happen. It has not happened. And then use the example of this Danny. The kid was Danny Almonte. He was a team. He played little league baseball for a Bronx team. And after an investigation, he could throw the ball like crazy fast. He was two years too old to have competed in little league baseball. He was 14 and a 12 and under league. And it was a massive uproar over that cheating scandal. Well, if two years of masculinity make that much of a difference in terms of your ability to dominate, what is 18, 20 or 25 years of masculinity mean when it comes to competing against women? These are very basic questions, but they're very hard for people to answer. And to your point, Buck, I think that's why we're starting to win in this level, because people who understand sports see it directly that this is the definition of an anti competitive bias. And it should not be allowed. And I give credit to the international track and field for taking a stand on this issue. And I think every single league in America, every single high school, every single, you know, NCAA college, certainly pro sports. There's an issue right now in Australia, where a guy who identifies as a woman is trying to play Australian women's basketball. This is going to be an issue. And Megan Kelly was right when she said at some point, somebody's going to try to play in Wimbledon as a woman who's a dude, you're going to have WNBA be and taken over by guys. This is real. And it's going to happen. And it's absurd. And we need to call it out. Tunnel the towers foundations building its lets let us do good village in land, a lakes, Florida, just northeast at Tampa. First of its kind, a community of about 100 homes for tunnel the towers program recipients, a gold star family. The thortons moved in first Danielle and children Danielle is the widow. Her kids are Jalen and Kinsley after the death of their husband and the father, Robert, who was a US Army Sergeant. Danielle calls the new home they have a blessing in the lettuce, do good village, gold star families of first fallen first responders, severely injured first responders and service members. They're all neighbors, heroes and families of heroes live in one community so they can help one another heal. With every mortgage free home, the foundation makes good on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices of our nation's greatest heroes and what they have done to make our country and our community stronger. Make the lettuce do good village the first of many communities, like it donate $11 a month as both Buck and myself have done at t2t.org. That's t the number two t dot org.

Join me for the Carol Markowitz show new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back. We're closing up shop 15 hours up, 15 hours down. We appreciate all of you hung out with us all week long on Monday. We'll see what the craziness out there is and we'll be looking forward to hanging out with all of you. But I wanted to hit you some good news as we finish off the week. Encourage you to go subscribe Clay Travis Buck's section and show podcast. You will not miss a moment. Lots of cool unique offerings that are brand new and would otherwise not be discoverable unless you are going to be a podcast subscriber. So go do it. I saw this story, Buck and I wanted to have a good story to close out the week. I don't think the story has actually gotten as much attention as it should have. Some of you will remember in Washington state, we appreciate everybody out there listening in Washington state right now. A coach named Joseph Kennedy was at Bremerton High School and he was an assistant football coach and after games, he would pray at the 50 yard line and sometimes other kids would decide to pray alongside of him. It wasn't compelled. It was for people who felt this is actually pretty common Buck as you probably know, even though you're not a huge sports fan, it's very common for after football games before football games for there to be prayers. It's a violent sport. People want people. I mean, I am I am in America. Yeah, I do. I do. I do watch some sport. So you're you're familiar with this. This is not uncommon right after a game for everybody together and to pray. Well, in Washington state, he was fired from his job for choosing to pray after games. And he eventually took his case all the way to the Supreme Court. It took seven years. He was suspended from his coaching job in 2015. And he said it was my covenant between me and God after every game, win or lose, I'm going to do it right there on the field of battle. He sued the school district. It went all the way to the Supreme Court. Justice Neil Goresack said the constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression for religious and non religious views alike. He won his case at the Supreme Court. This coach did. It was ordered that he be rehired as an assistant coach. They paid for all of his lawyers and he got a $1.7 million settlement. So for everybody out there, Buck, going into the weekend, I know sometimes it can be frustrating. You feel like truth and justice is not always winning. This story to me of a guy just an assistant high school football coach fought for seven years to get his right to pray after a football game and a public high school allowed. And now not only did he win all the way at the U S Supreme Court, he's getting his assistant coaching job back and $1.7 million. That my friends is a win. It's a good day for America. Good day. Makes me makes me happy. Justice can be done. I want to I want to remember that that it is possible because next week it may very well feel like justice doesn't really get done very much in this country at all, depending on how the situation plays out in New York City. Dare we call this book a beautiful result? I think it's definitely a handsome result. It's very handsome. This is a result that works out a lot. I for people out there who are not aware, Buck described Michael Angelo's David as a beautiful man. And there've been a lot of reactions rolling in as to whether or not a man can be beautiful. I just thought we're on history class for a second here. I thought I thought we were in the trust tree. I thought we were in the nest. Oh, it's such as old school. One of the great all time movies. The Frank the Tank would have called Michelangelo's David a beautiful man. Certainly after a few you need to watch old school again now that you're married because one of I think the funniest there's a ton of funny scenes in old school. But when Frank the Tank is going through and he gets offered a beer bomb and he says, no, he's got a really busy day. He's got to go to Home Depot and you know, I will say, it wasn't me just so ever it wasn't me. I did have a friend in college though, who during senior week went streaking and he got arrested. And this was in the Carolinas and they kept him naked in the back of the squad car. So streaking in the movies is one thing. Streaking in real life. Very different. Did they give him clothes when he got to the jail? They gave him like a blanket to wrap up in at the jail. But he was naked in the backseat of the car and handcuffed. I remember he told me about this. This is not you do not want to be. It was not me. I'm not an egg. I hope he didn't drop the soap. I appreciate all of you. I hope all of you have fantastic weekends. Good congratulations that coach in Washington. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast.
