    "text": " And here it is folks the week of the January 6 hearings begins our guest Glenn Kirschner a 30 year former federal prosecutor who now hosts the world famous podcast Justice Matters excited to have Glenn Kirschner on the podcast breaking down what we can expect during the January 6 hearings the January 6 hearings will be on prime time starting at 8 Eastern you can watch the January 6 hearings live on the Midas Touch podcast we will begin with pre game coverage of the January 6 hearings post game coverage of the January 6 hearings we will be breaking it down for you live as the hearings take place we'll also be talking about on this podcast a political action group that is supporting Georgia's Republican candidate for Senate Herschel Walker who was giving away gas vouchers to people $25 vouchers and basically saying you got a vote for Walker don't vote for Warnock in exchange for these gas vouchers very strange potentially unlawful we will break that down on the podcast a new CBS poll says that nearly 50% of Republicans believe that we shouldn't do anything to address mass shootings that America should just accept mass shootings let me repeat that that's half of Republicans basically think that you shouldn't take any action at all just mass shootings and you got to live with it you just live with something we have to live with every single day we are having like not even like one mass shooting anymore like you'll go through the weekend you'll have like oh 10 mass shootings happened over the weekend 30 mass shootings happened in the past week it's a real epidemic in this country and Republicans don't want to do a damn thing about it well it's the same Republican party that held its radical right turning points conventions purportedly its women's convention was held this past weekend and the main attraction was a pitch to the audience to marry Kyle Rittenhouse and they brought Kyle Rittenhouse on the stage with a golden retriever and talked about how all the women should marry him we're gonna break down these issues on the Midas Touch podcast I guess where do we even start with this craziness this fascism this hate this bizarness on the GOP I know where we could start brothers we're gonna start with little Stevie Lawson out of Georgia. Stevie Lawson. Now die hard listeners of the Midas Touch podcast probably know a little bit of our history with Stevie Lawson and everybody else is probably like who the heck is Stevie Lawson? Ben why don't you give a little retrospective for the new listeners because oh this is this is getting good guys Stevie Lawson basically makes the wrong decision his entire career so Stevie Lawson started working with DeSantis like early and left DeSantis to work for Kelly Loeffler which in and of itself is a ridiculous decision to make but Lawson was DeSantis communication guy number one then he works for the Kelly Loeffler Loeffler campaign and left-ler as they call her. Looting left-ler as I mean I think everybody calls her Looting left-ler at this point and Stevie Lawson started like going into my comments this is when like Midas Touch was first growing and our platform wasn't even that big and the guy just continually would like just say things to me in my comments so I was finally like dude what are you doing you work for Looting left-ler this is completely absurd so because he was trying to like pick on me he drew my attention and then I exposed just what a ridiculously bad communications director he was like I think inarguably the left-ler campaign was like the worst communications effort imaginable and so because this Stevie Lawson was continually in my messages I felt like we had to talk about him so we talked about him on a podcast was this from February of 2021 was that one this podcast was this early-diver reference previously Lawson jumping into our messages on his because it was constant little Stevie Lawson preplay the tape and not only that but he would like creep into my replies and I wouldn't even like realize it until like I would just see other people attacking him from being in my replies let me just pause it to say we look like each of us look like 15 years younger dude we have aged all of us so much in the last year and a half rough times all right let's let's keep playing yeah keep playing keep playing and I'd be like dude you're the deputy campaign manager like like can you just get out of my freaking replies man well he was proved to be the very worst uh campaign manager that there was we made a video about him let's play the clip from the last minus the podcast where I talked about Kelly Loughler's horrible clip within a glad you're Stevie Loughler's communications director kept me campaign manager Steven Lawson little Stevie little Stevie you got a little Stevie Stevie I'm looking at you you seditious trader you despicable disgusting human being you may have blocked me on Twitter for calling you out as the worst political operative in the history but don't think the Midas mighty has forgotten Stevie Lawson thought that he was some fucking rock star wanting to boost his twitter fucking presence and looks like a piece of shit fool Stevie Lawson Stevie Lawson you embarrassed the country you embarrassed the family little Stevie then go on to say in the podcast the original one that not the one the clip within the clip wait what if we just kept what if it was like in that clip it was then like and we spoke about him in the last episode and it just kept happening by saying insertion might as such podcast inception the rest of the episode of just flashbacks but I was pressured to play the end of that clip where I say he always finds himself on the wrong side of history wherever he's working how many times can one person just be on the wrong side of history I mean little Stevie Lawson you know little Stevie Lawson self-flagellates he's an S&M I'm I'm this is my opinion I have no facts this is just my own personal opinion I think he self flagellates you know so he whips himself and I think he's totally into S&M like he just loves being beat you could tell with that shit eating grin of his that little Stevie Lawson is just such he's such a I won't even go there all right I can imagine why the guy doesn't like us well here's the thing there was definitely a different energy I had back then too I mean I'm not sure have I gotten way more mature now no man you're becoming way too mainstream we want that old man energy stream I mean that what was that it was that kind of I mean I'm the same human being but I listen to myself talk and I'm like that's pretty brutal and then a wild part about that all he really do is she'll bet you in the replies like it wasn't like that like he didn't come other than imagine if he actually did something well he did do something and that's why we're bringing him back up today well yeah well why we bring up little Stevie Lawson we've aged a lot to a lot of growth that we've undergone mature maturity wise we'll see we'll see where this segment goes but yeah so as as Geordie predicted he's always on the wrong side of history um yeah following Looting Lefler's campaign he started working for a group to try to stop Stacey Abrams from running for governor and that didn't exactly work and now he's one of the main people apparently behind this group 34 and 22 that was doing this gas voucher scheme and also who was he doing this gas voucher scheme with um that you see in these videos it was somebody by the name of Angela Stanton King and she was convicted I think around 2004 for a conspiracy relating to Car Theft she was pardoned by Donald Trump in 2020 she's the individual you see on this video actually giving the gas vouchers she's a QAnon supporter also she denies that she's a QAnon supporter but Brett let's play the clip from the guardian of them asking her about her tweeting things like the storm is coming and other types of uh tweets this was her response when the guardian asked this to her about two years ago you have been accused of sympathizing with the QAnon conspiracy theory who accused me of that many people I just wanted to ask you about a few tweets that you know I need you to be factual who accused me of that because what is an accusation is that something that's been proven in court have I ever gone on record and said I'm a member of QAnon because I have not okay so who are the people that accused me of that so when you tweeted this isn't about COVID-19 or Black Lives Matter this is a major cover up for pedophilia and human trafficking that has nothing to do with QAnon what did you mean what did you mean by that exactly what I said well give me some evidence I don't think it needs any explanation okay so when you said did Ghislaine Maxwell tip off tip off authorities about wayfare what did you mean by that exactly what I said what's the next one so do you believe that an online exactly what I said it you know you can read what's the next one do you believe that an online exactly what I said what's the next one do you believe we done let's go do you believe that an online furniture retailer is peddling a global hate affiliate conspiracy then as he proceeds to go and asks her why do you write the storm is coming and she said it was a stormy day that day there was a right it was right yeah what about the tweet when you said the storm is here that's that's cumin on it was raining that day it was raining that day yeah yeah I think that's sort of the things that bothers me the most about republicans this is intellectual dishonesty where you can't just admit that that's what you're saying like just own it like if you're going to be crazy if you're going to be a qAnon person just say yeah and like at least own the fact that you are a qAnon supporter instead of being like oh the storm is coming oh it was a rainy day that day like fuck that what are you talking about it do with everything though and you see it with the politicians too like with this abortion ban that's on its way when Rose inevitably gonna get overturned I mean they don't want to spike the football although they will be gleefully cheering in the corner quietly it's lies and gaslighting over and over again but it is but it's the same thing with the Ted Cruz like complaining about the green new deal being responsible for the Texas energy grid a there is no green deal the Texas runs its own energy grid it's that constant gaslighting and bad faith just engagement that really is the main thing amongst other things obviously but it's really one of the big things that really bothers me about these people just so disingenuous just liars yeah well here's the thing people are like well republicans are really good messengers no they're not they just fucking lie all the time they lie and they have megaphones like Fox News to then perpetuate those lies and right-wing radio to perpetuate those lies but they're really not listen to what they say they're really not savvy messengers they're really not they're not they're based is just simply not critical of the lies that they're saying you know it's like saying was putting a good messengers by saying that his purpose of invading Ukraine was denotsification there's no different there's no different of a tactic and what republicans are doing there and you go oh is putting a great you know a great you know communicator we here go no that's the most ridiculous thing but guess what Russia TV says that's accurate similarly with republican yeah similarly with republicans that's exactly what's going on in you know with Fox News and with their right-wing echo chambers and they yeah is their unity within their message yeah but it's a unity to whatever the new big lie is of the day so just going back to this gas voucher scheme these are the individuals who are on there you got Stevie Lawson out there little stuck it little Stevie you got him out there with Angela Stanton King who we now know about her background she was also the person in that photo with Trump remember that photo where they were like praying for him uh-huh yeah she was the one right behind him in that photo for our viewers you can you can pull up that photo and you can see her and she's the one who received a pardon by Trump but anyway they're giving away these gas vouchers you know and then they're basically gaslighting people to say we were telling people to vote for Herschel Walker we were in telling people not to vote for Warnock and we went over and eclipse the laws that could be potentially violated here and we talked about the Georgia law at stake here and the Georgia law is found at title 21 section 21-2-570 giving a receiving offering to give or receive or participating in the giving or receiving the money or gifts for registering as a voter voting or voting for a particular candidate the law says quote any person who gives or receives offers to give or receive or participates in the giving or receiving of money or gifts for the purpose of registering as a voter voting or voting for a particular candidate in any primary or election shall be guilty of a felony now you will recall that bipartisan or nonpartisan groups were out there during the earlier elections giving water to people and they were not saying because by law they couldn't say vote for this person or vote for that one they were giving food and water to people and the Georgia Republicans threw a fit and said that was unlawful conduct that was a legal conduct how dare you give people water who have to wait on these lines for hours and hours and hours or how dare you give them and then they do this and then they engage in this type of conduct which is the exact opposite of everything they claim that they are trying to stop I mean this is what exactly what they rail against and they rail against it so then they can do it in the most egregious way possible and Ben this is what they're willing to put on camera and show people publicly imagine what they are doing behind the scenes corruptly to influence our elections and we all need to be aware of it we all need to be aware of these deceitful tactics and we should all call the FEC tip line and make complaints about this and have them at minimum investigate the behavior that is going on here oh no doubt there needs to be an investigation behind this I mean could you imagine if might have touched in this and then you have 18 US code section 597 expenditures to influence voting this is the federal statute which says whoever makes or offers to make an expenditure to any person either to vote or withhold his vote or to vote for or against any candidate shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year or both and if the violation is willful that will be two years or both now you clearly see in the video them saying do not vote for Warnock while giving away the gift I mean that's pretty clear of what we see taking place in the video and that is not supposed to happen in these situations but you know as you just dig deeper into like what is going on who's behind Herschel Walker there and you start seeing right that it's people like little Stevie Lawson with his background and you start seeing its people like Angela Stanton King with her background what does that tell you about who this GOP is let me tell you exactly what it tells you about who the GOP is let's go to that poll where the GOP says basically 50 percent it was actually 44 percent to be specific based on the CBS poll are saying that it is acceptable to them they accept mass shootings as just a way of life there's nothing that can be done politicians shouldn't do anything as part of their freedoms apparently they believe they should have the freedom to be shot and killed and Americans should be shot and killed in mass shootings which is utterly ridiculous but it is to be fair consistent at least with their view about COVID and about the pandemic which is that they were fine with millions and millions of people dying they were fine spreading conspiracies you know but for the vaccines that were out and it's an egregious number of people who have died based on the mishandling of this from the very outset without the vaccine actually going out to the people the way Biden was able to mass mobilize and get this out remember what a disaster it was under Trump where like you couldn't find or get the vaccine anywhere finally with Biden he was able to get these vaccines out we probably would have had three to four million more people dead if that vaccine wasn't out and I want you to think about and the Republicans were absolutely fine with it they're absolutely fine with it and here's the thing you would think well maybe when their close family member dies or or a friend dies that maybe they would change their views nope it really doesn't like we've heard stories where Republican politicians have been over and over and over again how these anti-vaxxers and they don't care like they have this strange view this incredibly nihilistic dystopian view of life where death is just except as is an acceptable solution like they don't view dying is not a good thing but that's why I am not being facetious in any way when I call the Republican Party a death cult and I use the word cult on purpose because that is one of the main tenants of a cult it's never deviate from a cult never distrust the cult the cult is always right the cult leader is always right just trust in the plan and you could go down all the main factions of the Republican Party and they all lead to this cult-like behavior whether it's with Trump or QAnon you name it it's all part of this death cult more than a dozen think about that more than a dozen mass shootings not this month not this year this past weekend you guys this past weekend in America and we don't have a Republican Party willing to do even the most basic of things to make sure that people don't die and by the way you speak up you're a Republican like a Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger they toss you out immediately you're woke go woke go broke you're woke and on the other side of that you become a mass and cothorn who tell us secrets inside the party inside the community they kick you out it's a very very weird thing that we're all with I mean it's it's honestly like it's like Scientology right I mean I think that's probably one of the biggest examples everybody knows in Scientology they have Suppressive Persons Suppressive Persons are people who deviate from the beliefs of Scientology and they are outcast and these could be your close family members in Scientology this could be your son this could be your significant other this could be anybody but once they deviate from what your cult leader is telling you then you become a Suppressive Person and you are kicked out of that group and the Republican Party operates in the same exact way yeah you become woke and to become woke is like a Suppressive Person and then you're and then you're out and you're woke because I don't support an insurrection because I believe in vaccines that vaccines work and or I believe in following what the medical community is saying and Ben look at what Ron DeSantis just did this weekend to that effect Ron DeSantis punished the Tampa Bay Rays by vetoing their funding for their stadium now we could and because that they spoke out against gun violence against children they spoke out against gun violence they made a donation to a gun safety group and Ron DeSantis when he received the budget he made a line item and crossed out the funding for the Tampa Bay Rays stadium now we could debate the merits of paying for these stadiums and I would say you know maybe it's not a good idea to pay for these stadiums often but that's really not the concern here the concern here is why is that money being vetoed the money being vetoed here is because they decided to use their free speech to speak out not against anything crazy but to say we don't want kids to die and Ron DeSantis goes oh go woke go broke you're no longer getting your funding for the party that talks about cancel culture and they speak about cancel culture in terms of private individuals criticizing other private individuals for takes that are inappropriate this is literal cancel culture and actual censorship the government take using the power of the government to silence and punish a business because you're in disagreement over a specific issue but that's not all that DeSantis did this weekend that was despicable DeSantis also was brave enough to attack you guessed it did the special Olympics now you heard me right DeSantis threatened to levy an eight figure fine against the special Olympics if they didn't drop its covid 19 vaccine requirement for its games in Orlando the special Olympics of course is full of people who are immunocompromised this is a matter of life or death for a lot of the attendees and a lot of the participants and DeSantis said I will find you eight figures if you do this and so they caved because they were like we can't we can't afford that right we cannot afford that fine and that is the government bullying people into submission that is what this whole go woke go broke movement is about and that's why we need to fight back against this fascism and this corruption it's more than bullying Ron DeSantis is a hostage taker that's what he's doing he's holding all of these companies all of these people all of the pro democracy folks in Florida hostage saying hey if you don't agree with me on a hundred percent of the things that I truly believe well guess what your project's not getting funded you're not getting x y and z it's just it's not right here's the thing bread it was reported as DeSantis threatening the special Olympics but I read the letter that the agency sent the special Olympics I mean the letter says you are hereby fined 27 or 28 million dollars it didn't even like give a due process solution it didn't say you may be fined it literally says you are actually fined 27 and 28 million dollars because you had a requirement to have people be vaccinated and to wear masks in the special Olympics and Brett you talk about these other efforts literally in all aspects of life he's doing this some which aren't reported and get the headlines but or they get the headlines for a day in our mass media forgets about these things but you recall for example the social media law that he passed which would have forced twitter and facebook to permit people to spread covid disinformation to spread hate speech to spread the big lie because people who would spread that disinfo would be taken off the platforms because the platforms want to create safe spaces so if you spread the big lie or covid disinfo or you know spread this fake information about ivermectin you would you would you know get penalized by the platforms and so he made a law that basically would find these social media companies to the point of taking them out of business ultimately they're the 11th circuit ruled you're violating the social media platforms first amendment rights but then Greg Abbott tried to do the exact same thing in Texas it actually reached the supreme court recently because the fifth circuit actually allowed Greg Abbott's version of that law to stay into the place unfortunately the supreme court basically said look we need to wait and at least hear what the arguments are before allowing the Abbott law to stay in place so we'll allow the district courts ruling which was the lower courts ruling which stopped Abbott's law to remain in place while the case gets litigated but there you have a dissent from Justice Alito and Justice Alito basically says we live in a very different world now so much things have changed and so we can't look at the first amendment the same way anymore because social media platforms have now become like common carriers so we need to look at the constitution like an evolving document oh where have we heard the exact fucking argument before with the Republicans on everything that doesn't suit their narrative when it comes to assault weapons that's not what the argument that they use the exact opposite when it comes to a woman's right to choose they don't use that argument it's the exact opposite but when it comes to all of a sudden the right of private actors to exercise free speech we live in a whole new modern age that the founders couldn't predict it that's what they say then one it's absurd that's what they said and one more thing I want to mention about Texas as we talk about gun control and and and gun reform did you know this fact this is really insidious that Texas has a law which says that banks can't do business with the state of Texas if they take political positions that are basically a pro-gun reform or if the gun or if the banks won't lend to these gun manufacturers if the banks take any position like that Texas says we won't do business with you so these large big Texas pension funds where you know that give these banks you know hundreds of millions of dollars in fees Texas basically says you better support the gun manufacturers who are putting guns in the hands of 18 year olds or this state won't do business with you and they wield that and retaliate against banks so that's why these corporations can't be more robust in their support of things that their workers actually support because you have these fascistic authoritarian leaders like Greg Abbott and like DeSantis and that's happening on all of these issues across across the board and going from you know that to even the more absurd you then have Kyle Rittenhouse showing up at what is called the women's convention most of the speakers I saw were men at this turning points women convention but that's all I saw through the social media and they have them on stage with the golden retriever and you know the the host of it is saying that Kyle Rittenhouse is a real man and that you need to marry him a woman would be lucky to marry a Kyle Rittenhouse what in the world is this I mean going back to the cult behavior this is some of the most disturbing and disgusting you know you know just just thing in the there conception of of the world man yeah I mean it's it's another kind of cult gathering these these events that Charlie Kirk puts on and especially it's very very very dystopian when you see Kyle Rittenhouse being wheeled out there like some sort of hero being pitched as the epitome of manhood and what all women should inspire to marry and their whole thing also there is about subjugating women their whole thing there is about a woman's place in the world is to marry a man and to care for that man that is it and to make babies make as many babies as possible was something that they kept hitting throughout this because they don't want women to have careers to have power to have a say in the government that's why they really are trying to take America into a handmaid's tail style form of just total subjugation of women that's I mean that's what this whole event is about that Rittenhouse clip was one of the most disturbing I mean he came out to a thunderous applause like he was like a beetle he's a hero to them it's disgusting really disturbing and then it's about the women need to marry this man I mean where are we talking about this is why the stakes could not be higher this week as the January 6th hearings are taking place because our democracy normalcy is on the line and you listening to this you watching this when you go well what can we do what is the solution you're looking at the person in the mirror that's it you can control what you can control I can control what I could control and Brett and Jordi can control what we can control and what they can control and so it's all about just making sure you're using every day every every every moment you have the opportunity to not give up to not be defeatist to not overcome when you think about like fascist regimes across the world and the history of fascist regimes they usually only represent about 25 to 30 percent of the population but like the example of the frog that's boiling in the pot and the frog just stays there in the pot until they're fully boiled while the water's getting hotter and hotter and hotter we can't be the frog in the pot and that's what happens in fascistic countries that's the history of it they're the frog in the pot until finally the fascist overthrows them because the people are like well it's hot but I gotta go to work it's hot but you know I gotta do this this week and it's hot but you know and before you know it you are boiled and that's what Midas touch is trying to tell you when trying to not get you boiled right now and the way to do that is to raise your voice and to be heard and to reach out and to share you know the Midas touch videos to share the videos that you've seen and to just not give up because the other side they're smaller if we all went out there and voted we would destroy them in every single election but it's because they're out there lined up like a cult unified with their big bizarre lies and their dystopian death cult they want to anoint but you are being called upon at this great moment to do something truly great with your lifetime and that's what we're asking of you which is to get out there register voters and do something and save our democracy together someone who's on the front line not to cut you off at the knees here Ben that was a really powerful speech right before we bring Glenn but frog in the pot do you mean do you mean like a lobster I'm what's this frog in a pot analogy I've never heard that one before it's because you don't read um let's bring in you never really heard of the frog in the pot analogy boiling frog syndrome it's a thing all right you guys tell me it's just thing fine I'll go around tell people it's a thing okay so let's bring you up the premise is that boiling frog you can Wikipedia boiling frog syndrome we had really needed a thing it's a thing I get it okay how premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water it will jump out but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to boil slowly it will not perceive the danger and it will be cooked to death you learn something every day on this podcast that's why you got to hang out around Brett and me more let's bring in Glenn Kersder on the pot our interview with Glenn Kersder but

kershner nbc news msnbc legal analyst former 30 year federal prosecutor and now leads justice matters podcast incredible organization galen kershner welcome to the pod hey guys great to see you again so glenn over time you know it seems like we check in with you every you know two months or so i'm going to be so bold as to say right now you are one of the if not in my opinion the most trusted source out there for legal news kind of cutting through the bs and it's been so incredible to see that what do you think that is just resonating with the people and how you deliver this information that maybe the mainstream media isn't picking up on because i'd like to see this news get out there to as many people as possible first of all that's very flattering thank you for that and you know i i guess i i tried to learn how to cut through the bs and 30 years of standing in front of juries trying to persuade them of the righteousness of the case we brought the quality and quantity of the evidence and why it was the right thing to do for 12 citizens to hold accountable a fellow citizen for breaking the laws of our jurisdiction so you know and i'm not a journalist i'm a legal analyst and a prosecutor by trade and by career so i don't have to present both sides of every issue and there are two sides to many of the issues that we're contending with you know treason doesn't have another side there's no flip side of the treason coin that kind of gives some plausible explanation for why a president of the united states would launch an attack against the certification of his opponent's win refuse to call it off for three hours sit there watch it gleefully rewinding to the good parts which i guess are the parts where i don't know his angry mod was giving the capital police officers officers and especially good beatdown you know having people streaming into the white house dining room begging the president of the united states to call off the attack that he launched against the u.s. capital and then we learned most recently that he won was angry and frustrated that mike pence was being whisked to safety and he said maybe mike pence should be hanged when you read the the statue that covers the crime of treason it couldn't be simpler or more straightforward if you owe allegiance to the united states and you wage and you levy war against the united states you're guilty of treason you know give any competent prosecutor time in front of a jury and i maintain that we can prove the crime of treason has been committed and that you know that's kind of the granddaddy of all crimes against the united states i also maintain we could prove a seditious conspiracy we could certainly prove inciting an insurrection and what i think all of these charges what will happen with all of these charges if doj asserts the rule of law as it should is they will all be brought under the umbrella of what we call a 371 conspiracy which is a very broad criminal statute that provides anyone who conspires to defraud or commit crimes against the united states is guilty of a 371 conspiracy against the united states i you know i can't imagine i can't conceive of our department of justice not bringing those charges against Donald trump and his co-conspirators and glenn i want to get to that in a bit the grand jury that the doj has and paneled um what their recent subpoena activity tells us specifically to peter nivaro but i want to reflect on what you said for a second because i think you hit the nail on the head right there which is that the media and how it is communicating treason is that it has equal merit to the non treason side of the argument and it's just being portrayed as just two legitimate arguments well on the one hand you have a coup and fascism and on the other side you had democracy if you rewind in our history i don't recall though i wasn't alive at the time period i'll admit but as a student of history the media taking a pro nixon break-in of the watergate side and being a proponent of that and saying that was actually there's legitimate reasons why you may want to break in and take the dncs information what we have now is a nuclear bomb version of that right that would be like a little missile compared to the nuclear bomb that was the fascist coup that was trying to overthrow the united states government but i think you just said it clearly what it is which is you just tell it how it is and how it is is treason doesn't have a defense in this situation yeah yeah uh watergate was shoplifting as compared to what we're experiencing right now with you know a concerted effort to kill our democracy let's call it what it is and then you you had a great point because i think the media is stuck abiding by um quite little norms and traditions with respect to feeling this compulsion to try to present both sides of everything and you know what there is a parallel problem in the department of justice which is forever stuck on its norms and traditions and i'll give you one example but i definitely do want to get to the recent subpoena to peter navaro and everything that came after it you know in the department of justice we have a i'm going to call it a quaint little norman tradition of not taking any overt law enforcement action within 60 days of an election that could impact the election or that could be perceived as partisan well we're investigating insurrectionists in congress who are running for reelection the last thing you do is give an insurrectionist an election holiday so they can get reelected become even more firmly entrenched in our federal government and continue to try to kill us from within that's why you know those norms and traditions served us well for a long time now they're actually doing damage and i can say that in the fourth estate and i can say that in our federal government we need to move forward with the times last week peter navaro was charged with contempt of congress um earlier in the week he was also subpoenaed for other information from the d oj so those two were not necessarily related but then the d oj also um sent a letter rather that they were subpoenaed by the grand jury i should say um the d oj then also sent a letter to congress saying that it would not be prosecuting mark meadows chief of staff and deputy chief of staff dans kavino what do you make of all that activity yeah the justice gods give with one hand and take away with the other um i feel like we were all sort of writing at justice high when we saw peter navaro has finally been indicted for the crime he inarguably committed contempt of congress and i believe that's just for openers when it comes to peter navaro and then virtually hours later we see that the department of justice has declined to prosecute mark meadows and dans kavino for precisely the same crime contempt of congress and i did a pretty um deep dive video on the three leading candidates as i see them knowing the dc u s attorney's office from the inside the way i do which is where all of this is unfolding so and let me try to bang out the three possibilities really quickly first of all we often will do coordinated interviews what do i mean by that well these three individuals navaro meadows and skavino were in sort of a similar legal bucket in at least one sense they were all referred for prosecution by congress for contempt for defying congressional subpoenas so doj had three decisions to make of course they already made the earlier decision they indicted steve bannen for that crime it could very well be that peter navaro who received the grand jury subpoena for june second to come in and among other things provide all evidence and information about his communications with donald trump first of all what does that tell us it tells us that doj absolutely is criminally investigating donald trump in the grand jury that's the only way to read that request that subpoena that peter navaro received i have a feeling on june second we had and i am not looking to offend anybody's religious practices or sensibilities we call it a come to jesus meeting and we sit down with a peter navaro and we say look sport you got two ways to go here you can either fully cooperate tell us about what you did because we can't deal with any cooperating witness until they unload their own criminal misconduct because only then can we credit what they tell us about the misconduct of others tell us what you did and then tell us what everybody else did donald trump uh steve bannen mike flinn broody juliani etc etc etc and he had a decision to make and it looks like peter navaro probably told the prosecutors go take a flying leap and he you know green base swept himself right into an indictment that's what he did because the next day june third the indictment was unsealed and we arrested him and presented him for his arraignment on that indictment i have a feeling it might be that we also met in a coordinated series of meetings with um meadows and with scabino the same day we we offered them the same opportunity look we can bang you out for an indictment for contempt of congress or you can cooperate maybe those other two individuals said you know what we're sick and tired of covering up for donald trump's crimes because when you cover up for donald trump's crimes you're committing more crimes yourself like accessory after the fact and this prison of a felony and maybe they decided to cooperate now some people will say you know what i don't see meadows and scabino cooperating and and that could be so here's a second possibility it may be the doj said look bannen and navaro they have no executive privilege to claim meadows and scabino they were the chief of staff and deputy chief of staff to the president of the united states they have a more robust executive privilege to claim even though ultimately i believe we could defeat it in court for lots of reasons but you know you layer on top of that that meadows actually tried to cooperate early on and provided thousands of documents to the j six committee before he ultimately quit the program and said i'm not complying anymore and those documents it turned out were deeply incriminating of donald trump some of them so i could see the department of justice which marked my words i was on the inside for decades they do not like to take difficult novel challenging cases to court and they especially shy away from cases that present made in legal voyages not their strong suit they may have said look there's enough in the mix here that we're going to decline to bring this misdemeanor charge for contempt of congress against meadows and scabino that does not mean nobody should interpret that as meadows and scabino are in the clear because i believe meadows particularly when you see the text messages and phone calls that were coming in around the time of the insurrection meadows looks like you know he was treason central you know i i've said i could see him you know taking calls you know mark meadows how can i direct your treasonous call and he's in real trouble he's in real trouble so i would expect him to get rolled in to the three seventy one conspiracy against the united states and i don't think this declination on this misdemeanor charge of contempt of congress is any indication that that's not going to happen yeah mark meadows was the hub because donald trump doesn't take text messages or phone calls so they were all literally being routed to the guy and he was the one coordinating it when you read those messages that have been released they are totally outrageous so do you think we've now reached are we in a new phase would you say of the d oj's investigation where they had focused on the lower level people the mid-level people the highest of the mid-level people and the crazies like the proud boys and all of these people though and now they're trying to connect it to the highest levels are we there yet yeah i i don't think d oj sees it as phases i just i think they see it as the natural progression of what is an unprecedented criminal investigation and they continue to work their way up the criminal ladder to the command structure of the insurrection and i think that is um is obviously what happened both by the navaro sapeenah seeking all communications with donald trump that means they are investigating trump and there was a series of other sapeenah seeking information about you know rudi juliani and jenna ellis and john eastman and uh chesa bro africana kennath chesa bro these are some of the other sort of nefarious lawyers who were architecting various pieces of the insurrection so they're absolutely working their way up and you know i i was heartened when i read the interview in salan with norma isen who is you know a man of significant accomplishments and was president obama's who in one of his government ethics gurus as assistant white house counsel we're assistant to the president i guess and he said look i've known maricarland for years and he may be quiet but he fears no man and he has trump in his sights i'm paraphrasing a little bit but you know from the people who really know maricarland as do some of my colleagues you know i met him but i i don't pretend to know him i have heard nothing but um reassuring things about the man he is and even though i think he suffers from some of the same problems we talked about earlier where we just abide by these old norms and traditions i maintain he's moved too slowly i maintain he hasn't brought charges in a way that meets the urgency of the moment the moment that we are living in the danger to our democracy but that doesn't mean he's not going to get there in what he believes will be the most bullet-proof case he can put together i'm actually feeling more optimistic than less optimistic at this point. Glenn speaking of lawyers and speaking of the viral i got to get your take what do you think in the viral representing himself and we're going to get to the answer to Brett's question in a second but first we got to talk to you about one of our sponsors upstart Brett you want to tell them about upstart sure thing Ben upstart powered personal loans can help you pay down high interest debt all online with simple and easy to understand payment terms upstart has helped over 1.8 million you heard that right 1.8 million customers on their path to financial freedom so whether it's paying off credit cards consolidating high interest debt or funding personal expenses upstart can help get you one fixed monthly payment with a clear payoff date upstart knows you're more than just your credit score so rather than looking at your credit score alone upstart model considers other factors like your income employment and other information provided in your loan application to find you a smarter rate on your loan you could check your rate of minutes for loans between $1,000 to $50,000 without impacting your credit score at all and you could even receive funds as fast as one business day after accepting your loan so don't wait and check your rate today at upstart.com slash mitis that's upstart.com slash mitis to check your rate today don't forget to use our URL to let them know that we sent you loan amounts will be determined based on your credit income and certain other information provided in your loan application so go to upstart.com mei das.

Now let's get back to our interview with Glenn Kirschner. Glenn speaking of lawyers and speaking of Navarro I got to get your take what do you think Navarro representing himself right now? Yeah he has a fool for a client and here's my favorite you know he will probably ultimately end up hiring a lawyer but let's be clear the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution says everybody has a right to counsel but as importantly everybody has the right to self-representation that's the lifeblood of the law. The government can't force a lawyer on you if you want to represent yourself yes he has a fool for a client and all those those sayings I think you know are especially apropos for a guy like Peter Navarro but here's my favorite part you know he just seems to think that by giving his criminal conduct a cute nickname it's not criminal I mean he's going on TV it was the Green Bay sweep it was the Green Bay sweep and what were they they were sweeping Joe Biden out of his rightful win and sweeping Donald Trump back in for a second term as an aspiring dictator I said listen if I rob a bank and I get caught like Peter Navarro has been caught and I say whoa whoa whoa whoa big rob a bank yeah I was just deploying the the Tom Brady accelerated withdrawal play that's what it is well guess what it's still a crime Navarro I'm sorry I don't I don't like to call people names the way Donald Trump does he's a stone cold clown is what he is who had no business ever setting foot in the White House except on the visitor tour no no doubt about that what do you make of the tension that we're seeing right now though between the Justice Department and the January 6th committee we also that letter that the January 6th committee had submitted to DOJ after the declination to indict meadows and Skavino what do you make of that relationship right now you know I think it's a healthy relationship because after all these are co-equal branches of government and they should not be you know walking together on this journey hand-in-hand figuratively speaking because they actually have significantly different mandates and responsibilities I think it's healthy to have the co-equal branches of government you know sometimes butt heads as long as they're doing it respectfully and professionally and honorably so I'm not troubled by it at all so for example when the Department of Justice said hey Chairman Thompson we kind of like those thousand interviews we'd like those thousand transcripts because that's going to help inform our criminal investigation and representative Thompson appropriately in my estimation said you know what there are we're about to launch public hearings and I'm reading between the lines you'll get them when you get them now if I were representative Thompson I would also say by the way where's the subpoena for them because then there's some legal cover if the j6 committee turns over its work product and we won't go into what actually constitutes work product but I would require a subpoena because that is the legal process by which I think one branch of government should request and receive information from another at least sometimes so yeah I think I think this is healthy and I think both Congress and the executive branch understand what's at stake here and I do think they're going to move forward together as much as they can. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman has told us that the star witness that we all need to be looking for during these hearings is former Trump aid and Meadows advisor Cassidy Hutchinson you know you agree with that sentiment you agree that she will have some bombshell testimony that the public needs to hear. She's important but I don't think there's a star witness I think Donald Trump will be the star of the show that we won't testify because we are going to hear in vivid and grotesque detail what he did to attack our democracy what he did you know either that was either designed to hurt Mike Pence or you know Mike Pence was collateral damage and he could care less about what happened to Mike Pence if it meant him retaining power unlawfully and constitutionally he was all in so yes Cassidy Hutchinson will be important because she heard lots of things Mark Meadows said for example she it was attributed to her that Mark Meadows comes out of the Oval Office or the White House dining room I forget which and said Donald Trump just said maybe Mike Pence should be hanged that's important testimony and you know Mark Meadows is an absolute lying you know what because he won't admit to anything in his zeal to continue to cover up Donald Trump's crimes so he's got a world of hurt coming but I think you know here's what I'm so heartened by and I don't know if I've talked to you all about this the J6 investigative team headed up by chief counsel chief investigative counsel Tim Heeffy Tim and I started at the DC US Attorney's Office together we handle the same Rico cases together he's one of the best Rico prosecutors the Department of Justice has ever had and we have other former there are tons of former federal prosecutors on the J6 investigative team that have been running this since jumped that's why what we see coming out of the J6 press releases it all looks like a Rico investigation being conducted to me that's because it's being conducted by one of our best Rico prosecutors ever and that's why I think Jamie Raskin is absolutely right when he says they are about to blow the roof off the house yeah and that's one of the things that I've noticed like you have Jamie Raskin very much not afraid to hype these hearings which I think speaks volumes and then Liz Cheney this weekend said that it's an extremely broad extremely well organized chilling conspiracy I'm paraphrasing here so what do you make of all those kind of statements like that like they're just not afraid to just you know hype up the hype up the event this is a serious sober group of lawmakers the members of the J6 committee and I think Cheney and Kinzing her will go down as you know heroic figures as will representative Thompson and Raskin and the other members I don't want to see you know sort of just just give the Republicans the credit but I think it's really important that Cheney and Kinzing are on this bipartisan committee you know and she is fierce and fearless and I saw her appearance where she said this was an extremely well coordinated coup by Donald Trump and his allies so yeah I don't think any of this is hyperbole I think if anything we're going to be even more surprised when we see the evidence with our own eyes that's going to make all the difference and here is what I envision happening when we see witnesses testify in documents and evidence produced and phone records analyzed and video and maybe even undercover recordings don't ever rule that out um that proves beyond the reasonable doubt that Donald Trump and company committed these crimes against the United States I believe the public outcry will be deafening and I think it will impact the Department of Justice who will have nowhere to go not that they're looking to avoid prosecuting Trump and Company I don't believe they're avoiding it I think they're trying to build a bulletproof case that in a way that's taking too long they're gonna have to have to start dropping indictments on the heads of these people because if they don't the DOJ will lose all of its legitimacy what do you think needs to happen in order for these hearings to be considered a success if we were to have you back on this show you know a couple months from now and we go where are those hearings successful how do we define success in that regard oh it's just telling a complete vivid compelling story about what the evidence is of Trump and his co-conspirators um efforts to kill our democracy to overturn a free and fair presidential election I think that's what we hope for and and I hope it inspires DOJ I don't think DOJ needs to wait for criminal referrals from the j-6 committee I think they're already dug in doing their grand jury investigation and you know I I have a feeling we're going to begin to see some indictments dropping on you know not Trump he'll be the last to be indicted but on some of the higher ups in the executive branch some of the command structure of the insurrection I think we're going to see those indictments beginning to come pretty promptly after the hearings and maybe even while the hearings are ongoing because they're going to stand some six weeks I guess and do you think the January 6 committee is going to go ahead and refer an indictment for Trump ultimately or will they let the justice department just handle that on their own they can't not refer him for prosecution if the evidence is as dramatic and direct and devastating as we expect it to be you can't forgo making a criminal referral because that's part of what they're doing right now the the lion's share is legislative yes we want laws to try to prevent this from ever recurring but they have a responsibility to refer for prosecution anybody that they have evidence committed a crime I don't get half the country to care about these hearings coming up I feel like the nation right now is so divided right you got a lot of Fox News watchers out there for example in Fox News is going to counter program these hearings I mean how do we really break through the clutter is it is it making sure that we show up on all social platforms like how do we speak to that Fox News voter and let them know to listen to this month's hearings so let me start with it really doesn't matter if we break through or not you know there are some things that you have to do because they're the right thing to do consequences be damned you know winning over converts be damned you know when people say well we shouldn't prosecute Trump because we can't impanel a fair and impartial jury first of all I disagree but second of all it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the process is more important than the outcome and if we don't engage in a process designed to shed light on what was done to our democracy and try to prevent it from happening again because we fear we won't be completely successful at the end of the day then we've already failed right so winning converts would be wonderful and and I think you know one of the best things that we can all do is have a one-on-one conversation with folk who are maybe in the Donald Trump camp you know now if you're not willing to operate from the same set of facts then it's really hard to break through with the consequences of of those facts with reason and logic but it doesn't mean we shouldn't try I mean I don't use the words maga and maggot and all that you know it's not us and them in America it's really it's we're just us we're just different kinds of us who believe in different things but I do believe there are a lot of folk who believe in things because they're fed disinformation and not to be unkind but a lot of them don't have the critical thinking abilities to parse through it and here's the thing I mean I'm not saying I'll ever take up for an insurrectionist but for gosh sakes if you don't have the capacity to critically think about what the president of the United States is telling you and he tells you you're your vote was stolen your president's being taken from you if you don't fight like hell you won't have a country anymore now go down to the Capitol and stop the steal stop the certification insurrectionists are showing up in court every day saying what the I was doing what the president told me I actually have sympathy for the people who got duped particularly the ones who maybe don't have it in them to to you know assimilate information from lots of sources and make their own decision frankly we should be allowed to listen to the president of the United States and make our life decisions accordingly we should be allowed but when you elect a con man it's kind of like all bets are off and I want to speak to another thing that you sort of hinted at in that response is that there's a lot of doom and gloom democrats out there that nothing seems to be good enough for them we could have 20 hearings in this committee we could have 30 every day of the month we landed with six in your opinion is six enough I don't know because I don't know what those thousand plus witnesses said I think six is a lot and I think the balancing act for the j six committee is how long can you hold people's attention before they're going to tune out I mean six sounds like as good a number is five or seven to me so you know I think they know what they're doing particularly because they're unified all members of the j six committee are unified in their goal of saving our democracy so the nice thing is it's not going to be the typical five minutes of a democratic of a democrat and five minutes of a republican you know with their separate agendas yelling and screaming and trying to you know create sound bites that they can use in their reelection campaign so I think because it's going to be a unified presentation and because the investigation was conducted by an expert team of federal prosecutors and their experts in RICO prosecutions public corruption prosecutions and violent prime prosecutions the team they've assembled I think this is as good as it gets you answered my last question on that before I kick the back over to Ben and which is going to be are you hopeful do you see hope do you see us coming out I have been spitting out the O word recently optimistic I am optimistic let me ask you this I'm also optimistic in what's going on in Fulton County Georgia right now with the special grand jury there um investigating Trump's phone call with Brad Raffensberger find me the extra one vote over 11,400 whatever votes um Lindsey Graham's conduct there it also kind of pushing election officials um you think we should be paying attention to what's going on with Fonnie down there the district attorney in Fulton County Fonnie Willis absolutely you know I don't know her personally everything I've read about her and the way she's conducted this investigation again which has been ongoing for a long time there's some procedural peculiarities in the Georgia grand jury laws and procedures that seem to be part of the reason it's taking so long but everything I've seen about DA Willis it she doesn't play she just doesn't play and look she grand jury she presented witnesses to the grand jury all of the witnesses that were willing to come without being subpoenaed without being compelled and I think she she presented 30 or more but then there were another 50 who were you know like the Mark Meadows and the Jim Jordan's of the world hey they're not they're not doing anything voluntarily to help protect our democracy or the security of our election systems or to snitch on Donald Trump so that's why she had to impanel the special grand jury because under the rules of the Georgia grand jury only special grand juries have the power to issue subpoenas and compel reluctant witnesses to appear and then that information gets batched up and it goes back to the regular grand jury which has the power to indict it's a very cumbersome and somewhat unusual process she itch at right after the elections abiding by the norm in tradition not doing anything before the election she issued 50 subpoenas Brad Raffensberger has already been in there and they wore him out for hours testifying and now I think five of his aides are appearing this week she is moving forward it looks like you know justice is kind of slow and steady as she goes down in Georgia and I am also optimistic that we're going to see an indictment of Donald Trump perhaps even Lindsey Graham and others and if you read a brilliant piece by the Brookings Institution doing a deep dive into the Georgia state election crimes that even the publicly available evidence suggests Donald Trump committed there there I think it I don't know if it's a full dozen or a baker's dozen misdemeanors and felonies alike a dozen crimes that are supported by the evidence of record that has been publicly reported alone so if I had to bet a dollar one dollar is my betting limit I'm not a high roller I would bet a dollar that Georgia will indict Donald Trump not a high roller either I just like to I don't like to gamble I like to get my facts and I like to like to argue with the facts what do you say though as we conclude this interview Glenn what what do you what's your response to people who watch you and say well that's great that you're optimistic Glenn Kershner but I've heard this before we've heard we heard not from you but we've heard a reason to be optimistic you know in the Mueller report we've heard you know justice is coming why is it different right now what's your response so they've heard from me in fact that the Mueller report was going to be blockbuster and for anybody who cares to read the Mueller report it actually was blockbuster but it suffered from three problems real quickly Bob Mueller was still doing business by 1950s norms and traditions now Bob was my mentor he was my chief of homicide he taught me how to be a federal homicide prosecutor and I have great admiration and and even affection for him but I think I have a clear-eyed perspective of how that played out in in the estimation of some what went wrong you know he put together a blockbuster volume to documenting 10 as many as 10 felony obstruction of justice crimes by Donald Trump I believe Bob believed that if that was delivered to Congress it would be like when they delivered the Nixon tapes to Congress and the Republicans marched on the White House and said Nixon you're done I think that was Bob's frame of reference how could any self-respecting politician not take that position and he was wrong about that but it suffered from the added problem of Bill Barr lying about it to the American people as was found by Judge Reggie Walton here in DC federal district court so the truth never had a chance to get out Bob Mueller offer off also was not able to communicate because of some physical challenges the way he used to be able to communicate that was another problem but but I think nobody could have nobody could have seen just how low the Republicans would sink in their zeal to retain power and retaining power meant hanging on to the coattails of Donald Trump so I think it was a series of you know really unfortunate incidents that conspired against the Mueller report having the impact it should have had so what was your question Ben what's different now so what's different now I think what's different now is we do not have a bill bar to misdirect the American people or to cover up the crimes of Donald Trump we have an attorney general and a deputy attorney general in Lisa Monaco who I worked with at the DC US Attorney's office that have our nation's best interests at heart even if they are a little bit too circumspect and moving too slowly in my estimation we have a J so we have a congressional committee that's lockstep which is unusual when we're launching into public hearings it's usually the cats and dogs fighting back and forth we have an investigative congressional staff unlike any that I think has ever been put together before so I think all of just just as there were several things conspiring to basically deprive the Mueller report of the impact it should have had we have a lot of forces conspiring to make sure that this time it's done right it's done effectively it's done thoroughly and we save our democracy so I'm optimistic as we begin to move into these public hearings well that is great to hear I'm sure our audience really
