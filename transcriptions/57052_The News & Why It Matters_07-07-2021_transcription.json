    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind Today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, President Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter and Google over alleged censorship. We'll get into that. And Governor Cuomo issues an executive order declaring a disaster emergency on the issue of gun violence. We've got a lot to come up and it starts all right now. Welcome to the News and White Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by Jason Buttrill, Chief Researcher of the Glenn Beck program and of course, the number one person to give me hell at all points in time. So really glad that Jason is back. That's the only reason I come into the studio anymore. I could do my work from home, but why? We did wear a polo though, so I can't give it too much. Also joined by Eric July, BlazeTV contributor. So let's talk about President Trump. So President Trump kind of teased that he had a big announcement coming on social media on the subject of social media. And of course, he announced it today that he will lead a lawsuit, a class action lawsuit over alleged censorship. This is against Twitter, Facebook and Google and the CEOs of these companies. And he says he's been censored. I'm not sure that you can argue whether or not he's been censored. I think it is very clear, but let me let President Trump tell you in his own words. Here he is from today. Watch. I just want to say that I stand before you this morning to announce a very important and very beautiful, I think, development for our freedom and our freedom of speech. And that goes to all Americans. Today, in conjunction with the America First Policy Institute, I'm filing as the lead class representative a major class action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Puche and Jack Gorsy. Three real nice guys. Real nice guys. Three real nice guys. He had to do it. Of course, had to slide that in there. Trump said, of course, you know, the social media companies are officially private entities, but in recent years they have ceased to be private with the enactment and their historical use of section 230, which obviously we've talked about this on the show many times, protects them from liability. And you know, remember, he is, of course, in Florida where Governor DeSantis just recently made it so that people could sue all of these companies. Now we see President Trump doing this. And again, it's class action, but he is the lead plaintiff. I can't wait to hear your thoughts, gentlemen. This is not easy because the circles I run around with are probably very similar to circles you run around with. And so like the far, the hardcore libertarians would say this is like any kind of government action that would lead to regulating big tech is absolutely not the way to go. So their perspective is government needs to get all the heck the way to out and then let them fend for themselves. I think that's pretty much where I'm at. On the other hand, the language he's using sounds very familiar to me. So he's talking about, you know, he kept saying, you know, they're, you know, private companies, but you know, they're also acting, you know, like they're public because the government is, you know, involved with them. When he says that, Clarence Thomas just did a ruling that this was also, I think it was about Twitter about, you know, Trump blocking some Twitter followers and they did a, I think it went all the way to the Supreme Court. But Clarence Thomas kind of laid out the framework to where if you want to regulate them, it was just, it was like a footnote in the opinion, you know, in the opinion, opinion. But it was, you know, that these big tech companies could be treated as common carriers. So common carriers like railroads, telephones, stuff like that, electric companies, stuff like that, which is, you know, they're supposed to give free access to everyone regardless. Now it seemed like he put that in there. So someone like high, someone on high profile like President Trump could take that, take their case and let it go all the way to the Supreme Court. Because with the way he worded that, he's basically inviting it in saying, hey, we'll take it, we'll take it, we'll discuss it. And so this has a very strong possibility to make it up and you could actually see some government regulation off of this. Now where I'm on the fence at is that really, if we're going based off a principle alone on conservative principles, is that really what we should be asking for? Specifically at this point in time, right, under this administration. Right. Because, you know, if we can take advantage of it, so can they. Right, right, right. Exactly. Well, that's an interesting point. Thanks for dampening everything. I was getting super pumped up. Well, hold on. I do want to add to that too. The case that Thomas was weighing in on was also completely different because when you're talking about someone blocking users, like, all you have to do is log out and you can still read that person's tweets, right? That's so much different than not allowing him on any of their platforms at all. Right. No, it's a good point. And I will say, I want to make the clarification that I do think something needs to be done with these companies. Right, right, right. It's just slippery. Right, right. They're abusing what they have. Well, I mean, they are a private company. If they want to be abusive, they can do it. It's just like Jim Crow laws, right? So Jim Crow laws, if these come back in the day when those businesses wanted to be idiots and they wanted to segregate their businesses, go ahead. By all means, do that and miss out on the thousands and millions of dollars that you could have gotten otherwise. The free market should have taken care of that. But the reason they didn't is because government was involved in codifying what they were doing. That's basically what we have now. That's basically what we have right now because government is protecting these companies to segregate off conservative users or basically anybody they want. They don't want it. It's basically the same thing. Like that's a that's a better like the left. I used to talk about Jim Crow laws. Let me talk about this is actually a better comparison to that actually, really. Yeah, Eric. See, look, I believe that two things can be true. I'm obviously I say this as a guy that's currently suspended on Twitter that I'm not fond of obviously how a lot of them handle let's say their business like this in the way that they do. There's an obvious and clear slant when it comes to who they allow on it and who they will not allow on the in terms of being egregious on their platform. That's not a secret. We know that it is no matter how much know that that's what's happening. No matter how much they like to decline that or rather deflect from it. Another thing can also be true in that I don't necessarily like the point that he is trying to raise and attempting to basically say because they benefit from a particular law, this was a shot of a wise man of the Austrian Institute was saying that they can now just wave a magic wand and I say that basically your deemed is public. If that's the route that we want to go, there's a whole host of other things that in which people benefit from even with direct government subsidies, not loosely calling it a government subsidy, direct government subsidies that if that's the slope that we want to be on, there's a whole heap of other things and industries that they can declare as public that we don't want. Now, this is my frustration with the with the trumps of the world because they lose sight of that because I get it. Is it censorship? Yeah. Should it be legal or illegal? That's a completely different conversation. But if you want to make the argument that they are benefiting from because this is what I will agree with, he said that there are like people that are government actors that are utilizing the Googles of the world in order to basically perpetuate whatever it is that they want to want to do and obviously a benefit from a governmental standpoint. We also know right now, I believe Twitter is going through a spot with India right now in this regards, I believe it's Twitter's one of the big big tech companies where they're on the verge of basically getting banned from from use out there. But if you want to make the case, and this is the case that I have been making, a lot of these guys benefit from world government. Googles of the world have been doing it forever. Amazon's of the world have been doing it for a very, very, very long time when you consider and they've been hosting on their web services and they weren't even profitable until they started taking government contracts. Why can't we rent the rent, I guess these companies of that? Not all the time does it appear in a direct government subsidy. Sometimes though it's a contract and I would like to, let's say you talk about letting them fiend for themselves, getting the government all the way out of the way, that's what we would have to do. But that's not what we have right now. Government, be it through campaigning, be it through, again, people that actually work with the government, add counsel, whatever, they're literally paying these big companies to advertise on them. That's, I don't know why, if we talk about what's illegal and illegal, illegal, illegal, why is that right? You know what I mean? That they're basically taking money that is obviously for a political gain and then they're giving it to these private institutions. So while I will agree that there's an issue here, I don't agree with the messaging or rather the rhetoric that he's utilizing to say that there is something that is there, that is there's some sort of wrongdoing. I think he's losing sight of what the, where the actual wrongdoing is. But that's a slippery slogan. We want to sit up here and it's not a fallacy either. It's a real thing. And we are going to sit up here and say with a wave of a magic wand that just because you benefit from a government law, obviously he's representing Section 230, if you benefit from a government law, you're no longer, you're no longer public. Well, there's virtually every single industry, there's people in every single industry that are doing that. Are we a de-deam, them public as well? Yeah. Well, and I mean, it is, it is curious too, because, and you know, you guys know, I'm a Trump person, right? It is frustrating because Trump was president and we had, you know, we had control of everything and nothing was done. So it just seems to be that there was always a lot of talk, whether it be from the White House or from Congress, whoever, there was just a lot of tough talk about what we might do if the social media companies make us do it and then nothing ever really came to fruition. And your point goes right to the reason why I hate government pretty much completely at all because that's all they do is, you know, they make all these promises, they get into power and you realize and that's actually, it's kind of like our government's not perfect, but it's the closest to it. I think that a lot of people can get to because- You wrote a sternly worded letter and sent it to the manager. Right. And that's it. It was built because the founders hated it. Yeah. So they built the system because it's almost like they were like kind of joking around with each other. Let's have this group, this group and this group, let's have three different branches, but let's constantly put them at each other's necks so they never get anything done. They just fight each other the entire time. That's really all it is. So every time you get someone, you get another administration in, all these promises are typically, they don't deliver on them. You might get an executive order here. You get something lucky or unlucky like Obamacare, which is an aberration. I like that shouldn't even have happened. I don't, Chief Justice Roberts actually thank him for that. Yeah, that's why I think that the solution in my mind is yes, I believe that this is a monster social media that's out of control. Yeah. But I think what to do is, you know, and the CEOs kind of got together, especially with Dorsey was saying, hey, if you got rid of 230, if the government completely got out, there would be no internet. I'm sorry, you're a gazillionaire? Figure it the heck out. Yeah. Figure it the heck out. You can do it. Certainly someone could. Yes, you're going to get sued and maybe this Trump suit starts that off. You know, maybe all the litigation comes out because, you know, once this happens, if this does actually go to court, your, the judge will be able to, will grant access to however many other cases that this has also happened. You ever seen that before? Like you're like, you get a letter in the mail saying, hey, you know, you've got, you know, these earplugs are bad. You want to join our lawsuit. Things like that will go out. So we'll start getting more and more and more of these cases that will come out. So the more that piles up, the more government pressure say, hey, we need to get the heck out of here and let them deal with it. And I think, and that's what I think the positive act can come from someone as, as prominent as Trump, even trying to enter some sort of conflict with them is that maybe people will see at minimum what the actual problem is. Now, whether he brings it to the table in their lawsuit or even if he can do that, you know what I mean? That's a completely different conversation. But at least people are looking at, okay, how does Facebook get their money? How does Google get their money? Why are they answering to of all people the WHO? Follow the money and then you'd be surprised how much we would rent out because in some cases, in a lot of cases, the taxpayer dollars are being utilized to subsidize these people. It's not through direct subsidies and that's how they get you. It's like, okay, well, it's not technically a direct subsidy. We're just contracting them to do whatever it is that we want them to do. No, it's not a direct subsidy, but you're basically using taxpayer dollars to subsidize or rather fund these institutions. You'd be surprised how much big tech gets from not just the American government, but from governments completely around the world, which is what got them necessarily in hot water. And you can argue that they shot themselves in a foot when they did this. So at minimum, I will say that the conflict that's happening right now between Donald Trump and them, there has to be some good that comes from it and it might not come from the lawsuit itself. Yeah. So can I just get confirmation, Eric, you are not going to be joining this class action? No, even though I say this as a person. Your band's been from. No, that's what I'm saying. I am not getting in on this. Okay. All right. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Omega XL. So if you are someone who you just live in constant pain, maybe it's shoulder pain, maybe it's neck pain, maybe you've just reached the age like I have where you just wake up in the morning and you're like, ow, I pulled something from sleeping. What you may not know is that the underlying cause of all of this pain that you have is likely inflammation and unless you defeat the inflammation, you're going to keep having the pain and it can also cause permanent damage. Now Omega XL is backed by 35 years of clinical research and it actually attacks the inflammation that is causing your pain. So it's not going to be like one of those pain relievers that you rub on, you know, the creams that you rub on and it feels awesome for 10 minutes and then you're in pain again. All right. Omega XL neutralizes that inflammation that causes the painful stiff joints and muscles. And by the way, it is natural, which I know some of you out there may be snubbing your nose at and saying, if it's natural, it must not work, but it is from the, it's a powerful essential fatty acid combination from the waters of New Zealand and our very own Pat Gray who is not what you would call a natural path. He was in constant pain in his shoulder. He used it the first week he started feeling vastly better by the second week. He was way better, a hundred percent better. So you know what? Sometimes you got to go the natural route and it works. Let's get you started. Order Omega XL now. Get a second bottle for free at omega XL dot com slash news. That is omega XL dot com slash news. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today announced the issuance of, I'm sorry, yesterday announced the issuance of an executive order declaring a disaster emergency on the matter of gun violence. Here are a couple of his tweets from yesterday. He said, today I'm issuing an executive order declaring a disaster emergency on gun violence. Gun violence is a public health crisis and we must treat it like one. This declaration will allow us to give this crisis the full attention and resources it deserves. Gun violence means getting illegal guns off the streets. 74% of guns used in crimes in New York state were purchased out of state. The New York police will form a new gun trafficking. What is that? Inter, how do you say that? Interdiction? Unit to stop the flood of illegal guns coming into New York from states with weak gun laws. It's interesting because I feel like if the guns are already illegal, I don't know how you're going to stop that. Maybe make new laws. That works every time. Then there will be double illegal. Then you really don't want to mess with something when it's double illegal. That definitely will solve the problem. So now they've got an executive order. It is now an emergency on gun violence. Of course, the answer is more laws, more executive orders. We saw this coming and I think a lot of people in this network agreed that the situation at the border was a state of emergency. I knew you were going to bring this out. Yes, yes. We all agreed it's an emergency. It's a state of emergency. Should we declare it that as such? I was not agreeing with that. Under Trump, under President Trump, when that came out. Even though I agreed with all of his actions he was doing down there, I did not want to open that Pandora's box because you knew the left was doing this. They could not wait because they knew the next time they got power, everything was going to be declared a state of emergency. Guns are being declared a state of emergency. We're almost leading the way with that. What does that allow him to do? A lot of things. I was reading through some of this earlier, but seizing guns that he claimed illegal? I mean, I don't even know because they have the wrong kind of magazine in them or something like that. Who the heck knows? It's probably vague on purpose, but they're just going to start going and seizing guns. He's talking about 74% or whatever it was came across state lines. Again vague. What does that mean? Was it guns that go against their assault weapons ban or whatever else? If you live in New York City, any gun is illegal, pretty much. You talked about getting rid of dangerous people from having guns. Well basically in New York, that means everyone that they deem is dangerous. Political ideology. Does that mean? What does that mean? Well, you are an extremist. You believe in conservative values. You know how many extremists list I'm probably on? It's probably scary. Eric even more. He probably puts me to say, yeah, this stuff is getting very, very scary and it goes beyond that. It goes to, right now, what else is going to be called a state of emergency? Anything that they get frustrated at in Stonewald Inn in Congress, they're going to declare it as a state of emergency. Our infrastructure, is that a state of emergency? Climate change. Does it become a state of emergency? It's coming. I don't disagree with you, but I would just ask, do you not think that the left would have done that anyway? Because I don't, I mean, they don't play fair, right? So what would be, what would stop them from doing it anyway? So it's, so they've definitely changed strategy and tactics over the last couple of years. They were very content with rhinos and non-conservatives within the Republican party, slowly pulling the rest of the country towards the left. It was a very gradual thing. They didn't want to do it the way they're doing it now. They didn't want to. I really think things started changing under Obama. He made some massive, massive changes to really polarize and divide the country. We've gone on that trajectory ever since to where now they're never going to agree. McConnell just said the other day on infrastructure. He was like the days of bipartisanship are over. They are. There are two different parts of the country right now. You're either the far left or what they consider the far right. The people in the center are very hard to find anymore. Everyone is pretty much going. At this point, I think people are just going to either side because they picked a side and they just don't want to lose. They might know that the people in the center that don't even really exist anymore, they're like, well screw it. I'm just going over with these guys. There's a lot of people that now are probably very, very pro-Trump people, just because they got sick of seeing them get beat up on for four straight years. I mean, I was not a huge Trump guy, but then at the end I was like, well screw it. I'll go to war with the guy because I hate a bully and they're being a bully against him. Yeah, Eric. Yeah, I think more of the COVID stuff is the biggest part of this, which was what I feared. Certainly out of this where you had executive acts is not just done by basically by way of the federal government, but by way of the state and local government. And he even references that. He says, this is Cuomo, he says gun violence is a major civil rights issue today. Yes, education, employment, discrimination, which you've heard this, you've been utilized by the rhetoric of basically every politician everywhere that now all of a sudden this is a public health crisis. He also says gun violence is hitting black and brown communities hardest and it's compounding the damage from COVID. And he also said, basically we beat COVID, we can beat this. So that's what they're going to try to do is conflate those two different deals where, okay, you gave us this power and you allowed us to do all of these things because of COVID, but now here's this thing, gun violence, whatever that is, it's not just a violence issue or anything like that. And this is unfortunately why these issues will never get resolved because they don't want to address it head on. When it comes to something definitely in these communities that are having these issues of gun, right, gun, it's not additional gun rights, though, that is, isn't a problem. But a violence, this is a cultural issue that is not going to be resolved by government. The only thing the government does is make it harder for people that have no problem following the law to get a weapon. That's the only thing that you're doing now. The people that want to get it illegally are going to do exactly that. Look, no further than what you do it. But what if you make a double, double legal? Double legal, I guess it didn't work the first time. So I guess you multiply by zero, both by two by zero, I guess you don't get the same thing. But this is a cultural issue and it sucks because everybody skirts around talking about it because we act like it's taboo. You know what I mean? Because what happens is you have to address that so many aspects of this culture, definitely in these black and brown communities in which why the violence is the way that it is. They'll never admit that. They'll never concede that because that not only will force them to look in the mirror, but these race hustlers who have helped me get in office, they would have to realize how ineffective that they have been in trying to combat this if that's something they even care about. So what can they do? They'll just go blame the guns, which makes no sense. Like you just blame the guns. Like we have other areas that again, more obviously have more people that are owning these weapons because well, it's not as much government interaction with them and they don't have the level of violence that you guys have there. I mean, definitely say this is someone that grew up not just in Dallas, but being in the country as well, it wasn't nothing for everybody to own a gun when nobody's shooting each other up. It's almost as if it's a cultural issue. But to your point, when you talk about the, okay, we now declare this as some crisis and now we have the power, our point took more towards COVID. If anything else, that should be the name calling racism. Racism is a public health crisis and then they get to build policies based upon that. That if anything should scare everyone. The issue obviously is not going to get solved because they're still skirting around the problem. I also love that, I mean, from Cuomo, it's rich to hear him say, if you can beat COVID, you know, we beat COVID. I'm like, did you kill a bunch of old people in nursing homes? I don't think you're the one. Yeah, I don't think you're the one to be saying you beat COVID, Andrew. All right, we've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Startmail.

The second largest defense contractor in America, Raytheon, is imposing an anti-racism program using critical race theory, arguing that white or straight or Christian men should identify their privilege, participate in reparations, and of course, obviously decolonize their bookshelves. This is a program called Stronger Together. And by the way, Chris Rufo, who has been amazing on critical race theory, he is the one who uncovered all of this. He obtained these documents and videos from a whistleblower. So let's go through some of these pages of the guide. So here is the one of the front pages commitment to diversity and inclusion takes all of us. CEO Action was founded on a shared belief that diversity, equity, and inclusion is a societal issue, not a competitive one. And that collaboration and bold action from the business community, especially CEOs, is vital to driving change at scale. Let's go through some of this. So the CEO had all of these employees, all of the employees sign this pledge. It says, I pledge to check my bias, speak up for others, and show up for all. I will initiate meaningful, complex, and sometimes difficult conversations with my friends and colleagues. I will ask myself, do my actions and words reflect the value of inclusion? I will move outside my comfort zone. I mean, it is all incredible, incredible critical race theory BS. Here's some more. It is a chart what not to say to your black colleagues right now, and instead what to say. So there's one that says, I'm scared to say the wrong thing to you. Well, don't say that. Don't say that to your black colleague. Don't say, I hope slash pray things change soon. And also don't say, I can't wait for things to calm down and get back to normal because that actually says that your comfort is more important than the message of anti-racism. So check your privilege. And then this is my actual favorite. This here is from the guide that says, for white people to find and join a local white space to learn more and talk about conscious and unconscious biases us white folks have. If there's not one in your area, start one. I feel like in the past, historically they did that. It didn't go so well. I think they had meetings. I think they wore hoods with the little pointy hats. I don't think that that ends well. I thought that that was like why we had the whole like, M.O.K. civil rights movement. I thought that that was where we were going with that, but apparently not we're just back to find and join your local white space. So I don't, Jason, I don't want you to white-splain to Eric. So I want Eric to please go first. Eric, were you? I didn't want to because I was scared to what to say. Right. Well, let's pull up. Let's not say and what to say. Let's pull that up. Okay, Eric, I'm having conversations about racism with my non-black family and friends, even though I'm afraid. This is to say that to you. This is unbelievable, but it actually is believable when you consider obviously it's the biggest defense contractor of the United States government. A lot of those contracts are going to be considering court here government. I mean, it's going to be- Look at what the armies. The armies, all the alphabet, all of them are doing that. Obviously they're going to tie that money to who can signal the hardest and then you'll get the contract. This is, that was anticipated. I'm definitely considering that Raytheon almost exclusively is funded by way, certainly of the state. That little pledge there, obviously I believe that a lot of people are going to sign of having not even read half of that crap in their own way. It's like the terms and conduction. Yeah, I'll accept it. I probably just saw him in my life. Right. I don't even would crap about that. But just, it's just such weird language. You know what I mean? To sit up and see that, manifest itself. It's not unexpected, scary maybe, but it isn't certainly unexpected because again, the money is tied to the state so they have to play ball. And that's what they're going to do. This is a bizarre subject, matter to even converse about the fact that they're really encouraging people to see, I get seems to have these conversations with their colleagues. I know when I was doing just regular private sector jobs, the last thing I was trying to talk about to my colleagues about any damn thing regarding racial bias or whatever bull crap that that thing say though, it was the first thing you read, they say white Christian and straight. Did they say or did they say and? It said or I believe. Let me pull this back. Let me pull this back. You say that black people, black straight people, black straight men are the white people or black people. So maybe it says arguing that white or straight or Christian. Right, yeah, so that's not just white for best. Right, right. I mean, that's a lot of people that they that they and that's ultimately what this boils down to anyway, the concept of not just critical race theory, but Marxism certainly in general. Look, this is your taxpayer dollars going to subsidize that crap. So if you want to look any further than why government bad, there you go. Can I Jason, I want to get your thoughts, but let me let me bring up Chris Rufo tweet number five because this is I just think is this is great. It says, Raytheon tells employees to quote identify everyone's race during work place conversations. Hey, I'm black. Or just I really thought this is what we find when you when you get around the water cooler, like every time I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, can I pull my car? Did you catch the game? No, because it is goopie America. It's so stupid. Again with that, it says whites must listen to the experiences of marginalized identities and should give those with such identities the floor in meetings or on calls, even if that means silencing yourself, Jason, I will let you talk now. Thank you. It's just it's such a backward way of thinking you talk about the disconnect between the two sides in America right now. Like so our stance, I know everyone at the table is when you talk to someone you don't see race. Yeah, you see them as an individual first and foremost. Right. That is true anti-racism. I'm an individual. I'm not defined by this. Right. Exactly. But content of character, right? Yeah. Like that used to be so far from that. We're so that that used to be like a left leaning talking point, right? At some point it changed and then now we have to view every single person under what sub category they are. Yeah. I remember when Biden had that speech the other day where he was a you can't define an American. Yes. And so what he was saying was you can't because I got I got what his root point was that we're all the same. Right. But that's not what they believe. Yeah. Like he was saying that I don't know why but just to score points or whatever but they don't believe that they want to like so I was reading through some of these documents from Raytheon and this is the same across the board for all companies right now if you want to get a high ESG score and that way you get the funding you get the financial investment from people. If you get a high ESG score they require a certain part you know a report from you that says how many Indians do you have? How many Asians do you have? How many black people do you have? How many white people do you have? They categorize everyone down the board. I don't know why. Like I don't know what they're doing with that information. I don't know if it's eventually like if some of the investors the people holding you know writing the checks go oh my gosh they just dipped below you know six Asians better get that back up. Like what? Like it makes it but you were exactly right. This is I don't believe Rethi on believes in the CRT crowd. Not at all. They care about making money and blowing crap up. Yeah. That's all they care about. I don't know this for a fact. And that's the funnest thing I've ever seen. I've seen the memes with the like Rethi on bombs and all that sort of stuff and it'll be like when Trump was president this I was Biden's president it's the same damn bomb but it has like all sort of like LGBT rainbows all over it. That's basically what we're getting right now. You know what the same crap but I guess you're signaling you know your weapons are being used to I don't know her brown people across the other side of the world. Can I get contracts? The contracts in Saudi Arabia I didn't have no issue whatsoever. They won't even mention their CRT stuff and how you know you know equitable they are. So the CEO is apparently Gregory Hayes who is like extremely white and makes $13.4 million a year. So white guy just fighting against himself like us. I mean I would think that if he really believed in this he would step down as CEO and give the position to a black person. Notice the folks that lecture the most about they'll never give up their power. People below them they'll play musical chairs do whatever you need to do. Give up your money. Give up your give up any of that. Would they do that? Absolutely not because everything is about a signal to them because he's not going to take a pay cut is he? How about you give half of your that was 13 million? I just get give half of it to the I don't know it's a black executive or higher. You need 13 million that's what the left would say. You don't need all that money. Give half of it. Why not? That's what he won't do though. Look man this is a crazy conversation to have but ultimately when it comes to the authoritarian left this is what they prioritize is they want to see is funny is a very collective way of collective its way of viewing the world but I am an individual first and foremost. I have no problem with people acknowledging the fact that yeah you got a lot of metal in the must get that's fine but I am an individual first and foremost and I always say all skin folk and kinfolk but that's what not what they do way that they see it it's like well you're black the further experience is the same or you're you're white you're white you're experience is the same you're woman you're experiences is the same and we need to work together to do this and that's like no dude we're individuals how about seeing me like that first and foremost. Yeah all right we have got more to come including Joe Biden botching yet another thing this time in Afghanistan when we come back. So under CRT for under so is it just if you were born? The United States apparently left Afghanistan's a bagram airfield after nearly 20 years by shutting off the electricity and slipping away in the night without notifying the bases new Afghan commander who by the way only discovered the Americans departure more than two hours after they left this is coming from the Afghan military Jason you are of course our military guy here our in-house military expert can you kind of give us the lowdown on this story because this seems crazy. Yeah a lot of people surrounding the president have said that a lot of things he's doing now off of base off of Afghanistan or regarding Afghanistan is based off of a quote gut instinct so a lot of things he's doing. Joe Biden's gut instinct or whoever's pulling the strings gut instinct. That's a good question who's really pulling the I don't know who's really in charge over there I do not know. You're right. Yeah. I think the reason they snuck out in the middle of the night was because they didn't want the media fiasco because they knew that they get a lot of people in the media coming out there and they'd be putting a big spotlight on the fact that we're abandoning in a base a base that will probably go to the Taliban. Look I'm going to be conservative with my. But they didn't even tell the Afghan military. Yeah they don't care. They don't care. They really don't. This is a hard one for me because I have a lot of emotional attachment to it. It really sucks to just hand this back over to the people that we fought and mark my words. I'm going to like I said I'm going to be conservative I'll give them at maximum 12 months. Somewhere between six and 12 months the Taliban will be back in control of that country. I'm almost convinced that's what's going to happen. They're already doing a massive assault they're taking one more territory. It's going to happen. I'm not advocating for a staying there. The war in Afghanistan is now old enough to vote over the age to vote right now. So it's absolutely insane we should not be there. We are going to have to deal with the same stuff. The Taliban is going to be back in control and they are going to do the same crap. They're going to be training terrorists. They're going to be doing all kinds of stuff. What do we do about that? It's not our responsibility to patrol that anymore. I think our boys need to get out of there. Yeah, I mean I agreed with it when Trump said that we need to do that and I agreed it when Biden just piggybacked off of what Trump was already going to do and somehow he's going to take credit for it. But he's also going to take credit for the fallout which is going to happen in his administration. Question now is what's going to happen? Are the Chinese going to fill the void which they probably will? They're already signaling they will. Russians are saying they might do something. They're all chomping at the bit right now to try and take advantage and make us look bad on the national stage. My thing to say to them is go for it. Russia, you already did it once. Do it again and fail. China, do it. You want to go ahead and do it and enter the same quagmire. No other countries ever going to rule that area. They're just not. It's never happened since the Mongols and before them it's never happened. So it's just it's hubris to think that we can go there and somehow enact a different ending. It's not going to happen. We need to get out. But the hard truth right now I guess my wrapping up of all this is we have to come to grips with what's about to happen. It's I'm not saying we're going to get attacked but they are going to be doing the same things that they did before. The question is how are we going to react to it? Are we going to enter into more never ending wars? Are we going to show more restraint? Let other people take care of this. We're going to have to deal with it somehow but I'm making a prediction. Six to twelve months this reality is going to be in our face. Look that's the reality of the situation. You put it correctly obviously my position I'm a libertarian here. I want the hell out. I've been wanting them to hell. I've been calling for them to even get the hell out. Since I was loud enough to tell them to get the hell out of there because it's a war that they simply cannot win. Obviously I'm not a big fan of war in general. But like you mentioned is it our job to be playing world police and this is the unfortunate thing about this conversation when it comes to us occupying a rather the United States government occupying in any way shape or form the middle east. It's that we look at what will happen or may happen rather and we look at that as if it's our duty. Because we're the leader of the free world our duty to try to save them sometimes from themselves albeit but save that or liberate that area. Now we don't necessarily see a lot of success in that regard but considering that region it's something that we have to face as a leader. We have to face as a reality and to think that it's a lot of you people's upcoming sons and daughters that are going to be flown. Well sons are going to be flown over there to have to deal with that and so unfortunately some of them lose their lives. I guess we have to decide is that worth the absolute trade off but I don't think that. I would believe that we would rather be trying to considering all the issues that we have in our own country. Utilizing those economics to resolve those problems as opposed to spending billions upon billions. Well we're at trillions now of dollars that we've spent trying to liberate whatever whoever's over there certainly in Afghanistan. That's a reality. So yes you're right and I'm glad that you're being up front with the yes we need to I want us to get out and I agree with you. But yeah you're right it's not going to resolve itself and there unfortunately are a lot of libertarians even that would agree with the get. Out of there but they are I think being oblivious to the idea that well that just means that everything every problem that basically exists in that area is going to go away. No it's not. No it's not and that's that's a reality that we have to absolutely acknowledge. It's not about whether it's going to be a problem out there. It's more is it our job and should we be exhausting resources to consider everything that's going on in our own country. Should we be exhausting those resources to try to deal with the issues that are happening right now and Afghanistan and it took 21 20 years over 20 years for people to come to terms with maybe no that's not what we should be doing. I will just say just to wrap it up is I think just to circle back to the closing of the air base in the middle of the night I think is very symbolic for how Biden is going to approach Afghanistan for the rest of his tenure. He's going to try to hide from these the fallback which I will I guess I could go on all day. Oh my gosh I said from quick I said I'm going to take a break. Well he's not.
