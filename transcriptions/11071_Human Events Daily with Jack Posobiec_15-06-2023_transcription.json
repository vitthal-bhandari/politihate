It's called the post so daily brief read what I read for show prep. You will not regret it. Human events.com slash Pozo totally free the post. So daily brief. We are in a fifth generational conflict. For every lie they tell we're going to get in their face and yell to truth. This is human events with your host Jack Vesobic Christ is king. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome board today's edition of human events with Jack Vesobic. Today is June 16th, 2023 anodominy. Folks, we're looking at this campaign. We're in the midst of this primary season and earlier this week when President Trump was arraigned, we had on as a live guest, the people's pundit Richard Barris. And I said, I promised him that I'd bring him back on later in the week to crunch some of these numbers. And so I wanted to bring him back on today to tell us what is the state of the horse race following this heinous indictment, unprecedented indictment of President Trump. Rich, the question here is you've been reporting this. I've been getting it from other reports that these consultants, Republican strategists are telling donors or we're telling donors that when Trump is indicted, his polls will go down. They'll shoot down. They'll race to the bottom and it'll knock him out of the race. Aren't we seeing the exact opposite now? Jack, and as always, thanks for having me on. I'm glad we had a couple of days now for me to really see how the numbers are moving, it's changing at all. And what we see is a slight bump out of the margin for Trump in most of the states and in nationally and a decline for other candidates. I said this when we talked the other day that every single day, take a candidate like Ron DeSantis, every single day these consultants, you know, feed this advice to him and to others. And every single day his unfavourables rise even further, even further, even more. Soon, he's going to end up in Mike Pence territory. This is consultants don't live with voters. They don't even do particularly good polling. I mean, this is the tragedy of it all. And a lot of these guys jumped into this race thinking that I'm going to run for a cabinet position or I'm going to run to be the replacement candidate when law fair takes out Donald Trump. And what we have seen is a circling of the wagons by Republican voters around the former president and a decline for the other candidates. There's only good news for one other non-Trump candidate in this race. That is Chris Christie increasing a little bit in New Hampshire, but he just came back from a trip there. He's got a lot of Chris Sonu knows connections. He got favorable coverage and he's almost, he's about to overtake DeSantis for second place. So there are a number of polls showing that now. That won't last forever and it doesn't matter anyway. But this is a thing too because, you know, and look, Trump has been impeached twice. He's been indicted once already in New York. They've been going after him for years. They went after Mueller, et cetera. I have the sense that the way of thinking that LKV is indicted once and none of that backstory or context that ever existed, then okay, maybe, right? That may have had a difference, but I feel like this is all priced in now. When you're looking at this, by the way, when you're assuming that law fair or some force majeure is going to take away your opponent, isn't that banking on a losing strategy? You know, it is because there's nothing worse that you can do to yourself than confirm or affirm something, a suspicion that voters have of you. And when you take the top couple of candidates behind Trump, anyone else other than I'd say Nikki Haley because like her lover, at least she's been consistent, right? Take Mike Pence, take Ron DeSantis. The voters have basically suspected or believed that these two men were simply just trying to ride off of Donald Trump's personal destruction. And you have to remember, this is a former president whom more than 80% of the party still beloved, Jack. So this isn't a hated former president among his party. So it was just, it was a stupid strategy. There's no other way to put it. And they were banking on fear. And I really think the more I talk to some of these people, I think they projected themselves and how they feel onto the American voter. And they really don't understand them. And they're very different from them. So what do I mean by that? I mean, they're afraid, Jack. They're afraid of the indictments, the law fair. They're afraid of, there's always been this, and you know you've heard this, whether you're online or you're talking to some of these people, you know, off camera behind the scenes. There's always been this feeling that if we just go with somebody else, Democrats are going to go easy on us. They'll be less drama. I mean, to you and I, that's a delusion, but it's very real to them. And I think they thought voters would believe that and then put that above their defense of this president. And that was a catastrophic mistake. I just think the future of these candidates. I think it was a losing strategy. And I think honestly that if you are sitting out there as a Republican and you're interested in higher office, potentially national office, the highest office in our land, you must be prepared to go through the pain box. You must be prepared to go through what they will put you through. And they would do it to any candidate or any person that actually stood up against the agenda. I think Tucker hit the nail on the head the other day when he's talked about this. He said Donald Trump is the one man that actually represents someone who could become president that is not in line with their preset agenda on any number, not just war, but any number of issues. So many issues. We're coming back. We got 10 seconds here. We are going to go. Richard Barris, the people's planet. I want to dive deeper and deeper into these numbers coming up. And we're back human events, Jack was so big. Before we get back to Richard Barris, I want to remind you, we are deep in the midst of pride month. And as we're looking at these companies, company after company after company going woker and woker and woker, isn't it time to support companies? I look, I say this every day, but isn't it time to support companies that actually do stand for our values? I'm going to tell you about one when it comes to wireless providers.

So stand with the people who stand with us. Now rich, when we're digging into these these bombs, these surges, when you really look at the situation on the ground for these guys, the question then becomes, and I keep hearing this from the Desanis team and from others out there, they say, well, it's, you know, how here's how we're going to be Trump. Don't worry about these polls because we're going to win more delegates is there. And I remember, you know, I'm thinking of back in my head, this is what the Ted Cruz guys used to say. And honestly, a lot of, a lot of the case, there's a lot of the same consultants, the exact same consultants walking around. I heard this strategy in 2016 and it was a complete failure. It was this idea that they would be able to march through the States and go to New Hampshire and pick up a little bit, then go to a few other States and pick up a little bit and then get Florida. And I would, I would say obviously Florida should be the most competitive state for Governor DeTantis. But do you really see something like that planning out? They need to change a lot of the rules that are on the books right now. And in truth, there are a lot of States that are still hatching out how they're going to hold their contest and what they're going to do. Nevada, for instance, is in the middle of a lawsuit. The state moved from a caucus, which they had had for a long time to a primary. Here's the thing, Jack. They tried this in Nevada because it was a caucus system last time and they thought that they could get a lot of paid activists to be able to, you know, serve as infrastructure and Trump beat them in the caucus anyway in Nevada. If you remember, it was one of his more dominant performances. So again, it's not as without significant changes now. They're going to run into issues. One we know of is the California plan where McCarthy accolades, his number two that he's grooming to come up, Jessica Patterson and others very much aligned with the DeSantis campaign. Their idea was to get all of these elected congressmen behind the Santas in California and that because of the way they allocate delegates by congressional district, they could actually be, they can actually close that delegate gap because Trump will have more success in some of those counties. Here's what, here's the problem with that, Jack. Puls just came out. We did California a couple of weeks ago. Trump is at or above in these polls 50%. It's a winner take most state. If you cross the 50% threshold, you don't get any delegates. You lose, well, no, if you cross it, you take them all and the people, you know, that are in second, third, fourth, they get nothing. All right. In some of these states like New Hampshire with the polling that we are seeing now, the other candidates are struggling even if Trump didn't get to 50. The other candidates are even struggling to hit the threshold to get delegates. So at the end of the day, you need voters and there will be a ton of these candidates that are on the ballot that will not even qualify in proportional states for delegates. South Carolina, we saw this in 2016. The president made history when he took every single congressional district. So he made South Carolina a winner take all state. This is what we, what would happen now if the races were held today, without some significant change, then the rules, they really, it's not feasible. And there would be an uproar of epic proportions, Jack. I mean, because right now, let's face it, it's not really competitive. So if they played these games and the people you were just referencing, they're the same people who are on team DeSantis that were on team Cruz, same people. What about super get delegates? Okay. So and here's, here's me playing, you know, sort of devil's advocate. Now, in other years in 2012, 2016, we saw fluctuations in the race where, you know, somebody would get into the race and then suddenly they'd have a boost or they'd have a moment at a debate or something like that. And they would suddenly become the front runner. They'd be the front runner for maybe a week, week or two until the news cycle died down and then they'd go down and actually saw this with Herman Cain, you saw this with some shell Bachman in 2012, but and then eventually it settled it down onto Romney. But is that really the same dynamic that we're seeing here in this race? Because I hear people say, Oh, well, he's just going to break out. He's going to break out your, you know, whichever candidate is going to break out. I don't, do they have any room to break out or are we in a situation where there are ceilings that are now imposed in these numbers? There are ceilings. And by the way, I would say that the dynamics of a primary, it's just not the way it used to be, you know, in 2012. And I would even argue in 2015 and 2016, you know, Donald Trump changed a lot and it will be permanently changed, or at least it will be changed until he's no longer a factor in Republican politics. But even the Democrats, they did not have that kind of gyrating back and forth. The world is different now, Jack. And you know, this idea that somebody could be a governor of Florida and have all this room to grow still, you know, because of name ID, wait until he launches, wait until he goes to Iowa, wait until he goes to New Hampshire. I mean, how many of these promises have we lived past now and the former president just keeps going up and up? Here's the cold, hard truth. No candidate, not in incumbent and incumbent. No candidate has had a dominant polling lead like Donald Trump has well above 50%, even this early because I keep hearing that too. Oh, it's so early. No candidate has ever been at the support he is at now and went on to lose. And by the way, I mean, there's an old book when I was coming up, People used to love the party, the party wins. And it was about endorsements and the impact of endorsements in primaries. Donald Trump crossed the threshold for historical nomination needing to get this many endorsements for the nomination. He crossed it like a month and a half ago, two months ago. And that's number 60, federal and gubernatorial endorsements. So the order is so tall, Jack, historically speaking, the lane is so small because he's closed it with non-college. He's closed it even now, he's starting to with even college voters. So they need, they're not going to rest back those working class voters. And by the way, he dominates with non-white voters. So the Republican primary is going to be more non-white than ever before. And he dominates. They never gave a look to the other candidates. Where does that leave them? You know, with the voters to make a lane large enough to cross 50%, even if they got them one out of one. The truth is, it's not there, Jack. Can I just say what everybody knows? This is becoming a half a billion dollar grip so the donors can make the consultant class 30 to 40 million dollars richer. This is, if this was 2012, if this was 2016, and we were talking about Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush, everybody in the media would be saying, wrap this up, it's impossible. This is a grift. The conservative insurgency is just trying to grift their voters. That would be the narrative right now. Yes. Rick Santorum won Iowa, Newt Gingrich won South Carolina, and Fox News and CNN were still telling voters it's over. Mitt Romney's the nominee, wrap it up. I mean, think about that for a second. Marinate on that. All right, remember. This is way different, Jack. He is way more dominant than not only them, but he himself ever was in 15 or 16. This is a ridiculous task. And I don't know how you can go with a straight face and ask people to give you money unless you're just trying to stick it in your pocket. That's the honest. And the sad thing, and I know Charlie has talked about this, is that that's all money that could be going into micro-targeting operations. It could be going into early votes. It could be going into ballot chase, ballot harvesting, and we could do that. We could be spending all that money on actually winning, putting points on the board, putting it into these operations like Scott Pressler, which by the way, turning point is putting at least $5 million dollars in the state of Wisconsin. Rich, let me ask you, as we got about two minutes left, would there be devil's advocate? Would there be potentially a way, and anyway, you've seen in talking to these voters, for one of them to maybe change tactics and actually do something that would be effective into running against President Trump? Two months ago, there was an opening. There really was. I wouldn't even say going back to November, going back to December and January, there was an opening and I saw it clear as day. And then they did whatever the other politician does. And listen to every other consultant that every other failed politician has listened to. And unfortunately for them, they've, again, really affirmed to the voter what they were suspecting about them. And there were, you know, I mean, a beat on him, but he is the second closest of the low tier candidates. He's the higher polling candidate. But Ron DeSantis, his negatives are starting to shoot up like crazy now, Jack. That's because two months ago when people started having questions about him on Ukraine, who fundraisers, who bankrolls this guy, right? All of these questions, every move he made, all he was the wrong move. And it was the move that the voters who already had their eyebrow raised looking at him, a little crooked, said, aha, I knew I knew you're that guy, you're that guy. And it's hard to change the image of someone who is establishment or, you know, I don't want to use some of these more brash words. But the fact is if they think that you are the candidate, the establishment has waiting in the wings for when they take out their beloved president, you're going to have a stamp on you that the voters are going to see from a mile away, Jack. And he's not particularly, you know, Chris Christie is a better retail guy, but he's just open about his disdain for the president. So that's not going to work. So as I look around this field, I struggle to see how they're going to break that connection. Strong words from the people's pundit rich. Where can people go to follow you to get all of your analysis and to join your community? Peoplespondent.locals.com. That's the central hub. Everywhere we're on social media, but that's the place to go, Jack. Peoplespondent.locals.com. Go check out the family. I got careful with that locals, man. I go in there and I'm like, I get sucked in because there's discussions, there's boards, there's people going back and forth. It's a whole little, little universe. And then I turn around and I'm like, I got to go. I got to get the kids. We got to go take care of something rich. God bless you. Thank you so much for your work. We're going to have to have you back on more and more as this primary continues actually explaining what's going on the numbers. Stay tuned. We'll be back on the next. All right, we are back. Human events. Very excited to have on again, my friend. Also the COO of turning point action. Turning point action is holding an incredible event. West Palm Beach, 15, 16, July. Tyler, who's going to be there? Just hit me with the list. Oh, we just announced today, Megan Kelly. We're joining. We have the great Tucker. Tucker Carlson. First, first event since. Is that right? Big event, yeah. I think the first big event that he's going to be speaking at. I can't think of anything else. Other than Twitter, the energy will be huge. Yeah, so Tucker Carlson. We got Megan Kelly. President Trump. President Trump. Senator JD Vance. There you go. So, and then we have Mary out of other people, you, yourself. Steve Bannon, myself, Charlie, Charlie, Johnson, Josh Hawley, right? Josh Hawley. He's going to be speaking a number of congressmen and including congresswoman. What's the difference between this convention? This conference and a typical turning point event. So this is going to be so much more focused on action. So we're calling it Aqcon. So action conference. It's the turning point action conference. We will be doing breakouts that are going to be giving our activists the tools that they need to be successful in 24 hours. Oh, and obviously, we say it all the time, but I forgot to say that obviously the centerpiece of all of this is Scott Pressler. Scott Pressler will be there. He'll be speaking. So we'll have Scott Pressler, Harmee Delan, Mike Lindell. Yes. Yes, I hope so. I'm going to be talking about everything from how we can fight for election integrity and applauding those that are doing the right thing in all the different counties, including getting rid of unnecessary machines all the way down to Scott who's helping and working with us. Yeah. So the way I'm hearing you, it's too pronged. Right. The way I view it is too pronged because if you're in a state or a county or some area where you have control over the levers of power, then right, we should be fighting for election integrity every step of the way. I want it to be one man, one vote, one day, IDs, the whole nine yards. Mail-in ballots should be, I mean, if you're like an invalid or an actual shut-in, that kind of thing, that's it or a military, obviously. Yeah. Which I have to say, I voted when I was deployed. I voted by military absentee number of times. You have to. And the idea that, however, you have to do that in conjunction with the Scott Pressler operation in areas that we don't yet control. Those are essentially the swing states. Yeah. And this is the thing that we keep repeating to everyone is that you need a great defense, which is election integrity. Yes. Defense is when championships. So you have to have a great defense, but sometimes you just aren't given a great defense. Sometimes you don't have a great defense. In which case, you still have to put points on the board. And in those states where we don't have a great defense, which are many blue states or blue controlled counties, you've got to have an even better offense, that means. Walk us through what are your target states? Yeah. I mean, so the key target states, and we know we've broken down the map many times, but for those, just as a refresher, you have basically four or five states that can determine the election at this point. You have deep red states, you have deep blue states, and then you have what they call purple states or swing states that right now are up in the air by polling and from what we've seen in the last few elections. Those states are Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and then hanging out there are Nevada and Michigan. Those are six states in total. I would argue that Nevada is probably a little bit far fetched for us for a number of different reasons. Michigan is really tough because of election integrity loss. Pennsylvania, we just saw what happened with John Federman. So I mean, you're looking at this down the barrel of- My Senator John Federman. It's awful. I mean, we know how much better here in Arizona, but you have- Walk us real quick though, what's the Nevada? I mean, look, Nevada is a tough state for a number of different reasons. You have massive union power in Nevada. So part of the reason, I think Nevada would be an easily one red state if it wasn't for the unions that are there. And remember, there's- And they're operating out of Carson and Vegas. You have massive unions because of the casinos. You have massive unions because of the restaurant industry that's there. Got a father too. For the resorts. This is- So unfortunately, your union folks, they typically are voting left. They vote Democrat. They're told they're Democrat. They're giving time off and then they're actually compensated extra money to go out and help Democrats get a lot. We have the same issue in Pennsylvania. It's the same issue in Pennsylvania. Same issue in the lot of East Coast states, on the coast. And so this is what's bled over in Nevada, which is made it so tough. So even when you're in a situation where- It's actually interesting that with the exception of Georgia and Arizona, every other state you mentioned is a union state. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And Georgia and Arizona are just unique because in Wisconsin, to a certain extent for a lot of different reasons, they just don't have a lot of defense, right? We don't have a lot of institutionalized Republican groups and conservative groups that are there. They're able to defend election integrity, for example. The Democrats were able to come in very quickly and they were able to dominate these candidates and counties, which is part of the reason why they selected Arizona and Georgia, I think, in a lot of different reasons to try to take advantage of the 270 electoral votes that they need to win. So this is when you break it down, you know, your three best defense options in order to win the presidency are Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia. That's where we put our heavy emphasis on focus. That's where we've worked together with close partners like Scott Pressler, who, our announcement came out this last few weeks where we are investing into the operation there in Wisconsin. Yeah, we're here in Arizona. We're based out of Arizona. We know Arizona well. And then other partners and friends like the Tea Party Patriots who have a huge, significant lift in Georgia, a lot of institutional knowledge there where it's like, well, this is now what we got to do is we got to go in and fund and get the resources necessary in order to put the bodies on the ground to execute on the office that we needed or to win. Now we, so we had Scott Pressler on yesterday. He walked us through how sort of the meta process works, the overall process of you target someone, you use this year and he was in Louisiana, so they do have an off your governor's royal election that you can use that as a test bed for 24, which is great. But then even in other cases where you don't have an election, you still have the ability to begin micro-targeting voters. He is urging people to call in, work with registration, et cetera, et cetera. But walk us through what is the left doing? Because really in many cases we're just recreating what they've already done on this. Yeah, I mean, look, and I think we can do a lot better. I mean, the exciting part about where we're at as a movement, even though we're losing and we have lost, excuse me, even though we've lost the last few election cycles in places that we legitimately should have won, we're not losing by much. And the good news, even though it's not good news that this hasn't happened. I feel like people overlooked that, by the way, a lot. These are like nail-biter, squeaker, over-the-line-dies. David Cratchick is barely winning. This is part of the reason why in these cases a lot of people feel like, oh, well, the manipulation that's happening, the cheating that's happening is getting the presidential zone. Just over the edge. And really the better way to look at this is like the moving money ball. The way statistically, if you've watched the movie Moneyball, it's how the MLB basically operates today, where it's like it's a series of equations that if you put in and if you apply the right pressure, you're more likely to win. And this is effectively what the Democrats have done. They have a myriad of things that they've done to manipulate the elections. One of the biggest ways they manipulate the elections is they figured out, well, if we flood the zone with ballots, which is what they've tried to do, and then we look at the individuals who are less likely to vote. So they take advantage of people who are less likely to vote. Well, who is that? Typically, really young people and typically really old people, super seniors. People who just typically don't vote because they're aged out, they don't make it to the polls. They're lazy. Young people are typically not in the know of what's happening politically. And so 18 year olds, 19 year olds are some of the least likely people to vote typically. Well, if you give every 18 year old a ballot and then I can go to your door and sell you on one issue, micro target you on one issue, I'm going to be much more likely to be able to get you to turn in your ballot. That's what the Democrats have figured out, right? Honestly, that started with all the climate stuff, right? This is why they've pushed climate change. This is why they pushed abortion so heavily. And this was really the strategy that was solidified during the Obama years. The historic precedent was you win a primary, you move to the middle. Which by the way, and I just have to say, because I have you on, when is the last time you actually heard anybody arguing about healthcare? No. Remember during the Obama years, healthcare, healthcare, healthcare, they were just dominating the airwaves, dominating the streets. If you were going to college at that time, there was somebody with a clipboard, healthcare, healthcare, healthcare. Now it is gone. I couldn't even tell you the last time somebody brought it up. Yeah, it's not a positive thing for Democrats now, right? So this is how it works. Don't listen to that part, Democrats. This is how it works, right? So anything that they can take advantage of, any issue, singular issue, they do because they know those low propensity, what we call low propensity, which means they're less likely to vote or they vote more rarely. They can go to the door of that person, identify that that is a subject that they care about, and then use that topic in order to extract the vote, right? And so this is what they've done so effectively. Well, meanwhile, Republicans are talking about everything under the sun publicly. This is the old way of doing politics. It's the honest way of doing politics, right? Which is go out in public, get in on a debate stage, talk about everything, right? And then, you know, try to win over people because this is, you have a good view of what you believe and you have a good view of what I believe and then you can pick who you picked. But what they've done, and I know we talked about this a couple of months ago here on Election Day in Arizona, is they've shifted the system itself in these areas where they have this control away from a vote-based system to a ballot-based system. And what is the difference between votes and ballots and everyone should go read the conservative treehouse explanation on this, is that what you're talking about is mass movements of people showing up to vote on Election Day because they believe in X candidate versus this extraction method of simply, you know, call it moneyball politics where it's just all about putting pieces of paper in the ballot and the more pieces of paper that get in, the more chance you have for winning. And that's the moneyball concept, right? Because they know no matter what we do, a certain percentage of the electorate is going to show up. Yes. Right. No matter what we do on the left and the right. And so now it's come down to, okay, well, who's not going to show up? You know, even the people who get turned off to your candidate, like Trump or whoever, right, or Biden on either side or Hillary, you know, it's only going to be a single-digit percentage. Even if it's like 6% instead of 5% or something, right? Or Romney. The numbers are relatively small. The big number that exists out there are the people who haven't voted, the people who are sitting at home that haven't turned in the ballot. And so the extraction process of that is so much more valuable and better money spent. Because it's money that, or it's a vote that wouldn't have come out otherwise. That's key. We're going to stick with Tyler Boyer as we dig through this. Turning Point Action, the conference comes up July 15th, 16th. You must be there. This is a working session. Scott Prosser will be leading working groups to explain how we can fight back and went. Stay tuned. Come right back. Okay. We're back, Tyler Boyer here, the COO of Turning Point Action. Tyler, you were breaking down for us the importance of extracting this extra. It's almost like a bonus percentage of ballots that we can get out for these races. And because the Democrats are doing this, and in many cases, Republicans are not, just set the stakes, set the table for us. You're going through process. We need that. But set the stakes. What happens if Republicans don't do this and decide to shut the door on it and say, you know what? That's not how I like doing politics. That's not how we should be running elections. I don't like it. And by the way, I don't like this either, personally. I find in a sense, I find it to be immoral, right? At the same time, because you're supposed to be getting the view of the people, the will of the people. The organic, the organic, actual will of the people. And yet they've changed the system in these areas. And so the only way that we can restore a moral order to politics is through fighting fire with fire. What happens if we don't do this? Well, I mean, look, we just talked about it. So if we look at this from a numbers perspective, what the left has figured out is that there's only a certain percentage that you're ever going to be able to move, right? So a very small single digit percentage is ever going to pull off of a candidate if they're the nominee for Republicans or the nominee for Democrats. So this means that you have to, no matter what, you have to do this work if they're doing this work. Because think about it, if Democrats have figured out, well, okay, if let's say your nominee, right? Let's go. And you lose 7%. What? Because of something that you've said in your past, they hit. I may have had some spicy tweets, all right. But they, I stand by all of them. If you're the nominee for the party, we know that if we can overcome that 7% in that share, we can know, we know without hard numbers, right? Right. But that protects the numbers. And I remember this because we used to say we used to just call that the ground game. Yeah. You just, now it's just, you go, now if we can flood the zone with ballots and make up that number, you're more likely to win in a tight race and a close state. Now if you can go beyond that, right, far beyond that, now it's really tough for the other side, especially if you're picking up votes that are independent, middle of the road, swing voters, because that's a two for one vote, right? Because every time I get a vote, that's a swing vote, I'm taking one for you. You're canceling a vote. Yeah. And I'm getting one, right? And so if that person doesn't vote, you're not really losing much. If that person does vote, it's like you're, you're a plus two if that person votes for you. So this is the reason why it doesn't really matter who our nominee is for any race, really, right? This is the reason why John Feldermen can get elected in, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a way, as hard as it is to, to hear that it doesn't matter who our nominee is. And I get that you're, look, here's something that I've always told candidates back when I used to consult on campaigns or, or just work on campaigns, I would say it is not the quality of your votes that matters. It is the quantity of your votes that matters. And that, the way to flip that around today is you would say, unfortunately, as John Feldermen explains, it is not the quality of your candidate that matters. Yeah. A candidate quality. Not if you're in an area with this system. Candidate quality is, is, is chairs on the cake, right? Yeah. So you're, the better your candidate is, the, the, the smaller ideally that margin that you're going to lose is going to be, right? Right. And so that just means that more votes that you go out and, and you get in in an organic ways, right? So these are inorganic ways that the Democrats are, are shoveling votes in the system. And we say Democrats, we really mean leftist organizations growing out and doing this work. Of course, they, they've understood for a while, and you saw this in 2016, they, this sort of all the great, you know, mega donors of the party and, you know, people talk about Soros, but he's not the only one. They decide at Reed Hoffman is another one of these, Steve Jobs' widow, Lorraine Powell Jobs is one of them, that the DNC, the party wasn't the right vehicle for this because it was too clunky. It was too bogged down with prior relationships, too much political instead, you know, infighting, etc. And so they just set up an entire ecosystem of an democratic machine outside of the party structure itself. This is your dark money groups. This is yours. 501c3s. This is your 501c4s. These are all super PACs now. All this stuff, which actually exists to win elections. And they just kind of use the DNC to run the convention. Yeah. And this is, and also all through in their sandbank been freed, right? So. Sam Beckman freed, right. So I mean, this was, this is where all this came into play and people are losing their minds that are studying this is because we were, yeah, they're like, oh, well, he donated to Republicans. Yeah. But Republican money, when it's being donated by donors right now is going into things that are ineffective at a 80% level. That's about the number that I give it. Meanwhile, while the Democrats have these systems that are built in the place that are, they're maximizing every dime that they get from donors to go into the system that's a ballot chasing heavy system. In addition to doing all the work, you know, they're trying to manipulate our elections. They're suing the courts to try to take advantage of specific counties that matter. And to make these laws better for them in these areas. There's only about 17 counties that matter, right? To win the election. So it's, this is a rocket science, right? If we're doing this right, you know, as Republicans, as conservatives, what we should be doing is going to donors and saying, hey, stop giving Mitch McConnell money and start funding litigation that's going to stop Democrats from manipulating our elections at the county level. Now, what can you do additionally is providing additional resources to build the army. It doesn't matter if you support Trump. It doesn't matter to support DeSantis. It doesn't matter if you support Tim Scott. It doesn't matter who you like, you have to build the infrastructure that's going to be able to get this work done no matter who the nominee becomes. Because if you don't do that, they're just, they're laughing at us every time because they have the infrastructure they're building. I think I just bottom line it. If we don't do this, we lose. I mean, constantly, right? And it's in the scary part about this. And all the arguments about 2024 and all the elect, you know, the memes and the Twitter battles and all the rest of it. None of it matters. None of it matters. And the scary part is though, it's not just losing the election, the 270 electoral college votes that we know are at play. It's, can they utilize this? And this is what the left is doing. There's sick people. They want to manipulate elections in states like Idaho and Utah and Tennessee. And this is what I've been telling people. We had a tweet go viral about six months ago, almost a year ago, I think that you retweeted where I let people know. I said, look, these are the states where if they manipulate the elections enough in these states, you're never going to get the country back because think about it. I mean, Idaho, I never even considered Idaho as a battle. And look, Idaho is, they did the right thing. They stopped ranked choice voting there, but ranked choice voting is one of those examples we'll get into it. But you're right though, ranked choice voting is a perfect example of this where they can come in and manipulate elections. Typically, it can help the status quo type candidates. But that being said, if you're on the right side of the system of it, they can, they can put whoever they want. They can manipulate everything. And so then you lose, you start losing the states that you don't anticipate losing or you, I mean, look what happened in Alaska, for example, right? Right. Alaska is, you start having these things. You start having these things happen. Well, you're, it's going to be really challenging to ever win the country back. You're talking about a single party, one party rule system. Because if all we're doing is playing defense and they're constantly on offense, then we're not putting points on the board. You're never going to. So this is, this is the time where it's like, well, we've got to fight these battles, but in order to fight battles, you got to win. How do you win? You put more points on the board than the other team. I'll ask you, and you can say if you don't want to, but you know, look, I've talked about this. I've talked about, I've talked about this directly to President Trump. I know other people have. He's been out publicly speaking about it. Do you feel that he really is embracing it as much as he says he is? I think organically, the entire movement is. A lot of it's thanks to the work that you're doing and that our good friends, Charlie and Charlie Kirk and so many others have been doing, which is having an open, honest dialogue discussion about this. And this is what's helping lead the charge. And Scott Press are obviously we need to give a lot of credit to Scott and so many others. Leading the charge saying, hey, look, this is the most critical thing. Now, the big question is, now people are starting to embrace like, oh, okay, this makes sense. Now the question is, how do we functionally build this the correct way? Because again, what the Democrats have figured out a long time ago is that Democrat party is useless. The Democrat party is in no place to build this and keep it running, this engine running year in and year out. And there's an equal argument to be made that the RNC, the Republican Party can't do this long term. There's things that the Republican Party should be doing that they're probably not doing perfectly and they could be doing a lot better right now. But they shouldn't be running these operations because you need outside groups to do that for you so that they stay well oiled and like a well oiled machine year in and year out. And that's the time. And you're solely focused on this. When we come back, we're coming up with our last break, but when we do come back, I want to get into with you some of the specifics on how we can build this out. And look, at the end of the day, we want to win. We want to win. We want to put points on the board. I don't want to be looking at any of these election nights again where, oh, the mail-in ballots came in at three in the morning. The mail-in ballots come in at four in the morning and all the numbers change, all the trajectories change. I'm sick of it. And if it's going to happen, I say, look, I said this already. If they bring 2,000 mules, we bring 10,000. All right, back to that with Tyler Boyer here on human events. Look, Tyler, when I see Dylan Mulvaney, when I see these Tiktakers go into the White House, even the one who was making a complete fool of her, him, I don't even know what kind of self, at the Pride celebration, we laugh about it and we make fun of it. But I think we also need to understand that that's part of an operation from the left, because that's a reward for people that have gone in and used their social media through these engines and through these operations to drive out ballots, to drive out votes, to drive out mail-in votes, early voting for Democrat candidates. So when you're looking at someone like this, oh, this person's a side show, they're a carnival show, well, you know what, that's part of an operation. And if we don't have respect for that, for all of the different operations that they're running, this is key, because look, you can have a Tiktoker with 2 million fans. And guess what? Boom, they're on livestream. They got 100,000 watching live. And tonight we're going to focus on Pennsylvania. Tonight we're going to focus on abortion. Tonight we're going to focus on guns, whatever it is. And then David Hogg is out there with guns, someone else who come up on trans issues, whatever it is, this is micro-targeting of micro-targeting, because influencers can play a huge role in this. So to directly affect ballots, not indirectly, directly affect ballots, but also you have a situation and you were breaking this down for us, but you really do need this regional micro-targeting of voters. How does that actually work? Yeah, I mean, you're bringing up something that's, there's two different sides to think about when you're looking at this, like an influencer type thing. Number one, is they're collecting data on users typically. Yes. So when you comment, you don't realize this, but when you comment or you follow somebody based around a topic, then they know they can go to your door and target you based off of that topic. So, for example, you brought up. Because guess what, folks? Your dad is for sale. You think you're just privately on those lists? No. And you brought up David Hogg. So like, once they know that you're against guns, right, right, now they know they can go to your door and try to get you to turn over your ballot on the topic of being anti-gun, right? Or like if you're pro-trans, so a lot of people are like- Or, but on our side, you could say maybe if you followed Kyle Rittenhouse. Right. We could use that data. We don't use that data. We should be using that data instead of, you know, we have a lot of establishment people that laugh at that. Meanwhile the left is using that data to micro-target those individuals that typically don't vote, right? Because they've given up on the system or they're young or whatever. And on our side, just think about this. So you have a scenario where a lot of people have been like, well, how is the transition moving votes? This is like less than probably 3% of the American populace actually thinks about trans issues, they care. Well, if you look at that, remember let's go back to those percentages that we talked about. Let's say you lose or, you know, we have a neck-to-neck Senate race, like in the state of Arizona, for example, the slacks of the election cycle where I'm polling, it was within one percentage point. Or next time it'll be when it's neck-to-neck-neck. Right. Neck-to-neck-neck, right? With Kearson-Cenima. If it's within 2% or 3% points, well, if you have a body of people that are easily targetable, like the, like people in the trans community in Arizona, which are, you know, are people that support the trans agenda, right? You're talking 3, 4, 5. Now it's even larger because they've popularized it within the Democrat party. Now all we have to do is identify those people based off of their feedback, their social, the surveys that they filled out, and then go to their door and say, do you care about trans issues? Yeah, I care about trans issues. Well, there's only one candidate. Give me your ballot, right? Or fill out your ballot in this way and we'll walk you to your mailbox. And so that's how they're hyper-targeting these people, these fringe issues, right? Meanwhile, our side, the establishment, you know, laughs at people who have conservative principles instead of trying to work with those people that turn to their ballots. So Tyler, we've got a couple of minutes left for the end of the show. You're running Turning Point Action. What is the plan? Are you going to be hiring people to put bodies where they need to be to actually do this work? Yeah, and this is the core, right? Is the fundamental change in how we go about this business on the conservative movement. And what we're doing at Turning Point Action and the huge credit, again, to Charlie Kirk, you know, we work with you that work so closely with us and so many people that have been supportive. We're building the first ever, I think, large-scale ballot-chasing army to do that specific work, which is identify those people on our side that we can micro-target and go to, give them a reason to vote, right, that are not voting right now. We have many, we have many, many people. But again, the establishment, historical precedent that's been set by the Republican Party is, oh, just forget about those people, move to the middle and that's how you're going to get them. That's not how you're going to get these people. That's actually the opposite approach, how you're going to get these people, which again, the Obama people figured out in their race and they've lived by that ever since. And so for us, it's now, build the army, go into Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, build the army, go to Pennsylvania, right? We're going to have a large, the largest army that we've ever built in these states, particularly Pennsylvania. We'll talk about Pennsylvania, my friend. This is a place where now the Democrats are going to be outgunned, outnumbered. We have a larger, more reliable base of voters. We just have to give them the right tools in order to go to the right doors and chase the right ballots that we need in order to win. And here's the thing is, in some of these areas where, and I remember when Trump won in 2016 in Pennsylvania, even to me it was a shock. Because Pennsylvania is one of those states, like you were just talking about in Nevada, where it just always seemed just out of reach for a Romney, for Bush Jr., for McCain. And then Trump comes in and he's able to do it exactly by what you just said, by driving out those lower propensity voters, particularly organically. Right? Right. He did it all again. Trump's personality, his force of personality, and particularly with his agenda on trade. These were the sons and daughters, in some cases, grandsons and granddaughters of the Reagan Democrats, who were the coalition that swung Pennsylvania and the rest of the Rust Belt over for Trump. With this plan, with Turning Point Action, you can easily go in, not easily, but the system isn't hard once you've figured it out. It's just going to take a lot of boot leather, it's going to take a lot of people working together. A lot of data. A lot of tech. But it's so doable. It's so doable. Well, and Jack, I just want to remind you, what happened to you? In 2016, organically, he's never going to happen again. That's right. Why? Because the billionaires on the left looked at that embarrassed. They never thought they got embarrassed. They didn't spend the money to do the chasing, number one. They didn't think they had to. Some of it wasn't developed, but they didn't have to because they thought, oh, Hillary's got this in the bag, right? All the polling show. Hillary's supposed to win at 99.8% chance. You would have been started five years ago. They thought there was no chance in heck that she was going to lose. And so they're never going to let that happen again. That's even more reasonable than we have to build this. We're never going to let this happen again. That means if we do not embrace this, we are going to lose. Tyler Boyer, Turning Point Action, can't wait for the action conference coming up later next month. I'm going to be there. I think, Tonya, believe it or not, Tonya Tae is planning to do a road trip down the East Coast and then end in Florida for the convention. I said, I don't know if I can do that. I got to do the show. I got to do everything else. But maybe we'll work it out. You can bring your whole family on stage with you. That's what you got to do. Let's do it. Do the Benny Johnson. Do the Benny Johnson. The ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay short."
