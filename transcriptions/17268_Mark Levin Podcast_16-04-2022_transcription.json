    "text": " It's all quiet in the underground bunker. Doors closed, blocks bolted. But the great one isn't just resting on his laurels. He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. This is the best of Mark Levin. They were having a sale, Mr. Producer, on Stents. You know, the Stents that go into the arteries? So I went into one of the hospitals and I got another Stent. But everything's great. And I want to thank you folks for inquiring. All right, look, if we can't keep the biggest city in the nation safe, the biggest financial center in the world safe. What was once the biggest tourist center in the world safe, then we're failing as a civil society. This attack on the New York subway is an attack on all of us. Many of you are listening. You've never been on a subway or you avoid subways. Well, people are avoiding subways because they're not safe anymore and because they stink from human feces and urine and so forth, and they're rat infested. And yet if people want us to take mass transit, this needs to be fixed, but it's not going to be fixed as long as criminals are on the street, as long as we have liberal judges letting them out the back door. These are violent people. Now, I don't know who this guy is. Five feet, five inches tall, about 180 pounds. African American. Sounds like a slob. But conditions are such that at least for now, maybe there's more than one person, but at least for now, one guy can elude all authorities, get on the subway, unleash these canisters, these gas canisters wearing a gas mask. He's carrying a bag that has gasoline, smoke bombs and other things in it. He unloads his pistol or his weapon, which jams, thank God, ten people are actually shot, five in critical condition. We hear none of them life threatening, but simply could have been. That's luck. Eighteen others injured in one way or another. The crime in the New York subway is up 68% year to year. Now they have an image of the guy apparently from somebody with a phone. But now the news is as of now that none of the video was working. You know, you see the video cameras in the ceilings and so forth and various subway stations. We haven't been watching it. They weren't working. None of them. So there was a systemic failure. On the other hand, who was there to moments, moments? Moments notice. The NYPD. The FDNY. The NYPD. Always the point of the spear. Always there first. Always there where there's smoke, where there's gunfire, where there's bomb threats, where there's mayhem. The same NYPD less than two years ago that was brutalized by the media. Brutalized by the Democrat party. Brutalized by that former mayor in that city council, the defund movement. You don't hear a word now about systemic racism in the NYPD, do you? Not a word. The people of New York, the people of New York state, the people of the country rely on this police department. And this police department will get to the bottom of this. Because it's made of professional men and women, not racists, who put their lives on the line every damn day. Same with the fire department. Right on the scene. And quite frankly, same with the MTA. There they were. Moving the wound of the casualties onto another train to get them to a hospital as fast as they could. This is a fantastic country. New York is a fantastic city. But you cannot allow violent criminals to be recidivists with these quack judges and these quack laws and these quack politicians. Now the president of the United States says federal authorities will get to the bottom of this. They'll leave no leaf unturned, no rock unturned and all the rest of it. All of a sudden everybody supports the cops, but they don't support the cops. That's why we're in the position we're in today. That's why people are moving in mass out of New York City and it's five boroughs to other places. Like Florida, like Texas, like Tennessee, like other states, they just had enough. The taxes are through the roof. Where are they all going? Then the masks, the moron governor in New Jersey across the river there. Yes, I think second graders should learn about different sexes and so forth. And he's having second thoughts because parents, regardless of party, regardless of background, have had enough of this crap. They've had enough. And the same day this is going on in New York City, the lieutenant governor is arrested for financial embezzlement, criminal activity. He's arrested, just resigned. The governor of New York hasn't even been elected. It's because the former governor had to resign under pressure because of his misconduct and unethical behavior. The American people deserve better than this. Now here are the facts for those of you who may not know, although it's been on television and radio. The New York City subway shooters Philadelphia rented U-Haul, is found abandoned on Brooklyn Highway five miles from where he shot ten strap hangers. Gunman dumped gun three extended-round magazines in a bag of smoke bombs at the train station. He opened fire in a northbound end train at 8.24 a.m. as it pulled into the 36th Street Station. He'd been calmly sitting on the train as the Daily Mail reports, but then put on a gas mess and detonated a smoke bomb. Passengers were trapped in the subway car. They tried to get to the next car, but the door was locked. When the train arrived at 36th Street, injured victims spilled out onto the platform trailing blood. The gunman described as a heavy set black five foot five inch individual and wearing a vest fled and remains at large. There's a massive manhunt underway. NYPD officials have told to look for the U-Haul van with the plate AL-3-1-4-0-8. Well, they found it. His 380 automatic handgun jammed, which stopped him from shooting more at the station. A bag of Falcon Rising Fireworks, seismic wave smoke canisters, and three extended magazines were found. The NYPD is doubling the number of police officers on the subway tonight. They'll find the guy. I have complete faith in the NYPD. They'll find the guy. And they've located the U-Haul. Sebastian Reyes, U-Haul Vice President of Communications, said law enforcement alerted us to its search for a rental van, and its possible connection to a suspect in today's incident in New York City. Well, they already have. No security cameras were operational. That is shocking. To be perfectly honest, that is a Pauling. Now, it says here that he may have jumped onto one of the other trains at the station or fled into the subway tunnel. It's been a frightening spike in crime across the city, particularly in the subway, where crimes are up by more than 60% from last year. And as I say, ABC reports the police have obtained a photo of the suspect from a bystanders phone, but the image has not yet been released anywhere. NYPD units are scouring the city's empty subway tunnels to find the suspect. And a city alert has been issued. The FBI and others have been going door to door in the area. It's a large area. It's a matter of fact. Is it terrorism? The mayor hasn't ruled it out. They haven't ruled it in as they gather information. This is what we know. The Daily Mail has very extensive photographs, if you wish to check it online. And the New York Post has done outstanding coverage, too, if you want to check that. One witness said I thought he was an MTA worker at first because I didn't pay much attention. He's got on orange. The smoke bomb and what I thought were fireworks. I'm hearing it was gunshots. I have no words for what I could see. I was in the car. I was in the front end of the third car. Everything happened at the back end. People started migrating to the front of the car. I don't know if people know this. It's one of those old things where they locked the door to stop people traveling between trains. There were people in the other car who saw it was happening and they tried to open it, but they couldn't. And there was blood on the floor. And I'll tell you another thing that's happening. This is where decent people begin to unite and pull together. And that's now what you're seeing in New York City. But I do want to mention again, this is an example why the war on cops is so destructive to society, to the civil society. And the NYPD that was honored after 9-11 and honored for so many horrific events that it was involved in stopping and dealing with afterwards. This is why so many of them, so many of us defended them when black lives matter, which is a corrupt organization stealing millions from people. Did what they did and said what they said. The NYPD's own an apology. These liberal judges need to be removed. These phony bail laws in the front door, out the back door need to be repealed. And if the people don't do it, it's not going to be done. It's what elections are all about. Mark, the vin. America's colleges and universities today are less concerned with critical thinking than within indoctrination. But I'm happy to report there is a college where students debate ideas openly and honestly, where they pursue true together with their professors. And where America's great heritage of liberty is studied and revered. My favorite college, Hillsdale College. As stated in Hillsdale's founding document in 1844, Hillsdale's original mission was to offer the kind of serious liberal arts education needed to preserve the blessings of civil and religious liberty across the country. And this mission continues to guide Hillsdale College today. And you can learn a whole lot more at levinforhillsdale.com. There you'll find a short video. It's just over a minute long showing how Hillsdale's work, not only in Michigan or Washington DC campuses, but across the nation is effective in defending American liberty. Take some time to watch today at levinforhillsdale.com. That's lvinforhillsdale.com. Making your weekend even better. This is the best of Mark Levin. The name Disney is worth hundreds of billions of dollars actually. Thanks to Walt Disney. Who's Abigail Disney? I think she's a granddaughter, great-damned granddaughter of Walt Disney. She had absolutely nothing to do with starting Disney, with Disney films, Disney TV, Disney products, nothing. Nothing. She's a Disney though. And that was enough for CNN, the Constipated News Network. That was enough for Brian Stelter to bring her on. To talk about the Disney law, because Brian Stelter has no problem if his little babies are exposed to sexuality, the age of 5, 6, 7 or 8. But that's up to Brian Stelter. And that's up to the people who advocate these things. And for my two cents worth, that is really a subject at that age. That should compel the various government services to take the children away from their parents. I mean that. No five-year-olds should be exposed to some intense discussion about genitalia. That's child abuse. You know they used to be child abuse. Now it's a movement, a civil rights movement. Brian Stelter has no problem with that being discussed with his babies. None. But that's because he's perverse in my view. And if that's what he wants to do, that's on him. But when did it become the power of a corporation, the power of the media, the power of government to impose that on our children? That's what the battle's about. It's not whether you're gay or straight or whatever you are. It's exposing young children to this, to sexuality. It's they don't say gay bill. Where does that come from? That is a lie. It's propaganda. But they keep saying it. Even Abigail Disney, even Brian Stelter. They're a disgrace. They keep pushing this narrative on MSLSD. They keep pushing this narrative on CNN. They keep pushing this narrative even though it's a lie, like so much of what they say. So here's Brian Stelter with Abigail Disney in my response. Go ahead. What is the Walt Disney Company actually? And how do you feel when you see it portrayed as this child abuse indoctrination cult? Well, what I'm seeing happen is pretty coordinated strategic plan unfolding. And Disney seems like the biggest target because it's so woven into families. And so if you can. By the way, a coordinated strategic plan unfolding. I hope so. That's called we the people rising up against what your corporation is now doing. After decades and decades and decades of persuading us to invest a lot of money in your corporation. These are shareholders are just movie watchers or attendees at your various parks. Go ahead. That somebody's in there trying to indoctrinate your child. My goodness, the paranoid imagination can run. It's not about indoctrinating your child either. It's about exposing children to issues that they should not be exposed to. That's what it's about. Go ahead. Run circles. Yeah. Yeah. And so I understand why it's been selected in this strategic whatever strategic meeting they had for what they would turn to. There was no strategic meeting you idiot. No strategic meeting. Go ahead. But this is absurd. The thing that Disney stands for more than anything in every film and especially in the animation where there's a gay character or not is love and acceptance and family and joy. It stands for little children. It stands for entertaining little children. That's what it stands for. Love and acceptance. Maybe love depending on how you define it, but acceptance. Are little kids supposed to accept everything? What are they supposed to accept? Are little kids supposed to accept changing genitalia? Five year olds? Is that what they're supposed to accept? They don't even understand it. You're exposing them to issues that they should not be exposed to at that age. Go ahead. And so they're trying to inject something into what Disney does that has nothing to do with what Disney does, whether or not they're a character. And I keep wondering gay characters. Why would you do that? Why not just have characters? Why do you inject gay characters, straight characters, crooked characters, just characters? And so what is the point of this interview, ladies and gentlemen, it's to tie a Disney name to this radical position. That Brian Stelter, I guarantee you, Brian Stelter would never or has never exposed his five-year-old, six-year-old or seven-year-old to these kinds of matters. I guarantee you. Here's a preschool teacher in Florida on TikTok. David Mamet on my show came under attack by the usual left-wing cukes, claiming that he said all teachers basically are, uh, perverts and waiting. Of course, that's not what he said if you take what he says in context, but it doesn't matter. They're not interested in what he actually said. These are both basically ideologues who are mostly illiterate. They know how to get on social media and kick up the dust, but you know what? Who cares? That's why I'm not on Twitter and Facebook. Here's a preschool teacher in Florida on TikTok. I wonder if Brian Stelter will have him on his show. I wonder if Disney... will welcome this teacher to Playland for the Magic Kingdom. Cut 15, go. Man, y'all thought me teaching the children about me being poly was crazy, but not only that, but they also know that I'm gender fluid. Uh, at one point last year, I had explained to them that I was not Miss Lois or Mr. Lois. It's just Lois because I'm not a boy or a girl. And this was all well and good until October when I also explained to them that I'm pagan, so I am also a witch. And at one point I got in a haircut and I got in the sides of my mohawk, a shave down. And I come into work and one of the children goes, Lois, are you a boy? You have short hair. And his sister goes, no, Lois is a girl and a third child, who's my favorite? Suddenly else, no guys, we've been over this. Lois isn't a boy or a girl. Lois is a witch. Duh. These are preschoolers. And this is the problem. The teacher doesn't own that classroom. Now, a teacher can be an authoritarian dictator of that classroom, but a teacher doesn't own the classroom. We do, the people. And that's the battle. The parents do, the taxpayers do. To go in there, I don't even know what polyamorous is, and I'm not even going to look it up. I don't care. She's gender fluid. She's talking to her preschoolers. That means there's four-year-olds, five-year-olds. And I wonder if Abigail Disney is aware of this. I wonder if Brian Stelter is aware of it. I wonder if they have any questions being raised. In order to protect these little kids from somebody like this, Florida passed its law, perfectly rational law, that ten years ago, wouldn't even have cost a dustup. Do not expose little babies to these sexual ideologies and practices. Period. Do not. And that's said to be a don't-say-gay bill. Don't say heterosexual. Don't say homosexual. Don't say, in other words, don't say sexual. It's the don't-be or say sexual bill. That's what it is. But this is the position of Disney. You have more and more of these teachers speaking on TikTok and elsewhere. And they should immediately have their tickets pulled if that's what they're doing. And this is why the parents are going to rise up in this election also, regardless of party. Because Biden, the Democrat Party, the Democrat governors, and the Democrat mayors, as well as the media, I might add, they're all promoting this now. Despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the American people want nothing to do with this, demonstrated in blue Virginia, demonstrated in dark blue New Jersey last election, demonstrated in San Francisco, which is as red as it gets, frankly, and I don't mean politically. I mean, ideologically, throwing out certain school board members, people of all ethnicities, all faiths, all backgrounds, red-blooded Americans, they've had enough of this. You're sabotaging the family. You're brainwashing children. It's from the top down, not the bottom up. And I hope I pray to God that this next election, despite everybody, that's going to be a slam. It's going to be a slam really is. And that's going to take you working hard. I don't care where you live to change things. You're going to have to change things. Because the saboteurs, the ideologues from above us are imposing the will on all of us. Mark, Bowvin. You're listening to the best of Mark Levin. It's Kevin Downey, Jr. at PJ Media. This is what stuck in my head who has a piece up today. How white liberals and black leaders sacrificed black lives for self-esteem and profit. And, you know, we always knew this, but the way he put it really does give it a marquee, doesn't it? I mean, it really underscores the fact white liberals and black leaders sacrificed black lives for self-esteem and profit. Is this not what goes on in every major city in America, particularly New York and L.A.? The answer is yes. Frank R. James, a domestic terrorist who tried to slaughter scores of people on the New York subway system. It's now been caught. They're going to need an extra big orange jumpsuit for this fat slob. Plus his breasts, they'll probably have to give him, well, I don't know. Probably have to have one custom made. Here he is on YouTube and YouTube. Congratulations. You did a hell of a job of managing this guy while you're chasing all the Trump people and all the people questioned Fauci and all the people support law enforcement. Oh, yeah, you guys at YouTube, which is owned by Google, by the way, as I recollect. And hat tip to Andy. How do you pronounce it? Andy? No, I should know this. It's a tough young man. Andy? No. Cut five. Go. I had no idea with that afternoon. Okay. Okay. He's talking about. Katanji Brown Jackson. Start from the top, please. I had no idea with that afternoon that she would be married to. A white man, one of my subscribers brought that to my attention. Yeah. Our black sister Supreme Court justice, power to the people is very 12 white. I don't believe. Oh, God. Wait a minute. This is the boy. What do you do? There is a white man. Black sister. Katanji. Hey, man. It's a white man. You know, this race is white this white that white this white that this is why I condemn it. When I hear it on MSNBC or other places, I condemn it. I condemn all this racism, critical race theory. Some people are on the edge and it pushes them over and it pushes them over. Who knows what affected this head case. Sure as hell doesn't help. Frank. Are and by the way, will people be protesting a Comcast? No. Will people be protesting at Google or YouTube? No. No. Frank R. James on YouTube had tip right scoop. Cut six. Go. Now tell American Negroness. I can tell you the same thing. White people and black people as we call ourselves should not have any contact with each other. You still refuse to understand this. You want to make up some story about some Jesus and the Bible said dumb. They don't see it that way. They hate your God's. And why they hate your God's? Because they know that your rightful place is at a slave in this country. They know that. You're the only one who doesn't realize that. And now you want to be equal to them by force. They didn't choose to elect. They didn't elect to make you equal. You had to force them to make you an equal. And now they're just getting more angry and more angry. The anger is building up and nothing can happen here differently than what happened over. And you're with the Jews. I want you to believe that that's possible. I want you to lose yourself and tell yourself this. I want you to believe that you can tell yourself this. Bull about that could never happen here. That could never happen here. Those are famous. Last words. That could never happen here. That's the good. And it will. Well, he didn't even get a scarlet letter. Did he, Mr. Producer, over there at YouTube? No. Nothing. Not a thing. Not a damn thing. And yet this is his ranting and raving on social media. And NBC and ABC finally have acknowledged that he is who he is. When the search was on to find the man, they wouldn't even know his color. If some white a hole went on the subway and did what this guy did, I'd want to know all the particulars, including whether the guy was white. But as Kevin Downey Jr. puts it, how white liberals and black leaders sacrifice black lies for self-esteem and profit. Now he was shooting randomly on that subway car. As best as we know, the investigation is ongoing. He would have killed anybody if he could. His gun jams. The fat slob. He's hungry after a while. You know, more than a day without a big Mac and a combo meal. And a 32 ounce Coke. I still think you can buy those. New York. Can't you, Mr. Producer? I want those outlawed. Who the hell does not? Yeah. But whatever. This guy's not wanting. Then he's caught by a citizen who speaks broken English, who is thrilled to be in this country, who loves this country, and calls the cops who arrest him. And this so-called systemically racist NYPD police force with its African American commissioner, the African American mayor, the female governor. We as Americans should be so proud of the unity and the diversity in this country. But we have people who keep trying to rip us apart, and they happen to be in the Democrat party, they happen to be in the American media. And especially on MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times and the Washington Post. Especially. As far as I'm concerned. Juliet Kayam, CNN national security analyst. Juliet Kayam, Kayam. Now listen to this. Just listen to this. And CNN employs this fool and gives her a platform. Cut nine, go. So the idea that it's only has to be a foreign ex as we know now, January 6, there's a lot of domestic terrorists. There are people who, and this is the majority of them. I'm not aware that anybody, perhaps I'm wrong, but maybe Juliet Kayam and CNN can tell us has been charged with some domestic terrorism act. I'm just unaware of it. She says there's a lot of domestic terrorists in January 6 demonstrated that. So she's supposed to be an actual analyst, a national security analyst. Is that true? I don't believe it is. And they didn't shoot a soul. They shot nobody. The person who was shot was a veteran, protestor, who didn't break in. They didn't harm a soul who wasn't violent. She was there in the Capitol building. And for all we know, she was waved in. But she didn't deserve to be shot randomly and die on the scene right on the spot. With a half-assed investigation by the authorities in Washington. So the officer who shot her is now considered some kind of a hero. See, it depends who you shoot, I suppose. But Juliet Kayam at CNN, this is why CNN really does need to die on the vine. This is why nobody watches it. They say they're going to fix it. They're going to turn it into a news operation. No, they're not. It is what it is. All the domestic terrorists from January 6, name one. Most of them have been prosecuted for parading and trespass, including people who've been waved in. Go ahead. Tells us. But I am a strong proponent of reserving the word terrorism for a political motivation. Listen to this, Lydia. She just attacked the January 6 people as domestic terrorists. But I'm a strong proponent of reserving the word tear for political motivation. It's like Biden who wants to redefine what genocide means. So she wants to redefine what a domestic terrorist act is. Remember that chart I read to you that was on ricochet from 2015 I read to you yesterday? It depends who the attacker is and it depends who the victim is. Remember that Mr. Baddus? So that's exactly what we have here. Because the attacker is Frank James. Well, I wouldn't get a terrorism. It depends on the political motive and the fact that the guys say out of the closet disgusting racist, all you have to do is watch his YouTube. That's not good enough for the national security analyst. Go ahead. And so I know this was terrifying. I know it was terrible. Hashtag you, idiot. You don't know a damn thing. You don't know a damn thing. Mark, the win. The great one. Make sure we can even better. This is the best of Mark Levin. Every year this publication called Talkers Magazine, most of you have not. But in this business people like to throw it around. And Rush used to tell me, ignore it, ignore it, ignore it. And I should. Puts out the list of the heavy hundred. Based on it's like the New York Times editorial board. Number one is Sean. That's correct. Number three is this show. This show is number two. It's the number two show in America. I can prove it. Then they have little editorial comments, such as the judgment of the staff. What is the point of that? It's like the New York Times bestseller list. You can have more books sold and they put you at number four behind the number one guy. Then some phony matrix they put out there about audience size. We know what our audience size is. Almost to the person. People have these phony matrices out there. Oh, look at this. Now you don't know when a host is desperate or hosts plural. When they keep pointing to Talkers Magazine, look at us, look where we are, ignore it. That's not where they are. Ignore it, which is what I'm going to do right now. We've got a lot of important stuff to talk about. Elon Musk. A lot of people have great hope for him. As do I. As do I. He's offered $43 billion to buy Twitter. But then we have some breaking news from late this afternoon, early this evening. From postmillennial.com, Musk no longer Twitter's largest shareholder after Vanguard stock buy. Now number one, this has to be an effort to block Musk. But we're going to find out in 20 minutes when we have the great Charlie Gasperino on who will walk us through this. Because this is very, very important. Musk wrote a letter to the board. He left as a board member because he wanted to have the ability to take over this company. And as he said in the letter and as he has said in interviews, which you'll hear in a moment, he wants to bring free speech and free access back to Twitter and that platform. He's under vicious attack by the left and the Democrat Party. Vicious attack. In fact, it's worse than that, ladies and gentlemen. Charlie Gasperino, again, he'll be here in 20 minutes. He tweeted out the following as Elon Musk offers to buy the rest of Twitter a legal source tells Fox business. That the Department of Justice and the SEC have launched what he described as quote joint investigation, unquote, into a myriad of Musk regulatory issues primarily involving Tesla. So here we have the politicized Department of Justice, the politicized SEC going after the wealthiest man in the world who's trying to take Twitter and make it a public free speech access site like it was supposed to be. But Twitter and Facebook and the rest of them have become the important mouthpieces and propaganda platforms for the Democrat Party in the American Marxists. So the idea that Musk would come along with his belief in free speech is quite the libertarian and say, OK, I'm going to fix this platform. Now, suddenly he's under investigation or joint investigation. There's a whole bunch of stuff involving Tesla. This man is an inventor. He's a creator. He's a producer. He's a taxpayer. He's an employer. Countries should thank individuals like this. Countries should celebrate individuals like this, not punish them. Not investigate them. Not attack them. And he said when it comes to Twitter, it's not even about the financial aspect. It's about free speech and not just in America, but all over the world because Twitter has that kind of a reach. So Musk no longer Twitter's largest shareholder after Vanguard stock buy. Vanguard, according to the Wall Street Journal Vanguard Group, an asset managing firm, increased its stake in the tech giant to 10.3%. Asset manager Vanguard recently upped its stake in the social media platform and is now the company's largest shareholder, bumping Mr. Musk out of the top spot. Vanguard disclosed on April 8 that it now owns 82.4 million shares of Twitter or 10.3% of the company, according to the most recent publicly available filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. You have to report that within 10 days of your purchase, which they did. Vanguard had previously owned 67.2 million shares of Twitter, 8.4%, according to fact set. Earlier on Thursday, Musk made an offer to buy Twitter outright, saying that the platform needed to be transformed into a private business to thrive once again. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO offered to buy Twitter for more than $40 billion. After recently rejecting a seat on the company's board, Twitter shareholders saw the Prince Awelead rejected Musk bid to take over the platform. Did you folks know that Saudi Prince Awelead was a major shareholder in Twitter? Now, let's listen to some of what Elon Musk had to say earlier. At a TED Talk, what the hell is a TED Talk, Mr. Producer? None of us know, because we're basically social media illiterate. But nonetheless, here we go. Cut one go. Why make an offer? Well, I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech, where... Twitter has become the de facto town square. So it's just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they're able to speak freely within the bounds of the law. One of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people's tweets or their emphasized or de-emphasized. That action should be made apparent so that anyone can see that action has been taken. So there's no sort of behind the scenes of manipulation, either algorithmically or manually. I mean, this would be fantastic if this occurred. And I would rejoin Twitter, not that that's the end all on be all. Absolutely fantastic if this occurred. And he's telling you, I'd let you know how our algorithms work. We had a gentleman on a few years ago, remember Mr. Badoos, her respected Google, said they manipulated the algorithms to affect elections, and particularly to harm Donald Trump. You remember that? What are algorithms? They're decisions that are made, what to promote, what comes first when you go online, what you're interested in. It drives the news. It drives attention. And it does it from the left. And he's saying, no, I want people to know exactly what it is that we'd be doing and why we're doing it and what to expect. And so the anti-free speech corrupt media, the anti-free speech corrupt big tech oligarchs, including apparently this SOTI monarch, the anti-free speech academia, they don't like any of this. They have a very nice situation, complete control over what Twitter does and Facebook does and Google and all the rest of the oogles, googles, isms and whatever is. Here's more Elon Musk today, cut to go. Well, I think we would want to err on this. If in doubt, let the speech let it exist. If it's a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously, in a case where there's perhaps a lot of controversy that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet. So I'm not saying this is the, I have all the answers here. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things and have just be very cautious with permanent bans. You know, timeouts I think are better than some permanent bans. And just in general, like I said, it won't be perfect, but I think we want to really have, like I said, the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible. And a good sign as to whether there's free speech is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like. And if that is the case, then we have free speech. And it's it's damn annoying when someone you don't like says something you don't like. That is a sign of healthy functioning free speech situation. Amen. Absolutely correct. And then finally cut three, go. I mean, I could technically afford it. I had that. I had that. I had that. But it's, but one of saying is this is, this is, this is, this is not a way to sort of make money. You know, I think this is, it's just that I think this is, this could, my, my strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and, and, and, and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. But you've, you've described yourself. I don't care about the economics at all. Yeah. And he's right. He'll be paying an enormous amount of money. And you'd have to liquidate some of his other assets, perhaps in Tesla in order to purchase it. As I say, at the bottom of the hour, we'll have an expert to help walk us through this Charlie Gasparino. And what Vanguard did today, depending on how he interprets this, I may take on a lot of money. I may take all my money out of Vanguard. Look, I put my money where my mouth is. It's that simple. If Vanguard's purpose here is to tackle and block Elon Musk and to prevent him from truly creating a reformation in social media, because if he did this with Twitter, Facebook and the others would die on the vine if they don't, they don't compete on similar terms. Mark, the vine. I have to tell you something that speaks to the very core of our values as Americans.

We're giving you nothing but the best, the best of Mark LeVin. Eric Adams is the mayor of New York City as most New Yorkers are well aware. Crime has gone up since he's been mayor. Would be nice if he did a little bit more. Actually a lot more. But there's a problem that he can't control quite frankly. It's the court system. And these Soros prosecutors or Soros want to be prosecutors. It's a disaster. A disaster. But he has a good question. This is a question that we've asked here on many occasions. Cut six go. As the NYPD was searching for this suspect in the subway shooting yesterday. There were more than a dozen shootings in the city last night. And not to mention the shootings that we've seen recently of young, innocent people. Some older as well being shot on the streets of New York. How do you get a handle on this crime in the city, Mr. Mayor? About being consistent with our message. Here's my question that I put out to the city. Hey, I thought black lives matter. We are all those who stated black lives matter. Then go do an analysis of who was killed or shot last night. I was up all night speaking to my commanders in the Bronx in Brooklyn. The victims were black. Many of the shooters were black. So I asked the question that was asking me when I was a child. It's 10 a.m. 10 p.m. Do you know where your children are? Why are 16, 17 and 18 year olds out in our streets armed with guns? 12, one o'clock at night. When are we going to start asking these serious questions? If black lives matters, then the thousands of people are so under street. When Floyd was murdered, should be on the street right now, stating that the lives of these black children that are dying every night matters. It can't be ever. It would be nice. But as we now know, the institution of black lives matter was a funding scam. Promoted by corporatists. Who didn't know any better? They would take it by athletes, by the corrupt media and so many others. Who barely talk about it now. So the mayor has the guts to bring this up. Where's black lives matter? Well, let's see. They spent about $6 million for a mansion. The group in Boston, the head of the group in Boston, is being charged. All kinds of other homes have been purchased. There's an audit going on in the state of California trying to figure out where all the money went. Wow, imagine that. And I'm waiting for LeBron James. I'm waiting for all the folks at ESPN who jumped into this with two feet and promoted this organization to apologize. Where's black lives matter when it comes to black on black crime? Where's black lives matter when they should be fighting white left-wing led teachers, unions who prevent school choice in black and other minority communities? Where are they? They're nowhere. You know, they should be like the guardian angels. They should be helping to protect the streets, protect people. You want to fight for rights? You want to fight for equality? You have to have safety. You have to have your life. And then there's Joy Behar. Dhamma's a doorknob. A failure in radio. Although I don't know that Talker's magazine is aware of this. Think Talker's magazine is aware of this, Mr. Producer. Here she is on the view yesterday. I want you to hear how sophisticated and intelligent she is. And the lawyer they have on their sunny hosten lives in a huge mansion. But she's down for the revolution too. And I'm sure she's been beaten the hell out of black lives matter, hasn't she? I don't know. I don't watch these five yentas fighting with each other. What the hell? Then they bring these never-trumpers on? What do you need an AR-15 for? I don't know. What do you need a Cadillac for? What do you need a Maserati for? What do you need a mansion for? Why does Obama have five homes? I don't know. What do you need it for? Because you want it. That's good enough. Go ahead. Those that were the proudest said I've never had to use my firearm in the line. You know that so it's just a cow boy. Oh, now Sonny Hostin is speaking for police. Does she speak for you folks? She speaks for everybody. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Go ahead. Pass a bill contradicting the New York City's for state laws. Okay, okay, okay. Joy, the Supreme Court doesn't pass a bill. The Supreme Court doesn't pass a law. The Supreme Court rules on laws. They rule on cases. They apply the facts to the law. They look at the Constitution and they look at their precedent. The Supreme Court doesn't pass a bill. Now, you support the Supreme Court ruling, right? You support the Supreme Court ruling over localities and states. If it's abortion on demand and whatever it is that your agenda is. But you don't support it doing so when they might rule to uphold the Constitution because some local or state government is violating it. But in no case do they pass laws. Or do they pass bills and Sonny Hostin should have said something but she didn't. And she won't. Enjoys an idiot, which is why she never made it on radio, you know. We'll all do respect and I'll say this. Even backbenchers on talk radio are smarter than any host on MSNBC and so on. MSNBC and CNN or any host on NBC, ABC or CBS. Particularly if you have a three hour program. If you're a blithering idiot, you can't talk for three hours on the radio. Otherwise, you're a blithering idiot if people won't know it. So you got to do some hard work. Unless of course you got four thousand guests and there's two or three of you on the air at the same time. Oh my God, that's got to be easy. You can be sitting there and eating your latkes, Mr. Producer. And by the way, I want to wish you all a fantastic Easter. This weekend, I want to wish you all a fantastic Passover as we like to say. These are very, very important holidays for the first for the Christian faith, obviously, the second for the Jewish faith. These are very, very important holidays. And they have tremendous meaning. So I want to show you all the best of the holidays. I want to tell you what we have in store for you. Sunday night on Life, Liberty and Levin, and obviously if you can't watch it live, I would encourage you to go ahead and set your DVRs to record it. Record it every Sunday. It's easier. 8 p.m. Eastern time, as I say, 8 p.m. Eastern time. I've been watching Jack Keene on Fox. He's usually given three, four, five, six, seven minutes. I said, you know what, we need to listen to him. The former four-star general about what's taking place now, the Russians amassing now on the Eastern border with Ukraine. He is a fascinating man. He's got enormously high-level military contacts. And he has things to say that you're not going to believe. And Dave Rubin. Dave Rubin used to be a leftist, not anymore. And we're going to talk about Disney. We're going to talk about all the insanity that's taking place in our classrooms. And of course, we lead the show with my monologue, which is a little longer, is going to be a little longer this week because I decided to really take a close examination of Joe Biden. It was very ugly. But I'm going to take a very close examination of what he's done to our country and what a true disaster he is. So please, if you can't watch Life, Liberty, and live in live this Sunday, 8 p.m. Eastern, go ahead. Well, why you can think about it, why you're thinking about it, and set your record on the DVR, 8 p.m. Eastern on Sunday."
