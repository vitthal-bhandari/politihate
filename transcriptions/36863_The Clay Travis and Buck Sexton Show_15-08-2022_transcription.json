    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks X 10 show podcast third hour of the clay Travis bucks Sexton show gets going right now We're heading into election season. We're also heading into for what most of this country will be Cold and flu season remember we talked about that you'd see ads For different, you know, Tylenol cold and flu and yeah I've called them flu night quill all this stuff because we know that the winter season Indoors more people get more respiratory viruses the flu hits here in year out. We know this we've seen this our entire lives And so that means we're heading into the next round here of COVID ism Fauciism whatever you want to call it Latest news on that and there's so there's so much by the way I know on Friday clay was talking to you when I was out about how suddenly the CDC has changed it So that you don't have to treat the unvaccinated and vaccinated differently as a matter of policy which is Massive boxes. I knew you would love this. I know you missed when the news came out But we've spent Basically the whole time that we've been on the show together with you telling you that the pandemic of the unvaccinated statistically Was a lie telling you that you were probably going to survive the Biden administration's winner of death And then suddenly they just basically said oh yeah There's no real distinction anymore these covid shots don't really provide much protection versus natural immunity or just kind of letting it ride It's about individual decision making Which is what it should have been all along the most absurd Overreaching authoritarianism in our lifetimes in our lifetimes from our own government was on this issue Of covid vaccines nothing else comes close people talk about oh post 9-11 the patriot act, please They fired soldiers from their careers Because they wouldn't get a shot that didn't matter that they didn't need that didn't stop the spread I think we all need to hear this right now Because that's what's going on and this is exactly as we've said they would eventually The the approach they would eventually take which is just yeah, we're just going with this kind of fade We're never going to have accountability. We're never going to face up to what we did to people I remember a year ago and clay will play in a in the next segment We'll get to what you're saying about mask. We'll have some some fun on the mask situation here But a year ago on vaccines Not only were they talking about the winter of death the pandemic of the unvaccinated all this stuff But you were a call they were experts going around saying if you don't get this shot You are risking creating super bugs remember that yeah Based on nothing based on just you know wish casting that their side was the good guys The other side was a bad guys if you won't get shots one two and then three soon thereafter You were effectively a petri dish for the super kovid that was going to come turns out Everyone got kovid anyway didn't stop the spread At all because people say well for 60 days. There's a bigger antibody response Guess what? Month three Doesn't matter you get kovid because we've all been exposed to it. This is what we've seen all along So now in the uk clay this is where it is They've just approved the first country to have a speaking of moderna On the one hand mojere throwing out 30 million vaccines because they're inspired And which we paid for because nobody wants them because they're stupid because it's not going to actually save you from kovid This is whatever runs realizing, you know, and I look you and I who are the big kovid deniers There was a hit piece on me in the new york times for god six. It's an abject complete Daster What the libs did about kovid it is indefensible you and I had parents get shots and we encouraged them to get Yeah boosted because they're a high risk because of their age. Yeah I can't my parents right now if I told them hey guys go get a booster. They're laughing my face My parents said the same thing because they're like we you know everyone's gotten kovid Yeah, everyone's gotten kovid. So what are you doing? My parents just got it And we're fine. They're 78 years old Uh had gotten uh their shots, but they're like we're not going to get any more Shots and I think there are a lot of people out there who are 70 plus right that are saying Like we got to get back to normal life now Uh, let people make decisions for themselves But the fact that we allowed these companies to make tens of billions of dollars selling us buck a fundamental why Because what they told us was you get this shot. You'll neither get nor spread kovid That was the implicit cells pitch that they made if they were eligible for lawsuits Every plaintiff's lawyer in america would be lining up on the courthouse steps because they fraudulently induced Tens of millions of americans to get the kovid shot by telling them something that is 100 Percent untrue you wouldn't get or spread kovid. There's a lot of people listening to us right now buck Who bought that sales pitch who listened who did what they thought was the right choice And then they've got kovid everybody gets kovid no matter what no matter how many times you got the shot You it's not the fifth one's ain't gonna save it. So so here's where we are with the uk All right, just so everyone knows the situation Moderna has this vaccine That is a basically A split in half. So it's a double dose but half dosage They just approve us in the uk first country in the world where they're going to have an omicron specific dose And an original kovid dose just for extra protection Now i'm just wondering has anybody over america thought about how many people already have natural immunity to the original kovid How many people already have natural immunity to omicron and oclay? Here's the other problem Does anyone think that we're going to be facing Old school omicron going into this fall. It's going to be a different virus It's like these people with for all their lab coats and their fancy degrees are total morons except They made so much money and they're not morons because they got away with it. It's about the money It's about the money. You got to follow the the and this is why i'm saying Look if i if you and i were uh were politicians Instead of just trying to sit here and talk to people every day for three hours. I would be hammering home that when Republicans take back the house in the senate Certainly when they take back the house We're passing a bill and we're sending it to joe biden That takes away all of the profits that fizer and moderna and johnson and johnson Made off of these covid shots which our government gave them tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of dollars now That don't work and we're gonna we're gonna take back their profits. We're gonna or do it two options for them either Either we are going to rescind your uh ability not to be sued over this and you can take us to court and we can fight out all those documents everything else or And that would open the door to the plaintiffs and there would be hundreds of billions of dollars in liability Fizer and moderna might bankrupt over The what i believe is clear fraud based on their sales pitch for this document or for this or you voluntarily discord All of your profits Uh to the united states government and we are redistributing those profits to everyone who was fired for refusing to take your shots That's what i would be arguing I think we're gonna head into now a winter period We're not going to see these results before the election which is a shame Because i i just want every person to remember what it was like think back to one year ago Think back to 12 months On the timeline in reverse here what the democrats were saying about you For not wanting even if you wanted to get the shot yourself a lot of our earnings I'm sure got the shot a lot of people did but when they were mandating this when they were saying get fired get the shot Or you get fired yeah get the shot or you can't go to your brother's wedding get the shot Or you can't go to your daughter's Graduation get the shot or else Was the whole pitch that they had not the pitch that was the demand that they made for everybody And we should all be one you know single issue voters going into democrats deserve Complete political annihilation just for the way they politicize covid just for the double mass triple mass and 95 mass get four shots Get five shots. It's a mess But i also think what we're going to see is that you're going to have blue states clay California, New York, etc Going to be getting all that stuff again Not to the same degree but a lot of people in those places are going to be saying i have to get the new fancy Omocron slash original covid whatever shot they're going to get it And a lot of people in the rest of the country are not going to get it. You know what's going to happen We're going to see the same thing that's happened before they're going to get covid too Just like everybody else and they're never going to stop until they finally realize that they've been had They wanted us not to be honest with you There was a lot of pressure back in the summer last year buck when you and i were having allx parents and on And we were talking about this was in the days when everybody was cheerleading Remember it was a hot vac summer everybody wanted to say 2021 covid's gone forever How dare you ask questions about the fact that there are a lot of breakthrough cases That's a tiny minority of cases. That's not a big issue Remember all those things that they told you Remember how they attacked buck and i for even having the audacity of sahail Let's just talk about some of this data. I'm not that comfortable with the numbers that are coming out of israel and coming out of uh, England we were right on all of it We mean here's my here's my favorite here's my favorite here's my favorites clay February of 2021 Politi fact Coming after yours truly the biggest fact checking site on the internet Got a good photo of me.

Okay, so this is quite a ways back And they write false Um a popular facebook blog blah blah blah and they they flag this And they say they taken apart point by point open the schools clay They hit me with a false information For opening the schools They hit me with false information for wearing masks outside they wrote because coronavirus is relatively new the research on outdoor Mask is limited but so far science has shown that mass prevent virus transmission CDC published february tentla So they hit me with it. I mean they're hitting me on outdoor mask wearing as a fact check. Yeah, people are such Such horrific morons and they're so dishonest and they're so grotesque And and i'm i'm not letting this stuff go and I know for a lot of our audience We have people that lost their jobs in this audience Oh, yeah, we have people that got screamed at by lunatics because they didn't mask up their five-year-old outdoors like we were supposed to I'm not letting this go. No, and when we come back by the way, it's been one year Since uh, I spoke out of my school board with a fbi's out here radin donald trump remember They also investigated parents who spoke at their school boards about masking and crt and everything else As domestic terrorists and one of those school board meetings that received national attention Uh, joe biden even commented directly was williamson county, tennessee where I spoke I haven't listened to this since I did it. You know, we get a minute or two to speak or whatever it is We're gonna play you that audio I think just like with you buck when it came to politifact. I think everything I say you're gonna listen to and say yeah Year later. He was 100 right.

They are here's the truth our kids under 25 year old One in a million chance that they are going to die of covet They are more likely to be struck by lightning They are more likely to be struck by lightning They are more likely to die of the seasonal flu have any of you ever mandated mass for the seasonal flu Well shame on you because every kid in wyobson county schools has been under more danger from the seasonal flu every year Then they are for covet. I would tell every parent here don't let your kids wear masks I think that's the most pissed off i've ever heard you by the way I'm still angry that they made any kid first of all they shut down schools all that But the mask people the fact I want the mask people to have to all acknowledge how wrong they were Particularly for kids Because the fact and look buck Philadelphia kids are going back to school and they're making them all wear masks for two weeks to start school There are still a lot of places masking kids under five Your old is going to be wearing walking around in a mask You know what? I'm thankful you and I are going to be in salt lake city this weekend I'm thankful buck that they haven't been able to bring back masks on airplanes and at least the cdc new guidance Uh makes it Theoretically harder and harder for them to bring them back But they're making tsa agents wear them which hasn't gotten a lot of attention if you go through an airport Uh in any time Recent history you've started to see they've had to wear it's all illogical. It's all immoral It's absurd. I mean I sit here. I go back. This is the fun thing about twitter. I go back in time I've got a written record of this And literally june of 2020 not june or 2020 or june 2020 mask wearing for the healthy Outdoors in summer is absurd as many of us have been saying for weeks That was in response to a cnbc piece With all these people in the parks with masks on like I mean I've you and I've been on this train from the beginning November of 2020 of course we're going back to the your mask protects me my mask protects you Bull crap just remember people who have been insisting that wearing a mask protects you Uh, and if you if you question them you're a monster.

No risk high reward Welcome back to the clay travis bucks section show we're going to get some of your calls here in a second because of the direct report from president trump himself that they seized his passport passports Including an expired one which he added in there What we do we're talking about why does he have more than one passport even and I mean you might have as I don't know if the president has a Travels on like a diplomatic passport or has some additional level of you know that that's certainly a possibility Um, but anyway There they seize his passport and so we we know about this um But first though clay we're talking about albroul the boerla before And the as a tweeter I want you to i'm gonna read what boerla says Okay, and then you're gonna give some of your favorite responses. This is the ceo of Pfizer you all loving that shot number four everybody. Yeah, that shot number four is the good stuff, right? Not so much people here's what boerla says I would like to let you know that they have tested positive for covid 19 I am thankful to have received four doses of the Pfizer bioentech vaccine And i'm feeling well while experiencing very mild symptoms I am isolating and have started a course of pax love it. We have come very far. So in our efforts to battle this disease I am confident in a speedy recovery Uh clay what are the folks saying in response to the ceo of fizer Genuflecting to his awesome vaccines while he has covid Uh, there's some amazing responses. He's getting torched in the comments I would encourage all of you if you want a laugh and you've been so angry about the way that these biotech companies these drug companies have treated you Uh, this is uh sander van dam amazing name Uh, this is like the ceo of durex Being thankful for wearing a condom despite his wife getting pregnant and then it's Top response to that is four condoms Uh, which is really uh, I mean and then before Condom clay that really gets the job Yeah Uh, and then I mean people i'm gonna read just a few more if you already took four shots of the covid vaccine you sell What do you need to take pax loven the other drug you sell? I mean, that's a good question. That's from jake shields Um You need more a lot of people saying I think the fifth would have helped you need more boosters Uh, you should have gotten mederna instead that would not have uh have have mattered Um, and then and then here's some of the sad and truthful things buck Uh, uh, lisa kirk tweets these statements tore my family apart Uh, they believed this nonsense and excluded me from christmas because I chose not to inject this stuff I mean and this is the reality right there are a lot of people out there Who's had family members who believed hey if you don't get the covid shot You are not able to uh, you're not able to interact. I mean here Four shots you still got a breakthrough case along with a billion others and on top of that you're taking a therapeutic What exactly are the four shots doing for you again? And then the top response is they're making him billions of dollars. That's what they're doing for him Uh, then there's a a couple of graphics here that are funny buck Uh, it says fizer alarm and it shows it's a meme. It shows a woman putting in her code Uh, we got burgled three times, but thank god we had fizer alarms would have been much worse if we hadn't Because obviously they're making fun of uh, just crashed my car for the fourth time Faulty steering again only minor injuries this time Can't wait to get the same model again apart from the steering issue. It's really a great car I recommended to everyone and being the ceo of the manufacturer had no bearing on this at all And can we add in since we're on the reel here and talking about what's true what we know now The it turned into over the winter when we had a huge spike in covid Huge spike in cases lots of people dying from covid It turned into oh, no, but you won't die if you get the vah if you get the vaccine and are up to date What that really meant was if you were on shot three or shot four And you're at high risk and you're within about a 60 day protection window 60 days folks. You may have been at slightly less risk of death from covid They can't even make that claim anymore based on the data. We've seen over the last six months So we are talking Top to bottom mission failure for four five sure for more for more darina That is where we are now a year ago Even saying the vaccines might not work as well as they said Was considered grounds for deplatforming was considered grounds for you're a murderer And this was a democrat top-down talking point you are risk to your neighbors You are a risk to the people around you if you don't get this shot It was all Lies lies and everyone needs to know that i'm somewhat encouraged that they're letting everybody in the mentions t off on the Pfizer CEO And also that they are allowing people to favor it One last thing here and then we're gonna take a couple of your calls So not only are you four times vaxxed with something that doesn't work for what you sold it But on top of that you need another drug paxlovid to go through a mild flu Resign and fire your rnd and marketing teams because this is quite an ugly ad for your company utter joke karma never misses Um, so that is the responses right now to the Pfizer ceo People wanted to weigh in with a variety of topics. We've been involved in one topic buck was Donald trump saying on truth social that his passports were seized in the mar-a-Lago raid I'm saying as a lawyer who's done criminal defense. I don't ever remember seeing that Uh, without charges james from c island. You're also in criminal defense. Have you seen that happen for a non charged individual? No No, it there has been no indictment. There's been no arraignment So what is this? What does this say to you? I mean have you ever heard of somebody who is a target of an investigation just having their passport seized? Nope So what do you think is going on? I mean you think it's as strange as I do when I see that assuming that trump is accurate because obviously he's not at mar-a-Lago right now And his passports have been seized. What does it tell you? Well, I i'm speechless. They are the property of the us government But you if you take somebody's passport and prevent them from travel you've got some section 1983 violations going on Which are what I mean you're as stunned by this. I mean my read on it was They must be planning on charging him with a crime almost immediately because he's your passport because I think you're gonna flee the country Well, I don't don't trump is not about to show up in Madagascar You know asking acting like he's no one's ever heard of him before Is there anyone who would be least able to hide in the entire world than donald? I literally think he may be it may be the hardest for him to hide of any person I mean, I don't think that's probably I think he may be the most famous person on the planet But so why so why is he's this bad? I mean that's why it's either there wasn't a tight minute It's such a slant to say it tries to make him look even more guilty because what the message they're sending is he's so guilty We have to take his passports now to keep him from being able to travel all of a sudden He's in the beach on like the west coast of mehiko and he's like I am senor trumpo I have lived here my entire life, you know, I don't think that's gonna fly I don't think it is gonna be no I again I think he's the least able to hide of anybody in the entire world Andrew in miami florida your retired police chief your son was in the army. Tell us what happened My son recently got his walking papers from the army After we pay to train him as a combat medic in the army He's he's back here now. He's not happy about it, but that's the way things go over the vaccine get the covid shot No, he wouldn't he he refused the the covid shot that is correct. That's it's horrible. Can we just As much as we can we apologize on behalf of the country for it was done to your son because it's wrong Andrew and your son was serving And your son service should have been honored and it's wrong but fauci and biden and the democrats they spat on that service Yeah, they did they did there's there's no two ways about it What I want to touch on was the the thing that I found interesting that nobody's talking about Is the application for the search warrant? Um, when we I've I've written search warrants. I have authorized search warrants I've reviewed search warrants Um, and when we write a search warrant, there's two things that stand out It's a search in the night time in a no knock and you have to articulate specific things Is to why you're requesting either one of those two boxes be checked On the search warrant application. So it generally goes like an hour before and an hour after sunset determines whether or not the search can be conducted during the night time And it it looked like it was early morning. So it's going to be very very interesting Once everything is finally released and this is what I'm going to look for is to see if they apply for a no knock And if they apply for a search in the night time and it's going to be interesting to see what their Justification wants for that. I think I think they applied for a daytime search If I I looked at the warrant and I think they clicked that check that box But a question for you Uh along those lines the passport seizure In your time as a Miami police officer, did you ever seize passports? And if so, how would that process have worked? Well, I wasn't a police officer in Miami. I was a police chief in the northeast and Okay, sorry answer to your question though. Is that's okay? Now the answer to your question is unequivocally no that that never ever Just happened in the 34 years that I was in law enforcement. Were you a massachusetts guy? I was yeah, I know my massachusetts brothers and sisters when I hear them. Thanks for calling in Andrew I appreciate that Uh, that's right. Everybody is relocated to florida I thought he just had an accent and then relocated at some point in his life to florida. Can you pick out? I mean so clay So here's the thing I can pick out New york accents versus boston accents Versus western new york like buffalo accents Can you tell as a tenon c and if somebody's alabama or versus south carolina or is the regional dialect not that Differentiated I mean it is differentiated. I'm not obviously for anybody who listens as adroit in terms of picking up on uh on verbal uh accents as you are If you if you get like three moonshines out of you all the sudden clay travis I can here's what I can do and I think a lot of southerners can do it We can pick out people who were raised in the south that you would otherwise maybe never know We're raised myself like if you took me to san francisco or you took me to ciaad or you took me to minneapolis And uh, and I went out to dinner and you said okay one of the poor people has grown up in the south Find out which one it is just by listening to their their verbal tics. I would be able to pick them Yes, see I can pick new york I can pick manhattan versus long island versus statin island versus Matt stand out and long island is tough to be fair But massachusetts it's for sure. I can do pretty good on regional variations like so Hey, you're midwest uh you grew up in the mid like because nashvall's want to cross pollination You know what really throws me and people are gonna they're gonna yell at me for this Buffalo and minneapolis can't tell him apart can't tell him apart. I know people say oh, it's so different But it sounds the it's oh gosh sounds the same to me So I know working on it folks. I just got this in my email Um, it says data breach affecting 69 million users and it's from it's about neopets It's telling me that there was a massive breach and it's saying hey Were you involved in the breach?

I can't stop reading the comments to the Pfizer CEO I just I mean there are so many of you out there I know who hate twitter and you've been angry about covid If you just want to feel better about humanity the amount of wit the amount of derision the amount of Ridicule that is raining down on Pfizer CEO right now Albert Borla After he said despite four shots he tested positive for covid You will enjoy it immensely. I encourage you to go find it and if you're Following buck or eye you'll see that we've retweeted and shared That that that that comment But I was reading directly through the comments and the thing that I'll say buck that I find Encouraging is you and I both know Uh our friend Alex berycen who we're going to try to get on later this week Shared i believe it was on friday on his sub stack that the white house During the biden administration demanded that twitter suspend him because of uh his influence Combating all of these now clearly falsehoods surrounding the covid shot And you know brought buck i'm not the kind of guy to brag or draw attention to myself really more of a shrinking violet But he shared a graphic that he said the white house referenced that had his name in bold that was an mit study And then our friend ovick roy shared it too And when I happened to click on that and saw my name emboldened I was like yes I was so excited that I had been cited in that same graphic I'm going to write to mite there right about my thing Because there's this whole matrix of thousands that and there are people on there to be fair I'm like who is that? I've never even heard of this person before so I don't know what's going on here. I I I think it is hard to find somebody with a more distinguished record Of despising dr. Fauci and saying he's a lot you're upset that you weren't flagged by the IP I got a politic fact coming after me. I got a bullcrap piece in the new york times a year ago coming after me I get all these psycho libs so he's a master nier he hates fauci and then they do the mit matrix I'm on on the matrix nonsense. I think you're probably on the matrix You need to get like a detailed matrix breakdown because there's so many different I mean this matrix this graphic has so many different Places and moving parts. I bet you're on it and they just didn't bolden your name I know that's hard. You just got to get some respect you got a different respect from MIT MIT not showing the love i'm going to do my math homework more next time I promise so We've got obviously so much that we're going to be following up here on the situation of The trump marlago thing but clay apparently a guy tried to join a sorority Out in what happened here because you know they didn't have sororities at amherst which was a huge Big l there big loss for the boxer in college university of alabama the Bidweek or whatever you should have gone to spruce. Yes. Yeah. Yeah is a monster deal the sorority rush So for the first time ever they had a biological man who was attempting to become an alabama sorority girl god bless alabama roll tide The sororities all rejected him and refused to allow him as a man Identifying as a woman to become a member of any of their sororities So I got to say roll tide good for the university of alabama good for these girls standing up for themselves and not allowing a guy in because There are a lot of dudes that would try to do this otherwise and by the way, you're a straight guy You got into the right sorority. I mean there's a lot of guys out there like heck I'd like to live in a sorority house It's like the guys who end up in prison that go and flip and decide to live in them You saw that new jersey where the guy got two different women pregnant shows away wild times Clay Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth"
