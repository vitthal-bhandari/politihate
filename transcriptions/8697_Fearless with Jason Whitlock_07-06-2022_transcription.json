    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals, a new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Welcome. Welcome to Fereless with Jason Whidlock. I am Jason Whidlock, your host. Happy Tuesday to you and yours. Happy day after Monday. Happy day before hump day. Awesome. Awesome Tuesday show plan for you. It's awesome because Shamika Michelle is back with us. Shamika, welcome back. Thanks for having me. Awesome to have you here. You're just brightening up the things and make things look and feel better around here. You're actually, you know, we've moved you from the left to the right. We moved you to the infamous spot, to Uncle Jimmy's former chair. Are you ready for that assignment? I'm ready. When I was here before I put a little hudu voodoo on the seat, so I knew I'd be back. Hudu voodoo. That sounds like you're taking credit for Uncle Jimmy out pursuing other opportunities. Man, that ain't right. We got to stop before I get in any more trouble. All right, Steve Kim is going to be here the Korean Co-Sail as will Royce White. Is it going to be here? And Larry Taunton, you guys remember Larry Taunton. Larry's been on the show before, but he wrote a very interesting thread over Twitter about gun violence and mass killings. And so Larry's down in South America, but he's agreed to come on our show and we'll have a little talk and let him provide some information, some research from his years of world travel and that perspective on mass killings and mass shootings. So look forward to that toward the end of the show, but we're going to start. We're always loved to start, and that's where they fire and a fire starter. So let's get this Tuesday rolling. Historians will lament social media spread of the blocked and charged contagion. It's unprecedented negative impact on human engagement, threatens democracies, freedom, and the truth. Blocked and charged is at the root of most of the alleged social contagions, existential threats, and pandemic's corporate media rely on for ratings and relevance. Blocked and charged has been around since the beginning of time. Its origins date back to the first time a young child stuck index fingers in its ears, closed its eyes, and shouted at the top of his lungs to avoid acknowledging an upsetting idea, opinion, or piece of information. Social media developers normalize the behavior for adults. Twitter and other social media apps trained influencers to block dissenting views and then charge their dissenters with racism, homophobia, misogyny, and or transphobia. Yesterday, ESP and opinion is Sarah Spain executed the blocked and charged concept to perfection, troubled by a harmful or by a handful of Tampa Rays baseball players refusing to wear gay pride patches on their uniforms on religious grounds. Spain took to the around the horn airwaves to charge the players with bigotry. Take a listen for yourself. Pride is about inclusion, so you don't love them and you don't welcome them if you're not willing to wear the patch. And calling it a lifestyle reveals to me that you've done not even a modicum of research or understanding on this topic, which what tends to happen when a privileged class isn't affected by things. This is not just about baseball. That religious exemption BS, which is used in sport and otherwise, also allows for people to be denied health care, jobs, apartments, children, prescriptions, all sorts of rights. And so we have to stop tiptoeing around it because we're trying to protect people who are trying to be bigoted from asking for them to be exempt from it when the very people that they are bigoted against are suffering the consequences. When you say trying to be bigoted, they're trying to use religious exemptions to affect the opportunities, services, available resources for people who are LGBTQ plus and a patch on the jersey in this way. In the case of sport, no, in the case of sport, though, they're double talking if they're saying you're welcome while also saying that we don't encourage or or we disagree with it, especially when they're devout people of every single religion that also welcome and are open to people who are born. David, I got to give Tony reality credit. He made it through that word salad and asked the appropriate question like, hold on, a patch on a uniform. Does all of what you said in that word salad? My God. But you know, I believe what Spain is actually saying is that Tampa pitchers, Jason Adam, Jalen Beaks, Brooks Rayleigh, Jeffrey Springs and Ryan Thompson are using their religious faith to express bigotry. After charging the players with bigotry on TV, Spain took to Twitter to clarify her position tweeting, using your religion as a shield for ignorance and bigotry is antiquated. And it's a choice. It's a choice made of privilege. You're not affected by the policies and laws that discriminate. You're not endangered by the hatred that bubbles. She then, based on the replies of several of her dissenters, began the process of blocking people who disagreed with her anti-religion screeds, blocked and charged. It even, I got a funny story. It even happened to one of our producers here, David Reed. He tweeted at Sarah Spain, you know, she put out something about how the Bible's antiquated and it isn't up to date with modern loving relationships. And David was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, modern, modern loving relationships aren't up to speed with the Bible. And immediately, within minutes, she blocked David's from her Twitter feed. My God. Listen, blocked and charged is the preferred tactic of corporate media. It's the nuclear option from mute and dispute. The negative impact on American culture cannot be denied. Social media has trained us to avoid engagement with people we disagree with and to never settle an argument, block, charge and move on. The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh produced a provocative, thoughtful and entertaining documentary on the transgender issue. Most of the legacy media are refusing to review the doc or interview Walsh. The Daily Wire published a story about the vitriolic rejection emails it has received from movie critics. Here's an example of one. Hard, effing past. I won't give that transphobic bigot a platform on my site. Never email me again. Blocked and charged. That's what everyone's doing. This is a social media contagion that has polluted our entire society for years. I didn't have one friend who cared that I was politically agnostic and that my worldview was biblically conservative. I've never voted. No one cared. But in recent years, I've lost numerous friends because I don't hate Trump or his supporters. I don't hate Obama or his supporters. I don't like policies and customs that contradict my biblically conservative worldview. I don't even hate Joe Biden. I don't like the policies, the high gas prices, the inflation, the demonization of working class Trump supporters, the condescending attitude toward black people, the persecution of January 6th protesters. Years ago, before social media trained adults to act like children, I was a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News. My biblical worldview wasn't controversial and dangerous. I was friends and co-workers with atheists. Blocked and charged, interpreted, interrupted lifelong friendships, CNN and MSNBC view me as problematic and will never have me on their air again. I don't even vote. The politician I criticize the most and most viciously was Sarah Palin, a Republican, the right-wing AOC. I've been blocked and charged by the left. This isn't a personal wine. I've never sought the approval of the mainstream establishment. I'm whining because the blocked and charged contagion is destroying America. It's dividing us. We no longer exchange ideas. We're locked in silos constructed by the social media matrix. As long as that's the case, our destruction is inevitable. Big tech. They're responsible for killing America. All right, that's my fire. What do you think of my fire, Shameka? I totally agree. I'm a little bit angry today, so I'm just waiting for you to give me to go ahead. On this or something else? All of it. I'm a little bit upset that we even have to define what a woman is and also because I may have to agree with you from yesterday. I get it. People don't like agreeing with me. Steve Kim, the Korean co-sell. Let's bring Steve into the conversation. Steve, Sarah Spain is calling the Tampa Ray players bigots because their religious beliefs make them not want to put on a gay pride patch. I just don't... Would you wear a gluttony patch if I asked you to and say, you know, put Big Macs all over yourself? Don't you have the right to be like, hey, man, I don't have a problem with that. I know a lot of people that don't have a problem with McDonald's, but they just don't eat it. They don't put McDonald's patches on their working uniforms or whatever. They don't like fast food. That's perfectly fine. These guys have a right to be like, hey, man, I don't have a problem with gay people, but I'm not going to cape up for. Well, first of all, good afternoon, Jason and Shameka. I want to make this point. You didn't even put up the most eye-opening thing she tweeted yesterday, which was put up by Bobby Borac, your old colleague over there at Outkick, where she basically tried to make a comparison between young kids and drag being paraded out there and an adult cheerleader, I believe, for the Dallas Cowboys, as of age and consent and maturity, it doesn't matter. Sarah R. Kelly Spain. I would have kept that tweet on the down low, but that's the whole thing though. I believe that this whole movement, the LGBTQIA has become a religion within itself. I think it goes far beyond just a sexual identity or a gender identity. And just think about this. Let's say, and this would never happen in modern day America, there was a Christianity month. And if you asked a group of players who were either Buddhist or Muslim or Hindu to or across, if any of those players said, you know what, that's not my religion. I'd rather just respectfully sit out. People what I believe nowadays would say, you know what, we will respect your wishes and you don't have to even participate, but we understand they certainly would not be branded as bigots or prejudiced or racist. The last point I want to make on this, the very same people excoriating the Tampa Bay Rays players for making their stand or probably in mass, absolutely screaming from the top of their lungs that men like Colin Kaepernick had the right to protest and take a knee. Well, if this is their version of taking a knee, why don't they have the ability to then exercise their first amendment rights? I don't even think they understand their own hypocrisy here. You made some excellent points. I want to start with the one about religious differences. And there are a lot of people that don't participate in Christmas activities. And no one has a problem with them. And no one thinks they're weird, no one thinks that they've done something wrong. We have that right. And so I just want to say that, but you're also right. And I want to get Shamika's take on this. I did see the analogy of drag queens dancing for kids and her saying that, oh, this is no different than NFL cheerleaders. And, and, you know, kids go to football games and they see the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders dancing or cheerleaders dancing. And by the way, we're soon going to be seen with the Carolina Panthers, a transgender cheerleader, as well. And this is progress in the NFL. But I don't, what's the, I don't understand the analogy between Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders at a football game. And I know they're provocatively dressed. But the kids aren't tucking dollars. They're not there. 100 feet. I don't know, 300 feet, depending on where your seats are away from the cheerleaders, as opposed to drag queens. And help me, help me make it make sense. It doesn't make sense. There is nothing that we can say to actually make her analogy make sense. And when I read what you called a word salad, I was so upset. It made me think that I wish a man in 1848 would have stood up to his wife when she said, I'm going to Seneca Falls. I wish she would have said, no, you're going to sit right here. You're not going to say a word. As a matter of fact, you're going to get in this kitchen and make me a sandwich because that's when it all started. And I wish she would have stood up to her then. We wouldn't be hearing women spout this foolishness today. And when she called them bigots, Jason, I think that was the part for me that made me the most angry because part of the definition for bigot is to be unreasonably attached to a belief. So you're going to say that someone who professes Christ is unreasonably, unreasonably attached to a belief. Someone who believed that Jesus died on the cross, rose on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father. From thence he shall come to judge, both the quick and the dead is unreasonably attached. I think taking the rainbow and perverting it, something that was meant to be a covenant between God and his people that he would never flood the earth again, perverting that, I think that's an unreasonable attachment to a belief. But I don't go around snatching down rainbows or, you know, I let them do what they do. And I don't call them bigots because I disagree with what they believe. So I just felt like that was an attack against Christianity and I didn't appreciate it. That part, calling them out like that made me angry. And so Steve piggybacking off of Shemika in this entire conversation and even bringing the whole the Matt Walsh conversation into it and what is a woman documentary and Matt has tweeted about how most of the media won't engage with him, won't review his documentary. This goes back to what I've been saying the past 18 months to two years is that the left seems to have a hard time defending its positions and nothing is harder to defend than this whole gender issue that they drummed up. And so the strategy is to not engage. And you can see it in all walks of life in terms of they instead of CNN or MSNBC having a guest on that will passionately and logically defend the Second Amendment. They'll just bring on people who take a dump on it and pretend like there isn't another side to the argument or just mock the other side of the argument amongst a little small group of themselves. And so I've been saying the reason they've adopted this strategy, block and charge, is because they can't defend their positions and they know it. So they stuck fingers in the ears and closed their eyes and just shout to the top of their lungs. Well, Jason, you know what Matt Walsh should do and the producers? They ought to take all of those emails and actually print it up in bold letters and use it on the movie poster. I don't think there's a greater endorsement of that production and then those misses. Those are actually better than four star reviews. It's like, wait a minute, that person said this about that. I want to go see it even more. And the other thing is, I think this is really not just an attack on Christianity. I think it's an attack on common sense. Just think about the conflating of the word or how they're distorting the word bigot. If you were a parent, and I don't mean CRT, but if you were a parent that didn't want your children to go to, let's say, a civil rights museum or something honoring Dr. Martin Luther King or anything that really happened in the 60s in an educationally honest way, I would be like, why wouldn't you want your kid to do that? Why wouldn't you want to send your children to actually see the American history of how we were shaped? But if a parent, and so you can say, all right, well, they're they're bigots. But if a parent then says, well, that drag show where those are going to be eight year old kids twerking and working a poll and you're going to be putting dollar bills into RuPaul's cousins. Bikini? Yeah, I'm good with that. Well, you're a bigot. Oh, wait a minute. Really? Is it really the same thing? That's where I think that Sarah House of Spain really lost me. And the reaction that she got, look, as someone that has blocked more people than Orlando Pace and Anthony Munoz, myself, what did she expect? And another thing I want to point out, I have to give Tony reality credit because he pushed back as much as he could. I agree with you, Jason, but I will say this as someone that was at ESPN, and I was there a little bit longer than you, I wasn't as high up on the totem pole. But I was right there during the epicenter of 2020 when everything went haywire. I know for a fact, given my own experiences, that if you had a dissenting opinion on such issues as the LGBTQ Black Lives Matter or anything else or white supremacy, you were not even allowed to retweet anything in opposition of it. You weren't allowed to retweet anything that supported your particular view because you'd be asked to take that down. And you certainly could not come on a show of that nature like around the horn and actually expiles those views. That's the reality of what's going on right now at the Disney Run ESPN. All right, let me take care of some business. This is not a commercial. This is not another endorsement. This is Life for Death. I'm Jason Whitlock and here at The Blaze, we're building a village of Blaze babies with the goal of rescuing 50,000 babies from abortion. Let me tell you a little bit about preborn and how they have rescued over 188,000 babies lives. When a woman under the pressure to abort her baby meets that baby and hears the precious heartbeat, it's a game changer because 80% of the time she will choose life. Preborn clinics are located in the highest abortion areas in the country, standing strong for mothers in crisis and introducing them to the beautiful life growing inside of them. Would you join us in rescuing preborn babies? It's one of the most important things you can do helping to preserve these precious lives. One ultrasound is just $28 or you can sponsor five ultrasounds for $140 and save five babies lives. All gives her tax deductible to donate securely called pound 250 and say the key word baby. That's pound 250 key word baby or go to preborn.com slash fearless. That's preborn.com slash fearless. Let's do it. Let's save babies lives. Let's take care of that business. Steve, I want to bring you back and move on to some other topics in the sports world. Steve, I don't know if you saw this. Well, I know you saw it because you see everything. Steve Kerr, your man Steve Kerr and Emia Duko of the Boston Celtics, they led their teams in wearing t-shirts that said end gun violence. And from what I understand when people saw those t-shirts in game two, just people all over the country just threw their guns away. The crypts and the bloods brought out a peace pipe and sat down and just ended their feud. People on the south side of Chicago, west side of Chicago just, what do we got these? What are we shooting each other for? Didn't you see those t-shirts? The problems fix. These t-shirts have done it and so I just want to give you the opportunity to celebrate the Celtics and the Warriors for ending gun violence. Yeah, even the Hatfield and McCoy's put away their rifles. Here's the thing that really bothers me about Steve Kerr doing this. It is such virtue signaling and I was on a chat Sunday night hosted by Auk Nation and we had a discussion over this on that very same weekend. There was a huge gathering that turned violent in Philadelphia. Something that happens, not every day but happens often and this point was brought up by all of us because again, is this about all gun violence or just certain gun violence that could be politicized? But look at the landscape of America and you look at the actual crime rates and the murder rates that are at the hands of guns. Most of them were often illegal and as MASH-TRADE explained to you a couple of days ago, a lot of these cities that have these high homicide rates with guns are actually gun-free zones in theory. But look at Philadelphia, the Evan NBA team, the Baltimore DC area, the Evan NBA team, Los Angeles, we have two LA NBA franchises out here. Memphis has an NBA franchise. New Orleans has an NBA franchise. Minnesota has an NBA franchise. They all have various rates of homicides, violent crimes with guns. Would Steve Kerr ever go into those cities with the shirt saying, guys, we got to end this gun violence, you know, self-destruction, we're headed for self-destruction. Let's just turn it our firearms. Let's sing kumbaya. Oh, it's that other song. We're all in the same gang. He wouldn't do it. This is just grandstanding. It is typical Steve Kerr. I don't know what else to say other than the fact that it's an empty gesture. This is basically the newish hashtag that he's wearing for about a week. I actually think they're going to wear it longer than a week because this whole gun violence thing is the new COVID, is the new Black Lives Matter. It's the new thing the media is going to focus on and spotlight. And so any time they can't, again, I'm not even saying they should ignore it. I'm not. When 21 people get killed and you've all the text, of course, it's a major story. But now the media is going out of its way to folk. And they all just want to, most of them all want to just point to the same problem. It's the guns. It's never culture. It's never gangs. And that's what I'm looking at these guys in gun violence. How about in-game culture? How about in the violent culture that solves all conflicts with more violence? And again, particularly for these Black NBA players that love to pretend like professional athletes love to pretend like they're from the streets, they know what's going on in the communities where they say they're from. And they know they're not sitting around going, oh, there's a gun. Let me run. They're saying, oh, there's a Bay Bay and he's a member of the Cribs and let me run because this dude is crazy. But never talk about it. These big masculine, athletic men that are so bold, they want to talk about things that can't talk back and will never show up on their door. Right. And that bothers me so much. I'm starting to wish that NBA stood for no bitch-assness because it appears that they are just a bunch of puppets and they have the Democrats have their hand up there behind and just animating them. Whenever they have something that they want to do, that's when the NBA stands up. And it really irritates me, like you said, because these are Black athletes. You know what is happening in inner cities, in the Black communities. I've never seen them speak out mostly on any topic until the media says, this is the topic of the time. This is when you say something. Now that the Democrats are on this big gun grab, now we want to talk about gun violence. When we've had people dying in our communities for years and they haven't pushed this. And so that really irritates me and I'm sick of them just being puppets for the Democrat party. I'm going to hammer the point and I want to be careful because you know I've long been known as a critic of Serena Williams. Serena and Venus put out that movie King Richard about their father and I'm very reluctant to criticize him now because it's one of the greatest movies I ever saw and it just I love Venus and Serena and the way they represented their dad. But and again so this is just I want to put the criticism in context, love them because of the movie, really love Venus, and don't have anything really negative to say. But what I would like to say is like Serena represents a problem I have with these athletes in terms of she had a sister killed by gang violence and will never talk on it. Never touch her. You're should be the leader of like coming from LA and coming from what she experienced as what her dad experienced they showed you in the movie. It's like hey we need to stop gun violence. We need to stop I mean a gang violence. Should be it but but we instead have gone the other direction and again I'm trying it's just like when she crypt walked at Wimbledon. I was like wow you got a sister killed by gang violence and you crypt walk at Wimbledon and then let me leave the William sisters out of it because there's a lot of professional athletes particularly black ones in football and basketball that love to talk about oh man my boy from high school my cousin Ray Ray they all they got shot up and killed and I saw this and I grew up in this name but never never once just come out and say hey we have a gang culture problem it's celebrated in music it's why here's one of the things this is just there it's easy for me to say now I'm 55 but I'm old but when I was younger and used to go to clubs I was so bothered by the fact that I was man anytime we go to a club a black one we got to go through a metal detector we got to get patted down to make sure we're not bringing guns in here and then if you went to a predominantly white club you didn't have to go through a metal detector you didn't have to go through getting patted down and and I was just like you can't just say that oh that's because that's in a poor area right it's in a poor culture area a culture that has been broken down but I'm sorry I've been poor right it didn't make me want to grab a gun it didn't make me want to join a gang it didn't you know and and so I just the athletes lack of willingness to address what is really going on and get caught up in this social media virtue signaling drives me crazy and these t-shirts or another example go ahead Jason and I'm making a point here yeah look they're from the streets but now they live in a gated suburb that is the reality that is part of the American dream that they are exercising which is certainly fine but you know it's interesting you talk about gun violence want to dream on greens closest teammates at Michigan State a young man by the name of Adrian Payne had a short stint in the NBA was killed there hasn't been that much coverage of it we talked about it a couple weeks ago I found it interesting that during the playoffs when the Miami Heat were still in it they put up this public service announcement about Uvalde and let's stop gun violence this and this meanwhile for the death of a former NBA player I maybe I don't follow these guys maybe I don't follow the league closely which I certainly don't has there been that much outrage over his murder there really hasn't been and look anytime and these are what they call context clues anytime you hear the phrase senseless violence shots rang out you know for a fact well they're not going to politicize that one those are very coded phrases that tell you exactly what happened and who was involved also it bothers me when they say things like we don't have to speak out that much on violence in the community because those people get arrested and go to prison that is not always true when it comes to yes when it comes to gang violence they will kill one side you know kill somebody from one side nobody speaks out because snitches get stitches then they retaliate those are a lot of deaths that go unsolved and they wreak have it in these communities and nobody has to pay for it so this lie that oh we only speak out when it's like a white person that does it because they we want to make sure they're charged make sure the people in your neighborhoods are paying for what's happening I'm gonna have to double check myself I'm on the say this and I'm not I've read it previously but I don't I could be I thought I read that 80% of murders in Detroit go unsolved and the clearance rate on murder in all of these major cities hovers mostly around 50% wow and and so that's just a lie that you know oh yeah the guys that do x y and z they all go to jail it's the Derek Chauvin's they get it it's a lie and it but again it's why they don't debate this stuff they talk in groups amongst themselves where there's agreement and everyone's agreed on the lie I want to move on to one more topic that I think both of you all will find interesting David Wiegle I believe is the name a political reporter for the Washington Post he's been suspended for a month without pay for retweeting a joke that and I want to read the joke a youtuber said tweeted out got youtuber's name is cam Harless every girl is bi you just have to figure out if it's polar or sexual that's the tweet the guy from the Washington Post retweeted it they've suspended him for a month without pay a month without pay is what 8% of his salary you know close to 10% of his salary it's and and there's a female reporter I believe her name's Felicia Samesz she drove all of this she started going after her and she works at the Washington Post as well she started going after this guy and pushed this issue and blew it up into more than what it was look I know I'm the last guy you know my tweeting history with Jeremy Len and I don't have an appropriate filter for jokes and things like that but a month without pay for a joke he didn't crack and retweeting it her her argument the woman that pushed this is that it's something that what does she say that about it creates an environment it's a confusing message about what the post values are and then women will see this this whole thing that women are locked to twitter and and based on who tweets out what is how women all across the world and DC feel about themselves and about the Washington Post because one guy retweeted someone else's joke that's making women all over Washington Post terrible place to work the Washington Post has the wrong values we got to sit this dude we got to deny this guy pay for a month. Jason couple plans you're number one. Go ahead Steve. Yeah first of all that was a fine joke I personally thought it was humorous but this if I was the editor I would have said bye Felicia and I would have told Dave Dave you're a white guy let's be careful here we kind of know the atmosphere of today but think about this on a more serious note about the Washington Post they are taking much harsher disciplinary action on that gentleman for retweeting one joke that is relatively harmless as opposed to Taylor Lorenz who literally needs an editor before during and most alarming after she publishes multiple lies think about it retweeting a joke gets you a month off without getting paid meanwhile Taylor Lorenz who you literally have to have a digital whiteout because she just flat out lies and just has factual errors in her stories there's no punishment that says all that tells you everything you need to know about the post. Well we don't know about her sexual but I would say from just the way she handled this we out go with the polar part because it definitely seemed like she's a little emotionally unstable. She has sued the Washington Post previously it got tossed but she said that her editors had mistreated and discriminated against her because they wouldn't let her cover sexual harassment issues because she had been so public in her complaints about being sexually assaulted they felt like she wouldn't couldn't be objective and they wanted to leave her out of the coverage of Brett Kavanaugh and other things and so she sued the post said that was a discriminatory policy and cost her money and it got thrown out or whatever but yeah she's a little bit unstable in my view. All right let's move to back to Sarah Spain let's give her an approval already. All right Sarah Spain here this will be interesting if any of us break out of the 30s or even the 20s here Sarah Spain job performance she's an opinionist for ESPN she's a panelist on around the horn and appears on I think maybe a couple of podcasts or no she's got a radio show Spain and somebody else on ESPN as well I'm going to give her a five in job performance just because you know she's kept a job at ESPN for a long time and she's got a radio show she's on around the horn you know she's put a little work in so I'll give her a five in job performance. Shemika I gave her a zero because what these men do on the baseball field I don't even understand why it concerns her so I gave her a zero I thought that was none of her business and that's where she gets zero. All right uh Steve well I think Shemika's being a little bit harsh I gave her a one she just you know she's okay she's crafted her career at ESPN but she you know most of these ESPN personalities nowadays as compared to the 90s getting me and you've talked about it if they were Baskin Robbins it'd be 31 scoops of vanilla they y'all just kind of blend in they don't none of them stand out so I just give her a one. Mmm character and you know I think she I'm gonna still align from Jimmy I think she's quite the character uh and look I think for her set of beliefs she has a little character for her set of beliefs and so I'll give her a six in character and uh Steve I'm gonna let you follow in after me that with your your thoughts on character. You know the character thing is interesting I remember several months back uh when Aaron Rodgers talked about being immunized and Sarah Spain went on this rant about how dishonest he was he was pitting people in danger that how could he do this and she literally like had this vitriol for Aaron Rodgers and it was right around the same time Henry Ruggs unfortunately ended his career and altered several lives by killing someone with the DUI and she had one tweet and she says oh that's awful and I was like what excuse me so anyway just for that I'm gonna give her a one. Mmm uh Samika I gave her a zero uh because I did not like the fact that she called Christian men bigots I didn't like that so she gets a zero from me. So right now if I do the math carry the one right now on your screen you have her at a zero if I can if my math is correct uh authenticity uh you know for her and what she's doing her job is to be woke on ESPN I think she's you know as woke as woke can be and as authentic as woke can be so I give her a two in authenticity uh Steve. You know what I kind of agree with you except I'm gonna give her a 20 she authentically believes what she spews every day I give her credit look I respect her right to have an opinion that is 180 degrees from you and I and Shemeka and she pushes it every day she's made a nice living and she authentically believes herself so I gotta give her a 20. I gave her a zero because I fed up with women I made a tweet yesterday that said if women hadn't spent in the last 60 years trying to be men we could have more guarded what it means to be a woman so any woman that is not guarding what it actually means the fact that God created us for a certain purpose in this earth realm if you are not guarding that you're not authentic to me zero. So if I carry the one and if I keep uh yeah drop that zero. Uh in fact this is where I do think I gotta give her some credit I don't know if you guys know this or Steve if you remember this this may be news to you but Sarah Spain's media career actually started when she auctioned herself off uh I think for Super Bowl tickets or World Series tickets or some sporting event she auctioned herself off to men to take her to a sporting event and so and at that time you know it was a pretty good auction because she's got quite a pair of cans that attracted you know some auctioners and so uh I'm gonna give her an 11 and it factor because you know still got the cans and you know at one point you know she saw herself as a sex symbol worthy of being auctioned off. Hmm Steve. Okay Jason I'm surprised you didn't give her a 36d okay look look she's just another ESPN personality and that's kind of nameless and faceless with me. She says some stuff once through all that'll pop up on my timeline or Bobby Burrackle right about her I gave her a five she is what she is she doesn't really move the needle for me one way or the other. Mmm uh she made it. I gave her a five because that's the same score I would give her on a scale of one to ten and I only gave her a five because apparently somebody at ESPN thinks she's bangable and gave her a job but I tend to lean with Sir Mixalot even though she's heavy up top Sir Mixalot said my anaconda don't want none unless you got bun ton. I don't do the top heavy she looks like a little linebacker to me her neck is kind of thick like a football player. Five. Wow so she's got back huh wow I'm glad she said it Jason. I mean yeah wow well she went with the rap reference she stepped on your toes she went with the rap ring to the reference you made one earlier. All right so I've got Sarah Spain at a 24 Steve has her at a 27. Shamika if I do the math here is zero plus zero plus zero plus five you got her at a five. We all have her at a dumpster fire so that's it and that's all Steve good job kept you longer than I expected. I got to keep it moving. Royce White. It's my obligation on hate discrimination isn't a don't hands for freedom. All right let's roll out to Minneapolis and bring in Royce White because I want to continue our discussion of what is a woman the Mad Walsh documentary on the transgender issue we had a long conversation about it yesterday and I figured Royce would be a great way to get back at the topic. I know he would have something original say Royce welcome back to the show. My argument yesterday and remains that I thought the documentary needed 10 15 minutes of a biblical perspective to put it in proper context and kind of show what the whole transgender issue is really about but other than that I really can't complain I thought it was compelling entertaining important documentary what was your take. Well I mean I think that the question of Christianity that you pose in your column is really the central or needs to be the central focus today in America and you know there's so much talk about life, death, freedom, humanity and government behind the scenes over on the Republican side there is a question about and to what extent God is enumerating the United States Constitution and I think a better question and a much simpler question is what society benefit from more God or less God I think the obvious answer to that question is more God. Now I don't think that I talk a lot about national honor I don't think that national honor needs to be an absolutist view towards our founding fathers of the United States Constitution it just can't be a nihilist view like the communists and globalists and Satanist one and that's largely what has been you know spread across society or America for the last 60 years as a nihilist view towards the ideas and values of America and you know in my opinion I would say that the people on the right the people who believe in America the people who believe in God the people who believe in tradition the people who believe in conserving what is true and good should strive to clarify have the moral clarity and have the confidence to do what the Constitution was intended to do and that's be a self-perfecting document and I think that the perfection that can be had is to go back to God and institute more God. And so one of the arguments I've made yesterday and will continue to make today is that this belief that well we got to get Republicans in power that'll fix it and and I'm like I'm not so sure I don't believe that I believe Christians in a biblical worldview needs to be placed back in power because politics force you to bend to whatever culture is in vogue at that time and so I argued yesterday and I say it again today when Bill Maher pointed out that 20 percent of this latest generation of young people are identifying as LGBTQ and they're eventually they're going to be a voting constituency and Republicans are going to lick their finger put them in the air and say whoop if there's far more LGBT people voting then we need to make sure our policies and platform are in line with them and and so they're just going to bend and I think we already see it. You know political people bending to that will or that wind and so the only salvation or people of religious faith is it's the only solution and that's why again this is a spiritual problem not a political problem. Yeah I think one of the main problems one of the main downfalls I've seen so far being involved in Republican politics is you know this misuse of the separation of church and state and the separation of church and state in large part is not seen through the proper historical context. The historical context is that if there is one complaint if there is one flaw fatal flaw you could argue in the United States Constitution or our founding documents it's that our founding fathers you know exhibited moral fatigue and not being more explicit about God's centrality and the ideas and and obviously the historical pressure that that they were under at the time is is well documented as well you know having having just experienced a tyrannical king monarch and and who had used not only his political power but but tied to a tyrannical Anglican church that was most of the reason why they didn't or why they weren't more explicit in discussing God or making God a central thing and that moral fatigue that gap of moral fatigue left the door cracked for moral hazard to build from then till now and Satan has walked right through that sliver and crack in the door and so you know all of these all of these historical questions now exposed fact or are used often to justify that we should throw the Constitution out or we should bend the need to amendments of the Constitution and the Republicans you know capitulate to that many ways as well you see that in the gun debate where you know you'll have Republican senators or people who are more moderate say oh well you know we should keep our AR-15s because they're the best way to hunt a raccoon it's like no we need our AR-15s because radical left tyranny and authoritarianism is on the move and that's a much more sound reason and more constitutional basis for the right to bear arms so you know there's a huge huge Republican capitulation to the attack on on America's foundation look Royce I think one thing that people have misconstrued about the founding documents and the founding fathers is that and it's clear as day I need to do some more research on this but to me it's clear as day everything that they did was trying to protect the people from the government and so this whole separation of church and state people have misconstrued it as like protecting the government from the church and they were actually trying to protect the church from the government and that's why that's what that is actually about and if you just everything all the systems and the they put in place and the word were about and why again they want you to have the right to bear arms is because they know the danger of the government and they want you at all times to be able to protect yourself and protect these religious institutions from the government yeah self governance I mean self governance being the key to freedom is the central idea and and that's your freedom is ultimately God given and and I mean I think that is that is pretty clear in the founding documents and even in the constitution but but again the founding fathers having having capitulated to the political pressures of their time and not mentioning God in an explicit way has great great consequence you know that we see playing out today and and really you know most of these people who argue against the constitution or that America is just a symbol of white supremacy or whatever other argument they make they they often reference the fear of going or becoming subject to a theocracy and that the right wing or the conservatives or the Christians in this country just want a theocracy you hear the young Turks they mentioned that or you know people in the far left AOC Ilhan Omar my opponent oh we we can't have a theocracy but in all actuality this country has become an anti-God theocracy we've become a theocracy of scientism and that that can be said on the global scale as well and there is nowhere in history where theocracy has yielded the type of chaos violence and murder that this scientific anti-God theocracy has I don't care if you talk about the inquisition the crusades any of the the genocides or wars in the middle age none of them have had the chaos and death toll of the anti-God the aquacies and I count Nazi Germany as an anti-God theocracy I count Stalinist Russia as an anti-God theocracy I count Mao China as an anti-God theocracy and ultimately I count the 40 to 50 million abortions per year as the product of a scientific anti-God theocracy and again if we have no sanctity of life then then we can't have any any real concept or or adherence to an idea of human rights Hey I want to move you on to a slightly lighter topic just slightly lighter Sarah Spain ESP and calling Tampa Ray Tampa Tampa Bay Rays baseball players bigots because they would not wear gay pride patches on their uniform your thoughts yeah well I'm a bigot then I'm not wearing any gay pride patches in any in any regard you know I'm from the Twin Cities and we have one of the biggest LGBTQ citizen you know communities in the entire country I think statistically it's like San Francisco and then Minneapolis and so I grew up around plenty of people who are LGBTQ this isn't a question of whether or not the LGBTQ community has faced any persecution in the past because we know that they have but many groups have faced persecution this isn't a question about LGBTQ citizens and should they have American rights rights as American citizens this is a question of should the LGBTQ be the central focus of all of our political attention and all of our political you know you know all of our political emphasis you know and and my answer and I think even some people who are in the LGBTQ who are honest will say no no this thing is getting out of hand and I'm actually starting to get feedback now that I'm campaigning on the ground for people who are LGBTQ who think that the political powers that be are are using the LGBTQ circumstance to push a political agenda and and I would tend to agree that the democrat platform is exploiting the LGBTQ actually they're using the LGBTQ as a human shield to say here is this marginalized group of people who you can't really identify or pin down as a demographic and we can use them as the ultimate scapegoat or leverage to push any policies that we want and most of them end up being anti-god in nature so you know that do I support the LGBTQ having rights yeah I think those rights are codified in the American United States Constitution all of these these ploys to use the LGBTQ to destroy the Constitution or go and get further rights like having a gay nightclub here in Duluth Minnesota and and having young grade school kids brought to a gay nightclub for a drag stripper show and and have white liberal moms hand out one dollar bills or money for the kids to hand to a drag queen stripper is way beyond the scope of a basic fight for LGBTQ rights and anybody who doesn't understand that or can't admit that they're in on it number one and they're they're kind of outing themselves as Satanists because that's satanic. Totally agree I think for me I've seen it coming I've been saying it for 10 years and I saw it just in popular culture just in the TV shows that I was watching it's like you couldn't watch a TV show that that storyline was not injected into into it even I'm rewatching the sopranos right now and where it went from season one to in season five or six where they pivot to the fat dude Vito uh being Johnny cakes and being gay there's no signs of that like in season four or five he's trying to get with Christopher's girlfriend Adriana and then all of a sudden on a dime and Edict came down from Hollywood hey the LGBT has to be in all these storylines next thing you know the fat Vito he's gay he's at gay nightclubs he's run off and blah blah blah and and just in every show it's like that narrative that has to be placed there and so pop culture uh actually is is like how you foreshadow what's going to go on in the rest of culture and so I'm not surprised that all of our attention is is focused on 5% 5% of the population gets 70% of the conversation not surprising to me right it's like an over correction I think the same thing happened with women's rights like of course nobody wanted women to be to be beat and they wanted them to have a voice but the infeminism came and it was a over correction and I think that's the same thing that's happened you know of course like Roy said there are some you know gay people who have been oppressed but what we're doing now to me is an over correction and I'm doing self-reflection as I listen to you to talk and I'm trying to figure out where I have been and and not really stood my ground in certain areas and today going forward I'm gonna I'm not saying all those alphabets I'm gonna say maybe the L and the G because if you be you still L or G and if you T you not real so I'm that's gonna be my step to to stop bending over for them L and G that's all you getting from me Roy I'll give you a final thought here and then we'll let you go Yeah well I think that the telltale sign of the contradiction in the entire LGBTQ plus movement argument push for policy push for influence on on federal funding and policy is uniquely tied to the the gun debate or the separation of church and state because fundamentally if you're gonna argue that that let's say violent video games have an impact culturally on young people's minds psychologically that could precursor them being violent in the future as adults or as as teenagers or if you're gonna say that the public schools allowing God to be in in the public schools creates the the circumstance for bigoted religious views then the same thing surely could be said of of putting LGBTQ plus culture in the schools for young people right I mean I don't even get where that that hypocrisy is allowed to be promoted through the mainstream if if God can't be in our public schools because it's too harmful or influential or impactful on a young person's mind and they should have that choice then then the same should definitely be true of the LGBTQ and and their beliefs and ideologies but they make the claim that and I've said this before that the scientific method is one of the four heresies of the west they make the claim that that being gay or lesbian or whatever else is is a natural thing and that it's not cultural so the left view of the world mostly is that anything we don't believe in is a is a social construct anything that we do believe in is the natural order the problem is they have the natural order completely backwards hmm great stuff thank you Royce should be got want to make a final point with you is when I think about the the over correction deal and and I started thinking about pop culture and the messaging in all the movies and tv shows the other thing that really I struggle with is for every story that involves black people or in tv movies or whatever it seems like it just goes overboard on the race angle like our whole existence is built around our interaction with white people and there are our negative interaction with white people and that uh that our whole lives are defined by racism right and I'm just I'm 55 and I've engaged with a lot of white people through athletics through going to school work environment what my engagement with them doesn't define my life right it it's there have been occasional issues but for the if if someone went and examined my life it just hasn't been built around racism or my experiences with racism and that's like I'll see people say oh god I had this horrible experience with police and and it was so racist and blah blah as if this was a day-to-day thing they were dealing with and as if they only had one experience with police because again I've said it many times I'm a speeder I've had 30 40 engagement with police pulling me over in my lifetime I've had one bad experience right and so that one and it was bad and I didn't like it or whatever but what about the other 30 right and then and that's them pulling me over and then I got friends that are police officers I just I run into police officers at while I'm out socializing so I've had thousands of engagement with police virtually none of them negative but every movie or every TV show that we have some kind of major role in it makes us believe that our whole life is built around our interactions with white people and it's just not true that's not true and another thing that bothers me is that how black people feel like you're supposed to have some type of alliance simply based on race or any other person simply based on race that bothers me and like let me let me say this I get your point but I almost understand that based on history based on look when they got signs up say black people can't drink in this water fountain can't shop in this store blah blah that history built an alliance slavery built an alliance among black people but what what I don't like is that we're that the real alliance that we have isn't really about skin color it's about oppression that's our alliance and that's why we're all looking for examples you know what ties us together you had a bad experience with police too didn't you white you can't you don't like white people either do you right white people don't like you either that's the alliance is really not skin color at this point and again that's why you'll take Lebron James is a billionaire but he went out of his way to come up with some story that he faced racial discrimination so that he could feel more black and connected to other black people again that's what I find preposterous the fact that a police because if I guarantee you Christian he's young one of our producers but at some point he's going to have a bad experience with police because police are kind of jerks and they got tough jobs and blah blah blah but no one expects me and Christian to connect over all we both had bad experience with police but black people that's our connection oh my god a white person said something rude to me that I experienced some sort of microaggression that's again our connection isn't based on us it's based on white people white people are what ties us together that's crazy yeah I just don't like for people to make me feel like I have to connect with them based on anything they say whether it's race or because I'm a woman I remember when people didn't vote for Hillary and Michelle Obama told us as black women like we really need to take a second look at ourselves if we didn't vote for her as women I don't have to agree with someone just on surface things that we may have in common I don't like that if I see a black woman in the dollar store in pajama bottoms and a bonnet and she's cursing her son out because he wanted a pack of nylators and she's telling him he ain't shit or he's gonna be just like his daddy I am not going to form an alliance with her simply because she's a black woman I'm gonna call her out on her BS because I should and I'm gonna turn my nose up to her just like the black man that left her all right Mr. Fearless Army swag at shopbladesmedia.com backslash fearless Larry Tonton there all right welcome back we're gonna bring in a friend of the show Larry Tonton you guys know him as an author a columnist public intellectual Larry wrote something on Twitter a few days ago that caught my attention it was a long Twitter thread about guns and mass killings I think it was 14 tweets all of it very interesting it started with the fact that Larry's visited the site of some of the most notorious mass killings in modern history and it goes on to basically explain why disarming the American people is not the solution he gets at some of the themes I've talked about today and previously on the show that I think many Americans don't understand that the government actually is the biggest perpetrator of mass disasters of any kind mass murders exploitation oppression and blah blah and and that's why the founders again as I said earlier to Royce one of us armed and able to protect ourselves from a government that will turn tyrannical tyrannical if we aren't armed and protected but enough already I'm gonna let Larry explain what he was trying to convey he's he's the expert Larry welcome back to the show and if you could summarize what you were trying to accomplish in your 14 tweets yeah it's great to be with you Jason as always you know I am not usually the first to chime in on you know breaking news I preferred to sit back a little bit and think and to to sift through all the details often because the things we hear at the very beginning are are often false but you know here we are a week or so out from this the shooting in Texas and I'm listening to what people are saying on this and I find myself disagreeing with it all for a lot of it first of all several years ago completely unrelated to this Jason I visited the sites of numerous terrorist attacks from you know I was I was at ground zero as a volunteer shortly after the attacks there when almost no one was a was allowed in that part of Manhattan but I was also visited you know the side of the Bataklan in in Paris a short walk away Charlie Hebdo the attacks in London on Westminster Bridge on London Bridge in Stockholm where a truck was used as a foreign attack in Toulouse in Meese in several places like this and you begin to see certain themes I begin to emerge and I find that the Democrat response to this Jason is fairly predictable it's it's a it's emotional it's politicized it is to say we're going to remove guns from everyone as though that's going to solve the problem and I think in it for instance in Meese where 86 people were killed no guns were involved it was just a truck that just ran over all kinds of people same thing in Stockholm same thing in London and then at the Bataklan and Charlie Hebdo law abiding citizens were completely unarmed the attackers walked into a heavy metal concert they casually began shooting people like fish in a barrel they knew those people were unarmed they could reload at will and just keep shooting and the police responses were quite slow yeah and I'm wondering what it's like when I read through your tweets it all makes sense and but one of the things that I think people don't understand is like governments and the atrocities that they execute and it's like why aren't we being taught this in school yeah it's almost like we've been convinced that all the government is your best friend and it's your next door neighbor who voted for Trump that's the guy that'll kill you and will harm you it's not the government when when the history of what governments have done and will do is so easily understood and explained but we're just not teaching young people that and that's why I think our conversations are so perverted and uninformed when things like events in Texas happen and we immediately go to oh we got to take these guns away from people I couldn't agree with you more Jason I mean listen the the founding fathers of this country they believed in checks and balances we all we all know that term when we think about the branches of government but checks and balances in their minds went further than that and one of the the major checks and balances was that a populace would not be disarmed I mean these were people who did not trust governments they didn't trust that the government that they were founding wouldn't eventually become tyrannical so one of the checks and balances that they put in there was the second amendment because governments that are armed when their populations are unarmed this is a central feature of tyranny and and so so governments are held in check made more accountable by people who are armed and I think that it's uh it's noteworthy for instance this recent attack in uh Charleston West Virginia where a guy shows up with an AR15 at a graduation party a woman shoots him dead she's armed she is exercising her concealed and carry rights properly she's properly trained with that weapon she pulls it out and shoots that guy dead before he can kill anyone same thing happened in garland Texas a few years ago a couple of Islamic terrorists show up an event they uh they pull out their guns and people who are on site are armed and shoot them both dead before anyone can get killed so um I think I think we're having the wrong conversations what and and I'm gonna ask this question it'll get me into trouble but I'm gonna ask you don't America actually yeah does America actually have a mass shooting pandemic one and if it does what are the proper solutions well I think it's very interesting that the National Institute of Health has told us that we have seen a uh a tremendous spike in mass shootings during the pandemic so um these are pandemic shootings you might say uh why is that well it seems that locking people down um isolating them leads to some serious mental health issues leads to a lot of anxiety suicide rates have skyrocketed and Jason I think we're seeing young people like this shooter in Texas these people you know more isolation more lock now leads to people spending more time on the internet and guys like this shooter they find the you know the dark corners of the internet where these kinds of shootings are celebrated I mean if we see somebody you know running onto a football field naked the camera turns away we don't give them the attention we want we don't we don't talk about them these shooters are celebrated and they know this and they're looking for their Andy Warhol moment of um you know a fame and so I think that we're seeing um a a huge rise in these shootings as a result of lockdowns again governments as a part of the problem here I think it is as well but I also think this and we because we were talking about this earlier in the show social media and how it's disconnected us and how you know I wrote about this as a related to the Uvaldi situation is kids that are engaging with people over DMs over Instagram or even text messaging and they're not in school or they're wearing masks we all seem to be just moving further and further away from intimate connections with each other and I don't mean that in a sexual way I mean that in a way of just like you really get to know people and that's how you really get to uh love and value other people's lives is because you're genuinely connected to them all of this social media and smartphone technology has disconnected humanity and I think that's unhealthy I agree with you and let let's go back to your your earlier question which I didn't quite answer in terms of what I think the real problems are here you made what I thought was an excellent point in your article on what is a woman and and that is that that we have gotten so far away from our Judeo-Christian roots from from any kind of basis in uh in morality that we now find ourselves in this absurd place I mean if if I may make a biblical reference you know Romans chapter one says that when you suppress the truth of God you eventually pervert the truth and you eventually pervert life itself meaning you become untethered from reality and you begin which was partially your point in that article to where you have come to a place where you can say a man can be a woman and a woman could be a man or what is a woman in the first place well the left has they have carried out in assault on two very important institutions that I think are leading to these attacks one of them is you can't complain I mean you know you're you're running campaigns on defund the police and then you turn around and you complain about where the police when there's a when there's a mass shooting so these this line of thinking is utterly contradictory the second one is the left has carried out and a decades-long assault on the Christian faith and you know one might say it might be good to have a you know a placard in school that says thou shalt not kill but no you can't do that that's you know a violation you can't do that so we we are seeing you know a gay pride month that is being forced into every corner of of our society it is absolutely assault on on our Christian values and at the same time we seem to be scratching our head and saying gosh wonder what's happening in society that all these terrible things are happening they're connected they're definitely connected and Roy likes to say this who was on before you and we certainly like to echo those thoughts in terms of the abortion issue and and this is about a mindset and so you want a society that values life and so how can your society value life when there's half of your population or the loudest part of your population values the ability and the freedom to kill babies in the womb and then you wonder if that's the mindset of if life has that little value that women and other supporters of of that are like this is a life or death issue they're going to draw a line in the sand over their right to kill a baby in the womb all the way up to the final trimester or or the until birth know what we got a polluted mindset we don't value life and then we get upset when we see symptoms or examples like well we don't value life yeah well it's actually even worse than that um Jason you know there is a pending piece of legislation in California that would give mothers a right to euthanize their babies up to 28 days postpartum so they would have the right to kill born children so we are moving in the direction this has been a philosophy of Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer a guy that we've debated at our our organization Peter Singer is arguably the most influential bioethicist in the world and it is his philosophy that is now actually finding its way into proposed legislation so to your point um we we do not value human life and kids know this they see the see straight through the hypocrisy of a culture that tells mothers that they can kill their children and then acts with horror when there are mass shootings they're one and the same thing Larry I need you to clarify or just say that just a bit more aggressively or something you're to in California correct they're trying to push a law that you can kill babies after they're born correct up to 28 days you've heard of this chameleon yeah I heard of that I wasn't certain that it was true but yes I heard of it and for me listening to to him I have to agree and with you saying that we have really just we don't connect with people anymore I often wonder how women can even be so callous to have abortion after abortion and how would you be able to kill your child up to 28 days after birth after you've looked in the child's eyes and face and smell the child how could you do that but I think we have been on such a course of teaching women to not be women that the they can be this heartless we we've really fed them this whole idea that you you don't have to value being married you don't have to value having children when that is exactly what God created us for which is why I said I have to agree with your stance on yesterday we've gotten so far away from why we are even in this earth realm as women we can be heartless and cold like that because we are not even valuing our purpose to start with and that's crazy to me that any woman could actually do that but you're seeing women be so cold because we aren't being true to who we are by nature Larry I'm gonna give you the final thought I really appreciate you joining us from South America if you got a final thought love to hear if not we'll let you go Jason I I'm gonna say what I I think is a thought an idea that we share and the answer here isn't disarming Americans they'll find trucks they'll find bombs they'll find knives all kinds of ways that you can kill your fellow man the reality is that we we greatly need a reawakening in this country of our spiritual values because we have lost any real sense of who we are and until until that happens this this if you want to put it this way this pandemic of violence of immorality of perversion will just simply get worse Larry thank you so much appreciate the time you topped off a great show for us I think I hear tomorrow or I'm gonna hear tomorrow and that means we'll see you tomorrow came like a fighter strike like a ladder making all this news for freedom I won't feed them no no go she has to my system or relation we all just want to have freedom sitting on the corner never been on our wrecking my back for freedom bless we are living get back we are receiving all the seed when we are on the beat for you we want freedom I just want I wanna be I just want"
