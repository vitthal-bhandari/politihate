    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Got a special surprise for all of you didn't even promo this one We have the vague Rama Swami with us right now calling in he is Running for president and he's doing a heck of a job so far the vak great to have you calling in my friend Thanks for being with us We're good man. So so you were in Nashville yesterday I want to first you know bring up the speed on the last 24 hours. We can get us some of the broader issues The indictments the campaigns all the things happening right now But first tell me what you were and tell everybody what you were doing in Nashville and and what your purpose has been there Well, my purpose was very focused on Calling for the release of the transgender shooters manifesto period I think that this is a shame that this hasn't yet been released But it's typical of what's happening in the country where we have a government that believes that the people cannot be trusted with the truth That tragedy that tragic shooting of six people at covenan school occurred on March 27th in April governor bill Lee and others gestured towards the likely release of the manifesto We're now sitting in August that manifesto has still not been released And I think that's wrong because there's a long-standing tradition in law enforcement whenever the manifesto is recovered to release it To help understand the most we can about a tragedy to help prevent something like it from happening in the future But my particular reason for going to Nashville this month to Tennessee now is that Governor Billy then has the gall to nonetheless call a special session of the legislature to pass Red flag laws and anti gun measures without actually releasing to the public the essence of that manifesto And I didn't think that's wrong. I think it erodes public trust I think it reinforces this wrong belief that the public cannot handle the truth And so I went there to say on behalf of the citizens of this country. Yes, actually we can handle the truth and The vague publicly I've called on this show and in other forums as well for the release of the manifesto My my sense of it all long has been and I'm sure this is a part of what's going on That there would be some very troubling things in there from the perspective of the beliefs of this transgender terrorist and either You know quote anti trans laws that are being passed in different states or you know the right wing Conducting some kind of a quote erasure of trans people and and they don't want the public to see that right that's been my Assessment all along is there another component to this I mean now that you've gone right to the heart of this of this debate and showed up in Nashville and tried to push For the release of the transgender shooters manifesto Is there a part of the argument that we're not hearing as much that actually makes more sense to you even if you still believe it should be released Yeah, I think that there is likely something else going on here. That's my strong sense I think there were people who came from that community who are also against its release But my view is even if it's not my preferred a political narrative or somebody else's preferred political narrative We should not have preferred political narratives actually we should just be interested in the truth America is founded on the truth on a government accountable to its people rather than the other way around and so Even if the truth isn't that they are protecting some transgender hate crime against a Christian school, which is my base case assumption You know, I think that having been there and on the ground my senses that may not be the story But all we have now to do is to be left to guess and I think that that's wrong Now one of the arguments that they sometimes use is to say that they don't want to provide inspiration or a roadmap for people who can commit Similar crimes in the future. I don't want that either. Nobody wants that I think if there are details of a crime that need to be that need to be you know laid out Well, those can be redacted in the case of a memo that's public released I'd be supportive of that but nonetheless We have to see at least the truth about the motives We have to see the truth about what was behind this killer's motives. We have a mental health epidemic in this country Gender dysphoria, I believe is a mental health condition. We have to confront that reality But a deeper mental health condition if people pose risks to their communities We need to deal with that in a different way than just removing guns from law-abiding citizens Which is exactly what Tennessee is on track to do later this month? And history teaches us that we make our worst policy decisions under conditions of a so-called response to an emergency When we suppress the truth that's exactly what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic And I see the same mistake on track to repeat itself in Tennessee by the way under a Republican governor at that The vake rummess while me with this now. He's running for president He's showing up big already and some of the polls relative to the the other Challengers and Vivek Did you I don't know if you've seen this I'm kind of putting you on the spot But I'm curious what your assessment of it is a lot of folks reacting to this David Samuels Kind of magazine piece in tablet Where he goes into effectively Obama's actually calling a lot of the shots for the Biden administration and This seems to pull together a lot of different threads makes a lot of sense to me What's your assessment of that and how it pertains to Biden going forward? Well here this actually is pretty relevant to my campaign. I'm a little bit outside the GOP Overton window here on this my whole point is I think we need to stop talking about Biden Right the party line is with the political consultants are coaching the candidates to do and every other candidate is doing It's talking about the radical Biden agenda. My message is folks stop talking about Biden for two reasons First of all, we have to actually talk more about an affirmative vision of our own It was our failure to do that that I believe actually lost us What was the red wave that never came in 2022? But the deeper reason is the dirty little secret that Biden is not in charge The people we elect to run the government are not the ones who actually run the government That is the dirty little secret of modern federal government in the United States of America It is the managerial class in the deep state and if we're unwilling to wake up to that reality Then we're just gonna swap out one Republican prep puppet for a for a democratic puppet But it's gonna be the still same managerial machine that runs the show So the only thing I would say and I haven't read the piece but to reacting to what you said is I think there's a temptation to then pin it to another one person Say Obama It's not one person. It is a machine. It is a system that is bigger than any one person It is the Leviathan. Okay. This is the Leviathan that Hobbes wrote about 400 years ago It exists on modern American soil. It is the hollowed-out husk of a republic that we actually live in today And I think the more we talk about that clay I'm leading the way in offering specifics Unprecedented detail on how we would shut down that administrative state that deep state and how that'll stimulate the economy How that restores accountability in government? That's how we actually win this election in a landslide But the more we fixate on just talking about Joe Biden and offering pole-tested platitudes from Republican political consultants The more we're missing the plot and I think by the way, the more likely it is we're gonna lose the next election too Now we are being told that any day now and I think of this one We it's an assumption right? It's not oh, maybe there's gonna be an indictment in Atlanta I'd be shocked if it didn't happen which could be a fourth criminal indictment against Donald Trump now you have maintained Vivek that you are running to be president not running to be from spice president or treasury secretary or anything else What do you think the proper response of the GOP to be good of machinery should be to well? Certainly three and likely soon for criminal indictments of your chief opponent in this primary Well, there's a lot of people who want to hear me sit around and bash Trump I'm not gonna do it because honestly, I think it was an excellent president I think that his victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 was probably the single most political and politically important My lifetime certainly in this century stopping the inevitable Marxist march throughout this country and our government And so if you want to hear a bunch of people bashing Trump to an MSNBC, that's not what I'm gonna give you But I'm in this to move us forward I would have made different judgments than Trump made But a bad judgment is not a crime and I think it is no accident that you are seeing three now possibly four But at least in the three that are out novel previously untested legal theories levied against one man in the middle of a presidential election Come on guys. This is politicized persecution through prosecution It sets an awful and dangerous legal precedent in our country even at most recent indictment effectively criminalizing Seeking good faith legal advice and a lawyer giving it turning that activity into a so-called conspiracy with your lawyer This is uncharted legal territory It is dangerous precedent that shaped the foundations of our legal system And I say this as somebody who is now running third in the Republican National primary It would be easier for me if Trump were eliminated from competition But that would be the wrong thing for the country and that is why I've been so forceful on this and is also I've been crystal clear that when I'm president and glad I do expect to be our name on buck plays out today But close enough go ahead We will we will pardon him. What's that what's that clay? I'm buck clay is out today. It's okay It's alright, man. We sound we sound close enough that it happens with people but tell me Let's let's get on to the the immigration frontier for a second Because you know you've seen I'm sure I talked about it at length yesterday on the show you you've seen the migrants who are out in the streets and and the whole thing What would a Rama Swami? Immigration policy look like and I mean give me somebody please Secure the border. Yeah. Yeah, we know enforce the law. Yeah, we know what though. How? Yeah, so let me let me go quickly Because because there's a lot here one is the wall is not enough We must use the US military to secure the southern border. We have 1.3 million men and women serving today 700,000 more in reserve that is plenty to secure the southern border close the Swiss cheese of a whole They're building cartel finessed tunnels underneath that wall. It's the source of most of the fentanyl coming into this country That's how we ended stop funding for thanks for cities that eliminates the incentives and further stop a dime of foreign aid any dime to Mexico Guatemala Honduras Nicaragua Belize until Mexico itself has solved its own southern border problem So that's how we saw the illegal migration problem and then on immigration more broadly look there's a key north star here It should be obvious, but I'm gonna say it anyway, which is that the purpose of our immigration policy should be what? advances the interests of the homeland What advances the interests of American citizens on American soil? I believe the US president I believe our government has a moral obligation to our citizens to ask what advances the interests of Our citizens and that would be what guides a broader legal immigration policy as well Which I have you know lengthy views on but that's the north star principle that I would use The fake Ramaswami everybody he is running Vivek, what's your site so people can see more about your policies and what you're up to Vivek 2024 calm that's the IV K 2024 calm and as I say if you want reform go with somebody else But I stand on the side of revolution and so if that you come join us.

You know what here. You can hear from everybody right now. This is a montage of media lives all saying that Trump is a threat to democracy play to Pearl Harbor 1941 9 11 2001 Donald Trump just like those other threats to American democracy Try to destroy our system. He's an existential threat to the national security of our country Put Donald Trump in this box as an existential threat the existential threat being Trump Trump is an existential threat to democracy These indictments which is about the future of American democracy Democracy itself is really an issue in this trial If Trump could get away with what he's done what he's charged with here Then we don't have the democracy. We believe we had it would be the end of our democracy if Donald Trump was able to get back into office It's the end of the world as we know it But I do not feel fine. Is that R. E. M? Is that R. E. M? Am I right? Yeah, R. E. M Remember when they had a moment back in the 90s they were everywhere early 90s like 92 93 I think it was using my religion. I I was never an R. E. M fan was gonna say it now. I Even as a young guy like a kid in grammar schools like this bands things anyway But there you have it the okay It's so terrible Trump is a threat an existential threat to democracy going to end the country and all this stuff Some of them are historians too or making the rounds to say that this is a historic threat But you know who's not a historian a reverent but not a historian Al Sharpton and I just want you to hear His assessment of Trump as a threat to Democracy play it one day our children's children will read American history and can you imagine our reading the James Madison or Thomas Jefferson tried to overthrow the government So okay, that's what we're looking at we're looking at American history and how we will play out is going to be very important. Oh Yeah Can you imagine? Everybody could you imagine for a second if the founding fathers, you know Jefferson and Washington and Madison if they Tried to overthrow the government. That's crazy That's just so crazy, isn't it? You know if there's one thing you can say about Thomas Jefferson it's that he was gonna do whatever the regime in power when he grew up told him to do no questions asked He was like King George. What do you want? What do you need? I got you covered? Not so much Not so much it turns out, but that was a great one imagine if the founding fathers I mean People act like this country was founded by a bunch of revolutionaries Yeah, yeah Reverend Reverend Al as a New Yorker. I've been hearing so much about Reverend Al for since I was a little kid So I have a particular I particular memories of what he was like back in the day, but anyway Yes, as you see here the rhetoric is going to have to get even more absurd about all things Trump related because The Democrats have been conditioned to speak about it in this way So if you want any attention if you want people to click on your you know your link or for your website or watch your segment on TV and you're a Democrat you've got to just come up with some way of Saying the worst possible things About Donald Trump you got but you've got it's it's an arms race, right? You've got to elevate the crazy Donald Trump isn't just worse than then Hitler.

So the Hunter Biden revelations, which we've talked about here a lot It couldn't be any more clear right That he broke the law that they try to give him a sweetheart deal It must be somewhat well, you'd have to have principles to be exhausted by it But I would think that for an honest person carrying endless amounts of water for Hunter Biden Would just become very tiresome because he's not representative look You know, there are things that that Trump says or does that not everyone I know agrees with that? I don't always agree with obviously but there's a broader movement and There's a sense of something bigger at stake than just well I didn't like that tweet or I disagree with him appointing this person or You know, no one's perfect. I argue with members of my own family and they're all pretty fantastic So, you know, this is this is the reality that we deal with in politics You're not looking for the perfect looking for the best option that brings about the most important Most meaningful results Hunter Biden is just like a I can't really sit on the radio. He's a you know, he's a jerk You know, but he's tied to Joe and as we know Joe was tied to Barack as we've been talking about so they protect him. They circle the wagons and there's it does remind me at some level of the most extreme the most extreme cults because They the more absurd what you're willing to say in front of or in favor of Hunter Biden the more absurd it is The more attached to the Democrat power apparatus you become I will give you a perfect example of this Joe Scarborough a former Republican. I mean, I'll tell you this There is no chance that I would ever become a lip. It's just never going to happen. I have viewed the world to the prism of A conservative values since as long as I have been thinking about things, you know beyond where I'm gonna get you know My next scooter and ham sandwich since I was a kid, right? I mean, it's just it couldn't be anymore straightforward for me Who I am and what I believe in some people in media that is totally switch doesn't matter Well, you know if if the paychecks are good enough. There'll be a communist. They don't care Whatever whatever works whatever matters however they get there And you certainly see that over at msnbc you a former push administration officials who are now working for the the commies over at msnbc and Scarborough a republican congressman from florida He goes over there and he says there's no way he believes this is true He could never say debate this would never call him to the show and say really you don't think hunter biden's can Committed any crimes here play 19 They keep trying to find something Anything to distract from the fact that donald trump has been charged with stealing nuclear secrets charged with stealing military plans charged with trying to overthrow an american presidential election and they keep sort of rummaging around for 100 by the invite and crime family conspiracy theories and again, let me say it again This is our daily reminder to anybody watching if hunter biden's guilty of anything arresting charging let a jury convicting case or a surah whatever will be will be as we say here, but the republicans they have nothing they keep making full of themselves I mean, could he really be that big of a jackass That he is the president joe So they won't allow any charges against him But the charges are so obvious and he's so guilty that they were going to at least for the purposes of The political optics make him take a multi count plead deal But he walked away from the plea deal because there were other crimes that the judge Wasn't willing to give him a get out of jail free card on because he hadn't been indicted or even talked about Uh being indicted with the prosecutors on that one Everyone knows he's guilty hunter knows he's guilty the whole world knows he's guilty There's no debate over whether hunter could oh let a jury convict him Oh, okay, you know This is great. It's been like what's the problem in soviet russia Let the people love stalin let them vote. Yeah, because that's how it was working. You know, hmm Sure No problem in the soviet union. They had a constitution they had all kinds of rights They had like paid leave in their constitution paid vacation Somehow it didn't work out that way. Hmm. They have a problem bring the charges the fix is in and he knows it Everybody knows it, but This is the game that we're going to be going through here People are going to do whatever is most advantageous to their belief system at some level but also to the bottom line and uh Here we go NBC's scott wong. I told you this what they're going to say Okay, it was really gross. Yes. They were selling influence. Yes Joe talked to the business partners. Yes, everything we told you before about this was a lie But no one's going to prison for it. There's no charges play 18 hunter biden is an entirely different question Of course very clearly was trying to trade on the biden name archer said that multiple times that he was portraying this appearance or In illusion of influence and so that was something that was very clearly stated by archer that hunter biden was trying to impress his employer barisma the Ukrainian energy company but that no evidence of Inpropriety was committed by joe biden Look at all these All these correspondents on the news all of a all of a sudden they're all speaking like defense attorneys Well, there was no there's no definitive proof that has been tested in a judicial system yet That is of a level of evidence Evidentiary burden the whole thing we know they're just Circle the wagons do whatever they have to do But this notion of the illusion of influence The illusion of influence. I mean with biden we have the illusion of a presidency, but that's something we talked about in the first hour The illusion of influence. Okay, let's just say You know, we got a lot of people out there, you know in honor of my buddy clay. I'll do a little sports a little sports analogy here If I were to pay off The referee of a game or rather let's say I am the referee at the i'm the i'm the head referee at the super bowl And someone gives me a million dollars and says hey You know my my uh, new york football giants We agree. They're gonna get the close calls right wink wink and I go I'm just gonna take your money You know, i'm not making any promises Wink wink Does anybody could that referee say oh? I just took the money It was the illusion of influence It was the illusion of influence that I took millions of dollars for Ah, I don't think so I don't think so imagine you're a politician make this even easier. You were signing off on big government contracts you're the governor of New York state was a true imbecile but put that aside a governor of New York state and someone brings you a briefcase full of money They say look I don't want this to be quid pro quo because that's corruption here Just take a briefcase with a million dollars in it Maybe you're gonna give me that casino license that I want I'm not saying you're going to but just take this million dollars and let Is that the illusion of influence or is that influence? You say oh, but you can't make the person well they've taken if they've taken a million dollars from you in the case of hunter It's many many millions of dollars By this is the game they move the goalposts They lied they ran interference for as long as they can Unfortunately interference they ran has helped them because of the statute of limitations component of all of this But now they're gonna have people like joe scrubby like yeah, if it's if he's guilty put him to a jury and let's see what happens I mean, I would love anybody with any honesty and any hoods, but whatsoever that table to say You know he was signing a plea deal because he did all this stuff, right You know, they've got him nailed right like this is not a there's no there's no question as to whether he broke the law He's saying he broke the law and it's not as false He was a drug addict so please be merciful on me and by merciful it means wipe the whole thing away because he's joe biden son But they're pushing the unreality They're pushing the unreality they think that if they throw another and the Atlanta charges probably coming down any day now Any day now they think if they throw a fourth maybe a fifth maybe a sixth Let's throw another criminal indictment. Let's get a criminal indictment. You know throw them on layaway Well, we'll we'll lease some criminal indictments. We'll we'll donate some criminal indictments, you know put them Make it 10 make it 15 They think the number of these indictments is going to change anybody's mind about what's happening They think that we're gonna say oh well, you know Because you are criminalizing Conversations with his lawyers and a legal strategy Now finally sure you lied at russia collusion sure you've you know, you've gone through extreme length to destroy the Whatever faith we have in the system to try to take down donald trump sure you impeach them twice Including an impeachment for a per when he said when trump was perfectly fine phone call it was he was right But yeah, if they get to indictment number four then we have to then we have to really rethink things sure It's not gonna work that way. It's not gonna work that way 802 822 882 will take some of your calls.
