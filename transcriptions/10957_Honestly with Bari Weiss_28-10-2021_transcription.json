What's the weirdest place you've gotten lucky? I never win and tell well there you have it You could get lucky anywhere playing at lucky land slots calm play for free right now. Are you feeling lucky? No purchase necessary for everybody by law 18 plus terms and conditions apply see what's every details I'm Barry Weiss. This is honestly and as a warning today's episode gets a little bit explicit First of all before I even start I want to say that I'm rich and famous And and the only reason I say that is because the last 17 months were hell and I cannot imagine What everybody went through but I'm happy to see you and I'm happy you're well and I hope everyone you love is okay In his latest Netflix special Dave Chappelle went hard. He made jokes about black people Asians molesting preachers lesbians celebrities the Me Too movement Jews space Jews But what would actually get him in trouble was the subject of gender and now we get to the core of the crisis What What is a woman? What is that in this damn time? Is there even such thing as a woman or a man or anything? Hmm? Hmm seems to be a question nowadays and specifically what got Dave in hot water was talking about something called a turf They've canceled people that are more powerful than me The cancel JK Rowling my god JK Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books by herself She sold so many books of Bible worries about her And it canceled her because she said in an interview and this is not exactly what she said, but affectionately she said Gender was a fact And then the trans community got mad as shit. They started calling her a turf I didn't even know what the fuck that was But I know that trans people make up words to win arguments So I looked it up Turf is an acronym stands for trans exclusionary radical feminists. This is a real thing. This is a group of women That hate transgender they don't hate transgender women, but they look at trans women the way we blacks might look at blackface It offends them like this bitches doing it in pressure me In that riff he actually says that he's on team turf. I'm team turf I Agree and then he makes a joke that felt like he was daring a more sensitive audience not to laugh I am not saying that to say that trans women aren't women I am just saying that those pussies that they got You know me I Am not saying it's not pussy, but that's like beyond pussy or impossible pussy Tastes like pussy, but that's not quite what it is. It's not blood. That's beet juice Oh Buddy I'm in trouble now Within days people including people at Netflix were saying that Chappelle's jokes were violence and that the jokes would lead to the murder of trans people in real life Has day He doesn't realize that the speech that he's putting out there And then last week activists gathered outside of Netflix headquarters here in Los Angeles They are promoting and causing hate conversation and also allowing people to think that it's okay to discriminate against those trans and non-binary And they said among other things that trans people are in the middle of a Holocaust Our lives are not comedic sound bites or moments for boardrooms and employees to funnel money into the harmful content that negatively impacts our Communities in one particular video that went viral you can see one of these activists attacking a guy holding a sign that just says And shouting in his face repent And so with all of this turf talk at a fever pitch I reached out to my guest today Julie Bindel Julie has been physically attacked Activists have tried to have her work band Bookstores have boycotted her in the name of safety all because of the accusation that she is a turf What Julie actually is is a longtime feminist writer and activist She joined the radical feminist movement in the 1970s as a 17 year old working-class girl and lesbian from the Northeast of England She's traveled all over the world exposing and campaigning against violence directed at women against female genital exclamation Domestic violence rape human trafficking She's fearless and she speaks her mind and she has a new book out called feminism for women the real route to liberation Which got an endorsement from none other than JK Rowling. I have to say I was really surprised when I read it I have always considered myself a feminist and that I've always believed and advocated for women having equal rights for having the same dignity The same pay for the same job and so on But Julie's version of feminism is much more radical than mine so much so that by the end of the book I wasn't even sure if I was a feminist All of which made me excited to talk to her about the latest culture war because Julie Bindel isn't new to this fight She's been on the front lines of it for over four decades and naturally at the moment She is right smack in the middle of this raging debate between turfs and swerves and feminists and second waivers and all manner of misogynists so whether you knew what a turf was before you saw the closer or not Julie Bindel is here to make sense of it all Stay with us You This show is sponsored by BetterHelp Has it ever happened to you that you resolved to go to sleep early you get in bed at 10 So you can be fresh the next day and then suddenly it's two in the morning and you've spent four hours watching TV You've already seen Sometimes your brain gets in its own way at least it does for me You know what you should do and what's good for you, but you can't seem to make yourself do it Therapy can help you figure out what's holding you back so you can train your brain to work for you instead of against you If you're thinking about starting therapy, I urge you to give BetterHelp a try It's entirely online and it's designed to be flexible convenient and suited to your schedule Just fill out a brief questionnaire to match you with a licensed therapist You could switch therapists at any time for no additional charge make friends with your brain with BetterHelp by visiting betterhelp.com Honestly today to get 10% off your first month.

I'm so thrilled to be here talking to you so happy to have you so Julie I've identified as a feminist from the time I was 12 or 13 years old and For as long as I've identified as a feminist I've also been aware that there is a ferocious and relentless debate About every aspect having to do with feminism what feminism is who is a real feminist and who isn't and If we even still need feminism or not And to that last point, you know, you look out into America at least compared to where we were in the 1950s and There's the pill. There's no fault divorce Women are in every Industry and often at the top of those industries women are outnumbering men on college campuses I mean by so many metrics It seems the fight for equality has been won and yet on the other hand I look at the reality of what it is to be a young woman in America today and There's TikToks and only fans and Instagram and all these apps that we know are sort of infecting young girls brains And you have the CDC Unable to say the word woman instead. They're saying birthing people and you have the ACLU Poshtimously revising quotes from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to make sure she doesn't use the pronoun her so it's very strange paradox that we're in and I think you're the perfect person to help me understand what's happening because you have been a feminist not just in word But indeed for decades You've been there as a feminist activist every step of the way since 1979 when you were 17 years old and you first began identifying as a feminist so What drew you to the feminist movement? I'd grown up in a very working-class community in Italian in the northeast of England called Darlington I Was expected to marry I was expected to have children to work in a factory or a store to have no aspirations whatsoever to certainly have no Proper education beyond school and I mean bad schooling and just be satisfied with my lot Hmm and my first job in a factory when I came of age at 16 was marking on women's blouses Where the buttons should be stitched and I cannot tell you how I lost the will to live every single day when I went into that factory I Was a lesbian I had fallen in love with my best friend at school. It wasn't reciprocated. I was heartbroken I felt completely out on a limb. I felt different. I was told I was a freak I was told I would never amount to anything because I was so bad at school. I was bullied. I rebelled things were really desperate and I decided to move away go and stay with a relative a little bit further south and There there was a gay bar. I couldn't believe it There were all kinds of drag queens and camp gay men and really butch lesbians I mean lesbian so butch they could kickstart their own vibrators I mean really kind of scary looking women and I was this quite sweet naive girl who you know could have been eaten alive, but the community was so Together it was so cohesive. There was a real sense that we were all kind of oppressed by the same forces We might have had different life Circumstances and backgrounds, but we would take care of each other and it was then that I happened to meet the feminists when I moved to a city called Leeds and That was because in those days Feminism and lesbianism were pretty indivisible The sexism and misogyny that girls and women in that era especially working-class girls Experienced when we came out as lesbians or when we were outed as lesbians was like misogyny on steroids It was the kind of double whammy of not only are you a Female with a low status in this society But you also have sexually rejected men and you've rejected the Control and protection of men. So all bets are off. There's no chivalry There's no patriarchal kind of good manners system here. You're just bitches and witches and You're out of our league. So when I met the feminists, I just thought wow this all makes sense We are told with reeks and we're treated as scum Because of something called patriarchy, which is men's power that they have as a class in the way that it can be argued that The ruling classes have people of color experience in some kind of racist white societies But I'd never thought of it as a system before and the reason why is because of heterosexuality Because we are the only oppressed group required to love our oppressors to have sex with our oppressors and to give birth with our oppressors So it was a very difficult dynamic women didn't want to look across the breakfast table at their husband or father and think You're an oppressor and so it was really tricky to say Men you are the problem, but that's what those women gave me while I was still in my teens the confidence to think that and to say it You know given the way that feminism is talked about now with girl bosses and shattering the glass ceiling and all of that I think the way that you're expressing how you understood feminism will feel feels really radical and really different so Help me understand how you understood Feminism at the time. What were the specific things that the women that you met in leads were fighting for When I first moved to the city, I was really quite Uneducated. I'd never read a book about feminism. Have you even heard the word when you were growing up? I had because when I was about 14 years old, I watched on one of our popular tv channels at dramatized series about the suffragettes and the suffragists it was called shoulder to shoulder and they were We saw them in hospital and in prison being force-fed for their digression. We saw them chaining themselves to railings We saw the dramatized, you know the very dramatic moment Um when one of them threw herself under the king's horse Of course to fight for the vote and the emancipation of women in general So I had heard the word but Something extraordinary was happening when I moved to leads and it had been happening Across the entire north of the country and through to the midlands Over a period of six years all of these women were murdered by the same man A serial killer who we were later to discover Was called peta suck life 13 families lives torn apart by peta suck life Was killing women with impunity and getting away with it Suck life murdered 13 women across Yorkshire and the north-west of england between 1975 and 1980 He was also convicted of the attempted murder of seven other women Mainly in the beginning he was targeting street prostitute women He was dubbed the Yorkshire ripper like his Victorian predecessor jack the ripper He mutilated his women victims or women who as the kind of northern parlance goes and no better than they ought to be In other words women who go out on their own Enjoy sex with men outside of marriage drink too much go to public houses on their own And it was so very scary because what was happening Was that the streets weren't safe for women when already the home wasn't safe for women So what these women told me in the meetings that we had to protest the police inertia about these murders But also the misogynistic reporting in the press Whether they were talking about innocent victims as opposed to women and this was the silent kind of thread Who actually deserved what had happened to them? These women who were raped mutilated murdered left in parks in public spaces as a warning to women So if the home wasn't safe And we had you know two women killed every week as a result of domestic violence In england and whales and we didn't have the streets Where the hell could women go? Now when people say oh that must have been a really scary time You must have been terrified of being attacked by this man Actually, it was the opposite It meant that I overcame my fear because I knew that we were fighting to end a situation Where we grow men Like the Yorkshire ripper where we grow men Who think it's okay to beat their wives and abuse their children So we were resisting that violence and so what feminism looked like to me through the women I met Was grassroots activism? We are not having this We would campaign on the streets We formed reclaim the night marches, which you call I think take back the night See see how polite I was is compared to yours Reclaim let's reclaim the night ladies and you've got take back the night Right, but it's hilarious because you're talking about women who are resisting terrifying violence And when I was exposed to take back the night it was on the campus of columbia university You know on the upper west side where you know the radical march, you know went for 10 blocks And then people gathered together with snacks and bottles of water to sort of share their stories It was just such a far echo From the kind of thing that you're describing Yeah, which is how feminism ended up So these feminists that you were connected to who were fighting against forces that they felt were oppressive Which at the time also included prostitution What were their views on other social issues that affect women like porn? So at that time in the early 80s as well as reeling From the revelations of the botched police operation in looking for Peter Sutcliffe We also were aware that Pornography was becoming more easily accessible. It was no longer your father's playboy It was no longer the magazine that I once found under my brother's bed Which you know was tits in us um, but there was very little sexual violence By then by the time that I started campaigning against sex cinemas, for example They were screening some pretty violent stuff that gave the message to men that women are I suppose dehumanized objects for penetration For one-sided sexual pleasure that women enjoyed pain being inflicted upon us And that there were no consequences for men that did that that in fact sexual violence and women's pain and Humiliation was entertainment And this was a boron to me because hey listen have as much sex as you want with whoever's consenting but normalizing and sexualizing the torture of women where women are clearly Really in pain? Why are we teaching our boys and men? To respond to that. I didn't think it was natural or innate and he certainly wasn't good So the first action I ever joined against pornography was a sex cinema in Leeds And we decided to go in We found a way to get in with our buying tickets And what we did was we took some liquid concrete And we poured it down the toilets To block the toilets and we threw eggs at the screen And we figured that yeah, we'd probably get arrested But we didn't care we were young and we didn't think we'd ever have real jobs Anyway, but that we would make a mark and that we would get in the local press And we'd be able to then be interviewed and say This is why we object to porn. We don't object to porn because we're anti-sex in fact Radical feminists Those of us that campaign to end male violence We said to women who are heterosexual You should demand sexual pleasure. You shouldn't just accept to lay back and think of England And just he have his pleasure You know, this is about women's sexual liberation To have sex outside of heterosexual marriage And to choose to be lesbian or celibate or whatever floats your boat So we wanted to explain to the press of the general public That we are pro sex and it's because we actually like sex good sex That we don't want it subverted To what pornography was starting to show in the mainstream So july, how did feminism go from throwing eggs at the screen at a sex cinema And pouring concrete down the toilet to buy the time that I arrive in college in, you know 2002 As the norm the feminist norm the feminist consensus was you know seeing sex work as possibly empowering Porn is totally okay The words like slut were being reclaimed You know, it was no longer about a specific set of policies And a specific set of personal choices that made you a feminist It was rather Any choice that any woman makes is a feminist choice Right I see the transformation of feminism as sort of like your version of feminism is very morally clear In certain ways, I don't know if I agree with it, but it's very clear about what it believes about the world Who women are who they aren't what a feminist is what it isn't what is good for women What isn't and the kind of feminism I encountered was sort of imbued with this sort of anti-western Culturally relativist position How did that happen? How did we go from what you're describing to what I encountered? I mean that is the question of the century, isn't it? And I think that what we have to do Is look at the way that feminism became co-opted by very privileged university students And taken away from its grassroots Original home Part of that is because so much of it went online, but look the internet's been great for feminism It's globalised the women's movement. It's fantastic But I think so many just thought You know what? We'll just talk online and we'll write we'll send petitions around And we'll sign open letters and that'll be it and the cultural relativist stuff, which I've railed against for decades You know began way back in the 90s. I remember going for a job as a press officer In a northern town. I was living in London by then But I really wanted to work on this big international conference It was the beginning of the globalisation of the anti-male violence women's movement Because it was held in in Brighton Just outside of London. It was in a huge conference hall We had about 60 countries and states represented there And when I went for the job, I was really surprised to get it because there was huge amounts of competition And I asked the organizer that the kind of midwife to the conference Years later, why did you give me the job? And she said well We threw a question in there Which was about a scenario that I turned up for my first day Being press officer for this week long event and there's a group of African men and women protesting outside saying hands off our girls bodies And the protest is against female genital mutilation Because of course the conference took a line that female genital mutilation is an abhorrence And to hell with it being described as a tradition Or a culture the only culture and tradition it relates to is patriarchy And when I was asked what would I do if I saw that baying job as a white woman I said I would just say to them FGM is child abuse It should be criminalised. Please stand out of my way And that's how I got the job And this relates to all kinds of things a lot of white liberal men and women Will support the kind of ideology that really harms women and girls and they call it feminism It's funny that you mention female genital mutilation because I remember very clearly Again going back to college and just sort of encountering versions of Ideologies and words that I thought I knew the meaning to but actually the meaning was all of a sudden really different So I grew up with an idea that feminism was about Equality for women that women should get treated equally that You know we should be treated with respect and dignity And I remember getting into a conversation with two other students friends who identified as feminists And the conversation was about FGM. It was about female genital mutilation And they were basically Offering an apology for it. They were basically justifying it in the name again of Cultural relativism we need to you know Respect other cultures and other practices and I walked away from that Genuinely confused because I didn't understand how someone could identify themselves as a feminist and Take that kind of Let's be generous like you know limp position with regard to profound violence against young girls So that's what I encountered. I thought it was exceptional. I was like eight to 19 years old And I think july and i'm wondering if you agree It seems to me that that brand of feminism has won Not yet it hasn't and not on our watch. I mean I remember the first time I ever heard the term cutting cutting. What do you mean cutting a Cambridge Senior academic referred to female genital mutilation As cutting in order to destigmatize it and it's been referred to as female circumcision a lot too Which to destigmatize it absolutely appalling language really matters You know, it's no mistake that that language has been used and there's a you know the the Academics in this country many of them Are so scared of being branded as bigoted in any way shape or form by particular groups That they will literally apologize as you've just said for the agonizing Procedure a female genital mutilation, which Anyone listening to this podcast just look it up. It's the worst worst act of Sadistic brutality. I think i've ever ever heard about and I know survivors of fgm Women from sedan Brilliant women such as nimco alley who has changed hearts and minds and laws about this And who rails against white liberal cultural relativists who buy into this nonsense And my view is it's the same kind of sanitize language and approach as a sex work So I know that we use the term sex work in order to dignify the women But I would never call women in prostitution Prostitutes I would say that there are women who are in prostitution or who are prostituted or who sell sex I would never label a woman a prostitute, but if you start talking about sex work It sanitizes what actually is happening to the vast majority of women caught up in the sex trade And I do think that this is how we've ended on a slippery slope Where all kinds of things that are bad for women Unaree branded and repackaged and sold back to us as feminist Well, actually if you really unpick who benefits from prostitution, it's the men It's not the women whatever individual experience is some women have who say they're happy within it Great, but we don't base law and policy on a tiny number of individuals Who make up a minority? We just don't I think the thing that I find so strange is that the same feminists who are basically saying You know who are we to judge? FGM Are also the people who would go to town and go to the mat? Over let's say, you know working class americans not knowing the right pronouns to use right there is just a total Disconnect here. They're they are fixating on tiny micro aggressions and overlooking or in fact like making apologies for Giant macro aggressions in the world right. How do you explain that? Oh, I mean, I suppose I could tell you just a brief story about something that happened to me In order to kind of look at how far down the rabbit hole And this kind of politics has gone in in june 2019. I went to give a talk on How to counter male violence against women rate domestic violence femicide and I was with Other human rights activists including every now the law professor and other experts And we were talking to the university of Edinburgh to their students and some of their staff And because there was one Speaker who had also decided to focus her talk on why we have to keep our sex based rights as women Have some things like rape crisis shelters You know Refuges for domestic abuse victims should be kept women only and prisons of course Naturally, the whole event was deemed to be transphobic. It's such a narcissistic movement Everything is about them the extremists and we're talking about Half of the planet and the prevalence of violence against women, which is just you know significant so I came out of the The talk and I was going to get a taxi a cab to the airport And there'd been a big protest the usual blue and red fringe brigade beforehand The signs you know trans women are women below jobs are real jobs Julie bindles a turf etc the usual or get a hold on but yes Indeed and I came out and I was with my law professor colleague and a trans identified person a man who was identifying as a trans woman came running at me Screaming the most horrendous things at me very violent kind of Manner I knew he was about to punch me and that punch would have really connected because his fist was flying through the air When three or four big burly security men managed to get hold of him and pull him off And eventually further down the line. He was charged and he was given a community sentence I didn't want him to go through the prison system. He clearly was mentally and well, but that was a violent attack and the headline in the guardian newspaper the newspaper on which I cut my journalistic teeth that I had written for for decades The first headline was about how I was a transphobic speaker Who had claimed I had been attacked Now as soon as the editor of the guardian saw that she realized that the victim here was being blamed A woman who had campaigned all her adult life to count her male violence And they made the newsroom change it, but not before many people had seen it and in the meantime I got a publication called pink news Which is supposed to be about the lgbtqqi plus two spirit blah blah blah community Had the story there about my attack Which as I say was reported to the police was about me misgendering a trans woman Because I had tweeted that a man had attacked me outside of edinburgh university. I mean wow just unbelievable Not just hypocrisy, but as you say These so-called microaggressions and dog whistles a term i've come to really detest being given precedence over actual violence against women the words are seen as violent And the act of actual violence is explained away That's what we're seeing obviously right now with the whole debate over the dave shappell special on netflix Where his words are being Placified as violence you had I believe it's now joey soloway the creator of transparent Talking about how there is a holocaust a genocide against trans people They're just a total inversion it seems to me so an actual Attack on you is not classified that way and in fact you become the perpetuator of the violence yes and words like holocaust being bandied around by trans activists who themselves are using Really offensive analogy such as holocaust is really starting to wind me up very very much for example There's this myth that trans women are being murdered in their droves no doubt killed as a result of my writing in the guardian or wherever And we haven't had thankfully we have not had One murder of a trans person for being trans in a number of years But at a conference I was at the weekend on feminism. There was a huge group of the usual protesters outside And they were holding signs some of the signs Said suck my dick you transphobic cunt So there they were protesting about our anti trans violence and bigotry because we were talking about the need for women only spaces and sex-based legislation And in the meantime We're indoors talking about real issues that face women around the world And these idiots were actually taking the knee Outside of the conference hall in commemoration of murdered trans people of which there were none That is the stark difference we're talking about between reality and some Orwellian craziness that has Become almost normalized. Okay. There's an optimistic way to look at all of this. I'm realizing which is in order to see words as violence in order to see you Julie Ben as a threat in order to see Dave Chappelle special on Netflix as you know worthy of weeks of attention You have to be living in an unbelievably safe secure prosperous and privileged world So in a way, isn't this all like the fact that people have the luxury of seeing You or Chappelle or you know Margaret Atwood or jk Rowling as a threat Isn't it a sign actually of how far things have come and what a progressive world we do live in? Could you see it that way? You could and The good thing is that feminism is the most optimistic movement on the planet because we don't believe that boys are born innately bad or Program to oppress or abuse or sexually exploit women and girls and therefore bad men can change Men that do bad things aren't necessarily bad men And actually they can choose not to do bad things Women can choose not to wallow in victimhood and fear and get out there and march on the streets and demand change I agree with you on one level about the kind of level of privilege that has to be Present in these people's minds to get themselves wound up About women in a conference talking about maintaining sex-based rights Or women talking about how we don't like to be referred to as womb havers Or cervix havers Or birthgivers But you see this is the problem with what passes the feminism today It's the kind of elite university feminism, right? That's had all of its kind of drive taken out of it. It's feminism for the rich I mean because of course the other way of seeing you know the protests outside Netflix or the protests outside public libraries where you're speaking is that Feminism is no longer The kind of feminism that's trying to lift up the woman working in the factory or the woman working at mcdonald's for minimum wage It is just a kind of luxury Like almost like a designer handbag that a very particular group of women Like to cloak themselves in but it's completely disconnected From the reality of the lives of the majority of women and girls That's the darker view of it, right? The optimistic view of it is Wow Things must be really great if people are debating shapelle jokes and the darker view of it Of course is this is a movement completely unmoored From the actual lives of women and girls as much as they talk all day about lived experiences And it's really just you know A luxury movement for a luxury class Yeah, you're absolutely right, you know I'm not interested in the glass ceiling, but I'm more interested in the women in the basement The women who are at the bottom of the ladder feminism is for all women But we have to prioritize feminism benefits all women But why the hell should we prioritize? Wealthy women who look down their noses at those of us doing the grassroots work And yet they're the women that often reject feminism when actually You know what male violence is the great leveler Because your privilege might protect you to a degree from some forms of male violence But it really doesn't protect you from misogyny When you're at it night when you're in a bar when you have your drinks spiked When your daughter gets prostituted because she ends up with a really nasty drug habit And she's had the misfortune to meet a pimp So although class is really crucial when we explain how women are vulnerable to male violence It's not the end. It's not the full picture You know, I write in the book about Going on a story for the observer magazine to a village called emojia in kenya Where I'd heard about a group of women who had escaped force marriage childhood marriage FGM domestic abuse and rape by the british gurkers that were stationed there They couldn't take the violence anymore. They weren't being schooled Because this was not what their community would allow an extremely patriarchal brutal culture And I went to visit this women-only Community that had been built by local women in order to help their girls thrive that these girls can go to school that they can be kept safe from being married to 11 in exchange for a cow by her father that they can escape being forced into polygamous marriages with Older men with dozens of children and loads of wives where her life is nothing but slavery So anyway, I went there and had the best trip of my life meeting these women Did a good story Story went viral. It was picked up by loads of journalists, which was a real um, you know how it goes berry A real honor to have other journalists looking at your story and following it with their own take except for the Australian Faux feminist in my view Clementine flor- sorry did I always call her fraud? um Clementine Ford She picked up on my story about these amazing women And decided that I was transphobic For writing about a women-only community Do you hear me berry? These were women that live in mud huts that they build With their own hands They have a stove and they cook dried beans their girls walk two kilometers to get water in the morning And she's talking about it being trans exclusionary. What the fuck I honestly could not believe what I was reading Just the disconnect of these women sitting in their ivory towers Writing this bullshit not even picking up you have to ask yourself why though What I don't know who this woman is that you just mentioned clementine But what's in it for her Australian columnists, right? She's an Australian columnist Right, so what's in it for her? It's not that she actually is wondering where are the trans women in the mud huts in this village It's her way of signaling to her audience. I'm not Julie Bindle. Julie Bindle's a baddie, but I'm a goodie, right? Totally that's exactly right What made it even funnier was that the day before I left the country and I've gone for my yellow fever jab And my editor who commissioned the piece a really lovely guy Who knew that the slurs of transphobia had followed me around that time for over a decade and he said to me Julie, I've got some bad news for you. Um The village elders have said that they can't receive you in emojia because of your transphobia And it took me seconds before I realized he was having me on he was joking So that happens and then clementine ford writes a piece which was beyond parody How the hell do you rationalize this? You're right. It is. I'm not Julie Bindle and I am one of the good ones I'm trans inclusive Let's get to sort of trans issues and turfism in a bit, but I want to focus on Real policy matters that are affecting women's lives here in the west So let's start with prostitution or sex work as is often called And there's two bills right now that are working their way through New York state legislature to decriminalize sex work And there was a recent op-ed in the New York times by a trans sex worker that put it this way. I'm going to read it to you We knew that the best way to help sex workers was not to decriminalize only their actions But also those of their clients the legal pressure that clients face is absorbed by sex workers A smaller client base means lower wages and poor working conditions With clients who are more likely to act in ways that make sex workers lives more difficult We believe criminalization of either side of the sex trade does not help protect sex workers But merely perpetuates the social stigma that treats sex work as an inherently harmful activity A stigma. I have long worked to eradicate now I usually do believe that it is an inherently harmful activity And I'd like you to make the case for me because I have to tell you I am sort of drawn to the idea similar to The abortion debate that you know sex work is going to happen anyway It's happened since the beginning of time pretty much And it's going to happen whether we regulate it or not so we may as well make it as safe as possible For the women Mostly women involved but for all sex workers. Tell me why that's wrong Tell me why it's an inherently harmful activity I mean I have worked with and interviewed now hundreds of women in the sex trade including many that have Exited prostitution And in fact, I conducted what remains the biggest piece of research On the barriers and opportunities of getting out of the sex trade And I think it's key we need to if we're going to criminalize the johns And we're going to decriminalize the women. We can't just leave it at that We can't just decide well, that's okay They're not going to be arrested and their lives are going to be just fine Because the social exclusion the poverty and the violence and coercion will still remain in their lives But the example i'm going to give is when I visited a brothel in navada Um, one of those brothels run by the late denis half. Thank god. He's dead Really horrendous human being and navada as you and your listeners will probably know Has a number of counties across the state where legal brothels are permitted And it's become a big tourist attraction and as a result of these legal brothels in navada everybody thinks that the entire state is Legalized is decriminalized is the wild west Hence will I first visited and went to my hotel in vegas I was immediately offered an 18 year old russian Prostituted woman to my room. I mean they don't care whether you're mad woman or beast. That's what's on offer Anyway, so I was doing some research in these brothels and denis half had clearly Chosen handpicked the women to speak to me and they had said yes, they would speak to me And I went to speak to one woman who will call Ivette who was Selling sex from the room In which she was living for six months solid these women do long Terms in these brothels and then take home the money and we're told it's a lot of money So she Prostituted from the room. She lived in that room. She slept in that room And the first thing I noticed when I walked in was a picture Of her in a pornographic pose and then the second thing I saw was a video playing pornography of her With john's on a loop So she said she was happy to talk to me and we chatted and I said look, you know I don't come to this with a blank slate. I campaign to eradicate men's entitlement in prostitution She said well, I disagree with you. She said I'm a feminist and I enjoy my work and You know, you can't tell me what to do with my body and it makes me angry when feminists say this and we talked and it was amicable And I listened and of course I didn't challenge her assertions and her points of view I heard her And so I said so are you john's are they are they nice men? Who are they? I'd met some of them in the bar and trust me They're the biggest walking advertisement for lesbianism that I've ever seen but anyway Um, as I said to her okay, so what are your john's like and she said they're nice. They're good looking. They smell good They treat me well. Hey Yeah, I even enjoy the sex so I said thank you very much for your time I appreciate it and then I took a another look around the room and I said Do you know what my bedroom at home? I've got books on the side. I've got a coffee cup from the night before I've got loads of shoes on the floor. I've got letters, you know my my room reflects me Um Yours is so clinically neat and tidy. Do you have any personal effects here with you bearing in mind? You're living here for months on end And she slowly opened the drawer Next to her bed and took out a framed photograph of a beautiful little girl probably about eight years old I think Showed me this picture but holding onto it and said this is my daughter She said but I don't leave it out For those dirty bastards to see I don't want those john's sperm hands touching my little girl And that told me everything I needed to hear And I think the harm sometimes is not the broken bones. It's not the dead body It's not even the HIV infection rates or the unwanted pregnancy or the drug and alcohol abuse It's the psychological Splitting of the self that so many women in prostitution have told me they have to do that they can't kiss their own children Because of what's been in their mouth that day Something's been in their mouth. They didn't want to have in their mouth They separate from their intimate sexual relationships with non john's Because it just gets into their head And they feel as one woman told me it's like paid rape So it's in gradations and all women have different experiences But the harm is so visible if you know what you're looking for as you're speaking I'm thinking about a brilliant woman who I interviewed recently for the podcast and She's enormously successful in both porn and sex work through only fans but also through in-person sex work and you know, she's Used to work in a factory like you did and like you she hated it And she talks about the work that she does now as being just So much better So much more in a way dignified. She's her own boss She decides her her hours what she will and won't do and she's on track to retire long before you and I ever will I think she would hear what you're saying and say well look at my life What was more harmful to me? having relentless hours in a windowless factory where I was essentially working as a robot in a broad machine We're doing this What would you say to that? I would accept her personal experience And I would believe her You know, it's not up to me to say that women are deluding themselves or that women Don't choose this or that they are the problem because they promote prostitution My perspective on this is of course she exists Of course there are women with that experience We can argue to look how's come home about Whether or not she's in a tiny minority or a sizable minority or whatever What we do know is that the vast majority of women in the system of prostitution Are the most disenfranchised girls and women and they're the ones that we have to actually consider When we devise policy and legislation Support and protection or deterrence for the johns My my point of view is this Prostitution isn't inevitable The world would not collapse. No one would be harmed if prostitution were not to exist tomorrow Men's penises would not drop off If they couldn't have the kind of sex that they wanted when they wanted with whom they wanted It would be fine men can go and get a real date or use their right hand The arguments about disabled men not being able to get a real date is offensive and inaccurate So I want to look at why we have A prostitution system that is so normalized that we're told we'll never get rid of it. We'll never eradicate it We don't say that about child poverty. We don't say it about rape either And yet we seem to accept that this will always be with us and I think if we if we ended male violence if patriarchy no longer existed The sex trade would die a death. It would be starved of oxygen And when I was in in a university I launched my book on prostitution in 2017 I was with a brilliant sex trade survivor Sabrina valise who campaigned for blanket decriminalisation of the sex trade In New Zealand in her native New Zealand And then when it came in she realized it only helped the johns and the pimps and the managers The women were still treated as badly if not worse than before because the police weren't involved at all It was just seen as a job. It became rape in the job became an employment tribunal issue, not even a criminal act So Sabrina came with me to talk to these students And the first thing I heard was a male student who said I've just done a shift in McDonald's to top up my student loan. So I'm working through my college course I was burned by hot fat. I was verbally abused by the manager. It was a grueling shift Why is sex work any worse than a shift in McDonald's? You get paid more Sabrina's answer to him was Okay See that man sitting next to you. You don't know if he's showered You don't know what his status is in terms of HIV You've no idea about his hygiene Take his dick in your mouth now And then take the one next to you up your ass Because that is what prostitution is And he went yeah, I think I'd rather work in McDonald's After the break julie and i take a deep dive into what exactly a turf is And why she thinks fighting with some trans activists is worth all the trouble Stay with us If my dogs could order what they want for dinner, they would choose pillows and my sandals 10 times out of 10 But their second choice. I'm sure would be food from the farmer's dog Say goodbye to those dry stale pellets. It's 2023 if your dog isn't on a custom meal plan You're doing it wrong The farmer's dog is fresh healthy food with home meat and veggies And the recipes are developed by vets and personalized to your pet You just provide your dogs details and for as little as $2 a day They'll receive customized meals delivered right to your doorstep Meals arrived in pre-portioned ready to serve packs and they're delivered on your schedule Now for the fun part My listeners get 50 off their first box of fresh healthy food at the farmers dog.com Bury plus you get free shipping just go to the farmers dog.com slash berry to get 50 off That's the farmers dog.com slash berry to get 50 off your first box plus free shipping julie Several times in this conversation so far the phrase turf has come up and This is a topic that seems to be tearing the feminist world apart from within And in fact has exploded into the broader culture Let's start with a simple question here. When did you first hear the word turf? I think he was around 2008 or nine, but I'd already been labeled as seriously Transphobic and when I heard turf I thought it was really interesting because a lot of men are violent towards Trans identified people outwardly visibly trans people in the way that they are to visibly Gay people or lesbians such as myself. We often have the same attackers And so therefore when trans people are murdered Or harmed It's bigoted males Almost every single case we've heard of are violent bigoted homophobic anti-trans males all of a sudden we've got an acronym for the first time in the history of Trans activism which has the words radical feminist in there so suddenly radical feminists the ones that Have a theory about male dominance and women's submission The ones that campaign to end rape that set up the first domestic violence shelters The ones like you in other words. Yes, feminists like me all of a sudden We are in the acronym. We are it radical feminists. So let's define what a turf what does turf stand for actually Trans exclusionary radical feminists So what how it came about was that feminists had said look come on We want trans people to have all the dignity in human rights that we are fighting for as women We will stand with our trans sisters and brothers In the face of any violence abuse and discrimination that goes without saying Of course feminists are concerned about other oppressed and marginalized people We always have been but we said look there's a problem here guys Because there's a clash of rights So when feminists in the 1960s and 70s fought to Bring about legislation that would mean we could have women only provision to protect us from male violence Yeah, of course most men aren't violent But enough of violent for it to be a concern in changing rooms in prisons in hospital wards And of course refuges So we said let's build refuges with no funding Let's build rate crisis centers And we're sorry to our trans sisters But you're going to have to build your own refugees because we can't accommodate natal males However, you live even if you live as the opposite sex Because women will recognize you as males unless of course They've lived in the opposite sex for decades. They've had every single medical and hormonal intervention And we wouldn't necessarily notice right but they are few and far between that end up in those situations So we said this is a clash of rights. We need to maintain our sex based legal rights and our refuges And they started saying You are transphobic. You are a bigot You don't mind when trans women are being raped and murdered. You won't even share your refuges And we said hey Build your own and we'll show you how to And we'll give you every bit of advice to do that And this is the debate that is sort of ripped apart Women's only spaces like I think about Lilith Fair, you know the famous feminist Music festival, but also, you know women's sports High school sports college sports professional sports. I mean this is the debate the question about whether or not trans women are women whether or not trans women should be accepted in female only spaces and I think it's a very complicated issue because it really pits two virtues against each other one being the virtue of inclusion but also it pits inclusion against the question of fairness and I'm just wondering Julie as someone who has been herself someone on the outs as feminist as a dyke as someone from the working class How do you understand? That movement in the most generous way possible and its desire to sort of be accepted somewhere So this is a key question and how I would answer it is by saying that trans people are wholly separate and different in terms of their demands and their attitude and their behaviors as our trans activists most of whom aren't even transgender and I suppose how I would approach the issue of anti-trans bigotry is as I said earlier to defend and protect trans women as a discriminated against minority and to say trans women are trans women third space is really important in this discussion because the trans activists are saying what's a third space Julie? So at the moment what we have is women only spaces, refuges and the like then we have mixed spaces and I don't mind going into a mixed sex bathroom in a bar in a pub in a restaurant so long as men watch the hygiene why should I care but a third space would be for trans people to choose if they wish to use that facility in other words they have a refuge they have a rape crisis center that we as feminists have long suggested we help them build that we help them design that we give them support to maintain and of course the extremists the activists don't want that but the majority of trans women that I speak to some of whom are my friends that's exactly what they want that's exactly the solution that they think we should be moving towards and the other solution would be this Barry you have trans women who have raped and abused women in female prisons on prison wings here in the UK I've interviewed two of those women who were raped by convicted male sex offenders who decided to transition during their time in a male prison the classic line in the Guardian newspaper when one of these rapes was reported was about a trans identified male called Karen White the line being the women could see her erect penis protruding from her stockings now as an Australian colleague of mine said when I did my book tour there when I read out that line her erect penis she said the only time the phrase her erect penis should be used is if a woman has castrated her rapist and she's holding it up as a trophy so okay I wouldn't necessarily go that far but she had a point so therefore what I would do as a lesbian as a feminist as a humanist is say to trans women we will help you we understand but it's a clash of rights right it is a clash of rights and it's hard and but I here's what I hear you saying let's put erect penises in in stockings to the side for a minute you're saying I think that women are women and that trans women are trans women and that's okay because diversity is a good thing and no good comes from papering over difference or pretending that we're all the same and let's fight for the rights of this group as this group is that what you're saying that's exactly what I'm saying when I was a young lesbian in that working-class community with all of the people not as them had benefited from a further education or liberal values and I was called pervert and a freak and I was asked constantly was I a man I wasn't a real woman because of course I was attracted to girls and not boys so I kind of have an inkling of understanding about how my trans sisters and brothers feel because they're on the margins of society what I really want is for the pressure to be on men in male prisons not to kick the heads in of trans women when they're in those prisons I don't want women in our prisons who are the most disenfranchised in society to have to be at risk of rape I want the trans women in men's prisons to be treated with courtesy not to be raped not to be beaten up by anti-trans male bigots because they're in no danger in women's prisons but women are in danger from convicted sex offenders that claim to be trans women and that is not acceptable so Julie you've obviously been branded as a turf and that's come with serious social costs for you from being disinvited from college campuses you've been physically attacked people claim all kinds of untrue things about you but sometimes I joke that all of England is a turf island you know you have obviously J.K. Rowling who blurb the cover of your book over here we have Margaret Atwood who's getting you know dragged right now for calling women women but you know there's also lesser known women whose lives are getting really unraveled by being branded as turf so I wanted to take the case of Kathleen Stock which is a story that's being covered in the British press but really hasn't penetrated over here. Kathleen Stock has attracted protests over her views on gender identification and last week was the victim of a poster campaign at the university's campus in Brighton accusing her of transphobia and suggesting she should be sacked. Posters have been put up around Sussex University calling for a professor Miss Stock to be fired. She's a philosophy professor at the University of Sussex she's a new book out called material girls and she has sort of been ringing the alarm on the risks of self-identification in other words you know the notion that anyone can claim they're a woman and enter women's spaces which is what we've been just been talking about but this month it kind of really boiled over at her university. Protesters on campus rallied together they called for her job they handed out leaflets calling her a transphobe they said fire Kathleen Stock until then you'll see us around and what's astonishing about this story although maybe it shouldn't be astonishing at this point is that Stock's own union instead of protecting her from this harassment they sent a letter her own union to the university asking the school to take a clear and strong stance against transphobia at Sussex to undertake an investigation into institutional transphobia. In meantime the police have told Kathleen Stock that she should install security cameras at her home and she should avoid her own campus for her safety. Why does a powerful union bend a knee to the will of as you put it in a recent op-ed a collection of pound shop antifas? Why isn't the union doing its job? Why isn't the university saying stop you know this is the place more than any other in a culture where we should be protecting free speech rights where we should be protecting freedom of conscience. You know why aren't her fellow professors going on Twitter and writing you know stop instead they're writing shame on Kathleen Stock and her transphobic ilk rather than saying enough what is going on here? Part of it is fear and cowardice because they've seen what's happened to me they've seen what's happened to other women that have been targeted in this way and that serves as a severe warning I'm lucky enough not to have a job as my mum's always saying when are you going to get a real job I'm a journalist and I don't have a stack of job and so they haven't been able to help me out of my job but there have been other consequences but the likes of Kathleen has to go on campus and teach so part of it is fear capitulation and cowardice but the other part of it I think is as worrying and it's this progressive men men on the left that have learned over the decades that it's not cool to be outwardly misogynistic it's not cool to make rape jokes it's not cool to talk about women's physical appearances call us too ugly to rape whatever they leave that to the the more blatant sexist but they've been kind of quite hemmed in because they resent the women making demands not all of these men by the way but the misogynistic ones wearing the cloak of respectability and progressiveness and they have been really curtailed in terms of their sexism this has given them a golden opportunity to be able to call us witches and bitches and worse and of course all under the banner of turf and still be seen as the good guys or as the journalist Dohan Jones said the right side of history but Julie what do you make of the fact that a lot of the a lot of the people you know protesting Kathleen Stock trying to push her out of the school or to use the example of Suzanne Moore your old colleague at the Guardian who was essentially pushed out of the paper for similar reasons a lot of the people doing the smearing and the shaming and the trying to get people de-platformed are themselves young women young women who no doubt identify as feminists I think those women can identify as feminists if they like they're not it's not feminist to hound women out of a job for saying that sex is real and that women's rights must be protected and women who speak out against misogyny which Kathleen Stock has Suzanne Moore Kathleen Stock is a very mild-mannered quite liberal academic philosopher I know Kathleen quite well she thinks my book's too radical I think her book's too liberal we're great friends it's a brilliant position to be in because we can tease each other with where we think we've gone wrong and we talk and we debate and we do that really old-fashioned thing do you remember this Barry disagreeing and still being friends yeah that's the word yeah that's how I felt when I read your book I'm like oh I really disagree with Julie way more than I thought but I love talking to her well and I feel the same about you but you probably disagree with me a bit more than I do with you but either way you you raise a really interesting crucial in that point about young women being really at the helm of this when I first started researching my book I got to talk to loads of young women some of whom had de-platformed me some of whom have been part of the gang at university saying no turf like Bindel on our turf she's a transphobe she's a swerve which for your listeners is sex worker exclusionary radical feminist so turf and swerve it sounds like a bad meal in a diner doesn't it but anyway I was called a whore phobe some of those women now come to me and say hey I'm sorry I did that I was wrong I believed it at the time but there were in these feminist societies where there were being drip fed a pho feminism that was a feminism for men is why I called my book feminism for women because it was all about pole dancing for exercise and sex work being empowering and choking and slapping and being spat out during sex was really erotic and I think that they had just realized that this kind of feminism wasn't going to liberate them and so those women on campus I think the other issue is what's happening with our universities right now is there's barely any kind of material reality being addressed by the academics it's all free floating postmodern queer theory and now because it's so expensive to go to university here there are barely any working-class students and the very quite privileged wealthy students are seeing university as a service as a business as opposed to a privileged place of learning where they're very lucky to have a higher education and so they they really are holding the strings when it comes to what happens in universities with certain lecturers and tutors and they're telling the university upper echelons who they want and they want tutors and lecturers that don't tell them anything that's going to trigger them don't teach them about rape for example without a trigger warning on the text don't teach them about racism and colonialism unless you remove all of the nasty words and and and subvert the actual historical facts and it's the same with the transphobia thing Kathleen has been very badly let down and it should come as a warning to every single person working not only in universities but working in the media working in any job whether it can be hounded out by these privileged unthinking individuals that have never heard a critical thought in their head and i'm absolutely bereft for them because they haven't been taught how to think critically about anything people are pandering to their every need and their every viewpoint one more break and then more with Julie Bindel on how to make feminism relevant once again to the working class stay with us with the lucky land sluts you can get lucky just

Julie we talked a little bit about Chappelle before and you know i keep watching these videos on repeat of you know highly educated grown adults well paid with amazing health care and parental leave and stock options. I'm out here because Dase Chappelle is harming our kids he doesn't realize that the speech that he's putting out there is harmful marching with little signs outside of Netflix they are promoting and causing hate conversation and also allowing people to think that it's okay to discriminate against those trans and non-binary individuals because of a stand up special yeah you don't have to be mean when you make jokes we will not stop until those demands are made yes yeah to me the broader point and this was made by a smart friend of mine that it's a little bit like he reminds me a little bit he said of hunger games like it's the fashions of people in the capital it really bears no relationship to reality to actual victims it's it's larping it's live action role playing it's it's sort of fakery but there is still as we've been obviously talking about in this conversation room for a muscular vision of feminism that actually focuses on the lives of women and girls so if the feminist movement had its head on straight what would the goals of it be what would the top three issues be if the feminist movement was run by Julie Bindel and Co well first of all sisterhood and solidarity that was really important because what we've been hit over the head with this past couple of decades maybe a bit more since post-modernism invaded the academy and leaked out into wider society so the kind of theory which is very abstract where they deny material reality per se not just about about women's biology thing that's happened is we've been told women have nothing in common women are divided by everything that white women are crying white tears when we're raped or when we're addressing male violence which in turn somehow affects trans women and somehow affects women of color we've been told that wealthy women don't need feminism at all we're also very well aware that the poorest women in society are left to their own devices when we ignore things like prostitution and the kind of systems of exploitation that eat up the most vulnerable women so we have to find a solidarity and we have to recognize that the only movement on the planet that centers women and girls is feminism but unfortunately and here's the rub we're three and a half billion that's a big group of women to say that we have something in common with right we're never going to do it we're never going to have a movement where we pretend and nor should we that we have so much in common but we do have one thing in common so here's my second thing male violence against women and girls and the fear of male violence against women and girls now that is the only thing on the planet that unites all women and girls there is no other thing we don't all have children some of us are poor some of us are educated some of us are heterosexual some of us are not some of us have different life experiences in the extreme but we all have understood that lesson that we grow up with we all understand what it feels like having a bit too much to drink coming back in a cab on our own and just wondering just wondering if something bad might happen or taking a different route home than through the park or feeling sick to our stomachs when we're in a lift with a man and the lift suddenly stops and we think okay anything could happen men don't have to fear that and so many of us I mean I think but it's just not just inevitable isn't that just isn't that just I mean it's horrible I felt it so many times I've crossed the street untold numbers of times but isn't that just inevitable meaning when I was reading your book the thing that struck me and this is where I think you genuinely are radical in the truest sense of that word is you seem to believe that all differences between men and women come from socialization that there isn't some kind of fundamental male and female nature I'm not saying that men are rapists by nature or sexual sultures by nature and that women are meek by nature but that there are things that are the result of evolutionary history and biology and DNA that does make us inclined in certain directions and that there is always going to be some amount of aggression and violence in men that is different to what is sort of the natural inclinations of women and I hear you writing in your book and I really wanted to ask you about it that no that's just the result of socialization and anything that doesn't any argument that doesn't acknowledge that it's just the result of socialization and the way we are socialized in a way is apologizing for this bad behavior. That's a fair point and I think that possibly I put that too simplistically and you're reading Carol Hovin's great book Testosterone which you know is so informative and educational and whether or not you kind of you know agree with all of her arguments my god did I learn so much from that book I mean I really wanted to take a hit of Testosterone you know just have we can easily procure that for you right now. I'm sure the internet is a great thing isn't it Barry but you're right you're right to pull me up on that I think simplistic kind of explanation of there being no differences between men and women there are differences there are biological and physical differences Testosterone as does estrogen plays a part in the way that we respond to each other it doesn't explain or excuse of course sexual violence towards women I mean men do fight men might even fight each other for the kind of best looking woman there's all kind of mating rituals that we go through and I think that there can be you know a rich kind of understanding of the differences between men and women without going down the route of explaining it explaining sexual violence yes I think you know and we have evolved and I think perhaps I want to put it like this we mustn't excuse male violence because there isn't a need or an inevitability about it we can live in a world without male violence however much testosterone or not somebody has coursing through their veins and I do think I've looked and looked and looked as a feminist over four decades for anything else that bonds women and girls and I think we need to come together on the basis of need and that need for me is to combat male violence so we can all live as free citizens and actually that men would benefit from having relationships with women as friends as colleagues as lovers as sons without that kind of sense that they could get away with it if they wanted to you know maybe this is something to try I also have to ask you know when reading your book I asked myself a few times am I a feminist because I've always identified as one my life is the result of feminist progress but I'm not a utopian and I am very very skeptical of utopian movements and you talk about in the book how feminism for you is not about the fight for equality per se it's about women's liberation from the patriarchy and you write explicitly it's a utopian movement so tell me Julie am I a feminist if I don't identify if I don't think of my feminism as being about a sort of utopian vision of toppling the patriarchy or eradicating hate and total women's liberation and a matriarchy am I a sufficient am I am I sufficiently feminist enough if I would be willing to settle for I don't know you know lack of violence against women and equality in all the places that we want to be and work and the sort of dignity and respect that's accorded to males of course you're a feminist in any movement we have radicals and we have others that have a different role within the movement and that practice feminism and that advance the cause of women through different means and that is the way that I see it there are anti-feminists who are calling themselves feminists in order to speak about issues with authority but they're not feminists they're anti-feminist whereas the feminism that you subscribe to you and probably the majority of women in the US in the UK that describe themselves as such you may not have a utopian vision and I hear what you're saying about the problems with that but you absolutely want the liberation of women from particular atrocities from a system that curtails our lives and our freedoms our role in the workplace wherever and there's room for hundreds of types of feminism Julie Bindel thank you so much thank you Barry it's been really great to talk to you thanks for listening and thanks so much to Julie if you've got story tips or guest suggestions visit us at honestlypod.com see you soon this episode of honestly is brought to you by Indeed if you're like me and scanning thousands of identical profiles on LinkedIn is not exactly your idea of a fun Saturday night use Indeed is the hiring partner you can count on to attract interview and hire all in one place indeed is the only job site where you're guaranteed to find quality applications that meet your must-have requirements or else you don't pay instead of spending hours on multiple job sites hoping to find candidates with the right skills use Indeed to help you find talent quick through tools such as instant match assessments and virtual interviews when you pay to post a job instant match immediately shows you candidates whose resumes fit your description so you can hire faster you pay only for the applications that meet your hiring criteria join more than three million businesses worldwide that use Indeed to hire great talent fast start hiring now with a limited time seventy five dollar sponsor job credit to upgrade your post at indeed.com slash honestly it's good for a limited time visit indeed.com slash honestly and tell them you heard about it on the podcast indeed.com slash honestly terms and conditions apply cost per application pricing not available for everyone"
