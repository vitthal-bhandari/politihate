    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Matt Walsh exposes the Woke Fox News and Tucker Carlson adds on to the dog pile. Another hero on the New York City subway gets charged with manslaughter and another state bans men from competing in women's sports because some of us are not totally insane. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news in Wyatt Matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and since Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News, it's been in my opinion difficult for anyone to justify watching the network at all. He was the last conservative bastion standing. Remember, this is supposedly a conservative network that forced employees working at their headquarters to get an experimental job, show proof of that job. And at one point, even eliminated the option of weekly COVID testing in lieu of the shot, something that Tucker, by the way, was able to avoid because he filmed from home. This is a network who platformed one of the OGs of trans culture, Caitlyn Jenner, as a reasonable gubernatorial candidate in California, a network who ran a series in June of 2022 called America Together LGBTQ Pride Month, which featured a transgender child who came out to her parents at five years old. The Fox correspondent interviewing the child and her family remarked on the family's extraordinary courage. Perhaps regular viewers of the network could chalk all these up to minor mistakes. Errors Fox would learn from because when it comes to legacy media, Fox News is as conservative as it gets. Well, according to Daily Wire host Matt Walsh's latest expose, there aren't any mistakes for Fox to learn from because Fox is simply showing you exactly who they really are. Matt uncovered internal documents from Fox Corporation attempting to indoctrinate employees and their kids into the LGBT cult and implementing woke DEI policies that they would use to determine employee advancement. In a screenshot, Matt shared of the Fox employee portal, the network encouraged all employees to donate in honor of Pride Month to organizations like The Trevor Project, Ali Forney Center, Andy Los Angeles LGBT Center, and encourage them to celebrate Pride all month long on the company Slack and Zoom by using Pride avatars and backgrounds. For reference, as Matt pointed out, The Trevor Project hosts a sexually explicit chatroom that connects children as young as 13 years old with LGBT adults and both the Ali Forney Center and the Los Angeles LGBT Center advocate for medical transition of children. But that's not all. Matt says, employees are also encouraged to expand their perspective by reading books by trans activists, including a memoir titled, Ferris, about a precocious boy who would grow up to become a woman. The same book apparently also includes references to a glory hole. By the way, if you don't know what that is, don't look it up. And it also includes a graphic scene of homosexual oral sex, just smacks of conservatism, don't you think? Now try this one on for size. Fox also encourages employees to read gay books to their children featuring characters who love glitter and sparkles and they come out as a unicorn. I can't think of anything more conservative than that. The network also partnered with extremely radical left ice cream company Ben and Jerry's to take an ice cream break and keep it cool with pride. But maybe the most egregious of all, Fox experimented with a woke AI platform called Escalera, which tracks employees commitment to the cult of DEI by helping them engage in activities that will deepen their understanding and identity and explore more nuanced DNI concepts. Escalera pulls in data from sources that include email and payroll systems and generates both a peer comfort index and a diversity index based in part on how often employees practice micro affirmations. The data can then be used in the company's own words as leverage to engage employees in career growth opportunities. In other words, if you want to advance your career at Fox News, you must bow at the altar of Wokeism. Does any of this sound conservative to you? Does this sound like a company who truly gets the average conservative or even cares to? This is a company who is feeding you content for clicks for advertiser money based on what they know is important to you. Oh look, there's a drag show at a high school. Let's throw that on the website. That'll get clicks. Oh, look over here. A D transition Navy Seal is warning about child transition, something we actually advocate for behind the scenes, but put it on the front page. That'll get the clicks. They're using you for profits that they will then turn around and put towards advancing their cause, which as you can see, totally aligns with the radical left. And as Maya Angelou famously said once, when someone shows you who they really are, believe them. Here to discuss this and more, we have Eric July, founder and owner of Ripaverse Comics. Eric, obviously you are someone who sees the need for creating this parallel economy, for contributing to the parallel economy with all of this Wokeism going on in comic books. Obviously here at Blaze Media, Glenn Beck saw the need to provide the consumer with an alternative. And when you see stuff like this, it becomes extremely apparent that all of these mainstream companies, they really are all the same at the end of the day, aren't they? Yeah, it's just like varying degrees more so of that spectrum is more so what it is to get. And not to plug my own thing, but this is why I do the Ripaverse. This is why it's specifically a thing. And this is why you have stuff like the Blaze. And I think to me, that's the way of the future. I'm getting to that here in a little bit, but I'm not at all surprised about Fox in their sort of position. And you put it perfectly because what they have done is really position themselves as, hey, we're the most conservative of the legacy media, even with some of their, like even not just conservative libertarian stuff as well, because they had definitely through the other forms of Fox, where you got like Fox business and all that stuff. You've had John Stostles of the world, Judge and App, you know, notorious libertarians on there, they've tried to kind of present that. And it seems that there's been an acceleration, sort of in this change that seems to fit the bill or the same bill that we see with the other companies and what they're pushing for with diversity, equity and all this other stuff, and that being the way of the future. Now, look, if that's going to be what they're going to be, I say act accordingly. I continue to tell people to act accordingly. This is why the alternatives are necessary. Now, I need people to understand there's a certain level of status quo that comes with anything that's legacy, whether it be news, whether it be entertainment, whether it be anything that you just look at, consume as a customer or whatever it is, the stuff that's been established and is existed for decades, they have their way of doing things. And there are people that benefit, especially people, and this is the folks that you got to watch out for, the people that act as if they are kind of on your side, but they're still kind of right in the middle of a lot of that legacy stuff. So it's more of like, hey, look at us. If you support us, well, you're supporting the fist in the air alternative, but really, again, it's just varying degrees of the same exact thing. So there are so many folks that are protective of that status quo and protecting that, because there's a level of uncertainty that happens in the event that, let's say, for example, there is no Fox or Fox is it doesn't have the pool it wants had. The same thing can be said for Marvel DC in our case. People are like, well, if they fall, the folks that have worked so hard to get in the industry, like let's say commentators in the conservative space, they look at Fox like, I can't get any higher than that, right? It's going to be a nice little paycheck. I'm going to have the most eyes I can possibly can anywhere else I'm going to hit a ceiling. So if they fall in any way, there's a level of uncertainty that a lot of folks aren't ready for and they don't welcome me. I love that stuff. If even if I didn't have a spot on the other side of this sort of more decentralized form of media, it works for me. I think the legacy stuff needs to fall. It's outdated. It's archaic. It's rotten and it needs to go. So people need to start acting accordingly as customers, as viewers. There's plenty of alternatives out there. And maybe on the other side, you're not going to see a mega corporation worth trillions of billions of dollars. Maybe that's not going to happen. Maybe it's going to be some wildly successful ones, but it won't look like it had before. Welcome it. Embrace it. There's going to give people more options. The customers win when it comes to that, but don't don't allow just because well, they're the biggest guys of the legacy media that seem to at least highlight our views. Right. You know what I mean? We have to have them be as as prominent as what they what they once were. And I just don't believe that should be the case. Yeah, you have to ask yourselves, when is enough enough? Just because their legacy media is that really worth holding up a company who forced a jab on all of their employees, who, you know, whose main shareholders, here's top institutional holders for Fox is a Vanguard group and BlackRock. I didn't even know that. That should have excluded them off-road. I don't want to do that. Do you I mean a company who fired Tucker Carlson for being like too conservative, I guess, and telling the truth too much, a company who here's another one that Tucker talked about last night in his Tucker on Twitter monologue. He said that I don't know if you saw the the Chiron on Fox News as Joe Biden was giving a speech and Donald Trump was giving a speech after he had been arrested for the second time. It said wannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested. Now these were Chiron, you know, the similar Chiron's were displayed during Tucker Carlson's show when he was at Fox all the time, just poking fun at some of these people who absolutely deserved to have that, you know, poked fun at them. So Tucker revealed that the producer who did that, who put the Chiron wannabe dictator, actually was punished by the channel and resigned less than 24 hours later. When he resigned, he offered to the channel, hey, as with most other employees, I'm happy to like still be here for the my two weeks, right? Like I'll be here for two weeks. I don't want to leave you an alert and Fox said no, actually we just would prefer that you just leave. So it's just fascinating because it's like you guys, I think that maybe they're so arrogant that they think that well we're on, we're mainstream media and we're the only one left. So viewers have to watch us as if places like Blaze and Daily Wire and you know, maybe someone else will pop up after this Tucker going on Twitter, like as if those alternatives don't exist because I can't think of anything other than a slap in the face to their own viewers that they would be thinking by punishing someone who wrote something calling Joe Biden a wannabe dictator, which I would argue is incorrect only because it says wannabe and in many cases he already is. Yeah, that's the intriguing part of it. And I think people, because they're so caught up on that status quo and protection of the legacy stuff that they think that it's totally unreasonable that someone can replace it or multiple entities can sort of replace that, I guess that void or fill in that void if let's say Fox fail. And I don't understand it because there's too many alternatives that also exist, but that are wildly successful. I just remember the people trying to talk me off the ledge before I kind of, it wasn't really a list, they were the ones walking off it and I was more looking at like, I'm not walking off the ledge with you. And the comic book industry and providing an alternative and people look at it like, well, there's no way that you'll ever be competitive, right? You're the new kid on the block, these guys, these companies have been around for and they're not incorrect longer than your mother has been alive. There's no way that you'll be able to compete. And then they thought we just kind of caught lightning in the bottle with ISOM number one, right, a $3.7 million campaign. And now we're going through ISOM two right now, which is already closing in on $1.5 million right now. And it just dropped Monday. So it's showing that, and by the way, to put those numbers in the perspective and the great Chuck Dixon prolific form, a former Batman writer was talking about this with me yesterday, the books of our size, Marvel and DC, this is selling the close to what it is that we sell. We destroyed them. We destroyed, we were already closing in on like 20,000 books. So for their graphic novels, they don't do anything. They don't have that. They don't do their top ones of whatever month don't even do have that. So we're not in, it's not that we're competing. We're doing better than what they, what it is that they are. The same thing can be said in this outlet. In fact, it's the easiest way. It's too many different, the rumbles, the YouTubes and the Twitters and all these different ways to connect with your audience, direct line of sight, legacy media is falling anyway. On the left, we see what's happening with C and N. They getting better. I mean, water doesn't know what to do with that platform. I might as well just cut the losses because there's no way they're making money off of C and N. So it's a failing entity, or declining one, let's say that, in comparison to what it had been doing before. There's no better time than now for Fox to be replaced. So when they tell you exactly who it is that you are, and they say, you know what, on the surface it might look like we support you, but all that stuff that y'all been calling rotten for all this time, not only are we, no, it's worse because they're like, implementing it within their own company and certainly applying it to its employees. That's worse. That's not about as worse as you can get. It's one thing to like cosign it's another to be like, well, not only are we on the cosign it, but we're also going to implement it in within our own company. Screw them. That should be the approach to companies when they tell on themselves, we see what happens. They can lose billions of dollars. They do not have to exist and be on top forever. Okay. So speaking of your comics, tell everyone where they can find Oh, by the way, yeah. I saw tools, a preorder campaign, rip a verse.com, R-I-P-P-A-V-E-R-S-E.com. You can then visit the campaign page and get in. It's a preorder. We start fulfillment at the end of next month on the 31st. So it's a little preorder campaign. You can also get caught up if you are late to the party and you didn't get I-Sum number one, you can get that as well. We have a catch up bundle where you can bundle books, saw kinds of merchandise, all sorts of stuff. And what we are doing is trying to provide an alternative within the comic book industry. And entertainment. We put out our first animation by the way, you guys that also want to check that out in Riververse Studios. I'm trying to, I'm trying. I'm doing everything that it is that I can to not just grab about the problem like I always used to do on YouTube, screaming and the screeching and hollering instead of begging for them to accept us and change. I just said, yeah, how about I do it myself? Yeah, I mean, you still do scream a little bit though. That's true. I mean, you come here and scream. That's true. I do do that. I'm screaming actually. I did a voice acting for I-Sum in the end. You did scream there. I was certainly screaming there. So I haven't stopped screaming. I haven't stopped screaming. By the way, that animation is sick. Like the the graph, it's really, it's big time. So it looks great. Congratulations. And I would be remiss if I didn't plug Blaze TV.

All right, we got to take a quick break. We will be back with more. But want to thank our sponsor, this segment, Jase Medical. So a lot of people, you know, you think about emergency food preparedness and you think about, well, if something happens, we have to be prepared. What do we need? We need food and we need water. Not so fast. You know, what else you need is medicines, specifically antibiotics because you use these for so many different things, you know, ear infection, respiratory infection, skin infection, all these different things that you, when you need antibiotics, you really need them. And most people don't realize a lot of our medicines, specifically antibiotics too, are manufactured in places like China, India, places that if something were to happen, if there were to be a global catastrophe or even just a national catastrophe in those countries, they're going to either take care of themselves first or they're not going to have anyone to actually produce the medication. And it's going to leave you stuck in a lurch. Do not do that. Make sure that you are prepared with the Jase case from Jase Medical. It's a pack of five different antibiotics, five different courses of antibiotics that you can use to treat a long list of all of these bacterial illnesses that I told you about before. So just make sure that you are ready for shortages. Make sure you're ready. You can use it for traveling. It's great for traveling and it's great for the busy mom like me who, if you have a kid who always gets the same type of respiratory infection, always gets ear infections, always gets something that you're like, I know when my kid is sick, it's like clockwork. I don't have time to go to the pharmacy, to go to the doctor, to get the prescription. I don't have the time. I know my kid. I need this medication now so I can be prepared.

A New York man was arrested yesterday and accused of fatally stabbing an ex-convict who punched his girlfriend on a J-train on, that is of course the subway, this is Jordan Williams who was arrested. They were on, he was on the New York J-train with his girlfriend when they were confronted by 36-year-old. I don't even know how to pronounce his name but the thing that you need to know about this is that he is apparently an illegal immigrant who had a rap sheet. I don't know why he was still here if he was an ex-con but he was harassing commuters aboard the train. Sounds familiar? Sounds a whole lot like the Daniel Penny case and Jordan Neely who was of course we spoke about I believe it was yesterday who he of course Daniel Penny is being charged with manslaughter for defending the passengers after Jordan Neely was acting erratically. Well this one was even more egregious so this guy was harassing commuters aboard the train and Jordan Williams stepped in to get the man away from his girlfriend when the man punched his girlfriend in the face and so to defend his girlfriend against this obvious aggressive behavior against this assault he removed his folding knife stabbed the man in the chest the man got off the train and later died from the stab wounds and Jordan and his girlfriend stayed on the train until the cops caught up with them later down the line. Another passenger recorded the event and eyewitnesses corroborated the claims that this man was aggressive to the couple but in New York City it doesn't matter because you're not allowed to defend yourself you're not allowed to defend others and so he was arrested and then later he was there's a rumor going around that he was released and the charges were dropped he was not released with the charges dropped he was released without bail because the judge felt that he was not a flight risk he absolutely is still being charged with manslaughter and he could face up to 26 years in prison if he is found guilty his attorney by the way told the court that he works for FedEx he's never been in legal trouble before they say he's a gentle soul in the community this situation escalated and it was by no fault of his own and he was in the precarious position where you either sit there and get assaulted and let all the people get assaulted or you eventually stand up for yourself and you get arrested by the way his mother has set up a give send go for his legal fund you can find it over at give send go dot com slash g a r 77 it's getting really scary in big cities specifically I mean I say big cities I feel like I shouldn't have to say big democrat cities because it's kind of redundant if you're in a big city it is overwhelmingly democrat that is going to be and you know I mean I guess you could make the argument that like this is being treated differently in the instance that you know Daniel Penny there was wall-to-wall coverage you had to dig deep to find this particular story because I would imagine maybe because it's not as exciting when it's a black guy who is standing up against this aggressive person because you can't make the race argument but I mean this is black or black or white or whatever color you are you're still going to get arrested if you defend yourself that's the important part that people had long needed to understand man it's his it's never been a black and white issue right with stuff like this and across the self-defensive if for whatever reason you live in an area where they basically criminalize you defending yourself and the people around you it doesn't matter what you are you're going to unfortunately get get arrested and what stuff like this the thing that's so uh it's so frustrating because people that have been in definitely physical conflicts you understand that you got to act quick because you never know and to me when you are an aggressor you forfeit anybody giving you the benefit of the doubt it's the same argument where people feel some kind of way and that's the argument that they're going to make is like will he pull out a knife and this is a more so overreaction it doesn't fit the crime as if he's supposed to analyze this whole situation and slow motion and and give this guy the benefit of the doubt it's the equivalent of of people that get angry when someone gets killed because they try out to let's say rob a house and they were like well it's just stuff right right it's like first of all if you invaded in someone's personal space they have no idea what it is that your intentions are what you're capable of doing and they don't owe that to you the great mary rothborn who ironically enough i'm wearing a shirt with his face on i just realized that but he he had once said you know when dealing with an act of aggression a deadly invasion of any sort you have every single right and is perfectly reasonable essentially to treat it as if every invasion is going to be a deadly one because you don't know exactly you have no idea so when there's a clear cut example of flat out aggression like that's what an act of aggression is right it's not it's not something definitely in this case and definitely in the case of private property rights it's a something they didn't provoke you you were out of your mind or you just felt like being an idiot whatever the reason was you are the aggressor nobody you initiated the conflict let's say that so if someone deals with you accordingly especially when you get in physical with someone else's like this is what we want we're talking about masculinity all the damn time i'm definitely here on this uh uh on this station you know what i mean and you'd expect the man to act accordingly this is woman you gonna punch i could imagine someone punching my wife that's probably how that person's gonna end up but i live in a city where i get to carry something that's far more deadly let's say than a knife yeah but on a serious note you don't know that in that given circumstance especially in somewhere like New York city man who knows what this person's gonna do just like what happened with the joy-nilly situation who knows what this uh uh this person's gonna do so i hate to see stories like this and i'm glad that you know obviously getting the support it is that they that they're getting but i would hate to see what do you say like 27 years he can face up to that i would hate to see this young man go to prison for defending himself and rather his woman from some idiot man that that'd be a power man to be a crunch yeah i mean it's you understand why as you mentioned we are constantly talking about the lack of masculinity in the average american male these days and it's like sometimes you see stories like this all the time and you're like i mean if he's punching out your woman you're gonna react if you're a bystander and you are a man who has a family and you want to make sure that you go home to your family and don't get arrested for standing up for a stranger i can kind of understand why someone would just sit back and let it happen i'm not saying it's the right decision to make but i am saying i can understand the the thought process of like well i don't want to get arrested i don't want to go to jail i'm gonna leave my kids and my family for a complete stranger i can understand why they would come to that conclusion and i couldn't blame them for it well yeah i mean that's the that's the criminal thing about those laws in itself that have criminal lives self-defense i think last week i was just talking about the sum of love in 2020 and the people that got arrested for defending their property um it's a it's a crime shame but that's what happens and this is why the crime is as rampant as it is in a lot of these areas because they basically said that the only people that are justified to act accordingly are the police that's it a lot of these issues sort of solve themselves definitely when you deal with a bunch of idiots roaming the streets that type of stuff gets resolved we don't i guess that's why the laws exist because then you have people that are heavily relying upon the state right so what war with the state one they certainly wouldn't want that they wouldn't want a situation where people are allowed and more free to protect themselves and not have to find the need for them right right they wouldn't want that at all so i think that's why those laws certainly exist uh in the first place but to your point it's why the crime would continue to rise because people you see this with even it's something as simple as theft like in places which i often have to be left this areas where you can't act right you can't stop a shop lifter you can't do this and you can't do that so what happens the crime then goes up and people still more because they don't fear any sort of consequence yep that's just how it happens so these issues would resolve themselves if you got rid of those laws and just allow people to reasonably protect themselves um all right we got to take another quick break we'll be back with more but we want to think our spots are collective so sometimes you hear something and it sounds you know you're like ah that's too good to be true but in this particular case what i'm about to tell you is correct it's absolutely real you can save an average of ten

Phil Robertson here they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days well my story is about as messy as they come but it turns out our movie The Blind is reaching a mighty throng out there you break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear you're never too far gone God can reach you wherever you are no matter how dark things have gotten if you're lost he can give you refuge if you weary he can bring you strength it was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie I know the embarrassment was worth it I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around on the blind today at blaze tv.com slash the blind Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a new bill into law that will protect Texas women from biological men competing in their sports this is SB 15 also known as the Save Women's Sports Act and it requires athletes to compete in gendered competitions based on what is on their birth certificate I believe this is only college athletes but you know it's something here is a video of Abbott signing the bill watch. Women's sports are being threatened some women are being forced to play against biological men women's college athletic teams are being threatened collegiate records that women set are being threatened women's sports women's records women's teams women's dressing rooms all are jeopardized when men are allowed to compete for those teams sometimes do you hear something like that and you're like how did we get to the place where that even needed to be said I mean it just listen to the words that are coming out of his mouth women should be protected they're from men coming into their dressing rooms competing in their sports stealing their scholarships like I'm like it's so we I feel like I'm living in the twilight zone that we have to have governors sign bills into law and say things like that that five minutes ago we all agreed was completely reasonable well that's that's proof of the culture of rot actually despised something like this would even have to go to the government or be be resolved or feel of people feel like it has to be resolved by the government that's just stupid but culturally that's kind of where where we're at a bunch of stupidity and putting this into perspective guys like it's fun I was just talking about this with uh tracking field on one of our shows previous previously this week we're talking about how like some of these tracking field records you know like the hundred meters and 200 meters they've been around for a while setting like the 80s and they haven't even got close that's funny it's like view allowed man to participate though in these sports world records NCAA records would be shattered you know because uh Flojo has the world record for example in the hundred meters I think she ran 1049 well I ran 1044 you know what I mean and nobody's gotten close to her but if they allowed guys and I was a grand I was a pretty good at good tracking field athlete I wasn't the best you know I was regional qualifier I wasn't a national qualifier but you know if somehow one of those guys these guys out here running 10-3 and below well you wanted to identify as such they would destroy those records they wouldn't even be close and I guess maybe that's what it would have to take in some of these other states for people to wake up and be like okay this is unreasonable the fact that people have been so I've been going along with this array because people are rather the sanctity of their sport be destroyed then be called a bigot or a transfer which is how sad it is but shows how this little sort of rainbow mafia coalition if you will how powerful that they are what people we dealt with that with the Leah Thomas thing right it was like now we got more people speaking up about it but she's already broke up records in one what we all doing the case they were doing it in a non as a mislead because nobody wanted to say anything why because they were afraid that they would be called all of these names now think about that think about that like you think it's I rather this this whole entire sport get absolutely destroyed then people daring to suggest that I'm a transfer and until people start being unapologetic and calling this goofiness for what it absolutely is it's not gonna end they're gonna keep pushing the envelope they're gonna keep going as far as they realistically can I mean here we are talking about it on the show every other week the concept of a trans kids for example right that's how crazy it's got why because well we kind of talking around the issue and people don't want to be called a transfer of war big hit or whatever isms and all that sort of stuff screw all that start calling this goofiness for what it is speaking of a good craziness so Miami mayor this is mayor Francis Suarez he is putting his hat in the ring for president on the GOP ticket now I just so you know who you're dealing with here I want to show you a tweet that he tweeted out about pride month wearing this cute little gay sash he said june is pride month what began as a statement of defiance against outdated laws now serves as a reminder and commemoration of where this movement all began over 50 years ago as the mayor of Miami I stand with the lgbtq plus community in celebrating all month long looks like a guy who probably belongs on fox news I'll say that I mean i'm gay i tend to agree that is pretty gay but this is the i'm like this is the absolute state of the mainstream republican party i mean i get it it's Miami but he is a mayor true and he's putting himself on the GOP ticket putting posts like that yeah i mean look what's that hold on hold on what self-respecting straight man would wear it not just something with pride but a sash a sash a gay sash that's what that was the point that i was about to make like it'd be one thing if he was just gay i know you said i had to read because i don't know he i mean he's a he's a pretty man so i wasn't sure but i did look up that he is straight he has a family right well that's what i'm saying it'd be one thing if that were the case like he was just gay right you know what i mean and i don't care well then you would expect him to wear a sash well even then though it would be like i just don't understand this whole like obsession i mean we'll get we've given this community an entire month um and it is what it is but the fact that people wear it on their sleeves or the sashes and talk about this as if this is like so uber important it's like i get it he's a politician i guess that's what the way they look at votes and how they have to gain some sort of support but it's just that should be to me the most or the least interesting thing about you right or at least interesting thing that you care about i don't care where you at on i can't keep up with the amount of genders and all that stuff but wherever you are it should be it shouldn't be a thing that you're leading with but every month i guess it kind of has people outing it well every time this month comes around outing themselves and i'm like man if you're gonna leave with that we will see this and everything everything's turning the rainbow stuff we got uh talking about comic books dc pride is going on and all these gay characters i don't know if you we probably should have did a show about that i should have even know yeah so dc pride is a thing but there's two characters who had been gay in the comics and they had nerd a post something i know a little bit of a side note but they hadn't nerd a post something that's it something along the lines like for the kids in that post and it had two men kissing obviously wait a minute wait a minute like okay i guess hey goes for the rip of russian but but no seriously like they're leading with all that stuff and i think at this point it's starting to turn people off so probably that guy's political career is dead on arrival once people discover that and that gets shared around especially conservative circles yeah well that's uh really if you straight i don't know man i'm i'm gonna have to i don't i don't know if he's straight erd means a fact check on that all right we got to take a break we'll be back all right it is friday you know what that means that means we have another edition of dear sarah because diorabi's dead so if you need advice you don't need to i mean you could email abby but you're not going to get a response from her you so you might as well email dear sarah at the blaze dot com we're giving out all sorts of life advice dating advice tips what do you do if your husband's cheating on you or anything dear sarah at the blaze dot com today's is uh dear sarah why are most modern american women insane oh boy as a man attracted to real women sad that you had to give that qualifier there uh as a man attracted to real women i have watched a mass of women grow increasingly nutty over the last 20 years normally as such as such women enter their forties they would start collecting cats and precious moments figures and old newspapers but the current crop of becoming 40 some things seem so off their rockers that the cats run away since cats are too smart to hang around these women carry small dogs in their purses because small dogs are too dumb to know any better wow that's really true in summary do you know where i should look for women who are genuinely hot i don't want a supermodel i just want a sane woman who weighs less than i do sincerely desperately seeking sane women um well first of all that was funny uh second of all i would say look if you want a sane woman who weighs less than you do the first thought that comes to mind might be the gym i mean well let me let me clarify here the gym but not in january because that's when all the fat people go to the gym saying that they want they have a new year's resolution to lose weight and then they just kind of trail off uh and stop going maybe february march so i would say now is the perfect time to start going to the gym and finding those women who actually care about their fitness and perhaps you will find one uh that is sane because i don't think that the blue haired uh let me just i'm gonna put it as delicately as i can when i go undercover at the events that i go to um i don't think many of those people are going to the gym i'm just gonna just bait just bait just based on what i'm seeing yes i am judging a book by its cover but this is a physicality issue so i know no other way to judge other than buy its cover you can go to the gym or to church don't use a dating app i can tell you that much eric what do you think yeah that's gonna be tough i mean maybe if you go to gym and you go to some of those classes maybe you link up with someone that way but yeah uh it's a daunting task man women are back crap crazy uh definitely an r-age group younger man so you know it's gonna be slum pickings out there um yeah obviously stay away from the leftists um that's gonna be the best way you can do it is do what i did my my woman was uh more so apolitical before i got but i also got a shower many many many years ago so it wasn't as crazy i could imagine being in that jungle this these days man it it has to suck but yeah i look like the idea of the church i do like the idea of the um you know maybe gym going in some classes and doing stuff like that but stay away from the neon colored hair in the leftists because uh that's going to be a recipe for disaster even if they seem somewhat rational trust me it's a ticket tom bah or maybe a uh political event yeah that's a go once a lot of ones that go yeah you would know that sure a lot of conservative women that aren't part of 300 pounds and are also very cute and conservative so there you go we've got one more on the aspect of dating it says dear sarah there's a girl that i really like uh whom i have recently whom i have been on a date with once recently yet has now friendzoned me i want to try and persist with the relationship as before we dated we hit it off really well when we first met we are still very good friends and message each other daily what is the best way to stay persistent without coming off as desperate or needy sincerely friendzoned aussie i mean i would say just i want eric to answer this one but i would say pick up on the like try to read into the context who's a little bit if you're messaging each other daily but she's taking hours and hours and hours to respond to you i would give it some i would give it a breather i would i would give her some space not that i'm telling you to play a game but it would be interesting to see how she responds when you do give her a little bit of space because she may decide oh wait i wasn't enjoying that attention that you just gave me um maybe i wanted but you don't want to do that forever because playing games is not the right way to uh to get into a relationship so i would say pick up on the context clues um try to allow you try to allow those to guide you because it is a delicate balance not wanting to come off as too needy too clingy when you're a friend but i will give you some encouragement um i you know once had a best friend and he was my very best friend and we talked every day um all day and then i you know i we fought it for a while and then i ended up marrying him and he's directing my show right now so hi so there is hope even though you are friends don't let that discourage you eric what do you think that was a tough one man but you know the whole games thing i don't you don't think you should play this yeah you don't want to play games and that aspect if you've done everything that you could make it obviously obvious that you're you're interested in nay night right yeah i agree with you on taking a little step back and if she's like all right well doing still gonna do her own thing then it's it's time to move on but whatever you do don't play these damn games yeah if that if that's how it is every single time where you back up and then she's all of a sudden like oh nevermind hey what are you doing where have you been but then once you persist yeah and then she's back yeah yeah you don't want to play that game you don't want a girl that's gonna play games you need someone to shoot you straight um and be an adult about things all right uh that's it for this week's edition of dear sarah we'll be right back so joe biden the other day was on stage with actress eva longoria at a screening of her latest movie and made a really creepy joke about knowing her when she was 17 and he was 40 watch my name's joe biden i'm joe biden's husband thank you for that introduction and congratulations i accept your debut as a director adding another accomplishment an already incredible career he's been done until a long time she was 17 i was 40 that's it it's not the first time by the way that he has made a weird joke like that about another woman and then trails off and says well anyway um but that wasn't the creepiest moment he actually there was like a very weird creepy linger when he was touching eva longoria uh let's watch she's like you know when a woman is uncomfortable they do the mmm no thank you all right but i'm on stage in front of people so i'm gonna pretend it didn't happen wow that was clearly the reaction it's not a secret if she was clearly like oh okay well i mean i guess the upside is that she's not a child you because usually when he does that he does the linger in the smell it's with a young child true so maybe we can give him bonus points that it's with a it's with a an adult this time well and he also started that whole deal with him being it what do you say i'm joe biden's husband or something yeah one little joe biden a long bill for
