We have Biden world freaking out because they realize that everybody understands how bad they are at running the country, the polls show it, everybody shows it, and now the narratives are working at cross purposes because they can't even get the story straight plus Canada takes a big step in the gun grabber direction because Justin Trudeau of course is a anti-self defense anti-right to bear arms lunatic. And we've also got 70% of the nation's baby formula still out of stock and children's learning loss in the pandemic wasn't just reading and math, it was also emotional and social skills. Store in the New York Times dealing with that. I don't like saying I told you so about such serious things and you all believed me all along but to the lives out there, we told you so and that is the reality of the situation. We'll dive into all this in a second. Look, if you run a small business, you got to have a very good answer to who's running your HR, right? Who's running it? If the answer is I'm going to figure it out myself or maybe even no one, guess what? One employee complaint can turn your world upside down. HR is not just about avoiding risk though.

You want to actually have a plan in place for your HR. Trust me on that one. So Biden's having a rough one. NBC News. When I say a rough one, I don't mean a rough day, rough week. I mean a rough presidency. Biden is having a rough presidency. And you see why the people around him are incompetent zealots. The people that are making decisions on his behalf aren't really any better than he is. And as we know, he is in decline. That much is obvious. There's an NBC story and they're trying so hard to come up with something. It's not Biden's fault. He's a good president. They're trying. They want to come up with something. He's great. He's Biden. And they can't. So they have things like this. Any assessment of Biden's performance needs to take into account the epic challenges that he faced from the start. What are these epic challenges that every president doesn't, uh, does not have to face? I'm just, I'm just wondering he was given the vaccine. I remember the vaccine that was supposed to be the end of COVID. It wasn't the end of COVID, as we all know, obviously, but it was much better than what Trump had to deal with. And yet more people died under Biden's first year in office, the second year of the pandemic, then died under Trump, his last year in office, the first year of the pandemic, which obviously isn't what one would expect unless you realize Democrats hold, I'm not going to shut down the economy. I'm going to shut down the virus. Yeah. Good old Joe, given the same story, you know, we're in the same suits, given the same grin, same shouty, and whispery, then whispery. It's the same song and dance from this guy for 40 years, folks. You go back and look at this in the same shtick. This guy is a sub mediocrity, intellectually, ethically, professionally. I don't care that he's president, he's president because the Democrats found the nearest warm body that they could make president during a pandemic year. And they said, yeah, this guy, he's got name recognition. Let's go for it. And they lied and lied and lied about Trump Russia collusion. They changed the election laws in different states so they could get away with all kinds of shenanigans. And here we are. And now we're supposed to say, Oh, wow, who could have seen this coming? Everybody saw it coming. Everyone saw this coming who has a brain. Democrats are all, man, maybe he wasn't really the safer. He thought he was. No, turns out he's not. This is all from this NBC piece, by the way, at a meeting with advisors about a month ago, Biden was surprised to see polling that indicated he had dropped among suburban women. Oh, you mean the whole they're going to take away your birth control. Roe v. Wade, all that fear mongering. Doesn't actually move the needle politically turns out the country doesn't agree with the Democratic extremist position on not only not only the issue of abortion and protecting the rights of the unborn, the Democrat party is extreme on that. They are all nine months of a pregnancy, as you know, but there are other things that suburban women do care about. Now, we're never going to win over the unhappy feminist cat ladies who sit around watching the view and MSNBC and thinking that they're getting honest journalism or whatever. That's never going to happen. But to the women out there who are like, look, I just want to be able to pay my bills for my household. I want the kids to be safe on the streets. I want there to be baby formula on the shelves. They have to look at this Biden administration and say, well, this is a mess. They look at inflation being the worst that is in 40 years. And Joe Biden's big plan was to spend more money like a lunatic bill back better here. I'm going to build back better. No, he's not. It's a mess. Guys, a mess. We all know it. You know it. I know it. And yet now they know it too. He's now lower than Trump. This NBC piece says, and he's really twisted about it. Uh, another person. This is another person close to the White House at a meeting with Biden about a month ago. He was surprised that he had dropped them on suburban women. Biden himself. This is great. Biden, the strategist, thought up the phrase ultra MAGA, which he and other Democrats have started using in hopes of drawing a clear contrast with Trump's movement. Ultra MAGA, I wanted on a t-shirt. I want it on a visor. I wanted on a on a beer cozy and I don't even drink beer. Producer Mike. I don't even drink beer. I want it. Ultra MAGA sounds amazing. And honestly, if someone hasn't already started an ultra MAGA product line, they should. Um, and on the baby formula shortage, speaking about suburban, uh, suburban women, suburban moms in particular, this is the reality still of the baby form of the shortage, which the White House is now admitting they were slow to act on with store shelves still barren across the country. Tonight, communities organizing giveaways to help desperate families in need of baby formula. I have no baby formula for my baby for the last two weeks. An estimated 70% of the nation's baby formula supplies now out of stock in Dearborn, Michigan on Friday, cars lined up for nearly a mile waiting for formula. Volunteers struggling to meet the demand as some in line returned away empty handed. See, here's the, here's the dilemma that the Democrats face in this moment. What really matters more to normal people going about their everyday lives in America? The January six insurrection to destroy the whole nation by a bunch of middle age folks, mostly almost entirely guilty of trespassing. Or you can't actually afford your gas, your mortgage. There's no baby from the two by even if you can afford it. What, what, what matters more to people? All the Democrats are finding out, you know, they just talk about the kitchen table issues. Democrats, folks, are the party of, of trans agenda drag shows with men twerking on stage for toddlers in the audience. Plenty of video of this. It's a real thing. And letting biological males compete against biological females, also known as females in the NCAA in the Olympics and spending trillions of dollars and acting like they don't understand the cause of inflation and being soft on crime and then saying, what's soft on crime? It's letting criminals prey on people without severe consequences that they deserve. That is what the Democrat party has become. Those things, destroying the currency, destroying safety on the streets, destroying culture and sanity in this country. That is what they are now. And, and I think there's this slow recognition of, oh my gosh, we can't actually sell this to the American people. Turns out Joe Biden, the Trojan horse, isn't going to be able to convince people that we're something other than what I just described. And the polls are in line with it. How they gonna turn this around, folks? It's basically June, June, July, then we get into the August recess. And then it's election time, baby. But I got to tell you right now, it's not going to be enough to win. It has to be the, it has to be an annihilation that we have to invoke the equivalent of the T ball mercy rule for Democrats in this election. It has to be the biggest walloping ass kicking we have seen in my lifetime in politics. Winning is not enough. It has to be repudiation. It has to be, oh my gosh, the Democrats say, our ideas are stupid and clear majorities of the American people across the country are saying enough of the madness. We'll get back into Trudeau's madness up in Canada here in a second. Another month comes to a close. We're likely to hear soon about more bad news in the cost of living and inflation.

Just in Trudeau, the little side part fascist up in Canada has some thoughts on guns. We're introducing legislation to implement a national freeze on handgun ownership. What this means is that it will no longer be possible to buy, sell, transfer or import handguns anywhere in Canada and will require the permanent alteration of long gun magazines so they can never hold more than five rounds. These are actions that doctors experts and chiefs of police have been calling for for years and we're acting on their advice. Doesn't he just honestly speak like such a pretentious little little jerk? You know, this really does sound like the guy who stands up in every class in college and goes speaking the perspective of an ally male feminist kind of over a nunciate everything. This is what we have been calling for for years. Oh, really Trudeau. Here's a prediction that I would whatever amount of money somebody wants to come up with we should we should try to set up I wish we could set up bets on these things. Here's here the prediction this won't do anything because Canada has not that much gun violence to begin with as we know as a small population. This isn't going to make a damn bit of difference to people who are law abiding. It's going to be annoying to the criminals. Guess what? They're not going to say wait a second. You mean that it's now even more illegal than the other illegal stuff I was going to be doing? You mean a straw purchase is illegal under Canadian law even more so than it was before buying a handgun and cash from somebody out of the back of a trunk in downtown Toronto is is even more illegal? Oh, no, now I'm really not going to do it. They just keep being wrong. But here's the thing friends. It's like what we saw with COVID. By the time it's clear to everybody that they're wrong. They don't care that they were wrong. They got their way and they moved on to the next thing. This will be true of guns and this will be true as well. This was true as well of COVID where the lockdowns now turns out caused tremendous emotional and social learning and developmental damage to children. The masking the lockdowns the so called remote work from home stuff all of it. This was an absolute mess and there was no upside to it. Children were not at risk. Children should have been in school the whole time and the libs were wrong. Libs wrong on guns wrong on lockdowns for schools for children. You should run on that this election. We'll see how that goes for them. Gotta leave it there for the team back from Bermuda today. So got a lot of energy this week and I do a lot of shows a lot of things. Talk to you tomorrow.
