    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today I'm joined once again by one of our favorites that would be Kelsey B\u00f6hler. She is a senior policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. We're in full disclosure. I'm a senior fellow and she is also a senior contributor to The Federalist. Kelsey, welcome back to the podcast. Hey, Emily. It's great to be here. It's been a little while. It has. Well, you've been working really hard on a series for IWF that is pretty incredible. And before we dive into the conversation, we're actually going to play a little teaser of a new report that you have out, which is absolutely critical and so emotional and powerful. So here's that clip. My daughter's name is Sophia. She's amazing. On July 22, 2019, she went to her dad's house and she never came back. I later found out that she had told her stepmom and her dad that she was trans and she was she didn't want to live with me anymore. She felt unsafe in no way should family court separate children from their biological parents without any evidence of abuse or neglect. So Kelsey, this is a horrible story and it is the story of Jeanette Cooper. And I think one thing that has been missing from a lot of the conversations since the legacy media really has a monopoly on coverage of this. Although that's changed a lot in recent years has been the emotional stories of the consequences for parents and the physical and emotional consequences for young people. These issues are largely framed as human rights or freedom for trans identifying people. But there is a really dark and ugly side to this that you document here. So tell us Jeanette's story and tell us about your reporting on what's happened in her life since 2019. Yeah, absolutely. You just heard from Jeanette Cooper herself. She is a 44 year old mother from Chicago. She a couple of years ago got divorced. Her and her ex-husband had a daughter and when they got divorced, they immacably decided that the daughter would remain in Jeanette the mother's custody for six days, seven nights a week. A couple years later, that with the daughter's father got remarried. And one day after a regular custodial visit to her father's house, the daughter informed her mother that she identified as transgender and wanted to stay with her father. Jeanette initially tried to give the daughter space. You know, thought this would pass, maybe just a day or two. Days kept passing. And so she got to the point where she attempted to enforce the custody agreement. That really opened up what became a series of court proceedings that ended with Jeanette not being able to have any visitation rights with her daughter for three years. The daughter was 12 at the time when she declared that she was trans. Jeanette was very skeptical because her daughter, Sophia had never exhibited signs of gender dysphoria prior to that. And if you if you watch the video where you'll see Jeanette very bravely going on camera showing her face, telling her story of what happened, you'll see she actually does not exhibit traditional feminine behaviors and preferences. Jeanette had her head. She actually identifies as a progressive feminist. She's voted Democrat all her life. I think a lot of the stereotypes of parents who are struggling with children who are gender confused. A lot of people think that these must be these extreme Christian conservative parents who don't want to affirm their daughters or their son's stated identities. But in fact, it's a lot of very progressive parents who are dealing with this who have voted Democrat their entire lives. I mean, of course, politics shouldn't have anything to do with this. But I think it's important to point out that that stereotype is not true. There are many parents on the left who simply want to acknowledge the truth that there that in this case, Jeanette's daughter is in fact a girl. So ultimately, Jeanette not only lost custody of her daughter to the point she can't visit her daughter who lives just 10 minutes down the street from her, she can't even communicate with her by phone or text message. The only way Jeanette can communicate with her daughter is via US postal mail. So what she does is at this point, she writes letters to her daughter. That is how she communicates with her. That is how she receives updates. She does have some parenting rights to have notification of anything medically involving her daughter and her daughter cannot medically transition without the mother's permission. But really, this is someone who very much loves her daughter unconditionally. In fact, to the point, if you want to really get into her story, initially, in order to get her daughter back, she did write this very long affirmation letter saying, I will call you by your preferred name, basically apologizing for not doing that. Because I think the initial reaction any parent would have is, I just need to see my daughter, I need to get her back. But Jeanette describes that initial affirmation attempt is rejected. It really just spiraled from there. It involved a lot of therapy sessions that Jeanette agreed to but was required to attend, where she was really ganged up on, put in an adversarial position between her and her daughter. And ultimately, she was forced into a new parenting agreement. And that parenting agreement states in court documents that Jeanette does not have an understanding of her daughter's transgender identity. Let's be very clear, Jeanette, it's, excuse me, doesn't have an understanding of transgender identity. Jeanette has an understanding of what a transgender identity has. It's just not the understanding that the courts, that the therapists, that anyone involved in this situation want her to have. And what Jeanette will tragically tell you, you know, of course she is a victim in this and has suffered to depths as a mom myself, I can't even begin to imagine. But what she'll tell you is that her daughter is the greatest victim in all of this. Her daughter is, is who is ultimately being damaged and harmed by, by courts, physically separating her from her biological mother. It is just tragic to see the extent to which the gender ideology movement has captured every institution in American society to the point that this movement that is branded in tolerance and inclusion now forcefully supports separating a mother from her biological child. Something we talk about a lot on this podcast is how recent changes to the way humans live their everyday lives have caused all of these other downstream changes that are pretty major and that we don't actually think about that often. For instance, did you know that poor sleep can cause weight gain, mood issues, poor mental health and lower productivity? Think about this, sleeping less than six to seven hours per night is actually linked to reduced white blood cell count and those white blood cells protect our body against illnesses and diseases. They fight viruses. They fight bacteria and so much more. I am one of those people that absolutely needs critical sleep. I need absolutely more sleep than most people probably do, but it's a huge difference and we all know that because we all need it. Introducing Beam Dream.

Kelsey, this is obviously as the audience can tell already, fantastic reporting and there's so much that we can pick out from everything you just described because the story does seem to be extremely representative of what hundreds of parents, if not thousands of parents around the country, surely thousands of parents around the country have experienced in recent years, you describe the quote Kafkaesque series of what's the exact wording that you use. The Kafkaesque series of court proceedings and therapy sessions in which Genet's ex-husband lawyers, therapists and other individuals and institutions supposedly concerned with Sifia's best interest work to erode Genet's most basic parenting rights. Again, just even in that sentence alone, it's packed with points of inquiry, but I wanted to ask you about those institutions in your conversations with Genet, where were the interferences in her basic rights? As you said, her most basic rights as a parent, did they come from the school? Did they come from the courts? What laws were being weaponized here? Or what institutional policies were being weaponized here in her ex-husband's attempts to block her from seeing their daughter? Yeah, first off, I want to tell you, Emily, it took me so long to report the story in part because when you hear about it on its face, you think there's got to be more. There's something she's not telling me. There's no way a court is going to physically and emotionally separate a mother from her biological child, a mother who had custody six days, seven nights a week. But I spent so much time looking through the court documents myself, talking to Genet's scene communications, and I have to tell you, I ultimately arrived to the conclusion. First off, there is nothing more. But second off, to understand how this situation happened, all you have to understand is the narrative that is captured society. We are all being told that if you do not affirm a child's chosen identity, that child will commit suicide. And so where does that logically leave you? That means any judge, any therapist who is dealing with a child who claims he or she is transgender is going to do anything in their power to quote unquote, save that child. In this case, saving that child to all the people involved here meant physically separating this child from the mother who was not affirming her daughter's male identity. Mind you, the daughter actually, according to public appearances, activism appearances and social media appearances, doesn't appear to identify as a man. As a boy anymore, this child now goes by Zeezer Zim. This all happened to a mother who didn't affirm her daughter's male identity and the daughter doesn't even identify as male anymore. So how does that make sense? I mean, that's where we are today. I guess, according to those involved, it's not even relevant. But as for those institutions you mentioned, it's notable that this all happened inside a family court. And I have to acknowledge I am not a lawyer and I'm not a court reporter. And so it took me some time to gain a foundational understanding of family court and how it worked. I want to again, acknowledge my understanding is still very foundational, but family court is very different from a regular court. And a lot of these situations are privately negotiated. That's how these parenting agreements often come up. And so there was actually when Sophia declared she was transgender, she via her father in court documents, you can see claimed she was unsafe in her mother's presence because the mother didn't appear to be affirming her transgender identity. And when you use the term unsafe, that implies some level of abuse or neglect on behalf of a parent. And Jeanette is actually a lifelong educator, loves children, and very much understands that when a child claims they feel unsafe, a court needs to investigate. And that's exactly what the court did. And as hard as that was for Jeanette, she knew or believed that as soon as this investigation was conducted, as soon as it reached its conclusion, she would get her daughter back. They would clearly find there was no evidence of abuse or neglect. Investigation did take place. It was very extensive somewhere around seven months, a court ordered investigation. And I will know I was not able to get access to the actual result of that report, but I did have access to the final parenting agreement, which referenced which had absolutely no reference to any abuse or neglect. You know, that Jeanette clearly stated there was no abuse or neglect. And I think that would have arisen in the final parenting agreement had that investigation found anything like that. What it did find, again, was that Jeanette did not have an understanding of the concept of a transgender identity. And because of that, through this family court, she had two options. She really reached the end of the road. She had two options. Her parenting time was in reserve, which means she hadn't been able to see her daughter for going on three years. And she could either at that point agree to a new parenting agreement in which it would be stipulated that she still would not have visitation rights with her daughter, or she could bring this situation to a hearing in which Jeanette feared would yield the same result because she is from Chicago, a very liberal area. This was in the Cook County Domestic Relations Division surrounded by gender affirming therapists who the court was requiring Jeanette to attend. And so it's like all the cards were stacked against her and she feared if she brought this to a hearing, she would be causing more trauma, not just for herself, but for her daughter. She did not want to put her daughter through any more pain and suffering. She did not want her to have to experience a contested hearing between her and her ex-husband. And so, you know, she felt she had no choice. The best option for her daughter was to take the peaceful route of this new parenting agreement in which she had to technically agree to not be able to see her daughter only be able to communicate her by U.S. male. If you're like me, you might be dreading looking at your 401k or IRA account balance lately. You're not alone and we're hearing all of the experts say there's just no place to hide. But that's simply not true. The truth is you can build a financial bunker that grows and protects your money even during the scariest economic times. The bank on yourself retirement plan alternative lets you escape the financial carnage and has never had a losing year in over 160 years. Whether you've been investing for years or you're just starting out, now is the time to bypass Wall Street and bank on yourself. Bank on yourself lets you reach your financial goals and dreams without taking any unnecessary risks. You get guaranteed predictable growth and retirement income with no luck, skill or guesswork needed. The strategy also lets you take a tax-free retirement income which protects you from the coming tax tsunami. Unlike a government controlled 401k, IRA or similar plan, you control the money in your plan, not the government. You can use the money for any purpose with no questions asked without interrupting the growth of your savings. This is the strategy famous businesses like McDonald's have used when no banker would lend them a dime and almost anyone can do it. Plus there's no volatility. Your plan doesn't go backward when the markets tumble. Both your principal and growth are protected. You can get a free report with all the details of how adding bank on yourself to your financial plan can help you take back control of your money. Just go to bankonyourself.com slash federalist. That's bankonyourself.com slash federalist. So what are her options going forward if there are any? It sounds like she's exhausted just about every substantive attempt so far that would rectify the situation, but where does she stand right now? Yeah, it's devastating. So in that final parenting agreement, her time is revoked until she can meet certain stipulations which involve attending these meetings with a gender affirming therapy group and meeting with a certain therapist. She very quickly attended these gender affirming therapy groups and although she disagrees with their approach, she actually enthusiastically attended them and had the opportunity to actually speak with other parents going through this. She's very open-minded. She has her beliefs, but she has no problem sitting in a room and talking to people who might take a different approach to a situation like this. The roadblock she faces right now is this final parenting agreement, one of the stipulations is meeting with a certain therapist and that therapist's weight list is empty, is full and she can't even get on a weight list. So she had to go back to the core and try to explain, you're requiring me to see this therapist, but the therapist's weight list is full. What else can I do? And it's such a process. It can take over a month just to get a back and forth through her court, so it just drags on and on. But really, she met all the requirements in attending these group therapy sessions for parents of transgender teens, which I looked them up and they're run through a gender affirming hospital, which is just so unfair on its face. And that tells you there's only one approach, there's only one solution to this, and that is this affirmation model, which, you know, that's a whole separate conversation about the number of doctors and mental health professionals and G-transitioners telling us, warning us of the dangers and the irreversible harms of taking that approach. And that just goes to show how Jeanette is being boxed in. And despite that, she's still trying to do everything the court is asking her to do in order to see her daughter. But again, this is just dragging on. It's been just about three years since she has seen her daughter. She doesn't even receive her school pictures. She actually, this breaks my heart. So she had to, at a certain point, the situation became so hard, so emotional for her. She had to pack away into cardboard boxes, all the pictures, items that reminded her of her daughter. She didn't want to throw them away, but she needed to put them somewhere where she wouldn't be reminded of this traumatic situation every waking moment. So she packed them away in her boxes, and I asked her if she would be willing to show us those boxes and unpack them on camera for us. And you don't actually know that full story in the video. It's only a eight-minute-long video, so I could tell so much. But it's interesting to know the backstory that when she was opening those boxes that were full of pictures and board games that she used to play with her daughter and to close and other items, I was an extremely emotional moment for her. It was overwhelming to walk her through that moment. And it's just, I can tell you, I have two little ones now. I've spent a long time working with Jeanette on telling her story, and it has been hard. It's been hard for me to report on, so I can't even begin to imagine how hard it has been for Jeanette. And that's what is so important to remember, that Jeanette loves her daughter unconditionally. She would do anything for her daughter. And in fact, she does not blame her daughter for any piece of this situation. She believes her daughter is a victim in all of this. She believes that adults who have been surrounding her are the ones who failed to protect her. Well, and I want to ask on that point, what do we know about her daughter's health at the moment or where her daughter sort of stands on this question of the binary as someone who isn't saying that she's a boy, but is saying that she prefers Z's or pronouns, I think you mentioned, what do we know, if anything, about how the daughter is doing right now? Yeah, I, you know, I want to acknowledge I have not spoken with the daughter. What I did here was tell Jeanette's story on her own terms. And I did my due diligence in, you know, looking at court documents, backing up everything she told me, you know, talking actually to people who know her. So I did quite a bit to verify the story, but I did not speak with her daughter. And we, of course, did not publish her daughter's name. Jeanette, since she is divorced Jeanette Cooper is her maiden name. And so you we actually did not publish the ex-husband's name either because that would reveal the last name of the daughter. So the only thing that I can tell you about the daughter is what is publicly available. And what's so sad is when I asked Jeanette, you know, do you know for sure how she's identifying, you know, she said, how would I know that? I can't talk to her. Right letters. And sometimes, you know, I almost felt like I was slipping up when I was talking to her because you asked these questions that any mother in a normal circumstance would be able to answer. And then it just hits you how limited her communication is with her daughter to the point that she can't answer some of these very basic questions. I can tell you from public appearances, I found her daughter appears in some local news report she appears to be quite a little political activist. Very, very progressive out there. And in these news reports identified as Z-Zir-Zim goes by a different name other than her birth name. So that's what I can tell you. But, you know, Jeanette, she does write her letters. That's what she's allowed to do. But she, the one of the things she doesn't have the legal ability to do or the desire to do is to share those private communications with her daughter. So that was one of the few things that I actually didn't personally review. She understandably wants to keep those communications with her daughter private and is very much hopeful that she will have a relationship with her again soon. But as I mentioned right now, she is really at a stand still. One other way that she could see her daughter is if her ex-husband agrees to allow parenting time. That should tell you a lot. And I was going to say as you write, if you have this dichotomy set up, where if the mother does not agree, does not agree fully with trans ideology, she is quote, creating an unsafe space that the daughter is then unsafe around her own mother because her mother doesn't fully comply with every tenant of trans ideology, even though she's bent over backwards to be compassionate and understanding through your reporting, Kelsey. If she doesn't believe in that, the only other option is that she's unsafe. So unless if you define safe by being fully progressive, politically progressive, on board with all of this, then the alternative is not just disagreement. The alternative is unsafe. And this is an extremely dangerous, basically binary for us to not just have in the fringes of academia, but be mainstreamed into our legal system. Absolutely. And it should be terrifying to know that all a child needs to do is claim he or she feels unsafe around a certain parent. And to be able to, in that sense, parent themselves, not have any communication with their biological parent. It's really, as a society, these institutions are enabling the abuse of the word unsafe because unsafe used to have a very serious and particular meaning in terms of child safety. But we're at the point where if a child who identifies as transgender wants to get away from a parent who is not affirming, all they need to do is to claim they feel unsafe. And that is enough despite a seven month investigation into actual evidence of abuse and neglect, which again, came up empty. That was not enough in this case. It was not enough. All right. I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again. One of the reasons I'm in journalism is because I'm just relentlessly skeptical of absolutely everything including those glowing my pillow ads that we all see so much of. But my own skepticism personally was just gone immediately after trying my pillow, which I really love. Did you know that my pillow is also about more than just a fantastic pillow though.

Yeah and I've seen that in other cases as well. It just it doesn't matter as soon as you basically inject this binary into the legal system and into the culture you hit a brick wall until you comply and until you know completely submit to the ideology and the ideology and of itself is untested and it's dangerous because it has completely shielded itself from criticism. And there are cracks in that front foundation that are starting to show but Kelsey, another question I had is just you've talked about this a little bit but as a reporter your perspective as a reporter I think might tell us a little bit more about the situation too just what it was like talking to Jeanette and what it was like getting the trust of somebody who has been through hell and is probably very guarded and scared and desperate. So I think very brave of her to talk to press and to tell the story but as a reporter what was it like to basically work on the story and you spent a lot of time on it you know in communication with somebody suffering so deeply. Yeah I can tell you it was out of a selfless desire to help and protect other parents who are experiencing the harms of the gender ideology movement that Jennifer decided to speak out and tell her story. The way I approached it was to give her a platform to share her story in her own words. So my publication has two components it has a video that is as I mentioned just over eight minutes long and the only person in that video well with one I'll mention that in a second but it's Jeanette telling her own story you don't have a reporter in it telling it for you it is Jeanette telling it in her own words. The only other person who I have to admit does make an appearance in that video is President Joe Biden because it was important to demonstrate the context in which this is happening where you have it feels like every institution in society all the way up to the office of the President of the United States telling parents you must affirm or your child is not safe or your child will commit suicide that is what Jeanette is up against and it is just relentless which is shocking to me that I feel like every other week there's a new study there's a new report coming out showing the side effects of medically transitioning children at young ages showing the number of children who are desisting because they're not really transgender if there even is a thing. We're constantly learning more and more harms of this because this is such a new phenomena and yet we still have every institution up to you know the White House telling parents we know your child better than you we know how to parent your child better than you and what you do in this situation if your child declares out of the blue tomorrow that he or she is transgender you must affirm or you are a bigot and your child will commit suicide that is such a dangerous narrative and again that is that is the backdrop of what Jeanette and thousands of parents across the country are facing and I'll know Jeanette is one of four parents who I've been interviewing pretty extensively she is the first of four mothers whose daughters fell prey to gender ideology and are very bravely speaking public going on camera to share their stories and was this decision easy for any of them absolutely not you know their primary concern across the board is protecting their child protecting their child's privacy and of course that is why we are not publishing Jeanette's daughter's last name and in any of the other reports I have coming out we won't be using the children's name some of the parents are not even using their own last names to protect their children these are very sensitive stories but what these mothers ultimately have concluded is that if they don't share their stories people won't believe what's actually happening yes the only way to change anything is for Americans especially in the center left to understand you know how how this is happening and what the repercussions are and how far it's gone to the point that a mother was separated from her biological daughter who she unconditionally loves so again it is it is so brave and so self less that Jeanette went on camera to share her deeply personal and deeply troubling story that you know you can only imagine how hard it's it's been for her and I I've shed some tears working on it Emily I have to be honest and I think anybody you know can understand why this is such an emotional story but I have a almost three-year-old daughter and I've just been staring at her imagining a court system taking her away from me and you know being put in the position of having to choose either to lie to my child or to be able to see my child and have a relationship with her it is so wrong it shouldn't be happening to any parent it shouldn't be happening to any child and I hope we're due for a course correction fast that's the truth cancel culture is coming to your bank and holding the wrong political views might soon leave you out in the cold I'm Bill Walton on the latest episode of the Bill Walton show Todd Zawicki Paul Watkins and I discuss what is already happening how the Biden administration is already pursuing this agenda and what we can do about it this progressive culture offensive is relentless it's coming for you and you won't hear about this anywhere else follow the Bill Walton show it Apple Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts yeah because we're really looking forward to your additional reporting on this I think another thing worth noting is that these are stories you know you can you can go back years and you know this has all happened very quickly but at least within the last five years this is something parents have been experiencing but the legacy media has been completely ignoring and is not telling these stories despite the fact that as you say policy powerful powerful people like the president of the United States is enabling their pain and worsening and perpetuating their suffering and it's truly horrendous and in my limited experience sort of talking to parents who have suffered from this not nearly as much as you have I have been really surprised at how willing they are you kept using the word selfless and that resonated with me in the conversations that I'd had because there's this just really genuine drive to do right and to prevent parents she's like this is so insane to them that they can't believe it's happening and they know other people won't believe it's happening and they just need people to know they just want other people to know so I think it's fascinating that that's what you found as well and I know we have another clip we're gonna play is there anything you want to say to set up this very powerful clip that we're about to share with the audience yeah Emily that's actually a perfect way to wrap this conversation the leaving listeners with this really beautiful analogy that Jeanette makes which really explains her decision in how to handle this traumatic situation that she's unfortunately found herself in so I would love to leave your audience with that and also encourage them to watch this video and share it share it not just with you know people who might agree with you on this issue this Jeanette is a voice again she's a lifelong Democrat she's a voice I think could really connect with audiences across the political spectrum and her story I hope can serve as a compassionate wake-up call and make make people force people to question whether this movement is really about tolerance and inclusion because I don't think any movement that supports physically separating a mother from a bio her biological child who she loves it has has any business calling itself tolerant so you can watch the video at I WF.org it's branded under this identity crisis series and just know within the next couple weeks we're going to be continually dropping a few more stories we're featuring additional mothers who have similar experiences as Jeanette perhaps not as traumatic but they all you know are unbelievable in their own way and from there we're also featuring the stories of two female D transitioners who are warning of the harms of medically and socially transitioning children and also a medical professional who is warning how her profession has been captured by this movement so appreciate you know any support in sharing these stories it is so important for them to be out there for people to understand how these policies are impacting families in really harmful ways here's that clip I see that my child is at sea in a boat she is struggling she is in kind of tumultuous seas I know that I have seen that and what I have been told is to follow her lead to follow her in this journey I am not willing to do that I don't think that is good parenting it's my responsibility not to hook my boat to hers it is my responsibility to be a lighthouse to be something stable that she can see some guide that she has that will always be there that is consistent I still do that today even though I have no custody of her I have no medical decision-making no educational decision-making and no way to communicate with her other than by mail I don't have her phone number I know where she lives but I'm not allowed to go there I know where she goes to school and I'm not allowed there either but this is parenting what I'm doing even though I have no real contact with her I am still a parent I am still her mother I am still parenting now my goodness Kelsey bowler thank you so much for your
