    "text": " There are so many vocal LGBTQ women in sports that they are making a change in allowing for other LGBTQ women to be themselves and going into sports. And on the men's side, we don't see that as an example for some reason. We don't see that as what can happen. We don't see them as our gay heroes because we don't think that they had it as tough, which is insane. You know, that's what I would like to get across and just open up. I just don't think it's gotten enough into the mainstream so that, you know, we can all sort of reference in our head, oh, a David copay, oh, a Billy Bean, and just keep those lessons in mind and not have to repeat history. Welcome to Politicalology. I'm Ron Steslow. Much to the chagrin of some number of vocal sports fans, politics has been interwoven with the top stories driving sports coverage for decades. Sports is not just matchups and scores or fantasy points and spreads. Sports excites us and unites us because it is a celebration of all of the things that make us human. Sports is a showcase of peak athletic ability, of sacrifice, and of triumph, of love and heartbreak. And it gives us a window into the struggles and challenges and roadblocks that millions experience every day, but we may not all be attuned to. So even as someone who doesn't regularly watch sports, I'm really excited for this conversation because there are dozens of threads we could pull on today of the innumerable links between sports and politics and why they are so intertwined. But specifically, today I want to talk about the plight of LGBT athletes and the attempts to exclude trans athletes spreading across the country. And what that means for not just our beloved collegiate and professional sports teams, but the athletes, young and old in our communities, being told they do not belong. So my guest today is Israel Gutierrez. And we're going to explore the link between issues we think of as political and the stories and narratives driving sports. Israel is a reporter and columnist covering the NBA for ESPN. He makes frequent appearances on ESPN shows, including highly questionable and around the horn. He has previously covered the Marlins and the Heat for the Palm Beach Post and Miami Herald. And he's among the most prominent openly gay figures in sports media. Izzy, thank you so much for joining me for this conversation today. Ron, my pleasure. Thanks for having me. And it was very well said how you opened the podcast there. Thank you. So, you know, first, why don't we start broadly? And I just want to ask you what it meant to you. Whenever you read or hear some iteration of someone telling you to stick to sports, when someone says something like stick to sports or even shut up and dribble, right? What are they showing about themselves? And what does that say to you? You know, it's interesting. And you mentioned this in your open sort of the intersection of sports and politics and how it's essentially impossible to avoid. And people say these days, but I mean, let's be honest, it's always been the case. I mean, you can go back to why we even play the national anthem in our sports. It was just basically around World War I to get some, you know, enthusiasm and get some patriotism and the feelings of, you know, just any positive feelings toward your country at the beginning of a baseball game. And then all of a sudden we've been playing that ever since. And so it's sort of the ultimate irony for me as at the time, and I don't know how much this had to do with my decision making, but at the time being a closeted gay male who decided to get into the sports journalism industry because I wanted to get away from the real world because, you know, my initial instinct coming out of high school or in high school rather was to be a lawyer, you know, president of my debate team. And I was very much, I thought I could be, you know, an excellent trial lawyer and then realize that, you know, wow, there might be some money in that and well, it might be exciting at times and 90% of the time it's boring. And so let me go do something where I don't have to think about the everyday when I can just have fun in a career where I'm not chasing dollars and just do things that make me happy. And that, you know, I've always said to myself, I want to leave the politics to those who are, you know, more intelligent or more well versed in it or, you know, who wanted to go that routes from the beginning. And, you know, now that I, you know, going through this career and having sort of sprouted in the industry faster than I anticipated, you know, I'm being put in this position. And I say put in this position of having this platform at ESPN is because I never really sought the television aspect, right? I would always, it always been a writer, graduated to a columnist and then, you know, once I became an opinionated columnist, all of a sudden, you know, TV came at calling for me and, and now, you know, much to my chagrin, I am not writing currently at all free ESPN. I do have the option to, I believe, but I just, you know, there's nothing consistent there and I'm doing almost strictly TV. And so given this platform now and the time that we're in, it is entirely unavoidable. And so I think that's the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the the, the the the the the the the the. the two of us, the two of us, one of us, for instance, first instance, first instance, first instance in the next instance, we, we, you, you she, the first instance in the next instance, first instance in the next instance is, tribute to, the first instance is, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, quote him on this, even after he's gone is, you know, sports is the toy department of human affairs. Wow. And that's good. If you can't recognize that that is part of real life and eventually they're going to get involved and, you know, recognizing which one's more important than the other, then you've got a skewed vision of pretty much everything. And so I go on these shows around the horn, highly questionable, and I talk about the sports and it's fun and it's still the release from the every day, but you can't separate it from the every day because if you just have the discussions, eventually you're going to get into something that becomes political and you can just go back to, you know, Jackie Robinson. It doesn't matter how, what error you go to, you will find political discussions spilling over into sports. How about, you know, I mean, is there any more of a political discussion than having your sports heroes just go to war for your country at for a time and then come back? So the idea of stick to sports is it's not antiquated. It never existed. And so yeah, it does bother me and it is just sort of the irony of my career that this is where I am when my goal going into it was, Hey, I don't want to talk about serious stuff. I don't want to have to write about serious stuff. I definitely don't want to have to go to county commission meetings and jot down what everybody's Oh my God, it drives me nuts. But you know, now given where we where I am and where we are as a planet, frankly, you know, too much has changed for me to just stick into that little window. So where do you think that we get that idea? And where do you think it's coming from? Because some people do seem to believe in this sort of fantasy land before time, right? That sports were once covered completely politically. And as you just eloquently said, that was never true. Why do we see that narrative being driven so hard right now? Because people want to avoid the truth because where sports was an escape. Now people just want to cloak themselves in it because it seems to be at least there's this narrative in people's minds that it seems to be the safe space. It seems to be the it's C team cheer for team. It's oversimplified. And you never you can frankly, if you really wanted to really avoid the political subjects. I mean, there's plenty of channels. There's plenty of radio stations. There's plenty of television stations that do exactly that. They'll not not only do they stick to sports. There's more specialized stations that talk about gambling and sports, a specialized station that talk about specific sports. So you can absolutely find all those things, but it's really it's folks that are saying that are just telling on themselves because they're just saying, Hey, I don't want to know what's real all the time. I want to believe that this is that this fantasy could be real. So don't bring realism into my games and into my fantasies. And it's just basically been a place for those who don't again, don't want to get into the politics or don't want to admit to their politics publicly for them to say, Hey, this is my safe space. I don't have we don't have to create arguments here, even though I might be kind of an evil person. Like that's not that there should be no place like that, right? I mean, a Chan is that there are yeah, exactly. There are places for that. You know, you just made me think of something. I'm not sure if you'd be familiar with it, but there's this book called The Path written by Michael Puet. He's a professor of Chinese history at Harvard. And the point of the book is about how rituals can teach us to live as if something is true. And sports maybe can be a place where we are able to share an experience as if something were true. And maybe that's something that could be true is that we've all sort of agreed to the rules by which we're going to be bound by in this game, in this experience. And maybe in that way, it's something that we don't have a lot of in the arena outside of sports. I don't know if you've if you're familiar with that concept of these as if rituals, but listening to that I haven't heard that phrase before, but I think part of the problem is, you know, the idea that sports are these rituals with these unchangeable rules, they should be flexible because the goal isn't to, you know, to continue to play sports by these rules. It's to continue to allow sports to be an entertainment source for us. That's all it is. It's just like saying, hey, you know, you can't change music. Well, of course, music has evolved over the course of you choose whichever one you want for that entertains you and you consume it. And so I think with sports, there's also that there's that argument that, oh, it should be traditional. It should be, you know, a ritual and what we're used to. And again, that's just people resisting change. And when you get to the idea of resisting change, I mean, frankly, it's it's anti American resisting change and it's an anti inclusive, which is also anti American. And so I think, you know, in that respect, sports can sort of be a leader and not something that says, Hey, we're just stuck in tradition and rituals. We can advance while still bringing the joy or entertainment. Yeah. So speaking of resisting change, let's talk about trans athletes. So across the country, bills that would preclude trans people, including trans youth and teens from participating in sports teams or leagues that match their gender identity are advancing in state legislatures. So for some context here, Idaho became the first state ever to prevent transgender women and girls from playing in leagues or teams for female athletes last summer. And the statute actually defines the word team as very broad. Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee have passed legislation restricting transgender athletes this year. Florida in the house, they voted to ban transgender athletes from women's and girls' scholastic sports earlier this month. And in all bills that would restrict trans participation are moving in at least 30 state legislatures. And I want to talk about the real reason behind these efforts in just a moment. But first, before we do, I want to address the claims head on and get your take on what the stated reasoning is for not allowing trans athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity. And how is it being tied to this idea of fairness? Well, that's the extremely frustrating part. And I just wanted to read a quote from a senator in Florida who said her name is Kelly Stargel. She sponsored the bill here in Florida, which just as an update, it seems to be sort of stuck and it might not actually go through, which I don't think people are really celebrating because it's probably just a delay. And it's not because of the idea that they shouldn't pass it. It's just because it's just got caught up with some other nonsense. The quote is, I believe Florida should protect the ability of girls and women to safely participate in athletics. And I think there is a consensus among my colleagues rounding that underlying policy objective. And the thing that's maddening is this is the first place people go. And this is not new to this particular subject. It's anywhere where you're sort of enforcing change and they go to the fear mongering and they go to a place that it's the same thing you heard about accepting homosexuality. Well, what's next? Are you going to let them the gays marry animals and you just make the next leap to where people say, hey, if they haven't given this, then he thought they say, hey, maybe that is true. Let's just nip this in the bud. And the idea that the transgender girls and women are going to, all of a sudden, dominate women's and girls sports and make it less competitive is it's exactly that. It's just fear mongering. It's absolutely insane to consider that any young person who's dealing with sexual questions is going to say, you know what, this is what's going to be the tipping point for me. I'm going to be crazy, successful in sport and maybe be famous and maybe make money. And I'm going to change my gender for that goal. And it's absolutely insane to me how much people value fame and money to think that that is the driving force for any human being to go as extreme in nature as a changing who they are or how they were born. And I think, you know, to just speak in general terms, I do think that there, you know, we have been so for so long, obviously caught up in the binary of gender and sex and believing that those are the, that the proper extremes when really they are just the extremes, that there are probably a lot of confused children and young adults who because of those standards think that they, hey, maybe because I'm a little bit different, I have to go extremely to the other side. But the solution to that is to be more open, is to be more inclusive, is to let everybody know, hey, this is a spectrum of humanity. So this is more normal. So don't think that because you are slightly different or even significantly different, that you have to make an entire leap to, you know, to the other side of that spectrum. And so I think by opening up these conversations and just by letting people understand what exactly it is to be trans and the feelings involved and the difficult decisions involved, I think it would make more people understand just exactly that, just what it means to be trans, but also when it comes to the idea of sports, girls and women's sports being in danger. Yeah, that's strong language. First of all, I mean, so the idea that I have, like, if I just want to participate in a sport, like I am threatening other girls, it's insane. It's the same idea of, you know, saying homosexual predators, like all of us are predators and just watch out, keep your children safe. It's the utmost of fear-mongering and it's painful. Look out for the gay agenda. Yeah. And it's harmful, especially we are specifically talking about girls' sports. We're specifically talking about girls under the age of 18 and these high school bills. And you're telling them that because of how you feel naturally, when you haven't even figured out your life yet, that you are a danger to other girls, like what I would do to myself if people just flatly told me that as a child and these are adults that I believe they know better than me, I don't know what I would do to myself. That's where, you know, self-harm comes into play. That's where all these, you know, lack of self-esteem comes into play and, you know, the suicide rates and never mind just implanting these fears and thoughts into others who've never given this any thought. And this is the first information that they hear and they say, well, that, my mind is made up. Those are evil people and they are harmful to my girls. It is the most idiotic form of thinking. And Kevin Blackestone, he wrote a column for the Washington Post, Kevin's. And around the horn columnist, he does more work for ESPN. We call him the professor because he's a professor at the University of Maryland. But he wrote a column for the Washington Post and I have it right here. Basically, there was a trans woman who was allowed to play in the tennis US Open. It was 40 some years ago. Okay. Wow. 40 some years ago. Wow. And have trans women, women, all of a sudden dominated women's tennis, is that something that has even been a conversation over the last 20 years, right? So to think that 40 some years ago, this has happened. And now people are saying, hey, guard your children, guard your little girls. Everything's going to change. It's insulting. It's frankly insulting and it's harmful. But it is not a new tactic. It's exactly what, you know, what folks who have not wanted inclusion or growth in this country. This is what they always do. They make everybody else afraid. And it is frankly, of course, it is, you know, we talk about the idea of this podcast and to just speak of it in broader terms and not, you know, to get caught up in the minutiae of everything. But it's, it's what I believe to be that sort of the moral compass of what should be the moral compass of this country is inclusivity and is, you know, literally equality and the more people the better. And it's just, it's just so frustrating because when you, when you think of, you know, sort of just the way we've almost learned too much, right? We've learned so much over the course of what technology has improved so quickly exponentially. And what's obvious, what should be obvious is that there's so much more about humans in humanity that we just didn't know. Yeah. Okay. There's so much we still don't know. Exactly. And the fact that we're learning faster, I know it's just a lot for people to handle. But if we just go along with the idea that if we can accept, embrace, and learn, we'll all realize that the familiarities, the similarities are way greater than the differences. And that is, it's not just a unifier. It's not just some patriotic, you know, nonsense that people can create. It literally helps people live longer. Like there's studies about people in greater communities, you know, with unified families and just, you know, larger communities that are beyond the family that you live longer because you don't deal with the stresses and you don't deal with a lot of the negativity around you and you have ways to express, you know, and God help me. If I had ways to express what I was thinking when I was, you know, 13 to, you know, 28, let's say it would have been so much more helpful. Now, unfortunately, to have been well adjusted because I've got great family and friends around me, but man, like the ability to express those things is absolutely important, especially you want to do it before these fear mongers speak for you and try to paint this certain picture for you. So it's just wildly frustrating. Yeah, I hear you, man. I want to get to the bigotry and the fear piece of this a little bit more. But before we do, we should take down the straw man, I think. So the, right, the real reason behind these efforts is everything that you just talked about, but there's this notion that trans women with biologically male characteristics would unfairly compete against cisgender women. Now, have we actually seen this happen at all ever? How common is this? And if not, is there anything that's underlying this narrative that they're pointing to as evidence of this being a problem? And how much of this has to do with gender affirming hormone therapy versus not? So these are some of the details that I would literally have to just read up on a little bit more in terms of the hormone therapy and everything else. I think, however, to your initial question there of the idea of it having happened before and there is Kaster Samanya, 2018. She is a Olympian from South Africa. Okay. So this has been sort of held up as this example of, hey, if you allow trans women that there will take over the sport because she is successful and there's been legislation actually written basically citing her and trying to get trans youth sprinters from being able to compete against women. And so the interesting part in you asked if it's common? No, it's absolutely not common. It will become more common as we have trans girls who are feeling free and wanting to play in these sports. But here's another aspect of that, which is also sort of maddening. Like this idea that these girls, these very innocent girls who are doing something that is even they recognize at a young age is as bold as it is and is as identity confirming and important as it is that they're going to want to participate in these sports that degrade them, that speak about them in terms of hormones and their genitals and how they were born. And just these things that they'd have to go through just to what, to hold up a trophy with what? A bunch of teammates that you can't even know if they're on your side or not, you have no idea whether they understand who you are. And so I don't think that the draw to sports is that great for these trans girls and women. Now for those that where the draw is enough for them to overcome these things, I applaud them first of all. But no, it's never going to become common, I don't believe, because you think about how long we've had sports in general and how long we've had gender questions and people, whether it be underground or not really discussed out loud. Like, no, this is not something that we have an army of trans girls who are like trying to convince the world that they should take over sports. It has nothing to do with sports. It's not a sports discussion. It's an identity discussion. Right. So they're also creating a stigma that every time a trans person wins, it's because they're trans. And the subtext there is, they're cheating. That's what they want people to feel. Yes. And so... And we'll get to the day in a minute. Yes. And the reason that it seems painfully obvious to them is because, oh, there is no equivalent on the men's side. And so because there isn't some other gender or sex that is superior physically to men that is all of a sudden... So it's obvious, so they shouldn't play there. And it's just so layered. And the idea of fairness, again, is it fair that a transgender person has no place to play? Is it fair that they cannot assign their own gender identity by what they actually feel and then say, oh, okay, I have no place to play. You won't let me because you think I'm dominant and I can't play there because it's not safe for me anymore because I've changed my body and my hormones. And so that's not fair either. And what are we really talking about? What are sports? Like if you're talking of sports as a career decision to try to make money, okay, well, these are your challengers. Go ahead. That's the landscape. And things change. Bigger, faster, stronger. It happens in sports everywhere. And so on the men's side as well, it's called evolution. And so now that we've evolved and said, oh, it's not just the binary. There are definitely different types of people. Let's try to integrate and let's see what happens because in the end, what are we talking about? It's winning and losing. It's feeling good and feeling shitty and sorry for my language. And so if you want to feel good at the expense of a whole group of people never having the opportunity, good for you. You're an evil piece of shit. So we should drop a little science here for our listeners. There was a study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine that looked at pushups, sit-ups, and running fitness tests for trans men and women in the US Air Force undergoing gender affirming treatment. And they identified a 15 to 31% athletic advantage that trans women displayed over their cis gender counterparts prior to starting gender affirming hormone therapy, which is why I mentioned it. But this largely disappeared after therapy, which means after one year of taking hormones, there was literally no difference in pushups or runtimes between trans and cis men. So I mentioned this because I believe the NCAA has included hormone therapy as one of the rules for trans athletes, trans women participating in the sport. Is that accurate? Yes. So this is essential. It sort of debunks this fairness argument because there are mechanisms in the rules of sports for dealing with this. So I just want to underscore that this is what the science says. Right. That's actually, it's a great point. And it's something that sort of brings me back to something that I wanted to bring up at the beginning of this conversation was, you know, I initially, after, you know, I came out in 2009, I came out my personal life in 2015, sort of came out publicly. And I remember sort of starting to discover the transgender discussion and wrapping myself in some of the research on it. And I remember saying to myself at the time, like, man, the more this becomes a popular subject, the more difficult it's going to be for people to wrap their minds around it because we're making sudden leaps, right? It's like, and I say sudden, I mean, you know, we're talking about relatively evolution. So it's got to be a little, especially in America. So you're talking about, okay, acceptance of gays. All right, we're getting there, right? And then it's just, okay, transgender, that's more confusing. And then you throw sports in there and just like, whoa, now I'm forced to just think about this because it's involving my, you know, my everyday interests and my everyday entertainment. And my initial thought was that's going to make it difficult for the entirety of the LGBT community because it is sort of the more difficult subject, again, to wrap your mind around. But now I'm glad that it's out there in the forefront because now it's all right. It's basically, you know, exercise, you work really hard. You get the results. They can work their minds around every single element of that LGBT flag, then we're all better off for it. And so the more we discuss the transgender athlete, the better off I am and the more we force people just to think. And frankly, I mean, I know it's hard, but it's the best way to go. Yeah. So really, this is about completely preventing participation, which is what we're all this comes down to. It's not about fairly crowning a champion or ensuring an even playing field. It's not about fairness. They want to tell the thousands of trans youth that they can't play soccer or gymnastics or basketball on the team they would fit into because there's a chance they would be better than everyone else. Yeah. And you know who else that they thought that about was black athletes in the 20s and 30s and 40s. And that was the whole part of the fear factor when it came to allowing Jackie Robinson and other black baseball players into Major League Baseball. So again, not a new tactic, not this epiphany of, oh, okay, we've figured something out here, this change definitely isn't good. It's just more fear. All right. Back to the culture war because I think with that context, it should be clear exactly why and I think you put this really well, it should be clear why sports has become the new front on this war. And transgender people have been a target outside of sports. In addition to what we just talked about last week, Arkansas, overrode the governor's veto to essentially ban trans health care in Arkansas. And this has nothing to do with sports, but it also has everything to do with sports. Is it possible that picking sports as the domain to wage this new front of the culture war could actually backfire because of the weakness of the argument, but also for all the reasons that you just pointed out about the speed with which we tend to make these advancements. Yeah, I don't think in the long term it's going to backfire. I think in the short term, it is it's the largest stumbling block because it is what people think that they know. They think it's as simple as, hey, I understand sports. Don't come in here. Tell me I don't understand sports. I know what women's sports looks like. I know what men's sports look like. Therefore, I know this whole gender conversation. And of course, they do not know that. And so, you know, I start to think of, you know, ways that it can advance, like ways people can can get past that while still being focused on sports. And this is where that that wall has to be broken between, you know, sports is just my entertainment and sports is real life. I think you do it by these athletes using their platforms and showing the rest of their lives. And I can't help but think of Dwayne Wade, who has a trans daughter, Ziya Wade. And this was a very public transformation because Ziya, while still identified as a boy, was trying to come out to his, well, not come out to his family. It had come out to his family, but was coming out, trying to come out to the world as early as nine years old. And at the time, his family was saying, hey, let's give this some time. Let's ease you into this because you're going to be a public figure because you're my son at the time and also of Gabrielle Union, who's a very public figure as well. And you know, after a couple of years, they brought Ziya to gay pride in Miami. Great. But the blowback that you heard and saw from fans of Dwayne Wade was jarring. Absolutely jarring. Don't bring that nonsense into my world, they said. Okay. Wow. Don't you have feminized you and Gary Union have, I mean, the absolute insults, you know, by bringing in this leftist, you know, actress into the world of the athlete. Look at the older boy, they said he's an athlete. And now this one has been has been affected by all the, it's absolutely insane. What's beautiful to watch or what had been beautiful to watch is Dwayne Wade, who, look, I felt I covered him as a rookie. So he was 21 years old. So I've seen Dwayne evolve as a basketball player as a human being. And I know that he would not have been able to handle this properly if he, you know, had to deal with it at age 22 or 23. And I don't say proper that. I mean, he wouldn't have been ready to, right? He would have eventually after some education or what have you, but just everything he's learned over the years as a father, as a human, the things that he's had to go through. And now with him and Gabrielle basically handling this as close to perfect as you can. It just, it forces people to understand. And even if, and this is a horrible thing to think about because like you're essentially using your child, not you, but the world is using your child as a meat shield to say, Hey, look at all these evil responses to somebody who's just trying to live their life. Let's back off of that. Let's maybe see through the eyes of the child or, you know, of the family and maybe not make these judgments. And I think that again has forced people to have the transgender discussion to even speak to their kids about it because that's another, I mean, again, that's that. And we talked about this earlier, the idea that somebody at this age at a nine, 10, 11 year old can say to themselves, you know, I am, I am not the person that everybody else believes I am, I need to make the bold decision to say who I am. Anybody who thinks that that is decided with sports in mind or some sort of fame at all, like, or success or career decisions at all is just not actually thinking about it as a human being. And like my position on humanity is just that our default position is accepting. Our default position is kind. Why do I believe that? People say, oh, the animal kingdom, look at all those, those animals fighting each other. They're different species. We are the same species and we all just come from different areas and have different different traditions. And that's how that is. And so, and you can just tell by the pattern of the world and especially by the pattern of this country, it is the human default. If you go long term, you're going to get, you know, the good winning over the evil. It's just, you know, hitting people over the head with that over and over again and realizing that it's just simple, you know, human humanity. I think people just don't get that these days. And, you know, that's just a product of, you know, too much information and not enough right. Yeah, I totally agree with you. Although it doesn't happen automatically and it doesn't happen without effort. You've been open about your sexuality for several years, but of course that wasn't always the case, right? You came out publicly with a blog post, I think eight days before your wedding in 2015. Exactly. So, you know, how has being your full self allowed you to grow professionally and in turn to share other stories through your work? It's been an incredible sort of last six years. Just seeing or experiencing the evolution or sort of the growth that just comes with, hey, there's an extra level of confidence. It comes with being, you know, who you are and being, you know, at the forefront with that and being proud and being non, you know, non apologetic about it. Especially in sports. Right. Yeah. And I think what gave me that ability was, you know, essentially being closeted in the industry for what was 15 years. And man, like to think of a hack is actually said that out loud. That's a long period of time to just just hold back an entire portion of yourself. And it's I never want anybody to have to do that. And so that first stage of just having that sort of confidence and just just walking and speaking like you're not hiding anything. I think that, you know, took about a couple of years to really soak in and really appreciate. And then I think the next level was just recognizing, especially with my particular minority group or our particular minority group. How easy it is to make an impact. And so I remember one time I was at a outside of a bar and this young lady came up to me and said, Hey, Israel, it's like a bucket list situation that I'm meeting you. And I was like, what? She's like, yeah, the things that you've done for the LGBT community. And at the time, all I've done was, you know, come out a couple of times, you know, spoken about certain issues. And I didn't realize that I, you know, that you could have that sort of an impact then. So I think that's when I sort of said to myself, OK, it doesn't take that much, but I still don't even feel like I'm doing as much. And because I know it doesn't take that much, I feel like I should make it more of a priority for myself. And so I guess the next shift there while I still value, you know, the sports I love in my job, I still love, you know, the entertainment part of it. It's not the most important thing to me on the daily. And it's not the most important thing in the big picture in terms of what I want out of this, again, sort of forced media, public platform that I have that I never really sought, at least on the television side. Do you think that's more product of your growth as an individual or the change in the world of sports and sports media specifically? I think it's a combination. I do think, though, that in the specific subject of being gay in sports, I don't think that it has really been tackled properly by the mainstream. And like, there's a project that I was working on that I say was because it's just on pause a little bit that I feel like can sort of make people understand it a little bit better and just speak about it the way it should be spoken about because, I mean, Jesus, like, what are we talking about? Jason Collins is 2014, Michael Sam was right around that time. That's right. Yeah. I don't watch football. And I remember like Michael Sam was a big deal for me and I watched the Super Bowl once a year, right? That's my engagement with football for the most part. And it was a big deal. Yeah. And I think, and so that to me is an important part of what I want to get across. Like, I almost want to tell like old, you know, gay love stories in sports. They actually exist, you know what I mean? I want to definitely want to, I need the world to know who Glenn Burke was and just how devastating his life as an openly gay baseball player was and how it shortened it. If we sort of tell the history and shine a spotlight on the things that have happened and are still happening, you know, undercover because they feel like they have to be undercover, then that it won't be, hey, somebody comes save us, it'll be, hey, you guys, like, you don't need to do that. You know what I mean? Like, it's all good. And you know, I know there's a ton of gay athletes now who their teammates know that they're gay. They just don't announce it or they don't make a public to do out of it. And everybody says, hey, isn't that the goal? Isn't that progress? Isn't that what we want? Yes and no, because those people probably still have to high portions of themselves, you know, those men probably don't bring their partner to the family room after the game to meet, you know, all the other girlfriends and wives. And so while they're focusing on their career and putting that to the side, and it's okay, because, you know, people around me know, it's still deep inside. It's still self-hatred. It's still not. They're still shame there. Yeah, they're still not loving yourself. And that's, I mean, Jesus, that's one of the things I've learned the most over the past 10, 11 years is the importance of that loving yourself. And so that's the part that if we just kind of opened up and just even just look at the women's games and sports and just recognize, wow, they've powered through a lot of the lot of women have and have, and you have openly gay athletes all over the women's side, but why doesn't that count? Because they're women? No, of course it counts. Of course they have the same, not same, but have very a large amount of stereotypes, a large amounts of things that they have to fight through, of hatred, of, you know, the WNBA overly feminizing their sport and their ads just to try to, you know, not feel like they are a gay league. It's just all insulting. And they say, oh, yeah, absolutely. Oh, wow. Over the years now they've, they've since evolved and, you know, there's too many, and this is what I'm talking about. There's so many vocal gay, you know, LGBT women, LGBTQ women in, in sports that they are making a change and allowing for other LGBTQ women to be themselves and going into sports. And on the men's side, we don't see that as an example for some reason. We don't see that as, as what can happen. We don't see them as our gay heroes because we don't think that they had it as tough, which is, is insane, you know. And so that's what I would like to get across and, and, and just open up, I guess. And I know some people have tried. I don't want to say that there haven't been, you know, films made or journalists, you know, have tackled these subjects. And I just don't think it's gotten enough into the mainstream so that, you know, we can all sort of reference in our head, oh, a David copay, oh, a Billy Bean. Oh, a Burke, and just keep those lessons in mind and not have to repeat history. Yeah. Yeah. After coming out and building a life where you are truthful to yourself and to others, how does it feel to imagine a young transgender athlete being told they don't belong in 2021? They can't play 2021. It's got to be 10 times, 100 times worse than what I'd felt because I wasn't overtly told to my face that say, Hey, you're a danger. Hey, you can't do this. I always used to think I couldn't play with the other guys because, you know, I would give something away or I wasn't good enough or because they told me, you know, like, yeah, with not so many words. Hey, if you think like this or if you act like this, you can't clearly be as good as we are. Your anatomy wasn't being scrutinized by the lawmakers. It has to be so painful just here. And then, you know, I don't want that to be the decision that motivates me to do something. You know, I want to be genuinely organically motivated, not out of hatred or fear or to, you know, I guess proving people wrong is sort of at the core of sports. But you know, this is a different level of wrong, right? This is, this is, you know, you are not the human that you think you are. And it's just like, how could you say that to another person, especially after all we've learned, but I guess that's the problem is, you know, we've got older, let's just say, or stuck in their ways, folks who are these lawmakers and, you know, going back to something I said earlier about leaving, you know, these, the politics and the decisions to the smarter people who devote, devote their lives to it. I mean, no, that's not a thing. Like it needs to be people who are driven to do the right thing and to maintain, you know, the actual priorities and beliefs that we've had, you know, from the beginning of this country. I mean, I, you know, I laugh all the time. And I think of, you know, Hamilton and I think it was a idea that we got so mad over taxing tea and like good God, the things we would do, you know, these individual states would do to get angry over and, you know, just become their, it's, it's, it's insane. Like people don't have the proper perspective on things. And again, humanity is worse off as a result. Speaking of the proper perspective on things. So I want to quote from this Kevin Blackstone column. He writes, the anti trans youth athlete bills, metastasizing in Republican controlled legislatures, aren't about leveling uneven playing fields. They aren't protections for girls and young women who identify with their birth sex. They are instead the latest salvos in a culture war waged the past few years by those who wish to impose 19th century Eurocentric Christian values on 21st century people. Who are diverse in every way. What more fiendish way to do so than kids sports? Now, when I read that, I, I thought sort of immediately about the, the sort of rhetoric that we're now seeing escalate the rhetoric and the politics that we're seeing escalate on the far right. And I put Tucker Carlson's nativism and his white replacement theory in that bucket. I put America first in that bucket and they just created a policy institute on Capitol Hill called America first policy institute, supposed to be this sort of think tank. And I put think tank in air quotes because I don't think there's a whole lot of thinking going on there. To advocate for Trump's policies, whatever that means. And then you have the Marjorie Taylor Greens, you know, Anglo-Saxon caucus in Congress. And all of this just feels exactly the same to me. It has the same emotional signature to it. And so first of all, I want to know, do you do you agree with Blackstone? Is this, is this fight against trans youth and transgenderism generally? Just one more way we're seeing the hopefully last gaps of this sort of grievance, this white identity politics or moral relativism? And where do you think it goes from here? And what can people do? I definitely agree with Kevin. And, you know, and it's just not to oversimplify it, but it goes back to what we were talking about earlier in terms of, you know, fear of change and and the necessity to create, you know, fear. So that such change said change doesn't happen. And, you know, it is it is whether you want to call it a white nationalist thing, whether you want to call it a, you know, even a Christian thing. It is just old thinking that is trying to be repurposed in today's society to create a sense of community and, you know, whatever you want to call it, strengthen among a very specific group of people, right? And they have big numbers and they have a lot of support and because they've had oversentries. But it's sort of what I've talked about before is just like the human default is toward acceptance. It is it is toward evolution. It is toward inclusivity. And I almost feel like this is a last gasp effort because you can't be this overt. Okay. And try and think that it won't eventually be called out and changed. Regardless of what kind of numbers you have or what kind of support you have because that support is uneducated and easy to be easy to sway and easy to, you know, just move along from because they don't really have any power because they don't really have any intelligence. All they have is, you know, their keyboards. And so I I just believe that that is the again, the more we include and this is, you know, whether and what can people do? I think, you know, whether it's whether it's not avoiding the subject, frankly, reaching out to your lawmakers, to your senators, your state senators, frankly, and saying this goes against everything that I believe is in America, everything I believe is a human. And, you know, forcing again people to think about these things and, you know, whether you go back and use examples of race, whether you go back and use examples of sexuality, or whether you go back and use examples of, you know, immigrants and immigration, eventually, we lean the right way and we accept. And so this is probably, I know my lifetime as an American, it feels like the hardest fight we've had, but not really because, you know, in my parents' lifetime, for example, they were hanging black people about two or three hours north of here on the regular. And that's not something that was that long ago. And so I do think that, you know, back then it was there wasn't as much of a fight or as much of a worldwide, united fight with, you know, this connection through through the internet and through communication advancements. And so I think the resistance can be a little stronger, right? And that's what that is. Essentially, they think of us as resistance. We're not there. Resistance. They are. They're literally resisting the the ideal of growth and what this country was built on. And so that resistance can be a little smarter, can be a little technologically inclined themselves, but eventually we'll get to the right place. Yeah. So there's one more thing, but we saw recently, Major League Baseball pull out of Atlanta over the voting rights law that they signed. And so I'm wondering how you're thinking about what we'll see from from majors, other major sports organizations over these trans anti-transgender bills. And what we think we will see and what should happen because the NCAA, I think, did say that they were going to something in the statement. I said, they said something like look very closely at venues where people can't participate equally or something like that. And it was very vague. And I don't think they've actually taken any formal action, but what do you think is going to happen there? All right. What I think is going to happen is I think the more often we're going to have people speak up for those who are being wronged or potentially being wronged in these bills and in this legislation and that we're going to force the league's teams, et cetera, to make more of these changes. But they have to have some sort of value to them. They have to have in the name of progress, not just in the name of, hey, reshuffle your dollars to a different state. And I think what needs to happen is if you actual, and this is not the job of these sports leagues, it's not. But if these sports leagues say preemptively or just to get ahead of it and say, hey, Texas, you guys have a Super Bowl this year, a few years, you guys have this, this, there's a lot of problematic laws on your books. A lot of them start addressing those whether it's something that is on your plate right now or something that is not even in your forecast in the next year or two. Look at these specific things, ask yourself why they're still there and address them before they become a problem. Because you're basically threatening them with their dollars going away. And it becoming a public issue that pretty much the rest of the country or the rest of the left-leaning country, let's just say, will loudly support. And then all of a sudden you've got this controversy. So I do think that sports teams can sort of do the work and say, where is the potential problem by hosting a bowl game in Idaho? Well, and so that's the only thing that I could think of at the top of my head that really would get ahead of this and would frankly be beneficial for everybody, right? Because you're getting rid of or changing out antiquated laws and anti-inclusive laws. And then you avoid mixing sports and politics because you've got to have to be an issue. Israel, good tiara, before I let you go, where can everybody find you on the internet? Do you want to be found on the internet? I mean, you could find me on Instagram. You recently deleted your Twitter account, I hear. I deactivated it for a while. It's a little bit of a social experiment. Which is going great, by the way. But it's also just a little bit of, again, learning to love myself and realizing that I don't need to get involved in a lot of these things that happen on that particular app. I'm not saying I won't be back, but right now you can just find me on Instagram at mr. is Gutierrez, M-R-I-Z-G-U-T-I-E-R-E-Z. And who knows? If my following on there gets super big, then maybe I'll be really active there and be more of a voice. But right now, so, and I've got read my Facebook a long time ago. Yeah. But yeah, you could find me there on Instagram or... And actually, I have my email address currently on my bio on Instagram. Maybe you don't want to do that. Yeah, maybe you don't. I've gotten some random emails lately, but hey, while it's still up there, you can hit me up. Find them on Insta. Thank you so much, Izzy, for doing this. Appreciate it. Hey, my pleasure. It's a blast. Thank you to everyone at home or on the go for listening today.
