    "text": " Men, if you've been following me for any amount of time, you know that I believe that there is a real dismissal of men in masculinity in society today. Now, I'm hesitant to use the term, you know, war on masculinity or attack on masculinity because I believe that words have meaning. That said, there are some very real threats, not only to men and boys, but the fabric of American culture and also Western civilization as a whole. And today I'm joined by a man who is working hard to fight against it. His name is Charlie Kirk and he is the founder of Turning Point USA and the New York Times bestselling author of the MAGA Doctrine. Today we discuss how men seem to have become the enemy in society, the sedation and feminization of males, emotional manipulation and cultural issues such as the dismantling of the family unit, the power of free speech, and ultimately how the deck is stacked against men and more importantly what we can do about it. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast and the Order of Man movement. Welcome here. Welcome back. I've got a very, very powerful conversation lined up for you today. Now no doubt this is going to be a controversial one with somebody who tends to be controversial. I'm going to explain more about that because I don't think if you listen to what he's saying, it's all that controversial. But we'll get to that in a minute. If you're new to the podcast, this is a podcast designed to help you become a better man. So we're having conversations that are going to help you do just that. Some of them you're going to agree with. Others you're not. But the whole goal and idea is that we have civil discourse and we start to hash out some of these important issues that we're facing as men and in society in general. Before we get into the meat of the discussion, we're going to talk a lot about America and Western civilization and on the subject of America. I want to introduce our show sponsors, Origin, Maine. Now these guys make products, all kinds of products, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gis, rash guards, lifestyle apparel, denim, boots. They've got a nutritional supplement called Jocko Fuels where they've got to pre-work out and cognitive enhancing drink. I mean, they've got it all. They're doing everything. And actually we're going to start partnering up Order of Man and Origin to bring a new product. That's all I can say right now. A new product to you. So stay tuned. In the meantime, I would suggest that you take a look at their American goods specifically their denim and their boots, 100% sourced and made in America, right out of here in Maine, 20 minutes from my house. You can check it out. I like the bison boots specifically. And you can do that at origin, Maine.com, origin, Maine.com and use the code order at checkout because you're going to get a discount when you do. Again, origin, Maine.com, use the code order at discount at checkout rather. Let me get that right. Order of Man is the discount at checkout. There you go. All right, guys, let me introduce you to my guest today. His name is Charlie Kirk. Many of you already know who he is. As I said earlier, can be a very polarizing figure. And I think if you listen to his message and what he shares and you try to strip away the preconceived biases and notions that we all have, I don't think what he shares is all that controversy at all. He's the founder and president of Turning Point USA, which is a movement dedicated to empowering young people to promote the principles of free markets and limited governments. And he's also the author of the New York Times bestselling book, The Magaductrin, the only ideas that will win the future. And guys, today he is here to talk with us about his fight to save men and to save America. Charlie, what's up, brother? Glad to be joining you today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. I got to admit, you look like you've been, you've been running around quite a bit. I know we had to reschedule a couple of times and while I can appreciate that, but it seems like you're a busy man these days. Yeah, doing two podcasts today, one on Saturday, one on Sunday, trying to get the president re-elected and still run Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action and speaking. And so, but we're glad we made this work. How do you do it all, man? That's what I want to know. I've got four kids. I've been married for 16 years. I'm running two different businesses. And I think I'm running about half of what you're running at. And even I feel overwhelmed. So tell me your secret. Well, the four kids, I don't know if I'd be able to do that. That sounds like quite a lot. Hopefully there'll be kids coming soon. I don't know who in my life. I don't know. But look, I really, really love what I get to do. I don't love some of the things I have to do to do it, such as traveling. I don't like that. Cross-country flights, the sleepless nights, red eyes, you know, checking in a new hotel. I don't like that, the kind of the technical part of it. But I really love pursuing ideas. I love convincing people. I love being challenged. And that just motivates you. You know, I'm up till midnight, one o'clock, one 30 every night, and then just up, you know, seven o'clock, six 37. And that's on a good night. That's sleeping in, by the way. And we have a great team. I'm very disciplined with how I spend my time. I really don't do anything that isn't pertinent to the mission. The only thing I would do, I'll work out five or six days a week. That's about it. But I don't do video games. You know, I don't really have leisure activities. You know, people say, what do you do for fun? Really do that, you know, kind of just do the mission. And so when you're, we actually have more time in a day than I think people realize. I think that most people waste so much time. So yeah, I'm incredibly blessed, wrote a book this year, made bestseller, you know, did the podcast thing now it's turning into a radio show. We were doing three podcasts a week. Now we're doing 12 podcasts a week. I knew that. So it's wild. Yeah, not to mention the longer form interviews and in a regular year, I'd be doing 300 speeches a year. Probably not going to hit it this year out for obvious reasons. So but I'm actually on pace. If I were to keep the pace on right now, I would have been I'd be doing more than 350. But no, look, I love what I get to do. I'm incredibly blessed and just very thankful. The term I use is integrated. And it sounds like you're very integrated with your work and your life. And there's not a bunch of different hats. Like a lot of men will talk about hats. I got to wear the family hat, the dad hat, the work hat. And I found in my own personal life that if I don't pretend like I'm wearing different hats, but instead say, I'm one man, whether I'm at work, whether I'm with my family, whether I'm with my friends or in my own leisure activities, there's a lot of congruency and integration between the way I live my life. And that's much more efficient than trying to put on different hats and pretend like I'm somebody different in each circumstance. Yeah. And I have the opportunity to not have to be somebody different. I mean, one of the greatest gifts that God has given me is I say the same things publicly as I do privately. Because that's I'm in the business of speaking and I'm in the business of idea advancement. So people come to me and they say, Charlie, and I'm going to lawyer at this law firm, a partner. I own this business and I wish I could be you because you're able to say the same thing in a work setting that you're able to say in a private setting. And so that kind of, as you say, congruency is actually very liberating. I don't have to pretend to be somebody in a different environment. And also I just have decided to completely disassociate with myself with anyone that is any form of nastiness or vitriol just as a compulsory friendship. I've just discontinued those. It is. Which, you know, it's funny. It's funny you say that because look, I see you in videos, I see you on the socials and you have immersed yourself in frankly what I would consider nastiness frankly, you know, with the rallies you go to and on campus and what you subject yourself to. I don't know if I could handle it. Is that because of your mission? Is that your purpose? Like, what keeps you going in those hostile environments? Yeah, I don't find I actually kind of enjoy the idea collision because I actually think it's good for our country to have different ideas. He presented against each other. I don't love being screamed at by some of these apparatrix. I mean, I'm not a sociopath. So that's something I find enjoyment about. But I will say that I do think that it's beneficial when those conversations are occurring and happening, the millions of people that might be watching them in the future. So when I go to a campus and some lunatic is screaming in my ear and about how awful of a person I am and all these sorts of things, at least I can have some form of peace that if I'm filming it, somebody might learn something from this in the future. And so that kind of makes it in some ways worthwhile. However, I wish what I was saying wasn't so deemed disagreeable. I actually think what I'm saying is pretty normal stuff. And it's just the overton window has changed so dramatically in our country that if you dare say there are only two genders or that there's a war on men or that we shouldn't judge people based on their skin color, you're all of a sudden deemed worthy of cancellation and outrage. And I obviously don't subscribe to that. So I think, and again, it's a mission driven thing. I actually really believe in this stuff, which is what drives me to continue to do it. You know, it's funny you talk about these, these ideas that I think, you know, 30, 40, 50 years ago weren't controversial. You know, I think about myself. I have four kids already told you that I believe in God. I believe men or men and women are women. I believe in traditional family values. I wouldn't have thought that that would be counterculture. I've never considered myself rebel. But it seems to me that now more than ever that I'm the rebellious one because I have all of these traditional values. And it's a very interesting thing that these types of things that we know with 100% certainty, lead men and families and women in society to a better life have become controversial. That's right. And now the sudden those of us that believe in taking responsibility for yourself and for your family, not blaming other people for your circumstances, applying yourself correctly, finding a good and moral aim, all of a sudden, this is considered to be controversial. And I think it's actually really dangerous for our country to do that and for our civilization to do that. I mean, if you get if you're now married and you are faithful that person with children, you are now the exception, not the rule. Right. That's really an incredible thing when you think about it. And it's also a very dangerous thing. And so you also asked early on, you know, how am I able to do it? It's also what I don't do. I even had a drink in a very, very long time. You know, I think that we, if you look at successful people, obviously don't do drugs or any of that. But for myself, I would not be able to do what I do if I were to be doing the substances that most of the people in this world do. And I think that there's there's a lesson here that a lot of people need to realize that there's a reason why they're trying to tell you to do alcohol all the time. There's a reason why they're trying to do that. And it's really to keep you down. And I think that you can actually become a much more, and again, I'm not actually morally against drinking. Let me be very clear. I'm not trying to make people feel bad if they're doing that. I'm purely talking about it from a utilitarian perspective. Just let me be very clear that I don't think I biochemically would be able to do what I do if I indulge in the same form of casual drinking that most of the country has been the last six months in particular. Yeah, I agree. I think what a lot of men do is they sedate themselves because the reality of their situations are difficult and demanding. And they learn from their parents, and they learn from society because we have this entire generation of fatherless homes how to respond to difficult circumstances. And all of us have difficult circumstances, whether it's the wake of COVID or we've lost a job or we deal with a family with a medical condition. It's such a travesty that so many men have not learned to address this in a positive manner and instead have learned that the way you deal with it is to sedate yourself. And that's what I see more and more of. Yeah, and nothing good happens after you're drunk. And that's a lot of people that make it is truly, and I hate to use this term because it's overused, it's a gateway to other bad things. You will make other discuss, you have to say things you don't mean you might hurt somebody you don't mean to hurt both physically or otherwise. And then it also makes you less responsible, more likely to fall into a pattern of behavior that you're not going to be able to take responsibility for your actions. And again, I'm not morally against it. I want to be very clear. I'm not trying to make anyone feel worse if they're doing that thing. I'm just saying it actually will make you in the long-term a much unhappier, much more unhappy, and less likely to be able to take the meaningful type of responsibility you need to in your life to be able to succeed. Yeah, I like this because I think what we hear a lot from the quote unquote self help gurus is here's what you need to do have a schedule, work a plan, be disciplined and all the things that you should do. None of those are wrong. I agree. But we don't hear from those of us who tell us, okay, well, here's what you need to eliminate from your life. Eliminate this adation, eliminate the toxicity, eliminate those friends who aren't serving you, so you can free up a path to be able to pursue like you talked about your mission, whatever it is for you. It's completely. Yeah. And so, I mean, again, I'm someone that has a great passion for what I get to do. I do it every single day. There are no days off. I don't have more talent than anyone else in this space, but I outwork everybody. I don't mean that bragadociously. It's just we have done that for seven and a half, eight years, and we're going to continue to do that. Let me pause you right there, Charlie. Is that let me ask you about your work ethic, because I recognize that to be true. Is that something that is innate within you? Or is that something you've developed? That's something I feel like I have as well. But I don't know if everybody has that same sort of drive and desire to just grind it out. And it seems like you do. Most people don't. Most people don't. And I don't know where it came from. My parents always taught me and showed me what hard work looks like. My father being an architect would work till 1.30 in the morning, every single morning for most of my life. He'd come home for dinner and then go back to work till 1.30 and wake up at 8 a.m. and do it all over again. That was the kind of culture I grew up around. And I mean, just looking at my high school life, I was always signing up for more activities, always working harder. I don't know if it's built into you. I can't quite pinpoint it. All I know is that I have known nothing my entire life other than being hyperactive and apps. And there's a really important thing though. Some of these people will go to some of these conferences that you just mentioned and they'll be fired up and they will start putting in those long hours. But the minute that any sort of adversity hits them, it's brittle and they shatter. And so it's not just being able to put in the long hours and work till 11 p.m. every single night and wake up at 6 a.m. and work Saturdays and work Sundays and do not drink and don't do drugs and stop watching mindless television and get rid of your video games, all that sort of stuff. Right? Again, if you're able to do a great life with those things, terrific. I love freedom. So good for you. I'm just telling you what works for me. Right? And so I don't mean this in a way where I'm trying to make someone feel bad or you're a bad person. I'm going to keep saying that because sometimes people read and do it too much. I am saying, I think our listeners here are a little bit more aware than that. Where there will be some context and these messages where people say, well, you know, people say, well, Charlie, do you think I'm a bad person because I have a beer once a week? I've never said people are incapable of context and discernment for sure. So yeah, that's good. And so to go to go a step further and a level deeper on this, though, if we kind of look at what so people who's really self help exercise and they have no capacity to withstand suffering. The hardest thing to do is to keep going when you really come across something that requires perseverance. When you have someone betray you, when you have someone come after you that wants to destroy your career, when you have a contract fall through, when you have a project that doesn't go the way you wanted it to, when you get a very angrily worded email from a donor in our world, you know, in our nonprofit world, that's right, you know, who we raise money from. How do you deal when that happens? And that's really when your toughness comes through. And we have created one of the most fragile generations in the history of humanity. We've done it through our school system. We've done it through our pop culture. We've done it through a variety of different ways. And I know the name of this program is the Order of Man. But just for young men out there, we have fully grown infants. Most young men in our country are not young men. They do not deserve that title. They are responsible for nothing. They have no direction at all whatsoever in their life. They have no capacity to be able to endure opposition or suffering. They have no direction and no aim whatsoever. And they're just infants. They are fully grown infants that are wholly subsidized by their parents or by a masculine woman. It's a great point. And this is exactly why we make the distinction between males and men. You know, I look at my, my boys, for example, I've got three boys and I've got one little girl and I look at my boys and nobody expects them to be men. They're immature, they're overly emotional. They throw temper tantrums occasionally. They don't know how to respond to situations with dignity and class and intelligence. Nobody expects them to. But it would be a shame if I saw my young boys grow into adult age without learning how to mature. The question I have is, how do we begin to foster this in a generation of young boys and girls who are growing up without fathers? Yeah, it's really hard because then the women have no aim to go marry and the men have no aim to go to basically harmonize with or try to embody, right? So women need strong fathers because they want a role model to be able to eventually go marry somebody like that. And then men, and that's not the only reason, by the way, that's just to vary. That's one of the most important reasons. And a man needs, a young boy needs a male father figure. So he knows what to aspire to. So he knows what to try to become. And when you break that down, your civilization will start to fall apart. But it's also, I see two parent households where the roles are reversed, where the female has become the male and the man has become the woman. And it is masculine women and feminine men. And you kind of hear the stereotype on some comedy shows and stuff. But it's actually really true, which is the kind of metropolitan beta male, where if you if you looked hard, you couldn't find an ounce of testosterone in some of these, these men, and they take responsibility for nothing and they've almost kind of turned themselves into this and dragonous, very unclear form of a once man now newly found woman. And that's a very dangerous thing for a country and for a civilization. And so what do we do for young men? And I know this, look, so first of all, we are over medicating young men. That's number one. No doubt. No doubt. Don't talk about this enough. If I would have grown up today, I would have been an ADHD or ADD, I should say, attention deficit disorder medication. You heard my schedule. I can't find enough stuff to do. I love being active. School is not designed for people like me. I could never sit still in second, third and fourth grade. I could never focus on what the teacher was telling me. I would always be active. I'd be up on my feet. That's just who I am. And that's how a lot of young boys are, but my parents to their credit, despite the pill pushers and people trying to intersect themselves, say, we are not putting our kid on medication, he'll grow up, he'll find his voice, he'll be fine. That was the best thing they could have done for me. Whereas now someone like me, you know what should worry everyone, there are thousands of people like Charlie Kirk that are being medicated right now, because parents are not holding the line against the over the over medication push in our country. And I would say Charlie on that is, I know you're a big fan of making sure we use the right verbiage. And so you're saying over medication, and technically that's true, but I would say it's more over sedation. Can you imagine sedating a child, you know, an eight year old child who's got creativity and passion and enthusiasm, and you say to yourself, if you had to recognize it for what it truly was, say, you know what, I don't like all that passion. Let's strip away a little bit of that passion by popping you full of pills so that you'll conform and toe the line and do what you're supposed to be doing. Yeah. And so yeah, you're right. Sedation's absolutely a better term. And look, if someone has a legitimate medical condition unrelated to their capacity and not focus, but what happens is these, the entire school system's been feminized. It's designed for women by women to be taught by women and for women. That's fine. Women are much more agreeable than men. And boys in particular are incredibly disagreeable. They can't sit still. They are they need to be involved in the learning process. That's why recess is important for young boys and not as important for young women. And so young women are thriving in our country. And in fact, I would make the argument that every metric that they're thriving at is not it's actually in some ways at the expense at times of men. And that I'm not saying that women are the problem. But the fact when 60% of college graduates are now women, that's that's not that there's no equilibrium there. And that comes at some expense because the school system has been so hyper feminized where young women are more than willing to sit and go through an entire class without moving a fourth grader, a young boy, forget it. That's not for two hours. That's asking a lot out of a young boy. I mean, I can't even know I can't even do that as an almost 40 year old man at this point. So let alone eight year old child, let alone in the digital age where they have a dopamine rush every time that their phone bangs and I'll get into that in a second. If we have, you know, if you want to go in that direction, where also in additional additionally that so what do we do for young boys? Let me just kind of go back. So we're overly sedating them. We're hyper feminizing their learning environment. And also the way that we educate them just to the curriculum is absolute garbage. Young men from very young boys from a young age are being taught that men are the enemy and women are good and you must make yourself more feminine in nature. This is garbage. It's nonsense. Foolish. For example, the literature that we teach young boys that they have to read, they don't want to read little house on the prairie. They would rather read a biography about Teddy Roosevelt. And so we, biographies are the best way to get young boys attention. Why? Because young boys want somebody to emulate. They want a hero. They want to resonate with that. Why does little house on the prairie resonate with young women? They want a family to nurture and young. They're much more relational. So books that are much more in dialogue form, women do a lot better when they're in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade. Much more the adventure form. Young boys do a lot better. That's why Mark Twain was such an incredibly important author for the formation and the hero's spirit. For our country, we don't teach anymore because they used a word they don't like. I mean, just grow up. And so that's the second other thing. And then finally, if I had put like third, the first being sedation, second high-perfamination of our school slash curriculum. The third thing is this is that we do not challenge young men for their call to adventure. Young men need to be challenged. And I mean this is why football is such an important part of our country and they're trying to destroy that too. I don't think football is for everyone, but it was important for me. I could tell you in my life, when I was an 8th grader, football really made me grow up very quickly saying, yes, sir, no, sir, to a strong male figure that made you be on the line at the exact time, being able to run wind sprints, hierarchy, order, discipline. For me, football really got me in the line. For all that distracted energy that I had in the classroom, football was, I had meaning, I had fulfillment, I had camaraderie. And you know what? The physical combativeness, I loved that. I loved being able to get out and have the blood flowing and testosterone. That was awesome. And again, it's not for everybody. I fully recognize that. But I can tell you it made me a more complete and fuller human being. And so we don't do that kind of call to adventure as much anymore. And outside of the football analogy, we need to be challenging 16-year-olds to take responsibility for their life. Here's how you treat women. Here's how you talk. Here's how you communicate. Here's how you set up straight with your shoulders back. You look clearly in people's eyes. All those sorts of things are completely lost. And now we have, and Jordan Peterson has said this so many times, we have the Peter Pan equivalent of the lost voice. We have tens of millions of fully mature infants or males that are not men that have no responsibility. They own nothing. They're full of substances. They're overweight. They have no direction. And they're cowards. And I can go into that further as to why that obviously is a problem. I think it's pretty self-evident. Yeah, I like the lost boys analogy. The analogy I've used quite often too is Lord of the Rings. You know, where you don't, excuse me, Lord of the Flies, sorry, where you don't have. Yeah, it's the exact reason. Yeah. Me, Lord of the Flies and lost boys are exactly the same idea. You're governed by the infants, basically. Right. Right. And so what happens without that clear male masculine, authoritative figure is they begin to take it upon themselves. And this is, I think, a big reason why we see the rioting and the vandalism and the violence and the looting because these young men, these boys, regardless of what age they are, have never learned to toe the line. You know, you talk about football. I had a, I had a football coach who got on my face. I remember what, when I went to basic training, I saw the guys that I went to basic training with. I could tell you, just in the first 24 hours, who was accustomed to having another grown man up in their face yelling at them and who was never accustomed to that, who grew up without a father, who grew up without playing sports, I could tell because they broke within a 24 hour time frame versus the men who played sports, who had dads in their lives were unbreakable, were unshatterable at that point. I like the interviews brittle, right? And so what the, what the feminists have done and the weak men is they say that that's inherently abusive. Look, I had coaches that probably borderline down abusive and I don't mean physically. Okay, I don't. But emotionally, they really pushed the on horse on that. It made me a stronger person. Okay, it did. Maybe a stronger person. However, I wouldn't wish that upon somebody else. However, they were the minority, the vast majority of coaches I had, they pushed me to the level to make me better. They, when they screamed and yelled at me, it wasn't that I was scared. It was, they wanted you to get to that next level. They wanted you to become a stronger person. They expected you to take responsibility for yourself. And so what the feminists have done is they say all of that moral discipline, all of that, all of that male involvement, all of it is wrong because of the few examples of abuse. Therefore, we must feminize everything. I know that's a really bad idea. Okay. In fact, it's an, it's a civilizational ending bad idea. Somebody said something to me the other day. And I don't really remember it was my band of Starbucks or something where someone said, man, I have to go adult today. I said, excuse me. You've heard this verb or like whatever it's a noun adult, I guess I have to go with the verb. It would be a verb. Yeah, I have to go adult. If it's something I have to do. And I asked, I said, do you mean that in a negative sense? Like, yeah, I don't really want to do it. I said, and I thought to myself, I said, okay, I just ended the conversation. And then I really sat down. I turned off my phone. I thought to myself for like five minutes because I said, so it was just such a train wreck. This is how you destroy your entire civilization. When someone thinks that adult thing is bad, is that I got to go with adults right now, basically. And it goes back to a philosopher by the name of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. A lot of the American left, and I don't want to over politicize this, it's just true. A lot of the political left believes in this, which is they prefer the infant over the adult and the primitive over the civilized. He wrote that explicitly. Jean-Jacques Rousseau did. And he inspired Karl Marx. And that is exactly where they want young boys to stay. Is in this state of perpetual infancy. You know, it's funny you talk about this. We'll use the term. I don't even know if I want to use this term. I was going to say emotional abuse, but you have these coaches right there. We're towing the line. But what's interesting is you have women who are, yeah, I get it. I understand. And I've been there too. I've had great coaches and I've had dicks and I've had everywhere in between. Precisely. But you know what, you kind of become tougher because of it, to be honest. So, right. As long as you have the balance of the proper type of coaching to outweigh the negative coaching is otherwise it becomes abuse. Right. And then you start to buy into it. Yeah. No, no, no. And I think that critique is a valid one by the people that are saying, I think a critique either internally or externally, that's a valid one. What I think the prescription to try to fix it is to abolish all hierarchies of male pouring into young people is a disaster. And that's where they go immediately. But anyway, the same could be said though, for terrorizing women. Where women can terrorize other women and where teachers or whatever older sisters, the younger sisters, girlfriends to girlfriends or for women teachers to male students. So, it's not a coincidence. I mean, the only civilly this idea. I mean, you're exactly right. The emotional manipulation that I've seen in some women just in hearing conversations with men is absolutely insane. And frankly, society has bought into that generally. You look at, for example, the family court system and this level of emotional manipulation from women to ostracize men from their children, for example, is a real threat not only to those men and their children, but to society in general. So, I think women are just as guilty and I'm not putting it all on them, but just as guilty of emotional manipulation is any man could be. Yeah. And the idea that one sex or one gender has a monopoly on the manipulation exercise is foolish. And it doesn't look at any sort of reality or empirical experience at all. It's anti-imperialist. And so, yeah. And look, so when you ask yourself, how do we create stronger men? How do we create, you know, a country where we have men take responsibility? First of all, parents need to do a much better job. And most of them aren't. They're doing a horrendous job. Young men should not get a smartphone until they're 16 or 17 or 18. It's that simple. Do not give them a phone. These things are designed and programmed to have you be slaves to the Silicon Valley Tech oligarchs. They are designed to be biochemically addictive, no different than Big Tobacco. They've admitted this in congressional testimonies that they have created these devices to be addictive for young people. If you're a parent out there, take the phone away from your kid if they are not 16 years old and go buy them a jitterbug, which is just a phone that they can call you in a time of emergency. That's how I grew up and praise God. It was that way. If I would have grown up in today's society getting phones when kids are eight, nine, 10 years old, I would have been a wreck. I would have been a quasi cyborg where a lot of these people are being raised. I agree. For my two oldest, we have these Gizmo watches is what they're called. So they're just a wash. They're synced to our data plan or whatever. And they can call me, my wife, and maybe two or three other people. And there's a few little minor games, but all the games on there are centered around physical activities. So it's like, how many jumps can you do in 60 seconds? But outside of that, no access to anything else because I just think there is a larger plan at play here to have our children stray away from their mothers and their fathers. And unfortunately, it seems to be working. Here's my test. If you will not give your kid a firearm at that age, do you not give them a smartphone? You think it's that dangerous? No, I notice. When we have seen a 200% increase in suicide for preteen women since the smartphone mobile age, we have seen a dramatic increase in teenage suicides, self harm, hospitalizations, cocaine, alcohol usage, glorification, glorification of the worst aspects of society, objectification of women, it's no doubt. And most people would only use, so it's kind of funny. Do I think it could be more dangerous than a firearm? Absolutely. I mean, a firearm is only used if a bad person uses it. I know almost everybody that would have a smartphone would agree that it's made them a less human human being. So if you are not willing to, if you don't trust your child to give them a firearm, then do not give them a smartphone. It's that simple. And by the way, once they're at that age, that's fine. Because it takes responsibility to be able to deal with these things, their weapons. And not only that, but training. You know, I look at my oldest, he's 12, and he's used a firearm. In fact, we're going hunting this afternoon. I found some turkeys on our lower property. We're going out this afternoon. Also, you and I are done here. And I'm a big believer in young men being able to use guns early, by the way. I think it's a very important thing. As long as they have the structure, the guidance, the disciplines, and everything that goes behind it, it's not, yes, technically, it is a weapon, but also it's known as a tool. But you have to know how to use the tool effectively. And I agree with that with smartphones, internet, etc, etc. That, you know, it's only as effective as you use it. And our children are not mature enough to be able to use this effectively. No, but I just want to reinforce the point, though. And you might have seen the documentary on Netflix social dilemma. Maybe not. A lot of people are talking about it. I deleted my Netflix combo and my friends let me see it. These, I cannot reinforce this point enough. These social media platforms are way more dangerous than you realize. They have algorithms that manipulate, monitor screen time, listen to your conversations and track 12, 13 and 14 year olds needs, wants, interest, desires, anxieties in a very, very manipulative way. And they are social programming our children. And they've admitted to this. And so that's why I try to use that analogy of fire numbers. People usually say, what are you talking about? That's kind of provocative. No, it's 100% true. And that's the type of level that we have to have at this because I'm telling you that we are creating a more anxious, depressed and suicidal generation because of these devices. Guys, let me hit the pause button real quick on the conversation. Now, we've done our very best. I'm not great at this yet.

You can do that after the show. For now, I'll get back to it with Charlie. Well said. I mean, I know that to be true. I see my kids as friends who are involved in these things that are seemingly innocuous or not that dangerous. And I can see the difference. Clearly, I can see the difference and it's a real shame. And then we bought into the lie that this is what we need to be able to operate. And so we introduce these things to our kids young and becomes a trap for them. That's very dangerous. It's not going to end well. I want to shift gears a little bit. You know, one of the first things you said is how involved and how much weight and emphasis you place on quote unquote your mission. What would you say your mission is? I hate to phrase it this way. I'm trying to save the country. I mean, we've been doing this incredible from boy, from people who are not grateful that they live in this country. I mean, we have a counter insurgency, ideologically and culturally that quite honestly have a completely different vision for America. And I'm trying to save it from I hate to be this political about I'm trying to save it from the bitterness and ingratitude of the left. I'm trying to save it from people that quite honestly, they're angry that they live in America, not thankful that they live here. And I also believe very firmly that a country's ability or inability to communicate our founding values, our core values and morals to young people, that will that will basically predict or be the judge of whether or not your country will continue to exist. And we have things so good in this country. We have grown so comfortable. It's so convenient. It's so easy that we have no idea how easy this thing can all crumble. And I deal with the most radical voices on the left. I see their ideas being mainstreamed and platformed on a daily basis, where police departments are being defunded in Minneapolis and murder rates are up 40%. Where pedophilia is being decriminalized in California, where section 145 decriminalizes pedophilia, where I see cuties on Netflix. If this is not a fire alarm for those of us that just believe in decency and believe in normal American values, I'm obviously a conservative and I'm not afraid to talk about it. However, you're just if you're not even political, this should concern you because there's a disintegration happening in front of our very eyes. And so, I mean, I hate to put it in those terms, save the country, but that's basically what I try to do. Yeah, I don't think that's off. You know, I don't think you need to hate putting it in those terms because I believe a lot of that. I just don't want to make myself seem like I'm an avenger character or something, but yeah, I am trying to save the country. I mean, let's be honest, a lot of us are in the industry, not only of informing, but entertaining too. And so, maybe we use some of that hyperbolic language. But I believe when you say something that you don't mean it to be inflammatory, you don't mean it to grand eyes. You're doing it because you genuinely believe it. And there's some integrity there. Look, there's going to be people who don't agree with me or you. I know you're a polarizing figure, but at least there's some integrity here. No, you don't try to be, but just through the nature of society, you are, right? And I think anytime you find somebody who's convicted so strongly as you are, there's going to be people who are strongly convicted and the exact opposite. And that's what makes it polarizing. I think that's question. And I don't disagree with that. Go ahead. Well, my question is, why the hostility? You know, like, now, look, I happen to agree with a lot of what you have to say, probably 99% of what you say. But let's take the 1% or even if it was more, I can't imagine myself being so hostile towards you or anybody else that, you know, I'd wish you violence or death or any catastrophe to both fall upon you. But it seems to me that not only are we polarizing, we wish violence on people. I don't understand where this is stemming from. I mean, it's part of a belief that has grown from postmodernism in our country, where they believe dialogue and discussion is dangerous. And not just dangerous, they think it's evil. Look, there's two ways to govern human beings. Aristotle said it best, we as human beings are the speaking beings. So Aristotle, of course, the student of Plato, who is the student of Socrates, the ancient classics that built ancient Rome, kind of the birthplace of a lot of the ideas that we discuss here in the West. Aristotle famously said, what makes us different than any other creature on the planet is we can talk. We should not forget that. So there's two ways to govern humans. One way is through talking and speaking, convincing, reasoning, getting together in a room and coming together and saying, this is a bad idea, it's a good idea. Let's add some new one and some compromise. Okay, you otherwise by force, I have a bigger army, a bigger sword, and I'm willing to use it. Shut up. Most of human history has been governed by force, not talking and speaking. The American idea, the American experiment was let's govern by speaking and talking. So now we have a devolution back to this idea of governing by force. I cannot get a liberal to talk to me on my podcast. I can't find one. Why? I'll go talk on any liberal podcast. They never invite me on theirs and they won't come on mine. They believe speech is evil. They believe that if they come talk to me, they're validating a dialogue that will only make the country less likely from being made in their image. So I want to make the differentiation between leftists and liberals. Leftists do not believe in speech. Liberals generally do. I can't find many liberals out there. And I'm welcome. I was going to say, Charlie, it's funny you say this because I know as we release this conversation between between each other, I'm going to get a lot of messages. Like, I can't believe you give him a platform. Look, why wouldn't I? Why wouldn't I? Look, if your information is good, wouldn't we want to know? And if your information is bad, wouldn't we want to expose that? Just tell me one thing I've said that's wrong, a reprehensible and come tell me about it. That's my whole thing. I mean, just to reinforce it, I go to a college campus. I sit down there for three hours and anyone can come up to me with their own camera and film me and make me look like an idiot anytime. I sit there and I wait for you. And I got the inspiration from, you know, Stephen Crowder, who's terrific. Just sat there and said, come up to me. Got a problem with me. Talk to me about it. If we stop talking, we are going to get into brute physical conflict. I don't want that BLM does. They're burning down cities. They're being validated by mainstream Democrats. They're being bailed out of prison. They're being told that if you have a need to loot, you can loot. They're being allowed to destroy the fabric of our society. Why don't you talk about things? Because again, you read their literature, read Michelle Foucault, you read Jacques Derrida, you read Herbert Makuza, you read the Frankfurt School literature. They believe dialogue is the problem. They took exception with Socrates. They do not think speaking is important. What you and I are doing here is healthy. It's robust. If I say something really foolish, you're going to tell me that. You say something really good. I'm going to compliment you. Again, we are speaking beings. This is what makes us different than primates. You get rid of that, then you're going to tear each other's heads off. That's where we were for 3,000, 4,000 years. I'm more worried about the direction of our country than ever before because we've completely lost that. Then we have tech companies that kick people off just because they have different opinions, which is a very real threat and they have far too much power these tech companies do, something I can agree with the left on if they're actually honest about it. Look, these are legitimate things. The country's not going to continue to survive at this pace. It's just not. It's a very dangerous trajectory. How do you bring people to the table? I think about it, for example, when people say, oh, Ryan, you're in an echo chamber. I actually agree with that to some degree because those who view things differently than me, and I'm sure you're experiencing this as well, like you just said, they won't talk to you. I'll have you on and guys will say, well, why don't you have somebody from the left on? It's like, who? Go find one. Who? Like, I'll talk with them. Who? Yeah, but the left thing's that men are poisonous. I mean, just the name of your podcast, an entire political party thinks that they think your podcast name is evil. You had Maisie Harono during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings to help men to sit down and shut up. I mean, this is a mainstream American political party that's been trying to destroy the man for quite some time now. So how do you bring these people to the table, though, Charlie? I mean, that's the question. I mean, I don't. I mean, what I'm trying, what I'll give two names in particular, James Lindsey and Peter Bogogian, they're two liberals. That did come on my podcast to actually bash the same things that you and I are bashing. Believe it or not, they came to me saying that the left is unafraid to talk. So that, and I guess that's the best way to do it. I'm going to keep on going into their environments to try to have these discussions. I don't know. And there's not a lot of things. I'll answer it with the answer. I don't know because I'm not saying I know a lot. I just usually, I have an answer to a couple things there. If they're unwilling to engage, if they're unwilling to lock into any form of a dialectic, it's almost a non-starter and we're reinforcing it with our five-year-olds and our six-year-olds and our seven-year-olds. And it's really interesting, back in the 80s and 90s, a big fear from the left is they would say, we can't give power to all those Christians because they're going to be fundamentalists and they're going to come after us and it's going to be a theocracy. You probably remember this period in American history, of course. And the exact opposite has happened. As America became more secular and the left took power, they became evangelical, not Christian evangelical. They're the ones that are basically, they think this is like a holy war. They think like, if you don't agree with me, I'm going to destroy your life. And if you don't agree with me, I'm kind of like, all right, whatever, that's fine, I guess. Sure. I don't obsess over it, but these people are so convinced to destroy you. If you do not hold their opinion, it's incredibly pathological. Do you, I'm just taking some notes, Charlie. So as I look down, I don't want you to think on your phone or anything, I'm taking notes. But as the things you say and the situations you expose yourself to, do you fear for your safety? Well, I mean, I get death threats. I've had to get the FBI involved. We've had our house deemed targeted many different times. I can't walk on a college campus without 10-arm guard, it's helicopter support at times. I have security and stuff, but these people are cowards, if they want to do something against me, whatever. I mean, that's part of the game. The physical safety piece of it, I think, is mostly bluster and empty threats. And someone really has a problem with me, then come find me. And I'm not trying to say that in some sort of tough guy way, but I've been kicked out of restaurants, I've been physically threatened, I've had stuff thrown at me about in Tifa, follow me through the streets, I've had all that sort of stuff. And so you say I'm convicted, you're right. I've been fighting these people for quite some time. Yeah, I think I saw, it must have been a couple of years ago, you and two years ago, I can't believe, were you in a restaurant or are you trying to have lunch together? We were in a breakfast restaurant in Philadelphia, the Green Eggs Cafe, mine and her own business, and Antifa came and mobilized, came into the restaurant, ran us out of the restaurant, threw objects at us, police had to come, and all white Antifa liberals screaming at a black conservative saying that she's not black. Interesting. Yeah, isn't that an interesting thing? I think, oh, let's talk about that for a second, let's talk about race. I think a lot of this is the powers that would be trying to light a fire a little bit and to instigate. And you see these type of conversations, I'm really curious about your take on race just in society in general as it is currently. Yeah, I think we're actually a lot less racist and more decent to each other than BLM incorporated and any of the activist media would ever leisure believe. In fact, I'll go to say that we're the least racist, most accepting country ever to exist in the history of the world, ever. And I'm, let me just go back by saying I grew up in America in 2008 to 2012, I went to high school in the suburbs of Chicago, a 53% English as a second language high school. So I went, I was as a white person, I was a minority as a white person in my high school, wheeling high school, you look up the demographic info, it is a majority Hispanic high school. My best friends were everything from illegal aliens to immigrants from Jamaica to African Americans to blacks, you name it, right Polish. I say this with a lot of reflection being done to this. We did not care about each other's skin color. We looked at each other as human beings and I grew up in that post racial America. I experienced it. I know it can happen. I lived through it. We treated each other decently. Everyone had the same opportunities anyone else in our public public high school. There was an institutional racism, there was a crap that didn't exist. So I take a, that's why I take a very firm stance on this race issue. And so whatever they might say, we're a systemically racist, we are not, we're absolutely not. And so they point to a couple subset of statistics, they say, well, blacks are doing worse than whites. I said, wait a second, you mean that if you look at the data, a black child married to, a black child who is raised by a mother and father who stay loyally married is far more likely to succeed than a white kid that is raised by a single mother. That's simple. It is not a race issue. It is a father issue. And we have subsidized followlessness from the top down to the Great Society Act. We've emasculated fathers. We've been through that. Our public school system has been hyper feminized. And you repeat that cycle over the last couple decades. Yeah, you're going to get the outcomes you get. That's not a racism problem. That's a family problem. And here's another great example as to how we're not a systemically racist country. And again, I lean in on these racist issues, no holds bar. You know, most people are afraid to have these conversations that you're not talking about. They're like, oh, you're not allowed to say this is a white man. I'm like, why? You're white. I'm a white straight man. And I know you've heard this more than more than me. Every time somebody says that, I'm like, oh, so, so what, I'm not allowed to have an opinion. I'm not allowed to share my perspective because I'm white. I'm going to believe that. This is ridiculous. Well, and by the way, truth transcends skin color. So I couldn't whoever believes that, you're racist, you're judging people by the color of your skin. But the greatest example of all this is Nigerian immigrants to America. Nigerian immigrants to America are the most successful immigrant ethnic group to America over the last 25 years. They're black and they've succeeded and succeeded, unbelievable. In fact, I could read an article from Aussie.com. Aussie.com, which is a left wing publication generally. They're partners with Vox and many others. Where they say we need more Nigerian immigrants in America because they succeeded such high rates. So either Aussie, the far left wing publication, either they hate Nigerian immigrants because they want them to come to a systemically racist country, or they actually might be looking at the same data that I am, which is that we're not systemically racist. Why do Nigerians do so well in this country? I'll tell you why. In the Nigerian culture, family is everything, everything. In Nigeria, they have the highest birth rates of any country in Africa. They're the most populated country in Africa. The Nigerian culture, for whatever reason, and there's plenty of good books written on this, is a country and a culture of monogamous marriage, of intergenerational family supporting and living with each other, of working hard, of valuing education. So if Nigerians can do so well in this country with coming with nothing and entering with nothing, and these are liberal publications that are saying this, by the way, Bloomberg, Aussie, Vox, you name it, you look it up, this type of Nigerian immigrant success stories, and the data shows it, they do better than white Americans in our country. Maybe the country's not rigged for just a skin color. Maybe the country's set up to reward choices. And so I just, I am really exhausted, looking and viewing it, personal appeal, I do not understand the landscape. They don't understand the statistics or data, but they're incredibly driven, emotively, by a couple issues in the news that they're supposed to be outraged about, even though they know nothing about it, like the Breonna Taylor case, which is ridiculous, made a whole video on that happy to dive in that if you want to, where you're told to be mad about something, when the data does not reflect any bit at all whatsoever. Well, you know, the hard part is, is that most of us, and look, I've fallen prey to this as well, I was like, I don't need the data, just, just give me the clickbait. You know, and so you look at these titles and it's like, oh, I got everything I need. Well, no, you actually don't, because not only is there not more information buried in the article, there's more information that goes on behind the scenes that is not even in the article. Yeah, I mean, let me tell you something we should be worried about in our country right now. We're on pace to have 500,000 less children next year than this year. That warrants a nationwide conversation. Let me tell you a real crisis in our country. It's not police officers killing black people. Okay, that happens less likely than you are to be struck by lightning, just you understand statistically. A real crisis, one in four young people have contemplated suicide in the last 90 days, according to CDC. When no real crisis antidepressants are now the most prescribed medication for the people in the age of 30, alcoholism, cocaine, self harm, hospitalizations, they're all up. You want to know real crisis? 100,000 small businesses have gone under since March. So the media, in their hypnotic ways, the simulation, as I like to call it, they're telling you to believe the sequence of lies. And this is propagated by LeBron James and by the National Basketball Association and the National Football League and our major corporations that were systemically racist. First of all, no, we're not. Second of all, there are 280 other issues that I could list ahead of policing in America as the biggest issue in our country, family formation, drug addiction, sedating our children, communicating our values, literacy rates, all those things matter abundantly more. As I mentioned, birth rates going down, most people don't talk about this. Go to the Brookings Institution study from June of this last year, June or July published by Bloomberg, civilizational collapse upcoming, the unintended consequence of the coronavirus. So we're on pace to have nearly a cut in half of our birth rate. And no one knows this. Wow. That's interesting. You know, it's funny you say this because just last night we had some friends, I live in Maine, I had we had some friends come through. Oh, I love me. That's beautiful. They're from Utah. They came up here and we were talking with her. Her daughter-in-law is about to have her 101st grandchild. Wow. I can't even. I'm thinking about that. I'm like, I can't even. Wait, are they from Utah? They're from Utah, of course, right? Yeah, of course. Large families. Large families. They probably held the S. Yes, of course. And I am too. So like, I completely understand that. We have large families. We bring a lot of kids in the world. Don't get me wrong. I'm plotting it. I think it's awesome. I've talked with people who are very, very concerned about bringing kids into the world in this environment. And I can't personally think of a better way to reverse the trend of society than to bring an army of young men and women who are raised in righteousness into this world to reverse the trends that we're seeing in society right now. Completely. Yes. And so one of the major reasons why people say they're not having kids is because of fear. You're right. Number two is socioeconomic reasons. And then also just three that we socially isolate ourselves so much. And this sounds really strange. We have more single young people than married young people. We have a crisis of young men that are afraid to approach women because they're afraid they'll be accused of something. They're uncomfortable in that kind of situation scenario. And they have no masculinity in themselves at all whatsoever to be able to have a meaningful relationship. Right. So yeah, that's this is this has long-term generational consequences to it. Where yeah, look, the federal this is what people say, well, what would you do about this politically? Because I try I try to have somewhat of a solution for every problem. We should sell the federal lands out west to young families under the age of 30 for almost dime on a dollar to go have many children. That's something we should make it easier to have big families. It sounds it sounds oversimplified, but I would have to agree. You know, I've heard we did it before. It's just it's homesteading is what it is. I mean, that's that's part of the reason we moved out here. You know, we've got just under 50 acres. We moved out here. We homeschool our children. We have for the past two years now, we've got big family. We've got neighbors who have big families. And I love the style. You know, one of the things I'm seeing and I think this is is very deliberate and intentional as a dismantling not only of the family unit, but also of the church. And I think the church in a lot of ways has replaced the family unit. That's where people gain a lot of their values from and understand how we operate successfully in society. You know, and I've heard people that you're connected with talk about how culture precedes politics, right? And this is exactly what we're talking about a culture of family, a culture of values through the church, whether that's the LDS church or the Catholic church, or some denomination of Christianity. This is where our values are derived from. And it's being dismantled right before our eyes. Yes. And the church is now playing in a lot of different churches and obvious, you know, exceptions are my pastor, Rob McCoy and many others that do such a great job, you know, communicating these values is now a lot of more complicit in these disintegrationist movements of our country. So, well, I think we've got under the notion as a Christian that that somehow I don't think it would be this, this, this deliberate, but almost that that we're supposed to be weak as opposed to me. And that's actually the reason I reached out to you. I've had you on my radar for a long time because I followed what you're doing. And I listened to the conversation last week or a couple of weeks ago that you had with Pastor Rob. And I thought, man, I really got to pull the trigger on this and get Charlie on the podcast. Thank you. Yeah, man. What you guys shared was so, so powerful. And I love to hear not only from you, but from Pastor Rob. Strong, Christian men who are unafraid to share your, your perception of the way that we can make this society better. And it seems like there's a lot of Christians out there who are afraid to do it. And it's a question of how do you want yourself to be governed? It's a question of civil society is not a place where Christians should compartmentalize our worldview. We should be actively involved in it. And so in California, when they're passing SB 145, which decriminalizes pedophilia, and the American church is generally silent on that, we'll be judged for that. Oh, my goodness. Will we be judged for that? And so, you know, I can go through a variety of different reasons and disappointments and struggles with that. But the American church needs to rise up in huge numbers right now. And if your pastor still has your church closed or is bowing to BLM incorporated this live systemic racism or critical race theory, leave that church to it respectfully into it lovingly get out. It is not worthy your time or your tithes. I actually saw a video just before you and I hopped on the call of a, he must have been a pastor of a church and he was outside and what looked like a parking lot. And there was circles spray painted in the parking lot and they were distanced. And so he had his congregation there. Well, the video was him being arrested. You know, his congregation was there. They were singing hymns. They were worshiping and he's being arrested. Is that where it was? Okay, because apparently because he had, I don't know, no mask on or because he congregated all these people, whatever, whatever the reason was crazy. Yeah. And look, this is they're going to keep and by the way, BLM incorporated can march through the streets and destroy and savage our cities and act like thugs and criminals and they don't get arrested for that. But pastors open their church and they get criminalized and they get arrested for that. Man, it's time for the church to wake up to this. Well, and I think this is where the, the silent majority needs to stop being so silent. You know, I think of myself and I'm like, you know, I just want, I really, here's what I want, Charlie. I want to be left alone. I want to do my work. I want to raise my kids. I want to work my land. And I just want to have some experiences with a little money in the bank account. That's it. And if you could just leave me alone to do that, that would be fine. And traditionally, that's been the case for the last almost four decades of my life. It seems to me that there's a real reason for me to stop being so silent and actually get involved at this point. Yeah. And we have an opportunity to do that in November. And I'll tell you that if you, if you want to be left alone and work your land, Joe Biden's not your guy. I'll tell you that. But you know, President Trump, he has, he has delivered amazing results for our country and really is a referendum on what kind of country we want to live in, one that respects speech and wants to go about our differences in a civil way or one that you want to take to the streets. So that's what I'll be working on from now to the election. I have no doubt you will. Hey, personal question for you. You seem to be somebody who is very, very, very well researched. You have all this information. Obviously, you're an intelligent human being. How do you balance being well researched, but then also taking so much time to be able to articulate and communicate that with the public? Because sometimes it seems like those are at odds with each other. I can either research or I can communicate. How do you balance that out for yourself? Yeah, every night I turn off my phone and I do at least an hour and a half, the two hours of reading and research, watching lectures, reading great books, listening, you know, reading good articles and thoughtful scholarship. And then I try to bring that over into the next day. And so just was working through Aristotle recently, which is where I kind of derived some of my comments today, where I found what he taught, you know, spoke about speaking. I got funny, so important. And so I tell everyone, read more and speak less. It's very important. So if I'm doing three hours of podcasting a day, I should be reading more than that. And that's, that's a lot of time, you know, I value scholarship and research a lot. And again, I'm constantly learning. The more I learn, the more I realize how little I knew when I thought I knew it all. Hmm. You talk about it being a lot of time, but it's no more time than any other man myself included has in a day. It's just how we spend it. That's right. That's exactly right. So well, Charlie, I want to be respectful of your time on that note and just let you know, I appreciate what you're doing. I appreciate your willingness to share in, in, in the face of an uphill battle at times, it seems like, but a noble fight for sure. So thank you for joining us. Thank you for doing what you do. And I really appreciate you being willing to share your strangeness of that as well. I appreciate it. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Thanks brother. Gentlemen, there you go. My conversation with the one and only Charlie Kirk. I know we're going to have a lot of conflicting ideas and thoughts and, and perspectives on this podcast, which is good. I actually like that. You know, if we're all agreeing on, on it, or all disagreeing, I think we've created somewhat of an echo chamber. And you know, that tends to happen as you create a movement because we're all centered and rallied around common principles and goals and objectives. But I would love to hear your feedback, the pros, the cons, the, the, in, in differences. It's very, very important that we have these types of real conversations. And yes, they're uncomfortable. And yes, they're awkward. And yes, people will get upset. But you know, the alternative was we talk about things that are only comfortable. And we don't address the real issues that we as men are called to deal with that were called to address and that were called to step into. So connect with Charlie on the interwebs, connect with me on the interwebs. Charlie's very active on both Instagram and Twitter. You can go to the show notes to check out his links. You can also connect with me on Instagram and Twitter, both at Ryan Mickler. Let me know what you thought about the show. Good, bad and different. And let's have a civil conversation about some of these very, very important issues in society today. Guys, make sure you on that note that you subscribe, that you support us by going to the store store.orderman.com that you check out Origin Maine, my friends and show sponsors at origin Maine.com and using the code order of man at discount. And then just share. That's it guys, just share. Right, more people need to hear this message and more people are hearing this message. We continue to grow each and every month. And that's a testament to you getting vocal about the issues that we as men need to get vocal about. So please continue down the path, share with a brother, a friend, a colleague, a coworker, a woman, a man, whoever needs to hear the message of reclaiming and restoring masculinity back to his rightful place. Guys, I will be back tomorrow for Kip Sorensen and my Ask Me Anything. But until then, go out there, take action and become a man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of a man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the order at order of man.com."
