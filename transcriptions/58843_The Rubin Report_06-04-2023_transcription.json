You got your transgenders, you got your queer. Now, what is queer that is separate from this? Like, if you're doing any of that other stuff, you're a little queer. What's intersex? That means you've got a wang and a hoo-hoo. That's a lot. I'll give those people a pass. I feel like that's a lot on the plate, you know what I mean? And then you've got Asexual, which is like, what, you want to have sex with cardboard or something? I'm Dave Rubin. This is The Rubin Report. It's April 6th, 2023. We're live streaming on Rumble, YouTube and locals. I think yesterday was our highest ever concurrent viewers on our live show across platforms. So I want to thank you, growing group of freedom fighters and patriots. I also want to thank Brock, who put together that short we put together there. That was just, I mean, the transgender one, the Asexual one. Absolutely perfect. We have a tremendous show for you. I said to the guys, I don't do this often. I usually ask them, what do you think we're going to get to today? And sometimes, Daphne usually low balls me to keep me on my toes. She'll do like a 9-2. Connor also usually a little on the lower side of Phoenix and Brock around the higher side. We're always going with a 9-8-9-9. I think we could get a 9-9 today. I'm feeling so good about this program. We are about to give you the direction of this thing. Also did the Passover Seder last night. I'm feeling focused knowing a little bit of history and belief and the path that man is on, who yearns for freedom, which is some of the stuff we often talk about here. So the theme today is that we've got to go on offense a little bit. We have to go on offense a bit more. We're always reacting, right? There's just a crazy set of people and we constantly react to them. But going on offense, as you have seen here in Florida, making that first move, it actually does give you an advantage. And it forces the left, the progressives, the globalists, the socialists. It forces them to defend themselves. And when you actually force them to defend themselves, they often cannot because their ideas are so bad. So when you expose them for who they are and what they are, they're the machine, you can actually begin to pick up more support on your side, right? Like if you actually stand up straight with your shoulders back, tell the world what you believe and why you believe it. And just don't endlessly go on that descent to hell that they're always taking us on. I actually think you can change things for the better. That is the message that we will be promoting today. Before we get to it, let me talk to you guys about my patriot supply. Guys, anyone who thinks they won't need emergency food isn't paying attention. Every day, the headlines get worse and worse.

Well, just yesterday, this beautiful thing happened. It's not often that beautiful things happen on Twitter. It's gotten significantly better, obviously, since Elon Musk has taken over, but it's usually just a cesspool than Saturday. But check this out yesterday. NPR is now labeled US state affiliated media. Now, of course, NPR does get donations from people. That is true. It also gets, they claim it's 1% of their budget from the federal government. It's a little unclear to me what that number actually is. But we know they get some money from the government and we know that NPR, anyone knows this. This is not partisan to say. NPR obviously is a partisan outlet, right? They're obviously always in lockstep with the Democrats, with the progressives, with the left. They are always going after scary Republicans and conservatives, etc., etc. So Elon Musk in his quest to democratize Twitter to make it so that corporate press does not deserve nor will get any more credit than the average independent journalist who's doing the best he can to get to something roughly approximate to truth. Elon is taken away that special status that they had as not state affiliated media when they actually are. Elon tweeted this in response to Benny Johnson, who had noticed it and tweeted it out. He wrote, seems accurate and here is the Twitter Help Center definition of state affiliated media. State affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures and or control over production and distribution according to Twitter's Help Center. So look, when I say that it's not partisan to say that NPR obviously was a wing of the Democrat party or that they're always pushing progressive messaging, it's obvious what side of the culture we're there on, it's obvious what side of the political divide they're on. We could have given you, we could have spent literally, I could have sat in this room all day long just reading NPR headlines that lean left that lie about the right. We just picked a couple here that we thought were sort of seminal ones. Let's just go through them one at a time. Here's one. Well, let's just go Russian military intelligence. The GRU is linked to the invasion of Ukraine and interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Now it's suspected of a bounty program to kill US troops in Afghanistan. That was in 2020 turned out completely untrue. But of course, what were they trying to do there? They were trying to scare you because Donald Trump had become president in 2016. Let's pick another one here all the way to the right. Some scientists, this is about a year and a half ago. No, yeah, no, this is two years ago. Now some scientists have welcomed President Biden's directive to further scrutinize the lab leak theory. I think it opens the door for other scientists to weigh in without being called conspiracy theorists. Hot digany dog turned out to be true. What else? NPR Politics, NRA, a new document acknowledges more than 20 Russian linked contributors. Yes, the NRA is controlled by the Russians. It just never ends. NPR did put out a statement after being labeled state-affiliated media. They said, we were disturbed to see last night that Twitter has labeled NPR, a state-affiliated media, a description that per Twitter's own guidelines does not apply to NPR. NPR and our member stations are supported by millions of listeners who depend on us for independent fact-based journalism we provide them, cracking up as I'm saying this. NPR stands for freedom of speech and holding the powerful accountable. It is unacceptable for Twitter to label us this way. A vigorous free press is essential to the health of our democracy. Phoenix, do a little work while we're doing this show or one of you guys over there. Scans through all of NPR's tweets, as far back as you can imagine, find me all the tweets where they were calling to open up the states and going against mandates. Find me all the tweets where they were trying to go against the narrative on the Ukraine war. Find me all the tweets where they were saying maybe Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be treated as a serial rapist. You're going to have a lot of work to do while I'm doing this. Also, beautifully. I mean, it's happening right in front of our eyes. If you let the good stuff in, it really is happening right now. Another little moment, and I know Twitter is not real life, but what happens on Twitter leaks into the real world. It's just a precursor for the reality of tomorrow. The other thing is that Elon Musk is taking away the blue checks unless you pay for it. So what happened in the last 10 or 12 years of Twitter is that if you were politically connected for the most part or you were a big Hollywood person and you had a big agency behind you, you could get that blue check. And if you got that blue check, you somehow seem more legit to people. It was really originally just to verify people. And there was a value in that, right? If you have a well-known person, they're going to be impersonated a gajillion times over. The blue check signified you are that person. But what it came to be was a status symbol. And then suddenly all of these quote-unquote journalists who worked at trash outlets like the Daily Beast and Huff Poe and Buzzfeed and the rest, they all got these blue checks. And it made it seem somehow like they were legit. And the average guy who's out on the streets with his camera trying to really figure things out that he's not legit. So Elon, as of like three days ago, has decided no more. If you want the blue check, you got to pay for it. And no one is going to get it just because they are who they are. Here's a tweet from the New York Times, which no longer has the blue check. As you can see, Twitter on Tuesday added a label to NPR's account, designating the broadcaster US state affiliated media. Other news media Twitter accounts with the label include RT of Russia, which is states, Mozart media and Genoa of China. NPR denounced the move as unacceptable. So of course, New York Times, which no longer has its blue check, it could pay. I think it's eight or 10, maybe $12 a month. But they're just not willing to do it. So all of the New York Times journalists that had the blue check that made it seem like they were journalists, they no longer have it unless they're willing to pay out of their pocket. I paid. I paid. Mine was going to go away. I got one years ago. However, I got it, right? I actually somehow met somebody that knew somebody at Twitter. That's how I got mine. I was verified. They were going to take it away. I feel that it is worth the eight or 10 dollars so that people will know if Dave Rubin tweets something is a check next to my name and it is what it is. But here, look, it's gone. It's gone. That's it. New York Times no longer has the blue check. And I certainly hope this does lead to their continued descent into oblivion that they should not be thought of as more authoritarian on any issue than anyone else. The New York Times, much like NPR, much like CNN and Washington Post and MSNBC and the rest of them, they have lied about almost everything. They have faked their credibility. We have fancy logos. We have big budgets. We get big corporations to put commercials on our content, but they lie about pretty much everything. Now, you might be going, Dave, I'm not on Twitter. I don't really care about this minutia. Why does this matter to me? Well, as I said, it's an airlock, right? What happens on Twitter? You might think it just stays there, but it does eventually leak out into the real world, much like I always say that the truth has become a time release pill. We know a certain set of people know things are true or suspect things are true, and it's only months and years later that we actually find that out. So why does it matter? I will tell you in just a second. But first, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk to you about Moethbox. Did you know? I know you know because you watched this show. 60% of US pork production comes from one company owned by the Chinese, and their hogs are given something called Raktopamine, which is banned in 160 countries, including China. Yet you find it in your grocery aisle every day. Well, there's a better way, folks. I'd like to tell you about Moeth. That's moo plus oink. Moink delivers grass fed and grass finished beef and lamb pastured pork and chicken and sustainable wild caught Alaskan salmon straight to your door. You choose the meat in every box like ribeyes, chicken breast, pork chops, salmon fillets and much more. Plus you can cancel any time. There's nothing better than cooking their meats on my big green egg on a Friday afternoon. Shark Tank host Kevin O'Leary called Moink's bacon the best bacon he's ever tasted. Plus, they guarantee you'll say, oink, oink. I'm just so happy I got Moinked. Keep American farming going by signing up at Moinkbox.com slash Ruben right now. And listeners of this show get a free filet mignon and every order for a year, that's one of the best filet mignon you'll ever taste. M-O-I-N-K box.com slash Ruben, Moinkbox.com slash Ruben and now back to me. So why does this matter? The idea that the mainstream media is not only are more and more people every day waking up to their nonsense, right? You watching this, I get it. Okay, so you're watching this. You've been read, peeled to a degree. But how many people do you know that are starting to question things, right? It is starting to happen. The hysterical leftists of five years ago, yeah, a lot of them are more hysterical. But a certain amount of them are waking up. We're seeing it happen. People are going, the media has lied about this and that. This sham Trump indictment, even not the crazy leftists. I get it therein on it. They wanted to happen no matter what. They don't care about a quality under the law or any of those things. But the certain average person who may be somewhat apolitical is kind of going, well, we did try the two impeachments on the guy in the Mar-a-Lago raid and the Russia collusion and yada, yada, yada. Maybe this is a bit much. Okay? So the fact that these people are losing momentum is absolutely good. Now I want to show you something that's been making the rounds on the Twitter. This is a video, Patrick Bette-David, who I'm doing his live podcast tonight in Fort Lauderdale this evening with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, actually. He tweeted this out, but it's been making the rounds around the internet. And check this out. This is a, I believe it's a college professor. I think it's a college professor. It might be high school teacher, but I think it's a college professor. And watch how he lays out so beautifully what propaganda over time does to you, does to the people around you, and does to society at large. Despite what you might be thinking, these two circles are not equal. I repeat, these two circles are not equal. One is in fact larger than the other. What I need you to do is determine which one that is. So please raise your hand if you believe the blue circle is larger than the red. All right. Please raise your hand if you believe the red circle is larger than the blue. All right, very good. Now before I said anything about these two circles, what was your first instinct? Equal, right? Because they look equal. And the reason why they look equal is because in fact they are equal. These two circles are identical. Yet I got just about every one of you to raise your hand and say that they're not. So what do we learn? But you can be manipulated like that to believe in something that goes against your natural instincts. Just imagine, just imagine as a child, you're taught that the blue circle is larger than the red. If you say it enough times, you convince yourself that's the truth. If you're told the lie enough times, it becomes part of your reality. And if enough people are taught that lie that the blue circle is larger than the red, well now it becomes part of the culture. And if that culture then passes that misinformation along to the next generation, well now it becomes tradition. Isn't that interesting? You take a group of people sitting in a room, hey, make a decision about this thing. They're going to get it wrong. They're just going to have their own biases. And over time, over generations, you can get a whole bunch of people to believe a whole bunch of as an old elderly man that I know says is malarkey. That's what you can do. And the mainstream media has been doing this to us for a really, really long time. It's why so many people are crazy. It's why people don't know the difference between boys and girls. It's why so many people have or had or it's recurring again now, Trump derangement syndrome because people's reality is so out of whack with what they are seeing on the media. The media has lied for so long. But now independent media is here, rumbles here. I'm here, plenty of other people are here and we're breaking through the nonsense. It's going to be a lot of work. We're just at the beginning. We're always right back at the beginning. But you can see, I just thought that was perfect. And that's why it was going viral the way it was. It was like, man, that is what's happening to us in real time. Now, let's show you some real time versions of that right now. As you know, Donald Trump was reigned in New York City, and then two nights ago, he went back to Florida. He went to Marlago and he gave a speech. And most of the networks were covering it. Here's how Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, the televised mental institution known as MSNBC. Here's how she chose to cover it. Anything newsworthy, we will turn them around and report on that right away. But for now, just know that it's happening and we're not taking it. They have it and then they give it even more people because they didn't recognize they were right. Instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person, potentially mutating and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way. Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person. A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus. The virus does not infect them. The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else. It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people. That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this. Okay, so everything she said right there was untrue. Now you might be going, but Dave, she didn't knowingly lie about that stuff. Except the problem is she knowingly swallowed the propaganda that Pfizer and Moderna and the NIH and the CDC and Fauci and everybody else were putting out there. That's not the job of a journalist. That's the job of a public relations executive. And that's what she acts as while she is on. Once again, the televised mental institution known as MSNBC. Glenn Greenwald, who's an actual journalist and independent journalist who I actually have some political disagreements with. He watched that clip of Maddow talking about Trump and he tweeted this out. I thought this was just perfect. He wrote, the person talking about Maddow, who won a 30 million dollar a year Comcast contract by telling liberals Biden laptop was rushing disinformation. Lab leak was debunked. Trump had secret server with Alpha Bank. Russia put bonus bounties on US soldiers. Says she's too worried about the lies to show Trump's speech. So you get it, guys. You get it. You see why I showed you that viral video of the two circles and how over time people swallow the lies more and more. And then when they are confronted with truth, they have to make a choice. Will I go down the scary red-pilled road where I will see the world as it is not as I wish it to be? And it's going to be scary and I may have to acknowledge that I actually got a whole bunch of stuff wrong. And I said awful things about other people and I really screwed up a whole bunch of stuff. Or will I just continue that blue-pilled slumber? I would argue if you're watching the televised mental institution known as MSNBC, unironically, you've made your choice. But we thought there's got to be a compilation of the media lying about everything and it's got to, well, there's many of them. Can we find one? And then we were like, yeah, we can't here. We are watching Republicans not just destroying democracy in the dark, breaking into election officers and plugging stuff in. We're watching them do it from rally stages, debate stages. We could lose our democracy and it could happen in 17 days. A majority of Americans believe that democracy is under threat. Democracy on the ballot is not just a slogan. A lot of Republicans in the last three weeks have suddenly found themselves deciding, hey, party over country. I'm wondering whether this puts America into the fast lane towards a liberal democracy. I'm not going to say that the GOP are Nazis at this point or whatever, but it certainly sounds very familiar. We will wake up the morning after election day. We might not even call with that anymore in two years. The future is not Republican Party, so they have to cheat. Do you think it's time to ask for friends and allies to come over and help us monitor our elections? Do you think it requires a democracy commission? The Republicans have an explicit incentive to make the economy work. They will cut social security. They're going to cut lunches for children. If Republicans win control of one or both House of Congress, they will do everything in their power to sabotage the economy. They are not going to help you, so why would you vote for them? That, that lied at the end. That's the best one. Like there's so much laughably ridiculous stuff there. They're not going to help you, so why would you vote for them? That gets to the mentality of these people. They think the government is supposed to help you. The government is not supposed to help you. Ronald Reagan, the nine scariest words in the English language are, I'm here from the government and I'm here to help. I'm from the government and I'm here to help. Those are those scariest words because the government screws up absolutely everything. But these people, it's not just that they lie, that these are propagandists who lie about everything. It's that they, it would be one thing if they just lied about like what the little policy differences are, but they are lying to keep people in an endless state of hysteria. Do I make mistakes on this show, on this show for sure? Do I have my own biases for sure? Do I hide that? No. But do you think when you're tuning into this, or do you, when this show ends, like I hope you laugh a little bit, you got a little bit entertained, you learned a little something, something like that, but I don't send you off into the world completely bamboozled by the truth. Like I whack you in the head, you got cartoon stars flying around your head, and then you're just angry at everybody. What we try to do is expose and debunk the nonsense here. What they are doing is trying to keep a certain amount of people so afraid of their own shadow that they will vote their own rights away. And this is a major, major problem because although they are losing steam, an NPR is now labeled state affiliated media and the New York Times doesn't have their blue check and the ratings for all of those things are failing. And as I said, we had our biggest concurrent live stream yesterday ever beat basically every CNN and MSNBC show. I'm sure it beat all of them actually. We probably didn't beat Tucker last night. I'll take Tucker. That'll be pretty good. And several other Fox shows that are crushing it. But the point is they are lying and keeping everyone in a perpetual state of insanity. And then you wonder why the culture is the way it is. And it has something to do with the people that are supposed to be the tastemakers of culture. So their negligence and their malice is exactly what has led this country to the state that it is in today when we'd be having this banana republic nonsense like hauling in a former president to a New York City courtroom on charges that are from years ago and everyone knows wouldn't be happening if he wasn't running for president again. Do we have any video about the mainstream media lying about Trump? We were able to come up with some. How do we do that? That's incredible. We are working our butts off over here. Does the public understand just how much trouble the president is in? To believe that the president isn't compromised requires such a leap of faith. I think we have all the proof we need of a scandal that's arguably worse than Watergate. The US president possibly working for the Russians. Possibly an unwitting pawn. But here's what the president said when asked if he was a secret Russian agent. The president did not directly answer the question. Why not just say no if that's the answer? There is tons of proof of potential collusion. We have dramatic evidence of collusion. How is it not collusion? How is all of that not collusion? A political hurricane is out there at C's for him. We'll call it hurricane Vladimir if you will. Donald Trump knows the news is tightening. The news is tightening. The news is tightening if you will. The news is tightening around the president. The news is tightening and I think they're shocked that the news is tightening and that people might go to jail. He knows he and POTUS are going to prison. Well I think they're all going to end up together in prison and maybe that's a good thing. Oh my god. The walls appear to be closing in on the president. You know Connor said to me in the middle of that like totally straight-faced. I miss Stelter. I think we all kind of miss Stelter in a way. Who would have thunk? We all miss Brian Stelter who now because irony is dead is a teacher of journalism at Harvard University. The best line on that man I mean there's so much and he got to remember they every the noose should have had a noose in here. I could use a noose for some of these shows. Like the best line on that though is Chris Cuomo and he says there are there is tons of proof of potential collusion. It's like the language itself these people are insane so they led us to this. They they created a situation where a bunch of hysterical lunatics some who then got voted into Congress and the Senate as Democrats and then became DAs in places like New York thought that they were stopping Orange Hitler so you would drag us all to your banana republic nonsense to do anything you could to stop him. The coverage of Trump over the years and it was a it was a double edged sword right they hated Trump but they needed him right because the second Trump went out of office for these last years their ratings tanked. Now their ratings are going up again. The media is on the same side as Trump. You got it. You really need to understand that. People say Trump's the one fighting the machine but he is now firm. He is fighting the political machine to an extent obviously right. I accept that he is fighting the deep state. Sure but he is also now part of the media machine and he even was before he was president. He was the number one host on television for a reality television show the Apprentice and the celebrity apprentice. That was the number one reality show out there but now he there's there is a match made in heaven right there is a Faustian bargain between the media and Trump. They need each other and that is why they will keep scaring the hell out of you over Trump and I think there's another reason which is what Joy Behar said the other day which we showed you which is that Trump can't win. He can't bring in new voters so they want Trump to be the Republican nominee. But the coverage over the last couple years has led our country to this moment this moment where we recklessly dangerously arrest former president. So here's the image again. This is Trump at the courthouse on Tuesday. This was right as the officer before him didn't hold the door open just let the door slam on him which you know that was planned. Now we're going to show you something from the view can we pull up the warning there. There we go. And for a second you're going to freak out when you see this clip because for just a second Alyssa Farrah who is the quote unquote conservative on the show but she's a pet conservative they give her they tap her on the head and give her a cookie at the end and you know they'll all throw her under the bus once she gets fired and I do hope it's worth the 200 grand a year for three years or whatever she's getting on it to sell your soul. You know you probably should negotiate it more when you're selling your soul you get better, better agent but anyway she's going to make sense for a second. Alyssa Farrah is going to kind of make sense for a second and then Sonny Hostin talks so you'll figure out the rest. Quick though two things can be true at once yesterday was a bad day for Donald Trump the first indicted former president. I want to see this guy held accountable. This case is not taking Donald Trump down and I say that for a couple reasons. How do you know that? There was well just real quick there was no conspiracy charge which a lot of folks were looking to see if there was. That was the hardest charge to prove. The felony charges they the max sentence is four years but this is the first time offender it's a non violent crime it's a classy felony. Every legal expert I've talked to has said most likely a fine and probation if he's even. I'll tell you why you're wrong is this legal expert. That is because that is wrong and I will tell you why you're wrong. Prosecutors are not only in the business of prosecuting crimes we're in the business of sending out a message. If you let the president of the United States be found guilty of one to 34 counts even if they're misdemeanors and he gets to go home scott free you're sending a message. Not scott free we're just saying it's going to be a fine and probation. It won't be serving. To the country. Well not yet but okay. That's not going to happen. All right first off just Sonny Hostin's general tone and that's what I'm saying. Alyssa you think they like you now and you know they don't really like you like they're just using you but the way that Sonny Hostin talks down to people like literally with her nose up down to people she's so soundly unpleasant but okay let that be. What's interesting is she's saying that you should prosecute to send a message. Now that's interesting because now I would say and I think most people who believe in equality under the law believe that you should be prosecuting based on the laws that are on the books so if you I don't know let's say murder somebody everyone who murders somebody should be treated equally under the law and you should have to prove that they did it they have a chance to prove that they are not guilty and that's how it should work but you should prosecute to send a message. It took us literally 0.002 seconds to find this from the New Yorker. On Alvin Bragg's third day as Manhattan District Attorney in January 2021 he stated that his office would no longer prosecute low-level offenses such as subway fare evasion resistance to arrest or prostitution unless they were part of an accompanying felony charge. So if you are sending a message if that's what prosecution is about then this guy has said to New Yorkers jump the turnstiles. Be prostitutes. Resist arrest. I mean the idea that resisting arrest would be something that wouldn't get you in trouble is absolutely insane. So well I guess if you're a prostitute and they were about to arrest you and now you can not only not get arrested for prostitution but you can also basically smack the cop in the face. So what was the message that Alvin Bragg has been sending to New Yorkers? It was break the law. It was break the law. So what is the one thing about the mainstream media that these the corporate press that these people never do? What they never do is pursue the truth. They never go after the people who deserve to be looked at right? Who really are the ones who are riling up people and making everybody angry and lying about everything and all of that stuff. For example the squad right? You've got your AOCs and your Ilhan Omar's and your Rashida Tlaibs. A group of people who are here to destroy America. They are socialists. They do not like our system. They do not like our founding. They are they are clearly here to ferment to foment anti-American sentiment. Check out this tweet by Rashida Tlaib. This was two days ago. I wanted to cover yesterday. We couldn't get to it. Every day 120 Americans are killed by gun violence. There have been 18 school shootings so far this year. Every single day that Republicans prioritize bigotry in banning books and drag shows more Americans will die. I mean she is just man she could get my Sonny Hostin award for being the worst person on the show today. That should be the official award. We'll have a little clay Sonny Hostin and we'll mail it to these people. She's conflating issues right? The drag queen story hour and these ridiculous pornography books that are in schools have nothing to do with school shootings. Also taking away guns from people who are abiding by the law is not going to stop the bad people. We played the video of it last week. When I sat down with Ted Cruz in DC he tried to get an armed guard at every school entrance in the United States. Every single Democrat voted against it. Dan Crenshaw had a very similar policy that he was trying to get forth. But they're focused on these books. This seems to be a reoccurring thing with these people that the Republicans are banning books and that especially Florida were banning books. Connor can we put up the image of gender queer? Now this is gender queer. This is the book that everyone's talking about. So just to be very, very clear here in Florida they are not banning books. What they are doing right now is that the local school districts are doing reviews of books just to see what's on the shelves and each school district can make their choice as to what they are going to have in there. Which of course makes sense. Parents and educators can come together and discuss what is age appropriate for students. Now this is the only book. This gender queer book is the only book that has been banned so far. Now what's fascinating about this book is we blurred out some images because we're a family show here. But we did see the images before we blurred them out. And I really want to get this correct. So I've got everybody on the team. I need you all focused right now. What we are blurring out there is that there is a girl. We believe it is a girl who does not have a penis because generally speaking girls do not have penises. Who's using a dildo and then has her what we think is asexual friend performing oral sex on the dildo so she can pretend she's a boy. That's what we are blurring out for you. That is what Rashida Taleb and Gavin Newsom and the lunatics at the view and all of these people think should be in public schools for kids to learn about. Am I just old fashioned? How about good night moon? Like what? Put it up one more time. We blur it out. Did I get that right? So just one more time guys. It's a chick using a dildo to have what we think is her male or at least the male was identifying as using weird pronouns to perform more. Sorry, forget it. Forget it. You got the point. Here's a drag queen in Canada. Go. We will not let fear win. A world without trans people has never existed. A world without drag has never existed and it never will. Creed people have always been here amongst us. There are co-workers. There are brothers. Our sisters. There are mothers. Our fathers. There are families. Drag is art. Drag is culture. Drag is educational. Drag is creative. Drag is comedy. But drag is not a crime. My name is Scarlett Bobo and thank you so much for your time. You live in Canada. Get out. Get out. A few of you can come here to Florida, but we're closing this thing down pretty soon. Trust me. I've got the governor's ear. We're putting up a wall. Gators. The whole freaking thing. Do you see what they do with everything though? So that was at that ridiculous press conference yesterday where the two spirited woman was trying of, yeah, okay, fine, you got it. But what she's saying is that the world has never existed without queer people or trans people. Okay, nobody's saying that. What we're saying is this shit should not be in front of kids. Would that just be okay with you guys? Wear your crazy wig. Put on your god forsaken makeup. Whatever you want to do with your life, fine. But why must you dance in front of ch- why must you dance in front of ch- I'm choking as I'm saying it. Why would you dance? Why must you dance in front of children for money? Why must you do that? Again, why do you not go to the annual actuary conference? Why do they only do it at late night clubs where adults are getting drunk and trying to hook up with each other? And then they do it for children. There seems to be nothing in between on that, right? Why is that? Can someone explain that to me? Anyway, when you realize that this stuff has leaked up all the way, because what happens is you get these radical activists with these crazy ideas and they're a tiny minority and everyone knows it's nonsense, but nobody wants to be the guy being like, you people stop doing that. Nobody wants to be that guy waving the finger. We need more of those people. Some people have tried it. A whole bunch of us have tried it, I would say, but no, I get it. The average person doesn't want to be that person. Like you want to be accepting and tolerant and nice and different cities are strength and all that stuff. But what happens is these radical activists push all of this insane nonsense. So literally at public schools, they've got a book where a girl is having oral sex performed on a dildo and that's thought of as tolerable for children. And then, and then you have the mainstream media, which runs cover for it because they never acknowledge what's in the content of the books that are being banned. They just say Republicans are mean and banning books. And you might go, well, all right, well, it's just books. Who cares? All right. But it's also now that they are pushing sex change surgeries, not gender affirming care. Don't use their language. It is not affirming to lop off somebody's wine. All right, it's not. I was going to say Google it, but don't Google that. Here is Corinne Jean Pierre, our White House press secretary saying that minor sex change surgeries are between a parent and a child and government should stay out. Now it's ironic that they've suddenly become libertarian on this. We'll get some more on that in a second. Yeah. And then today, Indiana just banned puberty blockers, hormone therapies and gender transition surgeries for minors. I'm wondering what the president's reaction is to the Indiana governor signing that bill into law. And does the president have a position on at what age these kinds of therapies and surgeries are appropriate? That's something for a child and their parents to decide. It's not something we believe should be decided by legislators. So I'll leave it there. It is absolutely incredible. The hypocrisy with these people, I know hypocrisy is dead, but their hypocrisy is incredible. The same people who will be upset if a parent comes to a school board meeting, saying, I don't want drag queens dancing in front of my children. They're the same ones that say it's up to a parent and a child to decide if they should have their nuts chopped off. You see the irony of this, right? Like if a parent objects to a book or objects to a drag queen, then the parent is completely out of control and they're a far right maniac. If as long as the parent is for the genitals being chopped off, then it should be between a parent and a child. These people want the government to be involved in absolutely everything. Suddenly, when some red states are saying, you know, maybe government does have a little bit of a role to have something to do with a functioning state, maybe we should be protecting children. It's something like that. And now they're upset about that. But suddenly, they're all libertarians. They're all libertarians. Absolutely incredible. By the way, cringe, John Pierre cringe. That's all right, cringe. I wish you were a libertarian. I wish you would get the hell out of my life. I wish Joe Biden had nothing to do with my life or any of you people. You're right. Stay out of our lives. Most things should be done between a parent and a child. How about you give us our tax money back that you steal for your crazy wars and everything else? How about you just stay out of our lives altogether and we'll make decisions for ourselves. But you guys are pushing this stuff on us constantly. And it's not just that they're pushing all of the gender stuff and the race stuff and that they lied about COVID and everything else. It's that there is also an unbelievable amount of crime happening in blue cities right now. You know it. We cover it all the time. By the way, in Chicago, you know, remember a couple of weeks ago, they voted out that lunatic beetle juice over there, Lori Lightfoot. Well, it turns out that they have since voted in probably even more of a far left progressive. So Chicago is just going to keep getting worse. But the worst of the worst, as you guys know, is San Francisco. San Francisco has completely collapsed. It is not a coincidence that San Francisco was once run by at the time Mayor Gavin Newsom, now governor of California, Gavin Newsom. There was a horrific murder on the streets of California of San Francisco about two days ago. No, I think it was this weekend. So it was about three days ago. Cash App founder, Bob Lee, I think is 43 years old, was stabbed to death in San Francisco. Here's CBS covering what happened. Tonight, friends and family are confirming what many fear the 43 year old man San Francisco police found stabbed here on Main Street early Tuesday morning is well-known tech executive Bob Lee. The father of two was chief product officer at cryptocurrency startup Mobile Coin. Before that, he worked with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at Square. Dorsey today called his death heartbreaking. Lee would later create the mobile payment service Cash App. Burn Twitter CEO Elon Musk responded to news of the killing by taking a swipe at the city. Violent crime in SF he said is horrific. Okay, it's an unbelievable murder. Look, the guy 43 years old, what's interesting about this is that while Jack Dorsey from Twitter comments about it, but Jack Dorsey was one of the main people at Twitter there who was pumping money into the things and defending all of the horrific ideas that have destroyed what once was a great city. San Francisco and I went to it for the first time about 15 years ago was was absolutely beautiful, gorgeous, thriving, flourishing. And now it is just everything the reverse of that. Elon Musk's comments are completely right. The amount of security he has to have at the Twitter offices, which is in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. And what's interesting about this story particularly is that this this poor guy, he had fled San Francisco. Yeah, he used to live in San Francisco. You know where he lived now? Miami. He had moved to Florida to enjoy some freedom. He was back there doing some business and he got murdered on the streets. And I have to tell you when I was there, you know, when I was there meeting Elon a couple, what was that, two months ago or so, it is the first time in my life in an American city that I was ever afraid for for my own safety. We have the video, we have the video. Remember this video that I took? This is literally right outside the Twitter offices. So you must understand, you have the world's richest man upstairs. And here is video of me walking around. This is one block away from Twitter offices. And this was sprawling across the entire city. Drugs mayhem zombies enjoy. Why aren't the ladies of the view who are so compassionate and care about people? Remember Joy Behar? The Republicans don't care about you. Well, the implication is that we Democrats do. So why is it that Democrat cities look like that? If you can find Republican led cities that look like that, please send me the video and I will show it and I will go after the Republican mayor in those cities that's doing it. But it's Denver that looks like that. That was a real shocker for me when I went on tour in Denver. It is Los Angeles. It is San Francisco. It is Portland and Seattle. Okay, blah, blah, blah. It is Austin. You got it. You got it. Democrats do not care about other people. Democrats care about power. That's what these media people care about. That's what the politicians care about. And that's why people are fleeing blue cities and fleeing blue states and coming to places where there is law and order and where there are flourishing economies because we don't put policies in place that destroy economies, which ultimately destroy families, destroy communities, destroy schools, etc. You might be thinking now, Dave, wait a minute, you said this show is a 9.9, but I'm feeling a little depressed. It's a little depressing hearing mainstream media lies. It's a little depressing hearing about this murder. It's a little depressing watching the general mayhem of the blue cities. Well, I got a good one for you because we're going to bring it home on a positive note. This is fantastic. This is just yesterday. Democrat Congresswoman named Tricia Cotherm from North Carolina. She's no longer a Democrat. She's moving over to the GOP. Modern day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me and to so many others throughout this state and this country. The party wants to villainize anyone who has free thought, free judgment, has solutions, who wants to get to work to better our state, not just sit in a meeting and have a workshop after a workshop, but really work with individuals to get things done because that's what real public servants do. If you don't do exactly what the Democrats want you to do, they will try to bully you. They will try to cast you aside. I got to tell you guys, watching that is so affirming for me personally because what she says there about free thought and what they will do to you and when you step away and all that stuff, literally, you've all seen it. I'm sure my why I left the left video I did on PragerU seven years ago, that's what I was saying. Now that is that time release pill, truth is time released. People, more and more people are realizing it. What's interesting about this also, Phoenix just told me that her switching from Democrat to GOP now gives the Republicans a super majority in North Carolina. So watch, watch what happens now in North Carolina. I bet you it will become more stable. It will become safer. They will protect kids. They will not allow for this woke nonsense and everything else. So this is a really, really nice moment. But guys, the media's lies, their malice, their negligence. It presents us with an opportunity to pick up those disaffected liberals, the people that have been bamboozled and everything else. And we just need more and more people to see it. So I want to end with this tweet from Elon Musk. This is in July of 2022. He said, the media is a click seeking machine dressed up as a truth seeking machine. Yes, yes it is. We must keep going. We will get to that promised land. There's a little, a little Passover messaging for you, right? You got to leave the oppression, leave the oppression of Egypt. You may have to wander in the desert for 40 years. We might be, maybe we're in year 36 of 40 right now. We've been wandering, confused, looking for a leader, trying to figure out what, what does the promised land look like? Well, you know what? You also have to map what the promised land will be, right? The heroes didn't just show up to the promised land and magically create an incredible society. You have to really be thinking, what would our society look like? Art of blueprint. We have everything we need. And now we got to start putting it together. And I really, really do believe that we can. Ladies and gentlemen, my full interview with Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin is up right now across platforms.
