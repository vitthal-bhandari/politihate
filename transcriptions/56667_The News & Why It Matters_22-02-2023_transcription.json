    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Donald Trump visits Ohio. Joe Biden decides maybe Donald Trump's border policy was a good thing after all, and another person close to the Clinton's ends up dead. We've got all of that and more coming up, but it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Earlier today, President Donald Trump taught the Biden administration a lesson in what leadership looks like when he traveled to East Palestine, Ohio to deliver pallets of water and supplies for the town that is still left with more questions than answers about how bad the devastation to their land, to their homes, to their water, to their actual physical bodies, how bad that devastation really is. And still, Trump managed to make the trip before any senior Biden administration official could be bothered to visit Ohio on the ground and give their support. Lend a hand, be a leader, show your citizens you care about them. That's kind of what the whole thing is supposed to be about. Well, don't worry. Joe Biden finally made time after his World War three speech yesterday to pick up the phone and call Ohio Governor Mike DeWine from Poland because, you know, priorities. But the most noticeably absent transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg had quite a contentious moment with a reporter asking him when he'd finally make time for the citizens of Ohio. Watch. Secretary, what do you have to say? Hi, how are you? Jenny here at the Daily Caller News Foundation. What do you have to say to the folks in Ohio East Palestine who are suffering right now? Well, I'd refer you to about a dozen interviews I've given today. And if you'd like to arrange a conversation, I'm sure you're going to have to repress on. I've had that conversation with you. Just walk through here. You don't have a message for them? I do, and I shared it with the press many times today. I'd refer you to those comments. Do you mind sharing it with us? No, I'm going to refer you to the comments that I made to the press because right now I'm taking some personal time and I'm walking out of the street. Are you going down there? What's up? Are you going down there at all? Yep, man. When are you going? I'll share that when I'm ready. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Can I get a photo of me? Yeah. I'm taking personal time. Yeah, we know Mayor Pete, seems your entire tenure has been personal time. First, it was paternity leave during the cargo shipping crisis, but I know, birthing that baby and all had to be really tough on your body and you needed to recover. Or how about the airline flight chaos that your office was warned about four months before Southwest Airlines stranded tens of thousands of passengers over the holidays? Let's not forget the rail workers union impending strike that your agency had to negotiate up until the 11th hour. Where were you during those negotiations? Oh, that's right. Vacationing in Portugal. Look, maybe I'm being too hard on the guy after all. I'm sure being the transportation secretary keeps one very busy. So busy that he's flown in private jets 18 times during his tenure, private jets that you have paid for. In fact, the organization Americans for Public Trust requested through FOIA a copy of his detailed schedule. And I will say his schedule throughout his tenure does seem very stacked. For instance, you've got to make time to prep for Jimmy Kimmel. Those late night comedians are so hard on the administration. You can never be too careful. Or how about this two hour equity training that I'm sure was very vital to his job? Although I guess he didn't quite grasp the equity thing because he did have to attend another transportation equity roundtable. Sounds and brawling. And you know, after all that talk about equity, one does need to make plenty of time to get some exercise. So he did manage to carve out back to back walks. Your taxpayer dollars, ladies and gentlemen, are you pissed off yet? You should be. Now I would be remiss if I didn't point out perhaps the most egregious part of Mayor Pete's contentious interaction. Did you catch it at the end? He asked to take her picture, a reporter who had already identified herself. Why? As an intimidation tactic because she was asking tough questions to identify her so he could punish her later, does the Biden regime have a problem with a free press? Will she be added to a list later? After the exchange, Pete announced he will be visiting Ohio tomorrow. So I guess now magically within 12 hours of having no date set, that time is finally right. Here to help me break this down are Eric July, Blaise TV contributor and founder and owner of Ripiverse Comics and Jason Butchel, Chief Researcher for the Glenn Beck program. It just blows my mind how arrogant these people are that they think that they shouldn't have to answer these same people, by the way, who encourage people to address Ted Cruz in the middle of dinner with his wife, to get up in people's faces, make them feel uncomfortable. You have a reporter asking a question and instead, Pete Buttigieg says, no, no, I'll refer you to my press secretary's office even though I'm standing right in front of you. Oh, and by the way, let me take your picture. Look, this is like such an obvious example of why the federal government is a clown show. It really has always been. But more importantly, you have these kind of positions that are fake. They don't really do anything. However, they, of course, get paid for it. Oftentimes they will vote for themselves for raises. These people aren't even elected a lot of times into their positions. Even if they did, it doesn't make it any better. But you get what it is that I'm saying. These are just people that are kind of propped up to be kind of figureheads and they don't really do anything because if they did do anything, you think something that kind of has a lot to do with his position, at least in name, he would be one of the first guys to go and address that position. Now, I talked about this. We talked about this last week, me and Matthew Marson, I kind of went on this tangent about the whole dependency on the federal government to get help when it comes to situations like this, I think, is a fundamental core issue. But for the first time in a long time, maybe since we're on Paul, we've had a congressperson actually pay at least lip service to the idea that maybe this whole structure of what we have with the federal government and its expectation is a failed kind of project. And maybe we need to look into some sort of decentralization effort. And she comes out, talks about national divorce. That term just makes even a lot of people that are on, let's say, outside of the aisle, they lower, wait a minute, I don't know about that. Marjorie Taylor-Gree. Yes, that's what I'm referring to. And I'm glad somebody's finally getting to discuss this because I think this is a serious thing that we need to be addressing because this is just another example of it. But you're going to see these definitely in the age of connectivity. In the age of social media, you're going to continue to see these so bizarre, even egregious examples of people that are in positions that you pay for. Like remember, we're in Texas, so we might get paid property taxes and all this other stuff. But when it comes to our income, that's all going to the federal government. And you're paying, essentially, for people that do nothing and they won't come to your aid any event that, let's say, you are in some sort of distress. I want to have the conversation and have an honest one with each other, because I do think it's a lot easier nowadays for us to at least start the conversation, less fear-mongering, but there's still going to be a lot of people to do it. But for a guy like Pete, he shouldn't even have a job. But for every one of him, you can probably, there's a lot of maybe like 25 of those guys that are in the shadows that you've never heard of that are getting their pockets lined up, that are in positions that are often fake, and you all are getting ripped off because of it. Well, and here's the frustrating part too, is that I don't disagree with you that the answer is decentralization. However, in the meantime, my tax money is going to pay for this stuff. So I do have a level of expectation that like, yeah, you should be down on the ground. You should be sending FEMA, right? Like what the hell am I paying my tax dollars for? No, I'd much rather have the situation where I'm not giving you, you're not stealing my income, right? You're my hard-earned money that I worked for that the government isn't stealing it from me, but they are right now, right? So as the situation currently stands, come do something. You're already stealing from me to do what? Go to diversity training, go to equity training, not actually respond whenever there is a crisis. That's my thing is that it's just like, I don't like it, I don't like the system, but it's the same thing that I have with public schools. It's like, I mean, my money is going there, so like get your kids out of public schools, but also like, we're still paying for it, so we need to do something about that. I love the conversation. It's been in perfectly with the Marjorie Taylor Agree National Divorce thing. A lot of us have been saying that for a while. It didn't really get the news coverage, is it now? They're like, you're talking civil war, you know? So to me, national divorce and that concept is basically deeper federalism, right? So we don't have to, like you said, we don't have to have a department of education, we don't have to have a department of transportation. The states can handle all these things. Now, if you want to live in a progressive hellhole, it's a lot more lockdown, a lot more regulated, and it has a lot closer, you know, relationship with the federal government, go live in California, go live in New York state, go live in Oregon, places like that. You're free to do that. This is America, at least it used to be. But we'll live in other places that will decouple. We have our own economy going. We don't need to leach off that. What would that do? That would open up lowering taxes. The government could actually maintain a budget, crazy concepts. But that's not the way we're thinking right now. We're thinking about becoming more and more under the wing of this over smothering government and giving them more and more money. They're become less frugal with the money that we give them. It's a downward spiral. Well, they're not, I mean, you would call Joe Biden frugal? Look at how much money he's given to Vladimir Zelensky. He's not frugal at all. We have very deep pockets, Jason. I'm not sure if you're aware. Well, I mean, we just print it. So, you know, whatever. You just print more. Doesn't matter. I love the fact how uncomfortable Buttigieg was on that. They're not used to being pushed back on. And that's, I mean, I'm sure he heard daily color and he probably almost like, you know, did something in his pants. He was like, oh, crap. Oh my gosh. They picked up the pace. They are not used to being pushed back on. I love the fact that he did. He's the perfect example of a diversity hire. He's a diversity hire. Like, he's not for that job. He knows nothing about it. There's nothing historically that he had did that would have put him in position. There'll be like any sort of expertise on like transportation or anything. And he's not showing up to these. He didn't show up for the, you know, the supply chain crisis. He didn't, he didn't show up for this, all these other things because I'm fairly certain he was told, look, bro, you don't have to. Yeah, that's probably what it was. We think that you might be a potential candidate to run for president in the future. We want to keep you relevant. I know. Right. And what was his big downside? Like, he did not appeal to the Black community at all. In fact, they had what's his name? Not, was it not Jesse Jackson. It was what's the other guy? How sharp. Sharpton. Sharpton. Remember that photo op they had was Sharpton where they were in a cafe and he in Sharpton was like, okay, tell me, tell me a little about yourself. They were begging for the cameras to make it look like he was reaching out. You know, this guy is completely clueless. He is completely clueless. He's got, he still has the same problems, right? He doesn't appeal to a large amount of people. And now we're stuck with, you know, the Biden's policy, policies of let's not concentrate on the actual problems. Let's just make up all these problems, like race is the biggest problem in the country right now. Ball wall is stupid crap that divides everyone. But meanwhile, we'll have Buddha judge instead of actually looking into some issues that would make sense in his position. They're going to talk about how racist the freeways are in certain states. Yeah. That's, I mean, that day was at the same day that this happened. He was talking about how there were too many white dudes and construction jobs. I, if it wasn't the same day, I think it was like the day after. Yeah, it was, it was bad. Not what we want to hear from you, bro. Right. Yeah. Well, I want to, I want to show a little bit of the response that President Trump received whenever he went over to Ohio. It just was, it was, it was encouraging to see because here he is with JD Vance and you can hear the people shouting Trump. They were quite receptive to his visit over in Ohio. And word on the street. There were a lot to have a, a lot of, I'll say let's go Brandon science. So I don't know if you caught that. That was actually a front of the program. Savannah Hernandez asking Donald Trump, what would you, what is your message to Joe Biden? And Trump looked at her and said, get over here. So, you know, for as much as, as Pete Buttigieg wants to call this a photo op, which is of course what he said about Donald Trump going there. It's like, I mean, I don't know. I feel like when you're running for president and you want to show people what true leadership looks like, what the hell else do you do other than go do something and help? Yeah, that seems to be apparently obvious. And I hate that this is what it's all come down to, man. It's like, you know, helping people is not really in the interest unless it's, let's say in the interest of themselves. That's the only time where there were eight other people, especially if it's people that are, let's say that they consider them their ideological enemies. Because any event, we saw this with the whole Texas free situation. Because any event that it is a state that they consider their ideological enemy, they're pointing left at the fact that, you know, some people weren't without powerful, you know, a couple of days. And it's more like a candidate being in this sort of abusive relationship where they say, well, this is why you need the federal government because of y'all have your own power grid and it failed for a couple of days, even though that happens in California every single year. But that's how they, that's the game it is they play because they don't actually care about you unless they can, let's say, use you and be, if you are, let's say, useful to them in whatever narrative it is that they're trying to portray to the American people. And that's what I hate so much about about politics is all for the most part is about optics. It's never about aiding folks. And I'm okay with that. I just don't like the fact that there's people that get money, get laced up by way of the taxpayers to go out there and campaign and do not necessarily on the campaign trail, but which that's probably more money is wasted in America on count. I don't know if people actually know how much definitely in presidential campaigns, how much money it's in an insane amount of money. You just think how much of that money could be used to just help your geographical area. And that's what I really want to start having the discussion in this country. As we see more examples of federal government abuse, let's start talking about getting them out of the way of these situations. That's a big problem for Democrats, especially these optics because those are the areas that Trump appeals to. And not just Trump, the GOP in general, that used to be the areas that the Democrats had a string hold on back in the Clinton days. He was the guy for them and they saw it that way. And that's changing. And that's also another thing that's bad for the optics there is that this whole thing shows that why didn't the Democrats rush over there and help? Why didn't they? This is one of their biggest issues, the environment. When the Nord Stream 2 pipeline broke down or got blown up, I remember there was mainstream articles all over the place not talking about, hey, I wonder how this happened? What did this do? How are they going to react? It was this amount of dangerous gases are going up into our atmosphere. What is this going to do for climate change? Nothing about that for this. Why? Because it's red areas. It's red areas. It's a small town. They don't give a crap about you. Maybe they did it a long time ago. They do not know. They don't now. Can you imagine if this happened? They'll say in between on the I-5 in between San Diego and Los Angeles. What would they be doing? FEMA would have been there immediately. The president would be there and we'll be freaking out. Which by the way is very short-sighted and stupid because the water flows. It's not just stagnant. It's flowing into other places. It's not going to just stay in that one area. But I'm sure we'll be seeing ads 10 to 20 years from now on the television. If you were a loved one, we're affected by the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. You could be awarded money. We got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more first. We want to thank our sponsor Birch Gold. I don't know if you realize this. The United States already blew through the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in January. Good news on the horizon. They still refuse to reduce spending. They got their heads in the sand. But it is time for you to really, really think about diversifying into gold with Birch Gold. In times of high uncertainty and instability, gold has historically been king. It is very, very dependable and Birch Gold is going to make it really easy to convert an IRA or 401k into an IRA with precious metals. Just text the word why to 9898. They're going to send you a free information kit on gold. You can talk to one of their precious metals specialists if this appeals to you, which it should. I'm not a financial advisor. I'm not trying to give you financial advice, but what I'm telling you is my family has diversified heavily into gold and silver right now because you don't want your retirement account just sitting there wasting away. Just look at it. Would you do yourself a favor and just text the word why to 9898 for that free information kit. That is the word why to 9898. If the Biden administration proposed a new restriction on asylum seekers that just saying it looks very similar to a Trump-era policy, it would prevent migrants who do not already use available legal pathways to asylum and do not also seek asylum in a third country from applying for asylum in the United States. The Biden administration is like, well, it's just in response to the proposal to end Title 42. But I'm just saying for the record looks very, very similar to the restrictions that Trump had in place when he was called xenophobic and racist and all of these other things because he understood the importance of a sovereign nation and actual borders. And I guess the DOJ and the DHS finally agree with him because they expressed optimism that the new restriction would lead to a reduction in migrants crossing the southern border and thereby reducing the power of human smuggling networks and helping decrease the number of migrants in already overcrowded border facilities. Wow, wait, you mean encouraging illegal immigrants to come and to abuse our current processes? So not encouraging them to come do this would lead to a reduction in people coming. It would lead to a reduction in human smugglers? Who know? Yeah, it's like with, look, I've made this point before on the show actually for years. I mean, about, you know, Democrats are really these like pro-immigration types and not even pro-immigration more so in the sense of just letting anybody over here, regardless until it makes them start to look bad or that public opinion starts to sway. Let's say on the subject and it has over the years, you know, I talk about with Obama, even if you consider the the language change of the deportations, even if you take that away, he still had deported more more immigrants than any president before him. This is why, you know, call the reporter in chief. It wasn't as a joke. That was what he, what he was. So they pay lip service to this idea because they think, well, we can get this demographic, demographic to support them. And often when they do get an office, quietly often they'll kind of start doing their own things where they be getting people out of here, where they be changing sort of policies. And man, you know, I just don't understand how people that let's say would let's say support something like that. Don't see through that that dude, they're just paying lip service to this idea. They aren't as pro immigration as they like to lead you to think. That's never been what it is that they certainly are. But a lot of people, particularly young people are convinced that they that they are and are convinced, of course, that this thing is a net game. And often these are, you know, talking about like Upper East Coast, like, right, leftists who don't live like in Texas, I never live in South Texas, like, I have. So they haven't seen the ugly part, let's say of that in the ramifications that it is. But I do like something like this is I think a way to solve the issue without having to use the the aggression, which I think a lot of people are they tend to have the issues with like, oh, they're stored in these facilities that are that are not, you know, top quality and all this. It's like, okay, how about you stop incentivizing people all together to make that that that trick on a lie dangerous. Yes, dangerous. Often in it is often a lot of criminal behavior that is done because you got people that are taking advantage of it. Let's just say you just stop incentivizing them. And this goes all across the board. You know, I talk about all time with like the whole, you know, seeking asylum and all that stuff. And our taxpayer dollars are being used to really subsidize and move people from other countries to countries like this. And it goes under the radar. But it's a thing that's literally taxpayers paying for this type of type of stuff. And that's the thing that a lot of folks, of course, are going to have issue with. So you can start if you if you no matter where you're at on this issue, if you want it to, let's say be lessened for that matter, the matter of aggression that is at the border, they stop trying to incentivize people based on a lie. How about that? The vindictiveness and just the, I don't know, toddler behavior of Joe Biden and the people around him right when he got elected. Remember that like stack of executive orders? Yes, they just wanted to undo what Trump did. That's it. No matter how effective it was, no matter what it did, whatever, they just wanted to say we are erasing this guy from, you know, history, who would erase everything. And it's, I want to say hilarious, but it's just sad that every once in a while they slip something like this back in because they know that it was actually good at doing what it was meant to do. Right. Democrat, to go off of your point, Democrats have never been throughout history, have never been pro-immigrant. Very true. Ever. You know when it changed? LBJ, welfare state. Yeah. Right around them. When they were like, oh, we need some more people to fuel this behemoth that we're building, this giant, with the massive amounts of immigration they found out, then we can build the government twice as fast. That's what it was for. Their virtue signaling on this just really pisses me off. They don't give a crap. Has AOC called this an immigration ban or an immigrant ban? No. Because that's what that's how they framed it back then. They used, you named off a few of them, called them xenophomic and all that stuff. I mean, the attacks went on and on. Not only that, but they weaponize their, you know, their legal weapons to go out and challenge all these things in court, nonstop. What was that guy's name, Cohen or whatever who was doing a lot of stuff, especially in elections? People like that, dude, were going all over the place to try and stop this. And it did. I think it went through the courts and got shot down and the courts like twice before like maybe on his last day or something like that, it went back into effect, something like that. But I mean, look, look, look what that has done. I mean, you're talking about like how dangerous it is for migrants to do this. Once they knew that Biden was coming in, they were going to enforce that. They all started coming in. And what happened to the cartels? The cartels are making just as much money, if not more, on this human trafficking than they are on, you know, getting drugs across the border. But don't worry, they're doing that too. But yeah, they're doing that too. They are getting plenty of drugs across the border. We've got people dying all over the place from fentanyl. So that's great. Leading cause of death was like 18 to 45 right now, fentanyl. That's crazy. That is incredible. You know, it just flexes me too, because I know we got to take a break in a second, but I just don't understand how you can't. I understand the people at the top why they want the welfare state, right? But I don't understand just like the average Democrat who can't see past feeling compassionate, right? You can't see past okay, but at a certain point, you do realize like we will not be able to support all of these people. You do realize that are like, how do you see this? It's a demographic change as well. And this is what I'd be trying to get to libertarians to understand like stop with just the shortsightedness of, well, what we what we want in terms of a libertarian social order. But even if we did have a libertarian social order, there are going to be people that are simply culturally incompatible. And those people are going to recognize that and not want to live among people. And it might be separated on various different issues. But that's a thing you you send cultures in a shot. This is happening. Star Wars have been started over stuff, stuff like this. So to your points, Sarah, like you have to look at it, not just from an economic perspective, but also from a cultural and social perspective when looking at this, this, this behemoth of immigration, it's not just, well, every individual is a person that's just trying to get over here better a life and they're going to adapt to wherever it is that they're moving to. I wish it was that simple, but that's never historically has been. Yeah. All right. When we come back, let's talk about a another detransitioner has filed a lawsuit against their medical provider. We'll be right back. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come. But it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. Own The Blind today at blazedtv.com slash The Blind. A woman in Ontario who identified as transgender and underwent hormone therapy, a bilateral mastectomy and a hysterectomy filed the first lawsuit in Canada against her health care providers for facilitating her transition. And this is eight doctors and mental health professionals who treated her over the years. She alleges that they failed to address her complex mental health needs. You think and instead allowed her to self-diagnose as transgender and undergo these irreversible procedures that she now regrets. Watch. Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm a D transition woman and I am pursuing legal action against the health professionals that facilitated my medical transition. I began identifying as transgender in young adulthood with no dysphoria beforehand. This was not a red flag to me as I was assured that many people discover their true gender identity later in life. Less than a year after coming out to myself, I was prescribed to synthetic testosterone, which permanently viritized my voice and appearance. I had a bilateral mastectomy 14 months later. And finally, eight years into my transition, I had a medically unnecessary hysterectomy covered by the Ontario health insurance plan. Each step involved irreversible alterations to my body and came with serious risks. Yet all were met with little challenge despite my long-standing history of mental health struggles and no indication of gender related distress in childhood or adolescence. I am alleging that this lack of inquiry is a failure of due diligence amounting to medical negligence towards a vulnerable patient. So I want to give you a little bit of these details of how neglectful these doctors were. So she attended a support group in Toronto called gender journeys where she met a doctor who referred her for male hormone therapy after one single hour long appointment. That's it. Did you hear her voice? Does it sound very feminine? Does it sound very womanly? They tell you this stuff is reversible. They tell you that you can change course at any time. It's not true. They are selling these people a lie. Also, her therapist also recommended hormone therapy despite being aware of her long history of serious mental health issues. After three appointments with another doctor, she was prescribed testosterone. Later, several years later, she had her breast removed after she received a letter from her doctors recommending her for this mastectomy. And she underwent the hysterectomy after being referred by another doctor. And all of these processes, it took the actual patient, the actual one who was going through all of these mental health issues. It took the one without the frickin medical degree to go, wait, did we just rush into this? Oh, that's right. We did. And now it's too late. And the damage is already done. I really, truly, I'm increasingly becoming more encouraged by all of these lawsuits because we're seeing them pop up in like Canada now, the UK. There's been one that has been formed against like the biggest gender clinic in the UK, Chloe Cole. Now here in the United States, I have to believe that D-transitioners are going to be what writes this ship, not because these doctors are not greedy bastards who don't give a crap about your health, but because they're scared of getting sued into oblivion. Yeah, and that's sad that it has to come certainly to that point. I think a lot of these, there've been more, you know, definitely as you look more into it, more of these D-transitioners than I think a lot of people get created for it, just they're not the guys that are going to get propped up when stuff like this goes down. But you know, you hear that voice, you know what I mean? Hell, the fact that people would lie and say, well, this wasn't like, you're not doing irreversible damage and stuff like, no, this is stuff. And it's happening to young people like definitely in the case of Chloe Cole, with a teenager, you know what I mean? This is child abuse. This is calling exactly what it is and all the doctors that participated in this are doing exactly that. If you want to think that if you are a full blown adult, you know what I mean? And you know, you got, you know, you make the argument, maybe a person that's going through that doesn't have it all upstairs. What's I'm saying? A vulnerable adult? I think you can still abuse a vulnerable adult? Yeah, exactly. You know what I mean? Like, so even to that case, you know, to your point, it's still a problem. It's still a fundamental issue that these people have mental issues regardless. And there used to be a time where the whole gender dysphoria thing was a thing that was a thing and they would address it as such as a mental illness. And now I'm more so, it's like, well, they weaponized this whole self-deletion, let's call it that. And they say, well, if you don't affirm, they love that term gender affirming care, if you don't affirm their gender, then they are likely to, let's say, do something to themselves. So they're rehearsing you. They're extorting, including parents, to get them into doing this sort of stuff. When the reality is that this person is going through something mentally and it needs to be addressed, you can think about this in really any other context. If a person has an issue with how they are, like just like God made you that way, you came out that way and somebody has a fundamental, something that you just, you can't possibly change, you ought to address that and say, well, something's up and that needs to be addressed. But on a subject of gender for whatever reason or sex, for some reason, that just went out the window. And now it's like a thing that, well, okay, you want to be something else. Well, let's just give you all of these things. Let's give you the mastectomy. Let's do these things that are irreversible. And let's just see what happens after that and affect that they've tried to like, it's not just a coercion. It's the gas sliding of everybody that's around and saying, there's something fundamentally wrong with this and affect that there are doctors, these supposed experts who are all in on it just makes it that much more criminal because we thought that we were supposed to be able to trust them. Right. I do think it's not science. And so you pointed out before, you know, a lot of this has to do with money. I think they're just after money. A lot of time patient. And I think that, I mean, it's kind of similar to like how corporations have gone woke today. I don't think it's because any of them believe in wokeness. I think that a lot of the, some of that some of it has to do with a lot of these woke kids graduating and going into some of these companies. But a lot of them were scared to death over Occupy Wall Street. And they were like, okay, something has changed. There's a shift in how activism happens, how some of these big-time lobbies are coming after people. And they can legitimately do damage now. The LGBT, barbecue, whatever it is now, how they are now. You forgot the two. I don't know. I forgot the two. It changes by minute. I'm forgetting a lot of letters. The way that the trans community kind of co-opted into that lobby was a huge boon for them. Huge. Because like you said, it was a mental disorder. We're not talking about someone that just, like if it's a dude that prefers dudes over chicks or vice versa. We're talking about someone that thinks it was something they're not. It's a mental disorder. And we have scientists saying, oh, it's a science. And doctors saying, yeah, they need treatment. This is not what you were saying a few years ago. So don't tell me it's a science. You want money and you're scared of the lobby. That's what it is. And these people are suffering because of it. And they're also weaponizing language as the left often does by calling it gender affirming care. That's quite literally the opposite of what it is. Right? Like, if you gave them gender affirming care, you would be telling them that they are what they were born. Right? That is gender affirming care affirming the gender that they actually are. This is something completely separate and they've marketed it as like, oh, well, this is called gender affirming care. And you have to do it or else your child will die. And it's like, no, that's not gender affirming care at all. No, it's never been. But that's how they sell it. Yeah, no, that's the part of the gaslight. That's what I was talking about. It's part of like making it seem like everybody else is crazy. As we sit up here and then we acknowledge the fact that this is nuts, man, especially the fact that I think that was where they overplayed their hand is going after young people, allowing young people to be able to go through all that, coercing people's children into doing this, this sort of care. Like we're talking about irreversible damage, man. Like in the fact that even that was a whole lie where they would try to excuse me gaslight us and they say, well, no, it's not irreversible. Like, no, dude, like, this is stuff when you talk about double money, what else is it? If it's not irreversible, like what else is that? You know what I mean? And I hate that, you know, it had to go there, right? You had to go after these young people, right? Because that's who ultimately to me, that was what it was all about. That was who they were all after. They tried to like make a bunch of new soldiers essentially and people that were affirmed. It's sad, but that's what they do is they go after young people to validate themselves and their own craziness. So, if they get the young people, if they get the institutions certainly of education, well, they can say, well, we've won even though their ideas are terrible. Yeah, I think it was Woodrow Wilson that said the goal of a university should be to make the child most unlike their parents as possible. And that just filtered for the progressives took that from university and now it's all the way down in grade school. Yep, absolutely. All right, we got to, well, let's take a quick break and then we're gonna let's talk this Bill Clinton advisor, mysteriously died. We'll get into that after the break. Okay, just another mysterious death popping up of someone who is quite familiar with the Clintons. This time it is Mark Middleton. He was a 59. He was a former advisor to President Bill Clinton and he was just just want to just want to tell you the details of how he was found. And then what type of death this was ruled? So he was found hanged from a tree with a gunshot wound to his chest and there was no weapon that they could find. The investigators could not find the weapon at the scene and they ruled it a suicide. Oh, but he also had a cord wrapped around his neck tied to a tree. Yes, that's why I said he was hanged from a tree with a gunshot wound and no gun. So he was just doubling up just in case? Well, you never can be too careful when you're killing yourself. So by the way, he signed Jeffrey Epstein into the White House on seven of the 17 times that Jeffrey Epstein visited Bill Clinton while he was in the White House. He flew on Epstein's jet and I it just look, I these things happen, right? When you're the Clintons, these things just tend to happen that all of these people who have previously worked for you just end up hanging themselves with a cord around a tree and then shooting themselves in the chest and also managing to throw the gun really far after they shoot themselves in the chest so that investigators can never even find the weapon. Yeah, and then it's like, hey, we'll just move on to the next case until it happens again. And then there's some person that is found dead that happened to be close, having to know a little bit too much and they died of suicide with two shots to the back of the head. You know, it's the same thing and we joke about it, but that is absolutely insane that someone could come to that conclusion that basically this person went through the work of hanging themselves and then this doubled down to shoot themselves in the chest. And as they're done, somehow launched that bad boy. I don't know who they had, maybe each or old right field to third base, like he had to have been a guy that had a arm on him to be able to get that gun to where it's nowhere near him. This is absolutely insane. Well, maybe Don Lamon was on to something when he talked about the black holes that could have swallowed up the Malaysian flight. Remember that? That was the most hilarious and he was being serious. But I don't know, maybe that same black hole just shifted over to where that gun was. This is really weird and like you said, it always follows the Clintons. I mean, at what point does it stop being just like a conspiracy theory and maybe we need to look into a little bit more? I don't know, but I have a feeling this is going to get weirder and weirder the closer we get to more disclosures about Epstein. Just got the feeling. Right. Right. We're getting closer. We still don't know all the names. A lot of the names involved in the court cases, just in the court cases, are still redacted. Why? Isn't that in the public interest? Well, who cares about the public interest? It's not in the interest of all of these wealthy elites, whose names are on there. Definitely not. Please. Definitely not. I just want to know, here's what I would like to happen. I don't think I'm very, very pessimistic about the Clintons ever seeing any sort of repercussions for all of the things that they have done. Or allegedly, okay, I tend to believe that it's too coincidental to not have something there. I also tend to believe the reports of how Juanita Broderick was treated. Even Hillary Clinton, how they were treating some of these women that accused Bill Clinton of sexual indecency. But I just would like to believe, if we can't have justice now, maybe when they die, people will start talking. No. You don't think? No. No. Who's going to kill them? I don't, I think that, well, so I guess, I don't know, actually, well, I do know that the Clintons are a Democrat, modern Democrat party establishment. Right. What Bill Clinton did was amazing for his party. Yeah. Like he grabbed that, you know, demographic. They didn't have, he's their poster child. And she was the, she was the anointed one. And, you know, to take over and plus she was a woman. They were going to have the first woman president. So I think they are untouchable. And I think that will continue out for, who knows how long, for decades, probably. They will not let them be tarnished more than they've already tarnished themselves. I just don't think it. What do you think, Eric? I don't, it's hard to say, man. I mean, what's going to, it's going to take people in entering in some dangerous territory, which may get them also hung and shot in the chest. Any event they get so close for them to actually at least have their brand tarnished enough to where we people kind of just concede that these people are part of like a lot of evil, evil stuff. And they really always always have been. But to your point, they are the democratic sort of establishment. And, you know, if they go down, there's going to be a lot of other people that are around them that are going to go down. And I think that's the point that why people aren't going to touch it. Their entire machine is like built off them. I mean, really, I mean, they're they're, they're, they're think tank, you know, I think progress, you know, media matters for America and all those like different organizations that are under that one dude. What's his name? Can't remember his name now that's head of that. They started to, they got their start defending Bill and Hillary. And now that, yeah, they run everything right now. That's a great point. That's a great point. Well, thanks. I was hoping for better news than that. All right. We've got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more. The very vigorous, according to his doctor, who just recently gave him a physical, the very vigorous Joe Biden, well, he had a misfortune accident again. He was caught tripping up the steps of Air Force one once again. Luckily, this was he caught himself. I mean, because of all the vigor and being 80, he did, he did manage to catch himself rather quickly. But you know, I, I don't understand how he tripped up the stairs. So many times the first time it happened, I don't understand how he keeps tripping up the stairs. He wasn't even, you know, the last time he was trying to jog. This one, he's not walking rather slowly, still trips, but don't worry. Nothing to see here. He is, as I mentioned, did I mention earlier, he is vigorous. Did you see him walking with Cilinsky in a kiv? The way he was walking, it was like he was going to fall over at any moment. No, I there was a, there was a political article that came out, I think it was Politico, either today or yesterday, and it talked about how Joe Biden might not run and people around them are scrambling to try and figure out what their plan B is. There's no, I don't think he's going to run. He didn't want to run the first time. You think? I think he was, he was picked because he knew that he could get more moderates and that they could take down Trump. They have nobody else that can pull in more moderates. I don't think. Well, but I mean, he's like basically dead. So you think he's going to do a better, well, 81 million votes, I know, than the safest and most secure election ever. That's why they had to fortify it because it was so safe and secure. Which by the way, fortified admittedly by them, not, that's not me saying that they said it. I just have to believe that a half dead guy is not going to play very well. Once you've seen the results that can come from the half dead guy. And the guy's tripping up them stairs back to back. Well, we just saw, oh, what's the name? Tripp as well. Y'all saw that? No. True. You tripped over that five-flower pie. It must be something in the water. Yeah. That's a virus. It's a hit wall.
